ABSTRACT
Digital Literacy Adoption with Academic Technology Namely: Digital Information
Literacy (DIL) to Enhance Student Learning Outcomes?
Nancy Adam-Turner
Old Dominion University, 2016
Director: Dr. Dana Burnett

This study explores Arts & Science faculty and librarians’ attitude of learning theory
and perceptions of digital literacy (DL) and how digital information literacy (DIL)
might improve and enhance student learning outcomes. Digital literacy (DL),
information literacy (IL), and digital information literacy (DIL) consists of interaction
with academic technology (AT) programs and tools. A literature review tracing the
course in the rise of IL within the parameters of DL and discuss the birth of DIL,
examine the modes of adoption and explore the levels of inclusion for faculty and
librarians’ concepts of DL with DIL instruction with AT, define the IL phenomenon,
and how IL affects faculty and librarian pedagogy. The study reveals the tension and
distinction between DL and IL. The key research question is how does
epistemological perception bridge the connection between technology skills and
technology self-efficacy, and subsequently; what are Arts & Science faculties’ digital
literacy (DL) epistemology? What is the librarian’s/ library digital literacy (DL)
epistemology perspectives? And what are Arts & Science faculties’ concept of DIL?

CHAPTER 1

Introduction
Change is a natural phenomenon (Darwin, 1969), but how people respond to the
influence of change makes a difference. Humans build relationships, behaviors, and methods of
learning, which are both specific to and contingent on the type of information medium (Piaget,
1964, 1967). Human interaction with technology media or devices is not inherent or second
nature to a person’s behavior (Vygotsky, 1997). Contrary to traditional, Newtonian (1687) causeand-effect mechanics, the idea of information exchange and the path of learning to achieve
subject competency (i.e., knowledge) is no longer linear (Rynasiewicz, 2014). Kincheloe,
Steinberg and Villaverde (2003) discuss prominent scholars’ research—Kuhn (1970), Vygotsky
(1997), and Freire (1970)—who argue that the post-modern notion of a paradigm shift becomes a
schema of concepts, epistemologies, assumptions, and practices that shape academic instruction
and learning. The nonlinearity of the cause-and-effect of (digital) information distribution, in
digital literacy (DL) instruction and learning in an academic environment is shown in Figure 1.

Bandura (1989), and Saracevic (2007) emphasize that cognitive, non-cognitive, and
environmental relationships overlap as a nonlinear dynamic that influences people’s learning
perceptions and capacities. However, Piaget (1985) and Freire (2000) suggest that the human
mind makes associative connections to and with information and experiences through cognitive
thought and critical thinking. Chickering and Gamson (1999) argue that incorporation of
technology should not foreshadow the value of education grounded in concept comprehension
and development. Industry-sponsored research and student opinion express the expectation of
better (digital) academic technology (AT) inclusion into methods of teaching and provision of
services in higher education (Bertrand, 2010; Gates Foundation, 2015; Lumina Foundation,
2014). Prenksy (2009), Wesch (2011), and Oblinger (2014) argue that differences exist between
people still learning and adapting to technological innovations—compared to most of the
Millennial and X, Y, and Z generations who were born into the digital environment post 1980s.

3

Being a Generation X, Y and Z native does not preclude the need to learn how to exercise the
best use of digital tools of DL to become more knowledgeable (Ng, 2015). Gonzalez-Patino and
Esteban-Guitat (2014) argue that technology is part of people’s lives, assisting, accompanying,
and to some extent manipulating behavior. McLuhan (1964) suggested that the value of the
artifact is not only the information message alone, but also the importance of the medium itself
as it produces a message. Vygotsky’s (1997) sociocultural theory describes human learning as a
social process, suggesting that technologies are extensions of human abilities much like writing
is an extension of thinking and thereafter memory.
Academic technology (AT) is an accumulation of multiple, digital components and
formats, whereas technology is a generic term that means a manner of accomplishing a task in a
technology process, method, or knowledge (Merriam-Webster, 2015). John and Pouder (2006)
argue that a characteristic of the new millennium is integration and reliance on digital
technology. Technology innovation drives industry and employment both in the United States
and globally, creating new industries and employment. Debackere and Veugelers (2005) suggest
that along the technological continuum of rapid digital advancements, enhanced relationships
between industry and science, foster research in higher education. Voogt, Erstad, Dede, and
Mishra (2013) argue that globally, there is a need for synthesis of digital technology
implementation and integration in education.
Higher education faces a DL imperative, where new digital technologies include
advantages, and limitations, requiring new literacies (Wesch, 2011, 2014). According to Badke,
(2012), the general belief and comprehension of digital literacy (DL) and competency are
inconsistent. This comes from the incongruence between the research literature’s view of digital
competencies as computer skills and/or knowledge learning applications and faculty/ librarian

4

actual instruction application of digital literacy (Badke, 2012). Gallardo-Echenique, de Oliveira,
Marques-Mollas, and Esteve-Mon (2015) research implies the need for higher education
institutions to be prepared to review and adapt towards the adoption of digital technology to
understand and incorporate DL. Among the different types of institutions, there are different
challenges that compound what faculty members report as negative factors (Badke, 2012). These
factors constitute respective, unique environments.
Consequently, Belshaw (2012) states that embarking on the twenty-first-century journey
involves being proactive in embracing both digital technology and popular DL trends. Digital
technologies are the trends of the century, but as Flanagan (2008) asks, in providing students
with AT, are educators enhancing student achievement, or replacing learning with computers and
handheld devices? Nilsen (2012) suggests when considering ATs for the institution, that faculty
and librarians should have the opportunity to offer input since they are expected to adopt them as
part of pedagogy.
Digital Technology in the Academic Environment
Zurkowski’s (1974) discussion of digital information technology recognized information
literacy (IL). Kurzweil (2011) predicted that by the 1990s, a computer and Internet technology
revolution would occur faster than Moore’s (1965) law of exponential development, and by
2005, the world was fast approaching a technology tipping point. Gilliespie (1998, 2002) noted
the incredible speed of technological developments would transform the academic ecology with
continued importance that would neither disappear nor diminish, influencing higher education
institutions (HEI). In the 1990s HEI’s experienced unprecedented growth in the frequency of use
of technology. Later, Thagard and Findlay (2012) argue that cognitive science combines
perception, intelligence, calculation, reasoning, and finally conscience, articulating many

5

disciplines of science and technology—linguistics, anthropology, psychology, philosophy,
neurosciences, and ultimately (computer) artificial intelligence. Thus, the innovation of cognitive
computing evolved into thinking models and human relationships with computing. However,
computer technological advances providing user-friendly interfaces does not change the reality
that people must learn digital technology functions to achieve DL (Thagard & Findlay, 2012).
Sorcinelli, Austin, Eddy, and Beach (2006) argue that the application of (digital)
information technology as DL is a compelling phenomenon, particularly where faculty and
technology development are concerned. Matthews (2015) suggest that DL with (digital)
information technology encompasses many formats of AT, which is synonymous with digital
information, digital, virtual, and ubiquitous technologies. Beetham and Sharpe (2013) and
Swanson and Jagman’s (2015) definitions of DL discusses a spectrum of technology programs
and digital tools that can be accessed through the Internet, including learning and content
management systems (LMS), Web 2.0, open educational resources (OER), and handheld devices
such as remote access units, or clickers, and iPads or Smart phones with Apps.
Discussing AT, Meyer (2010), Christensen and Eyring (2011) and Flavin (2012) report
that higher-education institutions are investing in digital learning technologies and the virtuallearning environments (i.e., academic technology). Ramaley (2014) suggests that these ATs
influence higher-education pedagogy, and consequently involve disruptive innovation that
affects faculty and librarians. Hargittai and Hinnant (2008), Hargittai (2010), and Belshaw
(2012) espouse the value of understanding dimensions of digital technology, digital information
learning, discovery, and IL, where AT is the application of hardware and software applications
that a person learns to use, thus, DL in the academic environment is the incorporation of the AT
application into instruction. Christensen and Eyring (2011) argue that disruptive innovation

6

occurs when new digital technologies attempt to replace standard and/or traditional methods and
programs, and comes with unforeseen consequences. Linder-VanBerschot and Summers (2015)
discuss DL adoption, commenting on its dimensions and that institutions must accept a culture of
change, and that difficulties often occur during transience of technology. Technology transience
occurs as the lifespan of technology changes when constant innovation happens, imposing
turmoil and its resulting influences. Thus, updates and revisions become constant, with which
institutions, faculty, and librarians must keep current (Linder-VanBerschot & Summers, 2015).
By focusing on the technological advancements is the human intelligence aptitude and
physiology efficacy overshadowed?
Exploring components of digital literacy. O’Banion (1999) posits that DL adoption
engages students in learning, and accentuates collaborative learning. Kurzweil (2011) considers
positive influences of new technology, that digital advances improve communication—the
ability to connect over great distances with accuracy and speed— thus enabling global
community members to communicate. For example, in distance learning and hybrid classes,
faculty and students exchange vast amounts of information for maximum learning (Renes &
Strange, 2011). Connaway and Dickey (2010), and Cordell (2013) stress that digital technology
offers practical advantages when used in education, and requires DL. Touminen, Touminen,
Savolainen, and Talja (2005), Hargittai and Hinnant (2008), Brandtweiner, Donat, and
Kerschbaum (2010), and Gross and Latham (2012) argue that ease of access does not ensure
digital information literacy (DIL) competency. Whether students’ DL and IL use is
homogeneous, a combination of locations of digital technology access (i.e. the haves and havenots), or sociodemographic technology skills, use behaviors have important influences on DIL
skill development (Anderson & Horn, 2012)

7

Wesch (2008, 2011, 2014), Swanson (2010), and Swanson and Jagman (2015) advocate
the benefits of DL with AT to have students integrate digital-virtual confidence with a subject,
learning occurs as an interactive exercise between faculty and students, who combine multiple
digital resources to achieve subject/topic learning outcomes. Hunt-Baron, Tracy, Howell, and
Kaminski (2015) discuss how digital tools for faculty in rural environments have positive
benefits. DL development is a core factor in AT that leads to DL competency and individual selfefficacy for faculty, educators’ and librarians’ professional. A favorable response to using online
professional development training forums is establishment of collaborative communities that
faculty report as useful support mechanisms when trying to learn new AT. However, one
obstacle should be addressed—allowing sufficient face-to-face time for professional training
(Hunt-Baron et al., 2015).
Bertrand’s (2010) diagnosis of AT adoption in U.S. higher-education institutions
criticizes the academy and faculty for lack of DL inclusion. He describes faculty, educators, and
librarians as stereotypical digital laggards, resistant to change and unwilling/unable to transform
pedagogy to incorporate the benefits of DL with AT inclusion, which is necessary for the United
States to compete in the global community. The Babson Research Center reports (2012) and the
Gates Foundation (2015) demonstrates that inclusion of DL with AT as a component of curricula
and faculty syllabi in higher education is sporadic. AT limitations at both organizational and
instructional levels are due partly to budget limitations and limited user computer knowledge and
self-efficacy. The samples contained only limited two-year community college data, and the
basis for results was faculty types of AT use frequency (Allen, Seaman, Lederman & Jaschik,
2012, June; Gates foundation, 2015).

8

With the higher-educational model in an altered state, challenges concerning adoption of
institutional AT, DL, and IL influence pedagogy. The academy and faculty attitudes toward DL
and IL make for continued pedagogical research of higher-education institutions. Blick, Dagnon,
Burgess, Brown, and Miller (2014) suggest that a layered approach to DL with AT inclusion is a
more efficient method for training and adoption. Another aspect is Selwyn’s (2010) degrees of
digital self-efficacy division since the compound nature of DL also influences faculties’ and
librarians’ digital literacy perceptions. The ability to incorporate DL and use AT relies on a
variety of competencies beyond basic computer operations. Badke (2012) argues that the variety
of twenty-first-century DL competencies represents being multi-literate (p. 109). Selwyn (2010)
refers to Carvin (2000), who outlines competencies as a range of skills, including (1) the ability
to be information literate (i.e., discerning content quality), (2) being adaptively literate (i.e.,
developing new skills while using information computer technologies [ICT] and recognized
universally as technology self-efficacy with AT), and (3) being occupationally literate (i.e.,
applying these skills in education, business, or domestic environments). These literacies are also
reinforced and supported by a person’s basic literacy competence (Carvin, 2000; Selwyn, 2010,
p. 35).
Community College Academic Technology and the Faculty and Librarian Role
Regarding DL with AT inclusion strategies, Cohen and Brawer (2008) and O’Banion
(1999) argue that community colleges are torn between supporting the newest digital
technologies to promote student academic certificates or degree completion, and creating a
career path for employment. Leeder’s (2013) positive commentary relates to the self-perception
of community college faculty, and so by extension librarians, as active practitioners, who expect
to be hands-on to assist students. In community colleges, librarians are not typically visible, in

9

comparison to faculty and instructors, since most library services and electronic resources for
research or class studies are offered seamlessly through technology (Leeder, 2013).
Vaughan (2006) confirms that community colleges have held a special niche since their
inception by serving all segments of society with a comprehensive program to foster lifelong
learning; they serve the community as a community-based, higher-education institution.
Misconceptions are present in the value of a community college education, and the role of
faculty and librarians. Leeder (2013) suggests that community colleges emphasize teaching and
learning rather than research. Within this framework, the library strives to support that mission
with services that sustain and expand DIL instruction, and reach everyone. Discussing DL
inclusion and adoption using AT resources and advances in community colleges, Ramaswami
(2009) uses Tallahassee Community College (Florida) as an example of effective practical
implementation
Faculty/librarian collaboration with digital information literacy. Cordell (2013)
argues that DL is a must in the technology era of the twenty-first century, and Leeder (2013)
similarly argues that the community college library is not like other higher-education
institutions’ libraries, as the vanguard of libraries, because the college curriculum/faculty
teaching environment serves and complements diverse student bodies. Community college
librarians often have faculty status, and serve in several roles simultaneously as librarians,
technology services, electronic services, and emerging technologies (Association of College &
Research Libraries, ACRL, 2011). Providing a case for DIL, Head (2013) uses Project
Information Literacy (PIL), an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)-funded
research study, explaining that the ACRL research report asserts the need for increased DIL
instruction due to students’ lack of IL instruction in secondary schools. A primary objective of IL

10

and DIL advocates that librarians provide a collaborative role with faculty and institution during
curriculum planning. Hence, new programs such as Embedded or E-brarian and Virtual Librarian
provide the digital, technical instruction and support for students to improve learning outcomes
(Head, 2013).
A Problem of Perceptions
A major problem is the paradigmatic differences with the adoption of digital technology
and digital literacy application among faculty members’ and librarians that implies a dichotomy
of perception (McGoldrick et al., 2015). Is an individual’s digital literacy self-efficacy
competency dependent on their perspective of the actions attributed to the interpretation of the
concept? Thus, does frequency of digital technology use demonstrate digital literacy (DL) selfefficacy? To put this in context the transience of technology has made an impact on DL
understanding, incorporation and adoption, influences faculty DL adoption and the uses of digital
AT as part of pedagogy.
Best practice models such as the technology acceptance model (TAM) or faculty learning
centers (FLC) are not generalizable, but as Collins (2014) explains, onsite institutional
collaborative review is necessary to identify a faculty development technology (FDT) approach
best suited to support DL adoption. Studies of community colleges that discuss DL inclusion are
inconsistent. Ianuzzi (2013) and Martin (2013) discuss the inconsistencies, where research
focuses only generally on digital technology and IL, but must catch up with digital disruptive
technologies of Web 2.0 and DIL’s impact. Wesch (2008, 2011, 2014) and Belshaw (2012) argue
that DIL remains an emerging topic because of multiple interpretations ascribed to its definition.
If faculty are digitally literate, they must have the ability, not only the technology skills, for e-

11

learning pedagogy. Similarly, do faculty who are digitally literate integrate DIL as part of their
curriculum?
Faculty digital literacy concerns with adoption and inclusion. Collins (2014) study of
faculty issues to DL adoption with AT cites Gilliespie (1998, 2002), Gilliespie and Robertson
(2010), and states that regarding faculty technology development, the primary barrier is lack of
institutional funds, a common issue that dates to 1975, a year after Zurkowski’s (1974) reference
to IL (Collins, 2014). Cohen and Brawer (2008) report that a joint faculty DL issue was lack of
time for faculty development participation, a salient issue at community colleges for adjunct
faculty who often have more than one job. Allen and Seaman (2007) argue that faculty
challenges to DL inclusion include low DL with AT confidence and competency as causes of
slow adoption in pedagogy. Faculty members are discipline subject experts, much as librarians
are information and digital information technology subject experts (Badke, 2012; Nilsen, 2012).
The difference lies in that librarians support faculty and students across all disciplines regarding
use of digital technology for IL and DL with AT programs. Criticism of faculty and librarians’
latent AT adoption, is what Bates (2000) calls barriers—a degree of inertia—indicative of
lacking support and institutional leadership to assist during transformation. Faculty and librarians
are aware of another issue, which Scott-Clayton (2011) suggests is that students from
underserved and low-socioeconomic backgrounds are not digitally information literate.
Similarly, Bailey, Jaggars, and Jenkins (2015) point out that students from rural, underserved,
and low-socioeconomic backgrounds might not have adequate access to digital technology. For
that reason, faculty and librarian perceptions of the student body they teach might be a cause of
their reluctance to introduce DL with AT programs into pedagogy.

12

Roberts and Hunter (2011) argue that generation X, Y and Z students expect technology
since they are digitally adept, and these same students have the same expectations of faculty’s
digital versatility, and DL provision of institutional digital technology and learning services.
However, Ng (2015) suggests that the issue is not instruction of generation X, Y and Z students
but a case of teaching these students to be digitally literate, where its dimensions include
technical operational literacy, cognitive critical thinking, and socio-emotion that relates to
netiquette. The majority of generation X, Y and Z students use new technologies, but show
disparities regarding engaging with educational technologies. Ng (2015) concludes that selfperceptions of generation X, Y and Z students are that they can be taught DL.
Assumptions on the lack of digital literacy adoption. Various findings on advancement
of DL inclusion, coupled with criticisms of lack of adoption in academia, indicate that many
areas require more research. Bent and Stockdale (2009) state that a criticism of digital
(information) technology is that digital technology is ubiquitous with AT, and its use removes
people’s aspects and levels of thought processes. When using DL activities with AT programs
information processing behavior is relevant to an individual's learning and self-perceived
knowledge and self-efficacy. Consensus in the academic field suggests the importance of IL to
student subject/discipline success. Through IL, students improve learning outcomes beyond class
lecture information to expand their knowledge bases (Bent & Stockdale, 2009). To gain clarity of
which factors influence faculty DL adoption and librarians’ inclusion of DIL with the combined
electronic resources and AT programs, the question of what causes the issues and identifying
how to find solutions must be answered. For in-depth understanding, qualitative research reveals
hidden or latent meanings for faculty and librarian DL reticence. On the topic of DL, it is
imperative to understand that some issues create barriers for faculty and librarians, and recognize

13

that each institution has a unique, diverse, technology ecosystem and human capital
demographics.
Purpose. This study addresses faculty attitudes of learning theory (i.e. epistemology) and
DL adoption with AT inclusion while teaching, and their understanding of how to incorporate
DIL at two-year community colleges. It examines two community colleges in Virginia and West
Virginia, located in rural areas where digital technology and DL are difficult to implement in
educational contexts.

This study combines Bandura’s (1989) triadic reciprocal determinism, Saracevic’s (2007)
subject/epistemic knowledge concept that relevance is not an action, and Fruge and RopersHuilman’s epistemological congruency (EC) theory. Where Rogers (2003) applied the diffusion
of innovation to human technology adoption as it relates to individual acceptance, shown in
Figure 3., Bandura’s (1989) model incorporates social cognitive theory, where a person’s
behaviors, cognitions, and environments are interacting determinants that mutually influence
each other simultaneously, shown in Figure 2. The theory’s relevance to the study is the

14

interconnectedness of the faculty, librarians and community college through use of digital
technology to teach, and includes the instruction / inclusion of DIL. Frank (1955) describes EC
as an effect between a person’s local sense-making patterns and newly introduced information
for learning. Fruge and Ropers-Huilman’s (2008) EC (i.e., shared attitudes of learning) model
describes the influences and implications of faculty and students’ digital technology affect.

Figure 3. Technology Adoption Diffusion of Innovation (Rogers, 2003, p. 247).
Bandura’s (1989) triadic model of an environment’s effect on self and behavior variables
is used to determine whether it explains faculty and librarians’ perceptions and activities
regarding DLs, shown in Figure 2. Participants are faculty and librarians, exploring and
measuring their collaborative EC (i.e., shared attitudes of learning) with DL when using AT
(Fruge & Ropers-Huilman, 2008). Saracevic (2007) adds behaviors and effects of relevance—
that “relevance does not behave” (p. 2127). People behave in a way when looking at information
or information objects to infer relevance. A person uses cognitive information as a thought
process, and thus a person’s comprehensions and perceptions of information influence actions
(Saracevic, 2007). Hjorland’s (2010) explanation of Saracevic’s (2007) position is that a person’s
subjective knowledge view parallels the epistemic view. Self-efficacy can be a powerful

15

determinant of behavior transformation, as personal attitudes determine the initial decision for
engaging in behavior: thus, influencing the effort a person expends and the persistence applied to
the action (Bandura, 1989).
Rogers’ (2003) research on AT adoption contends that people adopt new technology at
varying rates. The speed of adoption follows a bell curve, where the primary difference is an
individual’s psychological disposition to innovation. An individual passes through four stages in
the decision process; from knowledge of an innovation, to persuasion (attitude formation and
change), then the decision (to adopt or reject), and lastly confirmation. The classic bell curve
model shows the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle reinvented to show technology adoption
(Rogers, 1995).
Therefore, diffusion of technology transformation has certain measurable areas such as;
relative advantages, compatibility, complexity, trailability, and observability. The chasm is
where technology infusion changes from being new to becoming more commonly incorporated
having reached the threshold, thus, moves toward the tipping point of general acceptance shown
in Figure 3.
The Study Research Design Model
When using a structured approach while incorporating these different theoretical concepts
to develop the research framework, the conceptual framework might be unclear. However, by
explaining how the concept of the framework is anchored, providing an example offers clarity
(Cross, 1999). The design research model’s name is a Point of Reference Spectrum (PRS) to
show how an environment’s effect on self and behavior variables is used to determine whether it
explains faculty DL and librarians’ perceptions and activities regarding DILs.

The schema is A + B and B + C shown in figure 4; where A = technology skills

This study investigates the foci above through the lens of community college faculty,
instructors, librarians, and institution. Thus, gaining understanding of issues and obstacles these
groups face when dealing with incorporation of DL with new AT in community college
education programs (Mosley, 2011). The PRS provides a basis of recognizing participants DL
cognitive and non-cognitive issue levels, and possible occurrence of correlation in the areas
where clusters appear from the data analysis. The result provides a starting point from which to
offer constructive recommendations to build collaborative solutions.
A summary of Chapter 2. The literature review is based on a chronological view of
events from IL inception to DIL development—the transition of traditional literacy to the new
DL. The definition and explanation of the elements contribute to the information learning
continuum, starting with literacy, through the development of IL, to the inception and current
establishment of DIL. The complexity of DL integration into higher education, supports

17

challenges during integration of IL and DIL, particularly for community college pedagogy and
an institution’s mission. Challenges and issues derived from an institution’s concept of DL
influence faculty and librarians’ concept of DL adoption, and the possible benefits of DIL
regarding student learning outcomes. To address the tensions and distinction between digital and
information literacies, it is necessary to first define the phenomenon of DL with AT issues. That
faculty and librarians experience with inclusion and instruction of DL, IL and DIL and how this
influences student learning outcomes, especially from a humanities perspective.

Glossary—Definition of Terms
Academic technology (AT). AT is a generic term that represents the manner of
accomplishing a task in an academic context with use of a digital technology process, method, or
knowledge. AT is comprised of digital content, which is high-quality, academic material
delivered through technology. AT includes new engagements, interactive and adaptive software,
classic literature, video lectures, and games, not simply digital documents or electronic slide
presentations. AT is synonymous with digital technology and information computer technology
(ICT). Examples include learning management systems and open education resources from the
Internet.
Digital learning. Digital learning is any instructional practice that uses technology to
strengthen a student's learning experience—a broad definition of what constitutes a learning tool,
including curation tools and web browsers, and professional tools such as Google searches and
Docs, social media, and programs such as Adobe and Microsoft cloud computing. Digital
learning is synonymous with (electronic) e-learning, (ubiquitous) u-learning, and virtual
learning, which express the same activity.

19

Digital literacy. Digital literacy is the ability to use information and communication
technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive
and technical skills (Digital Literacy Taskforce, 2013).
The definition of digital literacy is inclusive of information literacy (IL) since IL applies to the
digital technology format. Therefore, a digitally literate person has the ability to perform tasks in
a digital environment. Literacy includes the ability to read and interpret media, reproduce data
and images through digital manipulation, and evaluate and apply knowledge gained from digital
environments (Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan, 2006). Digital literacy is synonymous with digital
information literacy and digital information fluency.
Digital information literacy (DIL). DIL is the application of information literacy
standards and skills with digital technologies. It is not only application of information research,
but also involves incorporation of spheres of philosophy of information (i.e., epistemology)
(Badke, 2012, p. 102). Another term used in this context is fluency; digital information fluency
(DIF) is the ability to find, evaluate, and use digital information effectively, efficiently, and
ethically. 21st Century Digital Information Fluency (DIF) project and model (2009, Oct).
Digital pedagogy. Digital pedagogy is the use of electronic elements to enhance or
change the learning experience of education. Examples include electronic slide presentations,
flipped classrooms, and online MOOC’s (More Open Online Classes) (Croxall, 2012).
Epistemology. Epistemology is the theory of knowing; the study or a theory of the nature
and grounds of knowledge, especially concerning its limits and validity. Epistemology is the
branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human
knowledge (Merriam-Webster dictionary, 2015).

20

Epistemological congruency (EC). EC is the degree of similarity in beliefs regarding
learning between a student and faculty member. Since academic integration ties with retention,
studies into how epistemological beliefs influence students’ intentions to remain in college are
common (Fruge & Ropers-Huilman, 2008).
Information literacy. Information literacy is a set of abilities requiring individuals to
"recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use the
needed information effectively." Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education. (American Library Association, 2000, p.2). Information literacy and digital literacy
are not competing concepts; they are complementary areas for students in higher education.
Digital literacy concepts and skills provide fundamentals of managing digital environments that
students need to succeed in IL and their other areas of study (Cordell, 2013).
Metaliteracy (or Multi-literacy). Metaliteracy is a type of literacy that recognizes
various forms and media in which information is found. This includes intermediality; people
view information processes as both producers (i.e., information creator) and users (Badke, 2012,
p. 96). Metaliteracy is also known as transliteracy (ALA) and hyperliteracy.
Self-Efficacy. A person’s cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, and personal perceptions
of his/her aptitude to learn, and that self-efficacy refers to a person’s beliefs in their capability to
organize and complete a course of action required for desired results (Bandura, 1989).
Web 2.0. Web 2.0 is a development of Web 1.0 that refers to the beginning of the web, as
an electronic-publishing platform, where people went to multiple webpages to get content, but
did not interact with the content. The switch to Web 2.0 occurs when users become content
creators, not only viewing webpages, but also helping to create and interact with web-based

21

information content. The Web then becomes more user-centered and collaborative (Metronet
Information Literacy Initiative (MILI), 2010).
Limitations and Delimitations of the Study
The faculty with the sample institutions are not all full-time or local, to expedite data
collection a brief online survey is used. A limitation of this method is that self-reports carry an
element of individual unreliability, so the researcher is relying on the participants’ selfassessment of tacit knowledge by providing candid responses (Neuman, 2011). Instead of the
more common randomized sampling purposeful sampling is used (Rosenthahl & Rosnow, 2008),
because purposeful participants are representative of diverse perspectives on an issue being
investigated, namely EC (i.e., attitudes of learning) relevant to DL adoption and DIL inclusion
(Leedy & Ormrod, 2013). This study might not be generalizable, but it answers research
questions that are unique to rural community college faculties’ and librarians’ DL and DIL issues
and needs. The sample is representative of rural community college faculty and librarians, and
therefore through identification of issues at rural community college sites, parts from general
digital professional technology programs can be adapted to support integration and inclusion of
DL and DIL. To avoid bias, a pilot study was used, with an interrater researcher to guide
application of a measurement instrument and data analysis. Faculty and librarians might feel
concerned that their digital IL epistemological beliefs and teaching methods are being evaluated.
Therefore, it was imperative that a distinct purpose, with clear guidelines, was communicated to
participants to understand the potential benefits of the study. Recommendations describe various
approaches that can be applied to how to best include programmed IL instruction in tandem with
faculty course curricula to benefit student self-efficacy at rural community colleges. The
parameter of the study is a comparison of faculty and librarian epistemological positions on the

22

influence of DL in college, their impressions and values of DIL about learning objectives, and
whether DIL incorporation enhances student learning outcomes. The study explores the basis for
how and why faculty and librarian instruction incorporates or excludes digital information
technology as part of a mode of pedagogy.
Since time was a limitation due to faculty availability regarding instruction and the
semester schedule, the research questions do not include examination of DL inclusion and
academic freedom. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) defines new
guidelines on academic freedom and DL inclusion with AT based on the new laws regarding
digital technology. Academic freedom involves interpretation of law, contractual agreements,
and an institution’s curriculum policies. Therefore, consideration of DL inclusion and how it
influences academic freedom is a topic for future research. Another concern is whether it is
possible to identify a relationship between a person’s epistemological beliefs and digital IL
teaching practices. The contention of this study is that an epistemological belief is determined,
but it is more appropriate to identify variables that affect digital IL other than faculty or
librarians’ epistemologies. Therefore, more research is needed in lieu of using EC to understand
this phenomenon and improve DIL inclusion in curricula for better student learning outcomes.

23

CHAPTER II
Literature Review
The hallmark of contemporary education is academic technology (AT) inclusion that
incorporates digital literacy, information literacy (IL), and digital information literacy (DIL). DL
is the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create and
communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills (Digital Literacy
Taskforce, 2013). DL is also the ability to use digital technology, communication tools, and
networks to locate, evaluate, use, and create information, and the aptitude to understand and use
information in multiple formats from a range of sources when it is presented through computers
(Belshaw, 2012; Gilster, 1997). The definition of DL is inclusive of IL, since IL applies to the
digital technology format. Therefore, a digitally literate person has the ability to perform tasks
effectively in a digital environment. Literacy includes the ability to read and interpret media,
reproduce data and images through digital manipulation, and evaluate and apply new knowledge
gained from digital environments (Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan, 2006). Digital literacy is
synonymous with DIL and digital information fluency. IL is a set of abilities requiring
individuals to “recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and
use the needed information effectively” Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (American Library Association, 2000, p.2). IL and DL are not competing concepts;
they are complementary areas for students in higher education. DL concepts and skills provide
fundamentals of managing digital environments that students need to succeed with IL and other
areas of study. DIL is the application of IL standards and skills with digital technologies
(Cordell, 2013).

24

Constant advancement of digital innovation is challenging for all stakeholders (Wesch,
2011, 2014). Institutions and administrators want to incorporate DL because it promotes
improved efficiency, in part where politicians and society instigate demand (Bertrand, 2010).
The Lumina Foundation (2014) and Gates Foundation’s (2015) deductive studies suggest that
students prefer to engage in digital technology, and consequently, faculty and student support
personnel are obliged to use the technology, but might not have the DL training or inclination to
incorporate AT while teaching. Conversely, libraries, librarians, and information specialists
engage in digital technology because the bulk of their services and resources are electronic
programs. Hence, librarians design IL instruction to meet faculties’ disciplines or students’ needs
(Badke, 2012).
IL influences teaching and learning in higher education, and consequently asks what are a
faculty’s perceptions of DIL and the influences on and benefits to student learning outcomes?
Exploration of the literature aids understanding of DL inclusion and issues involved with IL. The
literature review follows development of IL along the digital technology continuum into DIL. It
encompasses the types of challenges DL and digital technologies pose for faculty and librarians.
The literature discusses technology multitasking, but includes limited research in the area of
faculty and librarian (liaison) collaboration on digital technology, which demonstrates the
significance of this study. With emphasis on DIL and through the lens of faculties and librarians,
this study addresses what constitutes DL adoption from these perspectives for improved student
learning outcomes.
From Traditional Literacy to the New Digital Information Literacy
Neither institutional policy nor academic departments and faculty were prepared for the
influence technology brought to academia and DL learning programs (Bertand, 2010; Ramaley,

25

2014). With the arrival of the new millennium, Marcum (2002) informed the library/education
field that information literacies are ambiguous because of underlying assumptions of the
information-processing paradigm. Misconceptions occur in cognitive and non-cognitive actions
related to the connection between information and knowledge, and consideration of humancomputer interactions. Kahneman and Klein’s (2009) explanation of the misconception suggests
that humans think heuristically (i.e. using intuition; a way of doing--learned from experience),
engage in multiple, complex reasoning for naturalistic decision-making, and use preferences to
make decisions. Carrier (1990) suggests that computers do not think the same way as the human
mind; they engage in vast amounts of metadata and processing speeds—the process is a logical
algorithm, comprised of a set of unambiguous rules that follow a linear analogic path.
Information literacies involve DL, which in turn is universal in influencing faculty
pedagogy and student learning outcomes. Marcum (2002) suggests refocusing toward digital
technical fluency, implying the inclusiveness of multiple information literacies as a part of the
digital technology environment. Badke (2012) concurs, reiterating how Kuhlthau (1993)
identifies challenges of the information search process (ISP) and information retrieval (IR) as an
area of concern. Kuhlthau (1993) uses a constructivist approach that includes Dewey’s (1996)
sense-making theory, and incorporates affective and cognitive dimensions. From a review of the
literature, comes a clearer picture and understanding of the transition from the traditional concept
of literacy in the form of reading, writing, and comprehension of printed matter to the
contemporary, full-digital displays of information and multimedia technology. After examination
of scholarly works on these digital literacy characteristics, we learn of the complexity of DL and
the challenges institutions, faculties, and librarians face.

26

What is literacy? To start with a basic definition, literacy is attained when a person can
read, write, and comprehend the written word (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2015; Montessori,
1965; Piaget, 1967). Through basic literacy comprehensive, integration is an element during
development of learning, whether learning occurs from teaching, nurturing, or self-motivation
(Astin, 1984; Montessori, 1963, 1965). Literacy involves all senses, and thus is complex;
multiple factors influence a person’s abilities, from psychosocial and inherent abilities to
instructional learning. Tinto (1993) and Vygotsky (1997) explain that the elements of literacy
involve a combination of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities. Freire (2000) prompts further
discussion, suggesting that with IL and critical thinking, people develop the power to perceive
the world in which they live critically.
Before contemporary technology was a significant source of information
creation/production and access, the traditional method for the manufacture of information was
ink to paper, which led to print. Germano (2010) discusses that as a resource, books functioned
as information record-keepers of events—history past and present—and descriptive information
leading to information distribution for learning. A traditional argument is that through books, we
discover knowledge, the epistemology of what we know, and who we are (Germano, 2010). The
printed word has value and meaning only if a person is literate (Piaget, 1967), and hence all
senses are involved in literacy during stimulation and acquisition of learning (Chickering &
Gamson, 1999).
The term literacy is central to many academic disciplines and societies; all changes to
media environment mean that the focus shifts from print to information technology (IT), (Säljö,
2012). During the past two decades, traditional literacy expanded to include information, digital,
science, visual, and multimedia literacies. Therefore, the current DL term is an overarching

27

keyword often used as a synonym for (digital) learning competency and knowledge. Säljö (2012)
argues that literacy competency allows a person to engage in modern digital literacies, it alters an
individual’s epistemic practices in many ways. At higher education levels, the change is both to
how information is accessed and incorporated such as learning management systems (LMS) and
network learning resources. In the context of these electronic tools and the digital environment,
learning builds on a person’s literacy skills, and hence the merger between digital (virtual) tools
and human reasoning becomes closer to integration of new digital tools, and the challenge is
overcoming both a person’s ability and epistemic practices. In the modern concept of literacy,
literacy is the root of all other technical or digital literacies. These new six foundational literacies
are demonstrated in Figure 5. (Digital Literacy Task Force, 2013; Mackey & Jacobson, 2011).

Figure 5. The New Six Foundational Literacies
Consequently, according to Mackey and Jacobson (2011) scholarly definitions of the six
foundational literacies include: (1) critical literacy views readers as participants during reading.

28

Critical literacy focuses on issues of power and promotes reflection, transformation, and action
(Freire, 1970); (2) IL is a set of abilities requiring individuals to “recognize when information is
needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use the needed information effectively”
(American Libraries Association, 2000, p. 2); (3) visual literacy is the ability to understand,
interpret, and evaluate visual messages (Bristor & Drake, 1994); (4) media literacy is the ability
to access, analyze, evaluate, and communicate information in a variety of forms, and is
interdisciplinary (National Association for Media Literacy Education, n.d.); (5) digital literacy is
the ability to find, evaluate, use, share, and create content using information technologies and the
Internet; and (6) multimodal literacy is the ability to “interpret the intertextuality of
communication events that include combinations of print, speech, images, sounds, movement,
music, and animation,” and “the integration of multiple modes of communication and
expression” (Jacobson & Mackey, 2011, p. 12; National Council of Teachers of English, 2013).
The range of modern literacies is a unified term known as the family of metaliteracy.
Mackey and Jacobson (2011) describe metaliteracy as an overarching literacy term of a selfreferential framework that integrates emerging technologies and unifies multiple literacies.
Metaliteracy challenges traditional, skills-based methods of IL, and recognizes related literacy
types by incorporating emerging technologies (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011, p. 12). These terms—
literacy (also known as critical literacy), IL, DL (also known as multi-literacy or trans-literacy),
and DIL (also known as multimodal-literacy)—are recognized literacies within subtopics shown
in Figure 6.

Figure 6. A Meta-literacies diagram.
The meta-literacies diagram demonstrates their interactive connections, whether as an
application or applied skill, and indicates transitional development from traditional literacies to
IL to DL, and ultimately DIL. Consequently, qualities applied to literacy are as simple as a visual
image, sound, odor, or more involved scholarly, printed matter and full-scale theatrical/television
productions. With modern technology, these elements can be produced digitally (Schwitzer,
Ancis, & Brown, 2001). Wesch (2008, 2011) argues that technology superimposes onto the
traditional literacy proponent, culminating in DIL, virtual learning, and ubiquitous computing
environment. The effect, by extension, is that IL develops further into digital information literacy
(DIL). The change from IL to DIL has implications that influence a person’s behaviors regarding
information processing, and alter learning process comprehension (Wesch, 2008, 2011).
What are the cognitive and non-cognitive abilities involved? To understand what the
abilities are, methodical observations explain the processes. In a study on behavior and the
effects of relevance, Saracevic (2007) states, “relevance does not behave” (p. 2127). People

30

behave in a particular way when looking at information or information objects to infer relevance.
A person might question whether relevant inferences do change a person’s judgments and/or the
method in which they apply the task. That person is using cognitive information as a thought
process. Thus, retrieval of the topic approach derives topical or non-topical relationships, and
then analysis of information for relevance, and from that relevance, the person decides how to
behave (Saracevic, 2007). Freire (2000) argues, “by developing critical consciousness, students
learn to take control of their lives and their learning to become active agents, asking and
answering questions that matter to them and the world around them” (p. 193).
Fruge and Ropers-Huilman (2008) explore epistemological relationships between faculty
and student learning perceptions as they relate to learning activities and class disciplines to meet
expected learning objectives. The study explores epistemological congruency (EC)— how
participants, faculty members, and student perceptions share a degree of common agreement on
learning and knowledge acquisition, and how disparate perceptions of the value of learning
affects student learning outcomes. An online learning environment magnifies divergence in
perceptive attitudes, and faculty need to give clear directions regarding the value of content, and
the importance of all elements of the class so students achieve learning outcomes (Fruge &
Ropers-Huilman, 2008).
What is information literacy? To understand what information literacy (IL) means, we
must first explore who initiated the term, and why, including information from; (1) The
American Library Association’s (ALA) definition of IL, and (2) IL standards (Association of
College and Research Libraries, 2000). IL standards in academic research define the complexity
of IL comprehension and application. IL has a broad influence on everyone when dealing with
information, especially when using information technology. IL influences basic research skills,

31

to include understanding information, how it works, and especially regarding development of
students’ critical-thinking skills (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000). The
Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) (2000) suggests that people are
information literate when they “recognize when information is needed and have the ability to
locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (p. 2). Virkus (2004) and MachinMastromatteo and Virkus (2013) add that ease and success of use depend on a user having both
IL awareness and the capability of use, and digital technology self-efficacy. Bandura (1989)
suggests that the definition of self-efficacy depends on a person’s cognitive and non-cognitive
abilities, and personal perceptions of his/her aptitude to learn a skill. Bourantas (2008) argues
that self-efficacy refers to a person’s beliefs in their capability to organize and complete a course
of action required for desired results.
When discussing the IL continuum as it relates to digital technology from Wesch (2008,
2011), Swanson (2011), and Belshaw (2012), technology innovation appears as a continuous,
infinite cycle. Consequently, the current new literacy is digital literacy, where DIL is a
descendent of IL. The four elements that encompass DL are digital-age literacy, inventive
thinking, effective communication, and high productivity. These elements are part of visual,
media, computer, network, and information literacies, and Web 2.0. (Belshaw, 2012; Swanson,
2010; Wesch, 2008, 2011), and all interrelate. Shown in figure 7 demonstrates a model on the IL
continuum.

Figure 7. A Model on the information literacy continuum.
The term information literacy (IL) was introduced 40 years ago by Zurkowski (1974),
attributing IL to the influence of innovative technology. Expansion of computer digitization of
information, and digital access programs, emerged in the United States during the 1970s
(Zurkowski, 1974). At that time, approximately 60 percent of the U.S. population had some
comprehension about emerging information access routes (i.e., information technology). The
new technology influenced the economy and the professional and social lives of everyone
concerned; it was incumbent that the population recognized the need to be information literate.
Both Badke (2012) and Bird, Crumpton, Ozan, and Williams (2012) report that Zurkowski
(1974) held a vision of the creation of a major national and universal IL program by 1984,
believing IL skills were critical elements to creating wealth and a blueprint for the nation’s
economic recovery.
Bruce (2002) contends that IL connects with many forms of information technology
practices and critical thinking in information and communication technology environments.

33

Pollock (2002) describes IL as an active methodology and logic a person applies while searching
for information and/or discovering the answer to a question. A person relies on cognitive
knowledge to fulfill an information task, and so influences information behavior
epistemologically (Pollock, 2002). Bruce (2004) argues that IL acts as a catalyst to transform the
information society of today into the learning society of tomorrow. IL is also described as an
overarching literacy that is essential in the twenty-first century. Information and communication
technology (ICT), a subset of information science (IS), associates IL with information practices
and critical thinking (Gross & Latham, 2007). From the American Library Association (ALA)
and higher-education accreditation institutions such as the Middle States and Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), IL is the underpinning for learning in our modern
environment of continuous technological advancement; IL is a natural extension of literacy in
today's information society (Gross & Latham, 2007).
The appeal of inclusion of IL from outside of the library has been established by state,
educational, and professional organizations that recognize IL as a necessary part of higher
education (Rockman, 2004). These outside forces encourage acceptance internally, and create
opportunities to incorporate IL into curricula. Information management skills are one of eight
broad categories needed for twenty-first-century skills (Swanson, 2011). When instituting an IL
curriculum, there is need for creating collaboration, helping the library engage in cooperative
partnerships to further IL as a goal. These internal partnerships improve learning while using
community colleges’ limited resources efficiently (Srikantaiah & Koenig, 2004).
Rockman (2004) found that when IL is included in general education courses, it
represents a strategy for closing the gap across curriculum boundaries because general education
courses form the foundation of a common learning experience. Through collaborative alliances

34

with faculty and library personnel, students develop a process of personal empowerment by
becoming and remaining information literate throughout life (Rockman, 2004). Ragains (2006)
argues that incorporating IL into subject classes instills in students the ability to think and act
creatively, which is required in today's higher education system. The American Library
Association (ALA, 1989) Presidential Committee on Information Literacy report suggests that
what previously sufficed as literacy no longer counts as effective knowledge; there is great need
for computer, civic, global, and cultural literacies for the United States to compete in the world
economy (ALA, 1989). Kerr (2012) states that IL has had a profound influence on education,
employment, and quality of life, especially in contemporary, information-driven and
information-rich environments. IL is one of many literacies that appear in the digital educational
environment, often described as an overarching literacy (Koenig & Srikantaiah, 2004;
Srikantaiah, Koenig, & Al-Hawamdeh, 2010). Therefore, IL includes aspects of multi-literacy, as
information management, information technology, and DL. Many of these areas are indirect
components of information-learning skills (Swanson, 2004). Nearly thirty-five years after
Zurkowski (1974), President Obama declared that October is National IL Awareness Month,
spurred by the influence digital technology is having on education and IL (Obama, 2009).
The majority of IL publications are confined to library and information science journals.
Many contemporary, scholarly journals in higher education make minimal reference to IL, and
instead many articles in the same journals examine critical thinking and student research ability,
the terminology of which contains elements of IL (Badke, 2010). ALA and ACRL (2000), and
Badke (2010) disagree with the criticism of the IL term and description because IL is the correct
technical descriptor of the discipline. Badke (2010) explains the dichotomy of understanding
between faculty and librarians regarding the definition of IL. IL is not limited but a dynamic,

35

digitally dispersed learning method that challenges the concept of IL instruction (Badke, 2012).
Bucks County Community College’s pilot IL project for online students offered personalized
library and IL experiences. Findings suggest the importance of developing strong relationships
between faculty members and librarians, and building a foundation of IL instruction for faculty
members (Hemmig & Montet, 2010), thus creating questions concerning what is digital learning
and how to adapt pedagogy to fit with digital technology learning methodologies (Maddison,
2013).
What is digital literacy? Digital Literacy is a contemporary technology concept and an
integral part of IL. Therefore, DL now takes prominence because IL and all subsequent literacies
are a part of the whole literacy topic group. Each has its definition and value, often working
together to complement one another. Each topic also stands independently, but all have a
common denominator. Consequently, DL, and so IL as a subset, stems from literacy as the core
source of the foundational six root literacies mentioned above (Figure 5). According to
Lankshear and Knobel (2011), DL is an all-encompassing literacy that engages in the application
of AT, and Bawden (2008) identifies attributes that define DL, the top four of which are: (1)
reading and understanding non-sequential and dynamic material, (2) retrieval skills, plus critical
thinking for making informed judgments about retrieved information, with wariness about the
validity and completeness of internet sources, (3) knowledge assembly for building a reliable
information hoard from diverse sources, and (4) awareness of the value of traditional tools in
conjunction with networked media (Bawden, 2008). Lankshear and Knobel (2011) reiterate that
there is a combination of cognitive and non-cognitive factors that influence a person’s digital
literacy ability and success, and these factors interact and influence one another in any number of
combinations.

36

For a clearer picture to understand what the new literacy of DL means is to study the
concept with a breakdown of consummate parts. Examining each subtopic, to discover
interrelationships, why interconnections influence each component, and how they influence a
component or result. Similarly, to recognize types of people, academic or otherwise, who engage
with digital technologies, consequently identifying cause-and-effect links, when and where there
are issues connected with the phenomenon? Thus, research identifies possible solutions.
What is digital information literacy? Digital information literacy (DIL) is the evolution
of information available in myriad digital forms, and as such, IL is a component of information
computer technology (ICT) (Virkus, 2004). A dichotomy surrounds IL; IL incorporates
information technology skills, known as information retrieval (IR), and information search
processes (ISP) (Kuhlthau, 1999, 2004, 2007). DIL is the application of IL standards and selfefficacy skills with digital technology (Badke, 2010), where Figure 8 shows the interactive
relationship between IR and ISP as activities involved in IL.
Kirk (2007) explains the framework for information search process (ISP) is based on research on
users’ perspectives of IL and formal organized sources from information systems, interacts with
people for sources from everyday life experiences to review cognitive and affective aspects of
information seeking. Students conduct information searches, a process of construction that
involves the whole experience of the person, feelings, thoughts, and actions involved throughout
the IL process. As is demonstrated in Figure 7 the interconnectedness of the actions between IRISP and IL components, and DIL is applying those IL benchmarks in the digital format (ALA,
2000, Digital Literacy Task Force, 2013).

Figure 8. Interconnections between IR-ISP & IL components (Kirk, 2007).
Understanding information is represented by the relationship between IR and ISP skills,
and use of information and critical thinking skills (Kirk, 2007). From Virkus (2004) and Abbitt
(2011) discuss DL is at a premium, how expectation affect performance and a person’s ability
with AT applications, of which DIL is an integral part. Both are necessary attributes for everyone
to have the opportunity to be successful in the global market. Successful use of digital
information is contingent on the user, be it a faculty member, librarian, or college student, who
demonstrate both IL awareness (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000) and DL
self-efficacy (Abbitt, 2011; Virkus, 2004,).
The new millennium brought change in society’s opinions about understanding DL
attributes in higher education, and thus by extension DIL. From the perspective of faculty
members, Nelson, Courier, and Joseph (2011) argue that the primary challenge is the number of
digital literacy definitions. Their research surveys teaching faculty at a mid-sized, southeastern

38

U.S. university. Reiterating Hargittai (2010), evidence suggests that the influence of the range of
student computer literacy depends also on student demographics (Nelson et al., 2011). Nelson et
al. (2011) incorporate Covello’s (2010) research in a review of computer information literacy
(ICT), IL, and DIL, and add Web-literacy, thus demonstrating that DL is a much broader
discipline, representing an umbrella framework that incorporates interrelated sub-literacies.
Findings suggest that faculty perceptions of DL are not a single component, and nor is DL
assessed by one type of test (Nelson et al., 2011).
Belshaw (2012) argues that the global economy changed from industrial to an
information-technology knowledge economy. The definition of literacy in post-secondary
education is amended to include DIL in the fullest sense (Belshaw, 2012). Implications of this
newest digital form and format of literacy in education are in question. Jones-Kavalier &
Flannigan (2006) state that academia has not chosen a formula for digital teaching inclusion
since instructors and faculty members tend to be linear thinkers. Research on digital technology
with DL inclusion and predictability of improved student performance remains nascent.
Swanson (2011), Hennifer (2013), and Meland (2014) argue that digital technology
continually permeates the way institutions, faculty, and librarians provide instructional teaching
and educational administration of academic programs, from the fundamental activity of
information processing protocols to technology used as a platform to provide a learning
environment. DIL also includes technology tools used for learning information production (i.e.,
personal computers, tablets, and smartphones), and a multitude of interactive technology
instruments and programs available off-the-shelf (Hennefer, 2013; Meland, 2014; Swanson,
2011). Although digital technology has become popular with the public, benefits gained from
multiple digital avenues of access to information technology are influenced by geographic and

39

demographic factors (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008; Jaggars, 2012; Jaggars & Bailey, 2010; Kruger
& Gilroy, 2013). Many information-processing actions are conducted with, by, and even because
of technology. There is no avoiding the influence of digital technology, whether in a
school/college, at work, or for personal entertainment. Hence, IL also benefitted from technology
innovation, where accessibility is possible with even more diverse methods of digital access
(Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan, 2006).
Bruce et al. (2006) and Kuhlthau (2008) argue that a universal IL program is not
conducive to student learning (Bird et al., 2012; Lloyd, 2010), and Nelson et al. (2011) and
Ianuzzi (2013) suggest that a single-component DIL program lacks sufficient structure since
digital literacy and DIL agency involves interaction and successful efficacy of digital
competencies in academia and life. Faculty understand both students’ digital competencies and
technology perceptions when considering curriculum adjustments to include digital technology
(Ianuzzi, 2013; Nelson et al., 2011). Lea (2013) suggests a provision be made for DIL and web
literacy, and included as subject-discipline specific. McLuhan (1964) and Vygotsky (1997) posit
that integration of digital technology advantages with thoughtful modes of practice should be
developed and built on established connected learning theory (Gonzalez-Pitino & EstevanGuitart, 2014).
The evolution of IL to DL, and now DIL, where each has been born out of the other
indicates the innovation and development of digital technology as an integral component of
education, information learning and knowledge. The interconnectedness of all three—IL, digital
literacy (DL), and DIL—adoption in pedagogy introduces the incorporation of AT to achieve
learning outcomes. To add another layer to the list of terms in the digital literacy family,
synonymous with digital learning is (electronic) e-learning, (ubiquitous) u-learning, and virtual

40

learning, used to express the same types of digital learning activity. Similarly, IL developed such
ambiguity, with more than one definition depending on a person’s individual perspective or
discipline base, thus, the same inconsistency arises with DL.
Higher Education Faces a Digital Literacy Imperative with Academic Technology
In higher-education, universities, colleges, and community colleges agree that the
professional environment involves a combination of instructional learning, higher research,
service, and administration (Bok, 2013; Cohen & Brawer, 2008; Thelin, 2011), where teaching
and learning are central to their missions. Proactive commitment from faculty members,
librarians, students, and administrators serves an institution's various constituencies. The ALA,
Digital Literacy Task Force (2013) and Wesch (2011) provide a definition for digital technology
in higher education as use of electronic (digital) resources to create, communicate, and analyze
information in a digital context. Therefore, digital technology encompasses use of computer
information technology, software, Web 2.0, and digital media (Digital Literacy Task Force,
2013; Wesch, 2008, 2008, October, 2011, 2014). A college president, Ramaley (2014), expressed
interest in and concern about the influence of digital technology in higher education, and poses,
“How disruptive is this technology revolution?”(p.12). The concern is about the AT inclusion,
and what types of challenges occur once basic scholarship from teaching practice is depreciated
and therefore research on teaching disappears. During virtual learning, boundaries that once
separated teacher from student are lost (Ramaley, 2014). A review of Oblinger’s (2013)
reflections clarifies that no longer is a “classroom” limited to a physical location and face-to-face
interactions. Due to digital technology, essential information is available whenever and
wherever, and not stored alone in a physical form in a library. Institutions, curricula, faculty
members, librarians, and other educators must meet this challenge (Oblinger, 2013).

41

O’Banion (1999) advocated a reformed education environment that included technology,
and argued that multiple learning does occur, shifting faculty members beyond lecturers/teachers
to facilitators. DL with AT programs engages students during learning, and accentuates
collaborative, shared learning (O’Banion, 1999). Higher-education institutions experience
constant change, where institutions regularly expect faculty members and personnel to
demonstrate inclusion of (digital) AT as part of their pedagogy. During a review of a sample of
higher-education institutions, Bates (2000) explains how AT was deployed in colleges,
concluding, “Where technology was being used successfully for teaching, strong leadership was
a critical factor. Without leadership and a strong sense of support for a change in an organization,
the barriers of inertia can be great” (p. 43). Tirrell and Quick (2012) further explain that the
seven principles of good practice reflect assessing AT in student learning theory. They also
demonstrate that faculty cannot transfer traditional lecture material and teaching styles directly to
an AT program on a technology platform (Tirrell & Quick, 2012).
Institutional academic technology and information literacy. The National Center for
Educational Statistics (NCES) defines post-secondary education as:
an academic, vocational, technical, business, professional and home school…and may be
grouped in the following manner: universities, colleges offering programs leading to
bachelors and graduate degrees, as well as community/junior colleges two-year programs
offering programs that lead to associate degrees, diplomas, and professional certificates
of completion.” (cited in Putnam, 1981, p. 3)
Cohen and Brawer (2008), Thelin (2011), and Bok (2013) discuss the uniqueness of the
American higher education system, suggesting that post-secondary education is a person’s
journey of development during attainment of higher qualifications, with the intention of entering

42

a profession or career. Thus, the expectation is that higher education is responsible for providing
academic programs to meet current professional and career standards and expectations. In
opposition to K-12, higher education has no federal policies that mandate DL adoption and use
of AT in curricula. However, higher education institutions must adhere to accreditation standards
in geographic locations. Within these standards, accreditation commissions’ directions outline
criteria that the institution follows for compliance, and address the institution’s administration
and learning outcome goals. Universities and colleges might be advised to incorporate DL, but to
what extent is left to individual institutions since each institution is responsible for supporting its
campus community constituents (Bok, 2013; Cohen & Brawer, 2008; Thelin, 2011).
Tension and distinction between digital and information literacies. The basis of this
review cross-references education learning theory with faculty and librarian digital technology
and DIL applicable to higher education, and especially community colleges, exploring how
faculty digital technology use advocates epistemological congruency and influences faculty
members’ experiences and integration into academic teaching. Fruge and Ropers-Huilman
(2008) examine faculty and students’ epistemological congruency (EC). EC is the degree of
similarity between belief values (epistemology is learning attitudes) and congruency (similarity
of agreement). Frank (1955) argues that EC is explained as an effect between a person’s local
sense-making patterns and the newly introduced information for learning. It is change brought
about by coincidence as a shared experiential basis (where thought plus information achieves
decision) on which to build constructive analogies that provide further learning (i.e., knowledge)
and digital self-efficacy between digital technology instruments and tools (Frank, 1955). Fruge
and Ropers-Huilman (2008) argue that DL, AT tools, and programs enhance faculty subject
discipline content and teaching capability, offering enhanced subject learning objectives, and

43

hence improving student interactions and academic outcomes. This characterization mirrors
Hjorland’s (2010) explanation of Saracevic’s position that a person’s subject knowledge view is
a parallel to the person’s epistemic view.
Sinclair (2007) posits that research is a journey toward an endpoint, and is a guide to
understanding theoretical and conceptual frameworks. Hence, research is a foundation for
improved knowledge creation (Sinclair, 2007). This literature review targets faculty forms of
pedagogy, specific learning concepts and teaching methods of academic research (Sinclair,
2007). In discussions of faculty AT and teaching DIL, Adeyemon (2009), Wesch (2008), and
Swanson (2010) observe that the combination of digital literacy and IL into DIL must be a
collaborative effort of learning facilitators involved in curricula, learning modules, and learning
environments such as off-campus and online instruction. An initial search of the literature found
some studies on IL and student technology self-efficacy, but sparse research exists concerning
inclusion of DIL instruction programs in community colleges (Bailey et al., 2015; Ianuzzi,
2013). For this reason, broadening the study to include the nature of teaching and experienced
learning relationships between DL and DIL within the ethnographic sphere of higher education
was necessary (Hughes, 2014). Hughes (2014) explains that study participants’
ethnomethodology conceives the individuals as sense-making theorists, who design their own
motives for cognitive and non-cognitive meaning. The parameters of meaning are thus
understood contextually and developed by participants in ways particular to unique situations
and information environments (Hughes, 2014).
For the literature review to identify gaps or oversights, Samuels (2007), Laurillard
(2008b), and Mitchell (2012) suggest a coordinated strategy on the theme of teaching as a
science with discussion about the building of pedagogical patterns using AT for learning, From a

44

defined outline, search and develop comprehensive knowledge about the history of IL and its
development to its current state of DIL, and review scholarly materials through the lens of
faculty and librarians to explain the intricacies and anomalies of the interactive relationship in
higher education contexts. Faculty and librarian opinions, whether (digital) AT has become
pervasive, suggests a need to emphasize and combine recognized pedagogy with AT. Particularly
relevant is research from the perspective of a community college, and whether digital literacy is
in the foreground of academic discourse (Laurillard, 2008a; Mitchell, 2012; Samuels, 2007). The
literature contains multiple discussions on the question of faculty/student effective interactions,
and myriad types of IL programs from one-shot to faculty-librarian embedded courses, but no
articles on the epistemological congruency (i.e., perceptions and attitude toward learning) of
faculty and librarian pragmatic approaches to the new DIL. Therefore, Gallardo-Echenique et al.
(2015), Bucker and Kim (2014), and Marzilli et al. (2014), and similarly The Gates Foundation,
Babson Research Survey Group, and Educause research group, suggest that contemporary, postsecondary education systems must be prepared to question traditional models and corroborate
infusion of digital technology to complement pedagogy (Allen & Seaman, 2011; Allen et al.,
2012; Dahlstrom et al., 2014; Luma Consulting, 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2015).
Recently, there has been an abundance of studies conducted on digital literacy, but only
limited research on DIL, suggesting that the latter, in disparate academic contexts and regarding
library instruction, is multidimensional and complex, an area that also needs more research.
Hjorland (2007, 2008) states that the impression was that directional information research (DIR)
contradicted established, traditional information learning, and IL status quo and programs. DIR
appears in the conversation on the relevance of IR and information science assumptions of IL.
Hjorland (2010) continues with a discussion referring to Saracevic’s (1975) original declaration

45

that the fundamental perspective of relevance in IR was the “subject knowledge view” of
relevance, which is synonymous with “epistemological view” (p.217). Hjorland (2010) reiterates
that the concept of relevance is influenced by the type of approach a person uses during
information searching and discovery, which is explained by Kuhlthau’s (1999, 2004) concept of
IR and ISP interaction of IL (see figure 8, p.37). Covello (2010) and Littlejohn, Beetham, and
McGill’s (2012) response concerning how faculty respond to inclusion of digital technology and
DIL as components of educational practices suggest that recent studies demonstrate continued
need for expanded faculty/librarian pedagogical collaboration and development for research.
Gallardo et al. (2015) suggest new trends that society and global markets require
everyone to use technology in some way. In educational contexts, all new digital technologies
offer advantages, uses, and limitations that require new literacies (Gallardo et al., 2015). Thus, in
contemporary higher education, faculty members, librarian liaisons, and students must have the
ability to use digital technology and understand how the technology itself is a conduit to
information learning in the digital knowledge era. Bailey, Jaggars and Scott-Clayton. (2013) and
Scott-Clayton (2011, 2012) studies on educational technology reform continue because more
technology in a classroom does not ensure a bridge over the digital divide between the haves and
have- nots, which is especially noticeable in rural areas. Lamoureux (2012), Digital Literacy
Task Force (2013), Bucker and Kim (2014), and Gallardo et al. (2015) report that research
suggests that incorporation of advanced information and communication technology (ICT) in a
classroom is problematic because students’ personal perceptions do not necessarily match digital
literacy and IL capabilities or self-efficacy.
Constant, developing change of human epistemology (i.e., attitudes towards learning)
with digital technology, in Bertrand’s (2010) view, requires faculty to learn to adapt and use

46

technology. The phenomena of abundant information in various forms, printed hardcopy, and
electronic textual, visual, and auditory materials might arguably mean that digital technology
accelerates learning. Digital technology advocates argue that digital technology provides greater
access to the community by offering the potential for achieving better and faster information
production, and processing and retrieval for the individual in any environment (i.e., in college, at
work, and at home) (Bertrand, 2010; Lumina Foundation, 2014; Wesch, 2011, 2014).
O’Banion (1999) mentions that Dewey (1996) alluded that learning in the digital context
generally builds on previous literacy skills, and implies that new habits of learning must be
developed. The issue of literacy has changed in the current new media ecology. Swanson (2011)
and Säljö (2012) emphasize that the focus is no longer on printed matter, but is inclusive of
digital media. So, literacy gets confused with terms such as knowledge, competency, and
learning technology. Engagement with digitally produced information emerged because of recent
information technology transformations, mediated by communicative practices and the learning
environment (Belshaw, 2012; Säljö, 2012; Schraw, 2013).
Swanson (2011) and Säljö (2012) argue that the benefit of digital technology programs,
as part of the pedagogical process, relies on users; both teacher and learner must possess
technological ability and self-efficacy with the digital program to interact with the information
contained and develop new learning. The advantage of digital technology is potentially
contingent on the condition that each person has the right equipment, access to technology
connectivity, and the ability and skills to both use and make meaning with the digital technology
for the purpose of learning to achieve knowledge. Digital technology reconfigures the ways in
which faculty and students engage in learning and access learning community spaces (Swanson,
2011; Säljö, 2012; Schraw, 2013).

47

Considerations of the Ecology of Learning Technology. Discussing the ecology of
learning environment change, Wheeler (2007) argues that Piaget (1967) and Perry’s (1970, 1981)
theories are foundational to epistemology beliefs. In keeping with research from Perry (1970,
1981) on cognitive and non-cognitive thought processes, the dynamic interpretation is similar to
Dewey’s (1996) recognition of digital literacy—the human coordinated process of interpreting
the scene image to the recognized thought and understood response (Wheeler, 2007). Balacheff,
Ludvigsen, de Jong, Lazonder, and Barnes (2009) expand on Schulte (2008), who states that the
issue of learning technology incorporates philosophy of the mind, cognitive psychology,
linguistics and semiotics, philosophy of language, and computer science, tracing to early debates
on relationships among language, knowledge, and representation from Plato and Aristotle. Their
study explains digital technology that involves a semiotic perspective, which is triadic because of
the presentative combinations of images, attributes of the image, and perceptions of the image,
per Peirce’s (1998) and Atkin’s (2005) discussion of theory of signs or semiotics (Balacheff et
al., 2009). As a matter of conjecture, Shommer-Aikins, Unruh, and Morphew (2015), following
Schraw’s (2013) discussion, explain that the coevolution of literacy, digital literacy, and
epistemic practices of external memory systems comes with the new concept of a hybrid, human,
digital mind. Human cognitive, communicative, and non-cognitive activities integrate with
complex symbolic and material cultural tools presented through digital technology (Schraw,
2013; Wheeler, 2007). By engaging with resources, users develop epistemic practices and
literacy skills. These skills are coordinated specifically to the information format, be it printed
matter or digital information. The implication for the user is the notion that learning and literacy
skills change as they adapt to the functionalities of digital tools.

48

Lea (2013), reexamining Littlejohn et al.’s (2012) discussions of learning at the digital
frontier in theory and practice, argues that there is an expectation where the educator and learner
interact with digital technology as part of learning processes. In education, a primary concern for
instructors, faculty, and librarians, as subject experts, is student learning outcomes. Reimann and
Markauskaite (2010) contend new learning influences on old methods, and that e-research might
change the technology and enhance learning research. They highlight that an unexploited source
of educational development is the capacity of the educator to innovate (Reimann &
Markauskaite, 2010). To understand faculty and students’ tacit (implicit) practical thought
patterns versus explicit-abstract beliefs, people tend to think implicitly, but also be influenced by
explicit beliefs (Hjorland, 2010; Saracevic, 2007). Schommer-Aikins and Easter’s (2009)
epistemological questionnaire, Schraw (2013) epistemological beliefs inventory (EBI) are further
development from Schommer–Aikins (2002) and Hofer’s (2002) epistemological beliefs
questionnaire are three prominent instruments, each of which demonstrates part or all of three
epistemological world views—the realist, contextualist, and relativist (Säljö, 2012; Schraw,
2013; Shommer-Aikins, Duell, & Baker, 2003).
Shommer-Aikins et al. (2003) promote discussions of faculty epistemological beliefs,
since attitudes of learning theory and beliefs influence how teachers, and thus faculty, solve
problems of practice. The influence of epistemological beliefs about teaching and learning affect
how people interact with new information, and beliefs about that knowledge might influence
strategy use (Shommer-Aikins et al., 2003). Since the technology ecosystem has developed and
grown exponentially, the environment is populated by a variety of information, both produced
and provided, in traditional printed format and digitally. When it comes to the topic of whether
access to information is more accessible, there exists some consensus, as the topic expands to

49

include current digital equipment, Internet access, and connectivity support. In some rural areas
and communities, full digital access and support remain under development (Bailey et al., 2013;
Kruger & Gilroy, 2013; Scott-Clayton, 2011, 2012). The U.S. Broadband Technology
Opportunities Program (BTOP) is administered by the Department of Commerce, which
mandates facilitation of broadband service access to consumers who reside in unserved and rural
areas (NTIA, 2012).
According to the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL, 2000),
Ivanitskaya, Duford, Craig, and Casey (2008), and Badke (2010), IL and DIL literacy skills are
lifelong, and a prime example of interaction between people and information. The DIL process
links people with the information they need (Ivanitskaya et al. 2008; Badke, 2010). Gross and
Latham (2007, 2012) recognize a problem in which students generally resist IL and DIL. Other
findings suggest that student barriers to IL, and subsequently DIL, might come from being
unaware of the meaning of IL and DIL (Gross & Latham, 2007, 2012). Weigel, Straughn, and
Gardner (2010) questions whether it is possible to identify a student’s cognitive factors
responsible for IL resistance. Knowing why students resist and find IL needless provides useful
insights to both faculty and librarians. If faculty and librarians identify these cognitive factors, it
would be possible to improve the design and implementation of teaching with digital technology,
and IL and DIL learning interventions (Weigel et al., 2010). The contention is that new digital
media (NDM) is a controversial topic, since Bauerlein (2008) and Healy (2002) argue that
influences from NDM makes humans less intelligent and might harm the brain.
In the knowledge era, society requires more than basic literacy, to incorporate technology
in which digital competency is now an essential concept (Bertrand, 2010; Hughes, 2014; Wesch,
2011, 2014). Thus, digital literacy competency, computer and media literacy, and e-literacy skills

50

are the types of technology skills and understanding learners and faculty members must master.
The drawback is that there is no clear, definite digital literacy/competency concept; it is
multifaceted. Evaluating these digital concepts is complex, allowing for information origination,
production, dissemination, and generation of new technologies. In an educational environment,
new digital technologies include advantages, and limitations, requiring new literacies (Badke,
2010; Belshaw, 2012; Gallardo-Echenique et al., 2015; Wesch, 2011, 2014). Gallardo-Echenique
et al. (2015) do not establish a single definition, but explore how digital competency is described
systemically, identifying aspects to discover connections among disparate definitions and
understand how digital competency and digital literacy interconnect. The literature demonstrates
ambiguity regarding a definition of digital competency and digital literacy, in part from a variety
of names attached to technology skills. Across the literature, general perceptions of digital
competency and literacy are inconsistent because some researchers view digital competencies as
computer skills and others as learning/knowledge applications (Badke, 2012; GallardoEchenique et al., 2015). Multiple DL terminologies are sources of the problem. As Virtue, Dean,
and Matheson (2014) point out, terms used for IL in the digital environment vary, and a similar
situation exists for DIL in digital learning, representing a dilemma of jargon, found in library
science and elsewhere. The variety and inconsistency of terms include digital literacy, e-learning,
virtual learning, and ubiquitous learning. With no consensus, terminology and definition
confusion and complexity are common (Virtue et al., 2014).
Digital literacy, pedagogy, and content technology study models. Cox and Graham
(2009) describe a framework developed to address how educators use emerging educational
technologies, and expand on Shulman’s (1987) knowledge and teaching research into
pedagogical content knowledge. Polly and Brantley-Dias (2009) discuss how technological

51

pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) expresses a way educators might consider
knowledge associated with integrating DL into a learning environment. Bandura (1994), who
introduced the analysis, identifies self-efficacy as a person’s perception about their abilities in a
domain. The theory of self-efficacy is useful for shedding light on the difficult problem of
personal technology skill assessment and personal perceptions (i.e., relative to a person’s
epistemic perceptions of digital technology). Abbitt (2011) continues the discussion of primary
influences described by Bandura (1994, p.3) regarding a dynamic relationship between preservice teachers’ three levels of knowledge, DL technology, and self-efficacy. The framework
explains how technology-rich projects demonstrate educators’ teaching of content and pedagogy
to deliver and meet course objectives (Polly & Brantley-Dias, 2009). Koehler and Mishra’s
(2009) introduction of the TPACK model influenced the field of educational AT, inspiring
educators and educational technologists to reevaluate technology in the classroom. TPACK was
developed from Shulman’s original construct of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) adding
technology knowledge to the framework.
Koehler and Mishra (2009) investigate the relationship between self-efficacy beliefs
about technology integration and TPACK among pre-service teachers. Findings suggest a
positive correlation between self-efficacy beliefs and technology integration. Assessments of
pre- and post-test data demonstrate that over time, the predictive relationship between knowledge
in subjects’ TPACK and self-efficacy changes, illustrating the complex relationship and
malleable nature between knowledge and teachers’ technology self-efficacy. TPACK domains
highlight these attributes shown in figure 9.

52

Figure 9. TPACK (Koehler & Mishra, 2009, p. 63). Reproduced by permission of the publisher,

On the one hand, Cox and Graham (2009) argue that TPACK’s three-pronged approach is
definition of pedagogical knowledge that emphasizes an educator’s knowledge of general
pedagogy used in a course, technical knowledge of how to use emerging technologies, and
course content. These concepts overlap and interconnect, resulting in a) technological
pedagogical knowledge (TPK), which is knowledge of pedagogy in which a teacher engages
while using emerging technologies, b) technological content knowledge (TCK), which is
knowledge specific to a topic while using emerging technologies, and c) technological
knowledge (TK), which is the ability to use emerging technologies. The combination results in
TPACK, and the model recommends a rigorous framework for thinking about educators’
knowledge related to integrating technology into courses (Cox & Graham, 2009). On the other
hand, Wiggins and McTighe’s (2012) criticism of the TPACK graphic model in Figure 9 is that
all three elements are represented with equal weight (i.e., size and shape) in a Boolean logic

53

chart. Thus, each concept circle is identical, leading to an assumption of equal importance. In
reality, overall knowledge of pedagogy should hold the greatest importance (Wiggins, 2007).
In comparison, another model was designed by Puentedura (2006)—substitution,
augmentation, modification, and redefinition (SAMR; Figure 10). When considering DL
adoption in a curriculum and style of pedagogy, using SAMR builds beyond the (traditional)
lower level tasks of remembering, creative assessment, and augmentation to include higher levels
of Bloom’s revised taxonomy, in relation to Anderson and Krathwohl’s (2001) taxonomy for
learning, teaching, and assessing, a revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy of educational objectives
(Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001; Puentedura, 2006).

Burke (2013) advises that Puentedura’s (2009) adjustment and integration (for DL
inclusion in a curriculum) of SAMR is a deterministic behavior modification framework offered
as a supportive sociological and psychological tool for those who struggle with adjustment to
assimilation (Burke, 2013, p. 57). Whereas Abbitt (2011) suggests that continued use of TPACK
offers a model on which to build a knowledge base that augments self-efficacy beliefs for DL

54

technology integration in classrooms. There have been ongoing, self-reported measures using
TPACK, as Schmidt, Baran, Thompson, Mishra, Koehler and Shin (2009) describes, but more
research is needed to assess whether self-reported measures predict classroom practices (Abbitt,
2011).
Marcelo, Yot, and Mayor (2015) expand on Abbitt’s (2011) analysis of TPACK. The
study was conducted in Andalucía, Spain, to discover faculty frequency of technology use when
designing a teaching-learning process, and to what degree DL was incorporated in pedagogical
learning designs (Marcelo et al., 2015). Marcelo et al. (2015) argues that technology alone does
not change a learning environment; for learning to occur intervention is required during DL
instruction where AT accompanies teaching. Digital resources are based on learning strategies
that prioritize acquisition of knowledge. AT adopted in class content is relevant to appropriation
of knowledge by students. Hence, for AT to achieve learning goals, faculty must teach using
interactive, productive, experimental, or communicative learning methods of instruction
(Marcelo et al., 2015). Marcelo et al. (2015) also claims that DL inclusion rests on the
questionable assumption that in a culture of change, educators/faculty motivated by technology
demonstrate that DL with AT accords with their teaching methodologies, and that AT is
compatible with activities consistent with a pedagogy. Results of the study suggest coherence, in
which the primary component is content, transmitted through a variety of digital media. Faculty
engaged intensively in technologies that supported teaching and learning strategies, and 16.7
percent of faculty who integrated technology were younger lecturers, but most others
incorporated technology sparingly (Marcelo et al., 2015).
Different partnership support for digital literacy adoption. Albright and Nworie
(2008) discuss how DL adoption partnerships comprise college personnel from outside

55

information technology (IT) departments. From the perspective of teaching and learning with
technology and a foundation of instructional support, DL needs to commonly align with faculty
development, librarians, and distance or continuing education, and IT departments support
campus telecommunications, networks, and administrative computing. Albright and Nworie
(2008) define instructional digital technology as a field, function, or focus of service, in
comparison to ICT programs, which refers to a campus organization that provides the services.
Bertrand (2010) reports that a fair percentage of academia needs to overcome its late response,
emphasizing what Bates (2000) calls barriers of inertia as despondent faculty reactions to
technology. An institution and its leaders must instead embrace digital technology’s potential
(Bates, 2000; Bertrand, 2010).
Kezar (2009, 2011) continues Margolis (2008) discussion of how technology, namely DL
is changing the way learning occurs in higher education, transforming higher education into
more of a market business model, as opposed to the traditional, regulated public sector. In some
instances, the combination of technology and the new business model has been adopted by
community college leaders (Kezar, 2009, 2011; Margolis, 2008). Margolis (2008) expresses the
continued discrepancy between technology haves and have-nots of underserved minority student
demographics, where technology has not democratized the education system. Wesch (2008,
2008, October, 2011) advocates that embracing and achieving the benefits of digital technology
imply that all constituents must learn to use institutionally adopted technologies. Davis,
Lawrence, Miller, and Sanchez (2014), using the term digital leviathan, discuss the complex
process of faculty development during e-learning at a small liberal arts college, and the tendency
of faculty as adult learners to resist (digital) AT, where faculty (both full and part-time),
librarians, and student support personnel experience the challenge of change, and adapting to

56

incorporation of AT and understanding program learning objects (Davis et al., 2014). Lumina
Foundation (2014) and Gates Foundation (2015) research suggests a mixture of consensus in
popular attitudes toward (digital) AT in higher education; both industry-sponsored research and
student opinion suggests expectations of better DL inclusion with AT programs into methods of
teaching, and provision of student services in higher education.
Pedagogical research of higher-education institutions. During the last two decades,
there have been a number of scholarly studies that research higher-education institutional
academic status quo and effectiveness of student learning outcomes (Allen & Seaman, 2011;
Allen, Seaman, Lederman & Jaschik, 2012, June; Dahlstrom, Brooks & Bischel, 2014; Luma
Consulting, 2014; McGoldrick, Watts & Economou, 2015). Zurkowski (1974) suggests that IL
needs to be an integral part of the details of an accredited program curriculum (Gross & Latham,
2012). A national commission, the Carnegie Foundation, studied undergraduate education
environments of research universities, and assessed academic ecosystems, recommending need
for a new blueprint for undergraduate education (Boyer Commission Report, 1998). The Boyer
Commission Report (1998) proposes ten suggestions for improving education. Highlights from
the report reviewed IL and pedagogy when “reinventing undergraduate education” strategies,
where students engage in learning environments that require IL competencies; gaining skills in
IL multiplies opportunities for students’ self-directed learning (Boyer Commission Report, 1998,
p. 4). During a self-directed learning environment, students construct a framework for learning
how to learn as a foundation for continued growth, carried out in their roles as informed citizens
and members of the community (Boyer Commission Report, 1998).
The American Library Association (ALA) final report suggests that what used to suffice
as literacy no longer counts as effective knowledge. There is a need for computer, civic, global,

57

and cultural literacies for the United States to compete in the world economy. The committee
suggested continued effort to develop and incorporate IL into higher education pedagogy, but IL
is incorporated at the national accreditation level (ALA, 1989). By 2000, four of the primary
higher-education accreditation commissions developed standards that included IL as criteria,
indicating inclusion of IL as a pedagogical strategy. Commissions and the standards they
identified included the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSACS)
Commission on Higher Education, The New England Association of Schools and Colleges
(NEASC); The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) Commission on Colleges
(COC) and The Western Association of Schools and Colleges information literacy (American
Library Association, 2000; Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on
Higher Education, 2009). These standards demonstrate the commissions’ consensus that IL and
thus DL incorporation is a priority.
Facets of Digital Literacy Adoption
Digital literacy impact alters the higher-educational model. Growth of the highereducation organizational structure has become a complex system. Vaughan (2006) and O’Banion
(2011) argue that institutions remain gatekeepers of information and the educational
environment. Northouse (2013) suggests that the post-secondary system has diversified to such
an extent that organizational structure no longer fits the traditional model, a linear relationship
between cause and effect. Today’s reality exhibits how prediction of outcomes is problematic,
with all diverse factors involved. Consequently, emergent systems demonstrate these multiple
levels of educational methods, teaching formats, and DL with AT applications (i.e., face-to-face,
web-enhanced, and fully online classes) used in faculty pedagogy (Northouse, 2013).

58

Digital literacy challenges to the institution. Institutional challenges are three-fold:
understanding what causes an issue, the effect the issue has, and finding a solution when the
institution is itself multi-dimensional. At the forefront is the primary challenge of finance,
affected by continued budget cuts, continuous updating and maintenance of technology, and
annual equipment cost inflation. Compatibility with legacy systems and practical application of
new systems means training and acceptance of the human capital community, including
administrators, faculty, students, libraries, and information technology, and other personnel.
Considering incorporation of new DL concepts of AT applications in the existing institutional
culture, Schein’s (1988) model shows the flow of the information transfer cycle (McKinney,
2011); an organization’s information transfer cycle starts with basic assumptions, and then
moves on to espoused values and artifacts that include information systems incorporation (Figure
11). Through the flow of information, there is a connection among the three stages that reconnect
to the beginning, with the intention of leading to incorporation of DL methods of learning and
curriculum (McKinney, 2011, p. 8).
Schein (1988) posits a need to understand organizational culture theory, which creates the
possibility for a level of comprehension regarding how and where decisions are made, and who
makes them shown in figure 11. Through organizational culture theory, either a macro- or microlevel investigation into an institution’s structure enables uncovering of the levels of DL adoption
and AT acculturation and acceptance, leading to incorporation of DL methods of learning and
curriculum (McKinney, 2011, p. 8). As Greenleaf (1996) and Northouse (2013) advise, there is
need for constant transparency from leaders to the campus community so a culture of change will
happen.

Figure 11. Schein’s Model of Organizational Levels of Culture (McKinney, 2011, p. 8)
In many situations, DL with technology adaptation requires a collaborative approach to
transformation, acculturation, and accommodation. At the institutional level, there is consensus
among research from senior administrators and faculty. Administrative technology is effective
and helpful, but DL with AT incorporation is a different matter. Faculty are divided in their
opinions regarding the benefits of DL with AT applications toward student learning outcomes
within their respective disciplines since faculty are on the frontline dealing with factors
concerning students’ academic learning and DL (Collins, 2014; Sipple & Lightner, 2013). The
assumption being made is that students arrive at post-secondary institutions with IL awareness
and DL self-efficacy preparedness. Subsequently, Katz (2007) recommends continued effort
when incorporating AT, whereby indirect incorporation of IL and DL concepts appeared in
Educational Testing Service (ETS) questions on college-readiness tests, thus confirming
recognition of IL and DL by the establishment. Both of these factors are important to the
institution, aiding faculty advisors and counsellors when registering students for classes. Not all

60

students entering post-secondary education are ready for immersion in a digital technology
environment as a learning system (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008).
Regardless of constant technology changes and challenges, institutions must maintain
compliance for accreditation and currency with digital technology for a competitive reputation to
continue to attract and graduate students. Therefore, the institution and all constituents have no
option but to adapt and adopt AT. One positive aspect is that there are plenty of best practices
guides to assist during development of DL inclusion, and many professional associations offer
professional development conferences and workshops for added support when learning new
technologies. Many digital technology providers also offer training to assist a changeover to
learning new digital teaching tools and programs.
Digital literacy influences on institutional pedagogy. Bertrand (2010) argues that the
information revolution in education relates to production and delivery of courses, and American
universities should reassert their prevalence and the statuses of preeminent institutions for social
change and innovation in global higher education. Challenging American academia to become
more technologically applied and international, for example, by conducting a meta-analysis and
redesigning information-technology-delivered higher education that is learner centered and uses
problem-oriented learning driven by a new wave of research (Bertrand, 2010). Bertand (2010)
refers, to what Bates (2000) called barriers of inertia as a “Techno-sclerosis of higher education”
(Bertrand, 2010, p. 1). Scholarly groups such as Babson Research Group, Educause, Lumina, and
the Community College Research Center (CCRC) identify many institutional and faculty AT
barriers as legitimate issues that might be overcome (Lumina Foundation, 2014; McGoldrick et
al., 2015;), though they do not agree with Bertrand’s (2010) negative critical assessment of
faculty and the higher education system as a whole.

61

In higher education research, a majority of researchers agree that higher-education
research institutions must be more efficient and use technology competitively. In support of this
position, Samuels (2007) and Badke (2012) argue that institutional research requires redefinition
and reform of the traditional lecture model, and should identify faculty members as coaches
instead of traditional scholars and instructors. Thus, students become interactive colleagues
during learning, creating commitment to a student-centered pedagogy that drives the increase in
technology and computer-based instruction (Samuels, 2013; Wesch, 2011, 2014).
When considering the new literacy agenda for higher education composition, technology,
and academic labor, Samuels (2007) highlights Cynthia Selfe’s Technology and Literacy in the
Twenty-first Century. Selfe (1999) asks, “How do universities at the same time utilize new
information technologies and remain critical of the same technologies?” placing the institution
into a challenging situation (Selfe, 1999, p. 137). The National Academy of Sciences’ study,
Preparing for The Revolution: Information Technology and the Future of Research University,
(NAS, 2002) suggests high stakes are involved through billions of dollars invested by federal
research funding. Hence, government policy encourages the current push for universities to
integrate DL with new technologies and literacies into undergraduate instruction (Samuels, 2007,
2013).
Samuels (2007) develops a way for research to examine the possibilities and problems of
introducing multiple literacies into undergraduate programs. The model focuses on incorporation
of computer technology into U.S. universities, including the new literacy agenda for studentcentered classrooms regarding use of technology when teaching composition skills. Samuels’s
(2013) method highlights the possibilities and problems of introducing multiple literacies into
undergraduate programs, demonstrating how the new literacy agenda was conceived as

62

compromising the qualifications and job security of faculty, and the erosion of faculty expertise
when teaching student-learning outcomes (Samuels, 2007, 2013). Contrary to Samuels’s (2013)
opinion on DL inclusion, other scholars are unconvinced (Bertrand, 2010; Wesch, 2008, 2011).
Others promote technology advocacy since their studies maintain that digital technology
inclusion enhances faculty and student learning effectiveness, in effect, implying that technology
enhances learning (Bertrand, 2010; Lumina Foundation, 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2015; Samuels,
2013; Wesch, 2011, 2014). Therefore, if the assumption is that institutions are gatekeepers to
educational attainment, then faculty and librarians should be viewed as gatekeepers of course
pedagogy (Nilsen, 2012).
Academy attitudes toward digital and information literacy. Bertrand (2010)
demonstrates an unfortunate trend in that academia has not kept pace with research on the
influence of information technology on higher education and society, and has been slow to foster
the portability of knowledge. The American education system is tied to a discipline-centric
hierarchy (Bertrand, 2010). Regardless of how much evidence supports technology use,
Bertrand’s (2010) contention is that faculty question adapting to new digital pedagogy, but that
the traditional hierarchical, top-down pedagogical methods are ineffective ways to either teach or
learn, but these styles persist as dominant forms (Bertrand, 2010). Wesch (2011) explains the
debate regarding misrepresentation of how digital learning occurs and how forms of digital
information delivery create positive learning. In addition, Rogers (2003) and Wesch (2011)
identify the contentious attitude between DL with AT inclusions that are not in pedagogy, calling
it a crisis of significance that thwarts faculty/student interactive learning experiences. Digital
information is different from traditional hardcopy that faculty are accustomed to using, so there
is a need to rethink information learning and education methodologies (Wesch, 2008, 2014).

63

Support for digital literacy adoption with academic technology inclusion. Where
does the responsibility for developing and establishing the overarching incorporation of AT lie?
AT can be prescribed by a state education agency or at the institutional level, where
administrators make the choices. There are few exact rules, and therefore each state and
institution makes its own decisions on what technologies to use. Ultimately, faculty, librarians,
and other personnel must learn and adapt. Libraries and librarians already use technology as
much of a library’s information resources and management systems are now electronically
based. However, there might be an issue regarding on whom the responsibility for developing
and incorporating DL to include AT resources to fit into curricula lies. Consequently, faculty
members, as disciplinary experts are often given the task of developing DL with AT resources.
Luther and Pickering (2015) found that generally, faculty might have basic familiarity with
learning management systems (LMS) such as Blackboard or Moodle. In many institutions, with
expansion of the Internet and digital technology, there might be an instructional technology
designer or webmaster (Luther & Pickering, 2015). Surveys from the past ten years indicate that
faculty use some forms of digital technology, primarily e-mail, and a close second is in-class
Internet videos, followed by content for web-enhanced classes. Some faculty members engage
fully in digital technology inclusion. What makes the difference during DL adoption and
inclusion with AT applications might lie in whether an institution provides training and adequate
support (Gates Foundation, 2015; Lumina Foundation 2014).
Hawkins and Rudy’s (2006) summary of the Educause Core Data Service (CDS) (2005)
indicates that higher-education institutional IT departments provide instructional technology
services, but instructional technology support was non-existent. The Spellings Commission, “A
Test of Leadership, Charting the Future of U.S. Higher Education” (U.S. Department of

64

Education, 2006) comments that technology adds value by strengthening academic programs,
increasing access, and providing improved models for curriculum development and delivery.
Newman, Courturier, and Scurry (2004) argue that both new policies from politicians and
expectations handed down from institutional administrators regarding digital AT enhance
learning and teaching. Use of digital technology systems enables institutions to track both
student learning outcomes and institutional performance better (Newman et al., 2004). McMillen
(2010) suggests that both politicians and administrators believe that incorporating more digital
technology into learning and teaching provides data that enable better decision-making and
performance management.
Faculty attitudes toward digital and information literacy. DL successes in digital selfefficacy perception and digital information learning affect faculty, librarians, and instructors as
educators, and students as learners. These groups have different learning capabilities and
teaching styles. Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan (2006) argues that there is a variety of digital
literacy approaches and perceptions among faculty. So, there might be a possibility that they are
stymied technologically, as Bertrand (2010) points out. Jones et al. (2006) explain that by
definition, faculty members, must learn the how, what, when, and where of DL in the application
of AT as they became available and integrate into professional contexts and education. The
classification is not a conclusive result that generation X, Y and Z natives born into a
technology-driven world are naturally and intuitively successful with AT (Jones-Kavalier &
Flannigan, 2006). Tapscott (1998, 2008) and Prensky (2009) agree on an important factor—
everyone inclusive of the generation X, Y and Z natives must have the opportunity to engage
with AT as long as adequate training, time, and support are provided.

65

Luther and Pickering (2015) continue the research of Maloy, Verock-O’Loughlin,
Edwards, and Wolf (2013), that considers the influence of student populations’ learning styles
and academic ability diversity. As educators, faculty need to offer a variety of AT in their
teaching so students express their learning abilities fully (Luther & Picker, 2015; Maloy et al.,
2013). The study defines the particulars of integrating two types of Web 2.0 technology—
blogging and glogging—into curricula, also called a weblog. A blog is an online journal, a
combination of text, images, and sound. The universal design for learning (UDL) is a new model
of educational philosophy in the interactive Web 2.0 (i.e. Internet and electronic resources such
as databases) learning environment that advocates multiple academic technologies for students to
demonstrate mastery (Luther & Pickering, 2015). Luther and Pickering (2015) suggest that
Maloy et al. (2013) indicate that Web 2.0 includes interactive tools that “encourage nonlinear,
dynamic presentations that expand on how students think about topics” (Maloy et al., 2013, p.
224), offering students multiple paths to reaching learning goals. Using UDL, faculty are more
likely to engage fully and motivate student involvement (Luther & Pickering, 2015). Prior to
UDL, Jacobson and Mackey (2013) reported that the classroom lecture style is prevalent, but the
generalization is unwarranted since teaching style depends on the faculty and type of education
environment. In discussions of discipline and information media’s constant innovations, there is
a wave of change because information dissemination and publication are through digital media
on websites, blogs, and Twitter, for example, and alternatively through podcasts and YouTube
videos (Jacobson & Mackey, 2013).
When training new and current educators Luther and Pickering (2015) recommend
consideration for all digital learners at the varied levels of digital capability, and that
understanding of digital learner educators/faculty is needed during professional training and

66

support from institutional or technical instructional designers. Examples include meaningful
Web 2.0 applications, demonstrating Seung’s (2013) prediction that learning motivates students
and enhances their experiences. Incorporation of blogging and glogging from the Web 2.0 (i.e.
Internet and web applications) environment into curricula have a positive effect, and maintaining
ethical use of information within the parameters of copyright, and inclusion of digital
technologies, offer great potential (Luther & Pickering, 2015).
Faculty and student digital literacy interactive benefits. In the continued discussion of
AT, Beetham and Sharpe (2007) suggest that AT helps all levels of educators understand how
students learn since technology offers rapid response and the possibility for immediate student
feedback, and student potential to act as co-designers of learning. In higher-education
institutions, practical and theoretical constructs of best practices for improvement of pedagogy
during e-learning and distance education focus on types of rethinking of pedagogy. Redesign
brought about by digital learning in contemporary contexts is where e-learning represents use of
technology as a platform for a digital classroom and the AT environment (Beetham & Sharpe,
2007, 2013). Beetham and Sharpe (2007, 2013) also acknowledge that pedagogy remains a guide
for how a learner learns, what it takes for a student to learn, and whether fundamental learning
theories remain the same. However, DL with AT enables an active form of student learning. For
example, open educational resources (OER) technology programs over the Internet democratize
access to learning resources and related material (Beetham & Sharpe, 2007, 2013).
Beetham et al (2013) and Luther and Pickering (2015) emphasize that development of
information and communication-technology education experienced a paradigm shift. When
building on that shift, both illustrate how technology-rich learning environments call for holistic
analysis at the system level, and DL adoption of AT designs for learning in concrete, disciplinary

67

contexts. In contradiction to the popular opinion of other scholars, Badke (2012), Dubicki
(2013), and Luther and Pickering (2015) advocate interdisciplinary collaboration, with shared,
faculty/librarian, agentic DL cooperation to achieve optimum student learning outcomes.
Beetham and Sharpe (2013) promote active incorporation of many educational contexts such as
face-to-face, self-directed, blended, and distance-learning environments, suggesting multiple
ways to reconsider flexible learning needs of individuals, institutions, and societies. A variety of
resources elucidate learning design projects, demonstrating innovative models of designing for
learning alongside novel standpoints of pedagogy (Beetham & Shape, 2007, 2013). From a
faculty perspective, the progression of technology into their academic work and pedagogy might
be challenging since DL is a continually changing environment, and demand from institutions
and students to include DL that use AT applications is also constant.
Faculty issues with digital literacy. When it comes to the technology boom and overall
faculty attitudes toward DL inclusion and AT, rather than citing a list of scholars repeatedly and
belaboring the message, it suffices to say that unless a state or institution has a mandate for DL
inclusion, individual faculty members make their own choices. Wesch (2008, 2011) and
Swanson (2010) agree that education and learning are delivered on multiple platforms, but
agreement ends on the question of the traditional method of teaching during a lecture-style,
classroom presentation. In comparison to face-to-face, an in-classroom, lecture-style format has
been translated into the modern practice of a learning management system (LMS) that uses AT
application for instruction purposes; faculty and students engage in interactive learning, opening
the classroom environment to question the subject and topic context, and investigate the value of
subject content. For some faculty, the change seems radical (Swanson 2010; Wesch, 2008,
2011). Jumonville (2014) and Luther and Pickering (2015) explain that Blackboard, Moodle, and

68

Adobe Connect provide teaching instruction in asynchronous and synchronous online classroom
environments. Both Jumonville (2014) and Luther and Pickering (2015) maintain that policies
define secondary level institution inclusion of DL concept with digital technology and digital
teaching in schools, within common-core standards. At postsecondary/higher-education levels,
the decision to adopt and incorporate AT is left to the state and/or individual higher-education
institutions to adapt and interpret these policies. Therefore, faculty depend on their institution’s
procedures and systems to determine what becomes designated as accepted DL inclusion to
develop and adapt into curricula (Jumonville, 2014; Luther & Pickering, 2015; Swanson, 2010;
Wesch, 2011, 2014).
Is academic freedom impacted by digital literacy adoption? Nelson (2010), president
of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), posits that the academy is still
learning how to apply academic freedom to the new DL pedagogical, technological, cultural
realities that did not exist when the concept was defined. AAUP is a primary source of
documents outlining principles of faculty academic freedom rights and possible DL
responsibilities. Academic freedom broadly encompasses both individual and institutional rights
to maintain academic standards. It establishes a faculty member’s right to stay true to his/her
pedagogical philosophy, preserving intellectual integrity of the educational system (Nelson,
2010). Thus, it gives faculty the right to ignore college or university regulations. When
discussing faculty academic freedom in relation to the inclusion of AT, there must be
collaboration between the institution’s administrative policies and faculty senate to define what
academic freedom means regarding DL’s levels of AT adoption, and how it is defined (Nelson,
2010).

69

Responding to an appeal in the Supreme Court of New Hampshire (Sweezy v. New
Hampshire, 1957), Justice Frankfurter concurred that at institutions of higher education, the
faculty body has a primary responsibility of academic decisions that determine who may teach,
what they teach, how it should be taught, and who may be admitted to study. Poskanzer (2002)
explains that the extent that the legal concept of institutional academic freedom (or institutional
autonomy) influences adoption of new DL inclusion into faculty pedagogy depends on the
faculty as a body, or individually, and their position on First Amendment rights; where the “legal
decisions on academic freedom is considered as an aspect of freedom of speech protected by the
first amendment, the term is equivocal” (Bilgrami & Cole, 2015, p. 174). Many judicial opinions
recognize that institutional academic freedom might be viewed as the sum of acts of individual
faculty academic freedoms. The interpretative meaning, in layman’s terms, is that the only
reason courts side with institutional policies is because the faculty are considered involved with
decision-making. Therefore, faculty as a body have the voice in the approval of policies dealing
with AT inclusion (Poskanzer, 2002).
Since faculty academic freedom is an integral part of job responsibilities and satisfaction,
Jaschik and Leederman’s (2015) survey of college and university faculty workplace engagement
comparison of two and four year institutions informs that faculty at community colleges strongly
agree, both the mission of their institution and the job is important. Related to faculty job
satisfaction showed 42 percent of faculty, who strongly agreed that they have academic freedom,
and full-time faculty, as opposed to part-time faculty have the impression of greater job security.
Faculty meeting the challenge of digital literacy integration. Multiple research
surveys from the Gates Foundation, Lumina, Educause, and Babson Research Center examine
how faculty members have differences of opinion regarding online education and the

70

pervasiveness of new technologies, online education, and DL. The surveys discuss issues and
challenges faculty face with digital technology, DL adoption; probing whether online learning
modality is a useful method of rapid expansion of knowledge is debated among faculty members.
Recent studies argue both for and against DL, online education and instructional AT (Allen, &
Seaman, 2011; Allen, Seaman, Lederman & Jaschik, 2012, June; Allen, Seaman, Lederman &
Jaschik, 2012, August; Dahlstrom et al., 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2015). A review of these
national research studies and surveys suggests that 40 percent to 60 percent of faculty members
use or are interested in using administrative AT, and half that number, 20 percent to 30 percent,
are using AT to teach. Survey samples consisted of faculty from two- and four-year public and
private institutions, with some administrative membership (Allen, & Seaman, 2011; Allen,
Seaman, Lederman & Jaschik, 2012, August; Dahlstrom et al., 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2015).
Findings indicate that even with faculty support, skepticism is common regarding AT benefits
with learning outcomes. An Inside Higher Ed (2013) survey used a Gallup poll of 2,251
professors and found that 30 percent of respondents believed online courses achieve learning
outcomes equivalent to face-to-face. Another 50 percent agreed or strongly agreed that within a
discipline or department, online learning produces the same learning outcomes as face-to-face
(Jaschik & Lederman, 2013). Contrary to Jaschik and Lederman (2013), Mitchell (2010)
criticizes online education, where boundaries between disciplines are blurring, meaning faculty
members should work in collaborative teams in two or more disciplinary contexts, and therefore
participate in teaching or research in multiple disciplines. Consequently, faculty experience even
more pressure to adopt DL that engages in AT (Mitchell, 2010). Gappa, Austin, and Trice (2011)
argue that online education and digital technology add workload. The pressure on faculty from
institutions and students encourages a disconnected feeling, attributed more so to adjunct faculty.

71

To overcome this, the organization must offer robust and continuous DL and AT online training
and support for all faculty members (Gappa, Austin, & Trice, 2011).
Different types of faculty digital training and digital literacy support. Cox and
Richlin (2004) describe the faculty learning community (FLC) movement, with roots in future
new, junior, mid-career, and senior faculty members’ desires for a collaborative,
transdisciplinary learning community that supports investigation and implementation of new AT
in teaching and DL learning approaches and opportunities. Developing an FLC program involves
changing the institutional culture with a design that enhances teaching effectiveness using group
discussions of shared experiences (Cox & Richlin, 2004). In discussions of a community-college
(CCCSE) (2010) survey, Sipple and Lightner (2013) offer an interesting discovery—
development of an FLC is an important and valuable aspect of AT. FLC success is also credited
to establishing a faculty learning cohort community, particularly when designing FLCs at twoyear colleges for faculty professional learning. A critical factor was connections between
collaborative, structured FLCs, and student-learning persistence. However, FLCs have the
potential to offer two-year college faculty opportunities to develop scholarship of teaching and
learning (SoTL), making even more connections between two- and four-year faculty members,
and closing the gap between full-time and adjunct faculty members (Sipple & Lightner, 2013).
McKinney (2006, 2007) explains that SoTL involves post-secondary practitioners conducting
scholarly inquiry into both teaching and learning in a higher-education context, with the public
sharing and reviewing such work through presentations, performances, and publications
(McKinney, 2006, p. 39, 2007). As an example, technology FLC brings together faculty
members from all disciplines for e-learning and information instruction design support that
encourage expansion of creativity and application of IT to pedagogical redesign. Sipple and

72

Lightner (2013) provide an example, showing the advantages and disadvantages of the FLC
structure, and that there is no universal model. However, the model is implemented in either the
short- or long-term. FLCs develop a collaborative environment among faculty members, and
essential elements of effective faculty encouragement (Sipple & Lightner, 2013).
Librarian challenges to adopting digital literacy changes. At the American Libraries
Association Midwinter meeting in New Orleans, ALA President, Berry (2001), said that as the
gatekeeper of information and with the Internet making electronic information accessible,
libraries are balancing access and control in a networked world. Therefore, incorporation of new
(digital) AT is a continuous process for libraries. According to Andrade and Zaghloul (2010) and
as the literature demonstrates, there has been restructuring of librarian (i.e., librarian-liaison)
roles, redefining the librarian’s academic purpose in many academic libraries. Librarian-liaison
roles differ at each institution, if an institution even has such a position. The librarian-liaison role
collaborates as an intermediary with faculty on subject content resource development, which is
influenced by new digital technology and AT adoption. Arendt and Lotts (2012) focus on
research support services connected to restructuring the liaison librarian team at the University of
Arizona Libraries, 2007 through 2009. The library’s restructuring between 1993 and 2000
occurred due to the addition of an information commons (i.e., learning center), changes to
customer needs and expectations, budget reductions, and especially adoption of new technology
(Andrade & Zaghloul, 2010).
Andrade and Zaghloul (2010) conclude that altering a liaison librarian team to the real
simple syndication (RSS) model affects the library and influences librarians’ and information
professionals’ morale. The move from subject to domain specialist changed librarian identities,
with unanticipated effects on the organizational structure. Thus, the influence revealed that more

73

conversations should occur concerning subject-specialist roles, communication and marketing,
and outreach directions. Evaluations of a library’s change to the RSS structure to assess its
effectiveness regarding meeting customer needs are also warranted (Andrade & Zaghloul, 2010).
The literature suggests that faculty and their respective academic departments are
unaware of whether their institution’s library has a librarian-liaison program. Arendt and Lotts
(2012) discuss what librarian-liaisons say about themselves and what faculty members say about
their liaisons. The study was a survey of librarians and faculty members at colleges and
universities across the United States, identified from the Department of Education’s integrated,
postsecondary education data system (IPEDS) and using 2008 data. Faculty participants ranged
across multiple disciplines, with three groups of participants: faculty, matched-group librarians,
and unmatched-group librarians. Findings suggest that faculty are ambivalent, often because they
are unaware of their availability. In universities at which faculty members were aware of a
library-liaison program, faculty members spoke highly of their collaboration and services
(Arendt & Lotts, 2012). Arendt and Lotts (2012) argue that librarian (librarian-liaison) and
library-information professionals are unsure of what faculty members perceive they need or
want.
Vakkari (2008) suggests that faculty view librarians and libraries as valuable when
providing electronic resources and other material in support of their teaching and research, and
are the appropriate agency for document preservation. Faculty attitudes suggest that the
electronic resources librarians provide aid their work, but decrease physical use of the library,
reducing students’ perceptions of a library’s value (Vakkari, 2008). So why has there been little
change in faculty attitudes toward librarians? Badke (2012) suggests that the librarian’s role is
often perceived by faculty and students as traditional, stereotyped support to the academic

74

support role, and not a proactive, instructional role. However, changes are occurring, with more
institutions and faculty considering what is called embedded librarian instructional incorporation
as part of academic curricula (Badke, 2012).
Librarian and pedagogy information literacy challenges and issues. Bruce et al.
(2006) and Badke (2010) comment on lack of IL assessment, but Oakleaf (2011) brought the
issue to the foreground. IL is frequently omitted from assessment in higher education, in part
because faculty and co-curricular professionals expect students to possess IL skills before
entering college (Badke, 2010; Bruce et al., 2006; Oakleaf, 2011). The consequences are not
something faculty focus on in their courses; instead, the assumption is that the librarian
(instructional-librarian-liaison) attends to students’ IL needs. The American Association of
Colleges and Universities (AACU) designed an assessment in the form of a holistic rubric to
overcome IL obstacles. The new, comprehensive, IL rubric—valid assessment of learning in
undergraduate education (VALUE)—was tested and used in an IMLS-funded, three-year grant
study during 2010 and 2011. The rubric assessment of information literacy skills (RAILS) study
investigated five higher-education institutions. Feedback from student participants suggests that
the primary barrier to the project was lack of time and coordinated structures for assessment. The
most notable outcome was that adoption of the VALUE rubric as a catalyst improved evaluations
from institutions and collaboration among faculty, co-curricular professionals, and librarians
(Oakleaf, 2011).
Bruce, Edwards, and Lupton, (2006), Head, (2008), Kuhlthau (2008), and Latham and
Gross (2013) argue that IL is a complex phenomenon. The definition of IL is an overarching
parent term and subtopic child term, depending on context. Complicated further by institution,
organization, faculty, and discipline attitudes is that IL is a set of universally applicable skills

75

that can be learned regardless of context or practice within a discipline. As Cope and Sanabria
(2014) suggest, there is reason to reconnect with faculty, especially since education is
experiencing expansive installation of (digital) AT. In-depth comprehension of how academic
departments/faculty members understand IL is required because IL is an important step during
development of institutional IL programs and support for academic curricula. At community
colleges, regardless of a faculty member’s discipline, students come from diverse academic
backgrounds, and thus teaching must address fundamental literacies. Discussing IL depends on a
student’s capacity and academic needs, but faculty from community colleges focus on
rudimentary skills related to IL (Bruce et al., 2006; Cope & Sanabria, 2014; Head, 2008;
Kuhlthau, 2008; Latham & Gross, 2013.
A few studies explore faculty perceptions of IL beyond library information science (LIS).
DaCosta (2010) examines faculty perceptions and activities related to IL in the United States and
England, and found there is a skills gap to be bridged. Cope and Sanabria (2014) hypothesize
that disciplinary training influences faculty IL perceptions. Interviews during 2012 and 2013
examined whether librarians and faculty members “speak the same language” (Cope & Sanabria,
2014, p. 475), using a phenomenological method and interviewing faculty from two- and fouryear colleges. The study assesses two factors: (1) whether faculty members’ disciplinary
backgrounds influence perceptions of IL, and (2) whether LIS professionals’ perceptions of IL
differ from faculty members’ (Cope & Sanabria, 2014).
Cope and Sanabria (2014) examine individual professors’ IL perceptions, with responses
suggesting that faculty members’ personal IL concepts contradict LIS IL standards (Association
of College and Research Libraries, 2000). Hence, Cope and Sanabria’s (2014) argument supports
DaCosta’s (2010) findings that differences of opinion on how IL should be taught between

76

faculty and LIS professionals represent an area of misconception and miscommunication. Cope
and Sanabria (2014) emphasize the importance that indifference requires assessment. Faculty
participants believed that IL is a combination of learning basic library skills (not necessarily IL
skills), and is part of the academic discourse in a discipline. Faculty realize that students face
many hurdles, and fundamental literacies are skills that support their studies and learning.
Students use a basic range of abilities to find information, relying especially on the Internet for
knowledge. The contemporary information environment magnifies the IL issue and problem of
information overload. Consequently, findings demonstrate an emergence during which student
IL skill patterns relate to a contextual, textual, and empirical theme. Thus, Cope and Sanabria
(2014) identify many IL instruction programs, considering that IL learning skills occur linearly,
except the adoption of DL technology self-efficacy adds a non-linear aspect.
Faculty do not see IL as a distinct academic course but as embedded in a discipline, and
perceive that they already incorporate IL into their teaching structure (Cope & Sanabria, 2014).
These two points demonstrate some of the current hindrances that limit IL and therefore DIL
success since information/subject learning is not a linear process (Hjorland, 2010).
Swanson (2011), Swanson and Jagman (2011, 2015) and Wesch (2008, 2008, October)
argue that research suggests, at both secondary and post-secondary institutions, that faculty,
(instructional) librarians, and teachers are incorporating various forms of AT to energize and
reengage students, brought to the foreground partly by the influence of open-source (OER),
readily available technology (Swanson, 2011; Swanson & Jagman, 2015; Wesch, 2008, 2008,
October). Jacobson and Mackey (2013) comment on a change in library facilities, electronic
services’ design, and digital information management to a learning environment set up as a
learning commons to promote cooperative student DL interactions with technology. Providing

77

the environment promotes student, faculty, and librarian DIL and AT access. Students find
support and information access for their studies 24/7 through digital electronic technology, an
essential tool for the commuter or distance learner to facilitate classes and learn (Jacobson &
Mackey, 2013).
A developing theme is threading through all of these areas. From the viewpoint of
institutions, faculty, and librarians, the literature suggests that a person’s concept of what defines
DL adoption and AT engagement in the higher education environment varies considerably.
These varying degrees comprise issues that challenge inclusion of AT, and influence
achievement of student learning outcomes, where consideration of faculty and librarians’
aptitudes and acceptance of DL inclusion with AT ties with their perceptions of DL’s value
toward student academic learning outcomes and success.
Community College Pedagogy and Information Literacy

The community college mission and information literacy. The national agenda stresses
that more American students should reach degree completion, but community college goals are
much broader; the outcome is not just for degree completion or transferability, but to have
portable credentials of market value in careers for sustaining good wages (American Association
of Community Colleges, AACC, 2012; Silverman & Williams, 2014). The 21st Century
Commission on the future of community colleges, Reclaiming the American Dream, states the
importance for community colleges to sustain open access (AACC, 2012, p. 29). Both
Kahlenberg (2013) and Bailey, Jaggars and Jenkin’s (2015) assessment of the Reclaiming the
American Dream report observes how it calls for honest self-evaluation and criticism that
acknowledge present community-college shortcomings in areas such as student success rates,
employment preparation, and transferability. The report opens the door for thinking creatively to

78

make it possible to reclaim the American dream (Bailey, Jaggars & Jenkins 2015; Kahlenberg,
2013).
Vaughan (2006) and Cohen, Brawer, and Kisker (2013) acknowledge the merit of the
community college mission and the how there is need for change. The present higher-education
environment must respond to society’s digital advancements to face a (digital) AT imperative
(Cohen et al., 2013; Vaughan, 2006). Kuh and O’Donnell (2013) argue that the modern
community college mission should have clear objectives to demonstrate a culture of proof and
collaboration, gaining better focus on access and student success, clear and coherent educational
paths, collective responsibility for student success, and funding tied but not limited to
enrollment, institutional performance, and student learning objectives. Through prioritization and
regular assessment at varied points along students’ paths, quality implementation should be
trackable (Kuh & O’Donnell, 2013). Glasper and de los Santos (2013) argue that American
higher-education history demonstrates that community colleges are essential innovators. The
innovation framework is not limited to the business model; process innovations occur as
technology acts as an enabler, ranging from workflow productivity for incremental improvement
and student ability to focusing on academic success (Glasper & de los Santos, 2013).
Reiterating Vaughan (2006), Cohen et al. (2008) and Cohen et al. (2013) allude to an
organizational change that Diel-Amen and Rosenbaum (2014) explain is a case in which
community colleges transform into institutions oriented toward college preparatory transfer
programs or organizations that emphasize terminal vocational training (Cohen & Brawer, 2008;
Cohen et al., 2013; Deil-Amen & Rosenbaum, 2014). Levin and Kater (2012), suggest that the
difference is where the business-domination model was designed, with curricular offerings of
those colleges reflecting the imprint of commercial and business interests. These programs

79

provide technically trained workers. Another variation of the community-college model creates
vocational isolation because with the enterprise-domination model, emphasis is on the power of
large corporations that shape the educational system to serve their interests, focusing on
efficiency, business, and market/economic ends, and thus making educational programs
commoditized and vocationalized. The impression is that the education curriculum is reduced to
occupational training and marketable skills (Levin & Kater, 2012; Wagoner et al., 2010). In
Wagoner et al. (2010) study argues that in the twenty first century and beyond, community
colleges will have altered their identities and missions; educational endeavor will become
primarily a capitalist enterprise (Wagoner et al., 2010).
Discussing community colleges, Vaughan (2006) and Cohen et al. (2013) argue that
community colleges are unique in their ability to adapt to change, with close relationships with
industry and commerce. Community colleges align much of their academic missions rationally
with career and technical certifications. They incorporate advances in technology as it pertains to
the industry, in comparison to other institutions of higher education
(Cohen et al., 2013; Silverman & Williams, 2014). However, Scott-Clayton (2011, 2012) and
Bailey et al. (2015) highlight the reality that as the new wave of digital technologies is adopted,
they are not necessarily accepted because of the demographics of students, faculty members, and,
by extension, librarians. The added need for support in training and application of new digital
formats is an issue, especially in rural areas because access to and comprehension of new digital
technologies is limited (Scott-Clayton, 2011, 2012; Bailey et al., 2015). Zurkowski (1974)
alluded to technology’s prominence in people’s professional lives. Whether people agree with
Zurkowski, they have to accept that we live in a digital technology era.

80

Vaughan (2006) and Bertrand (2010) are among many scholars who express the
realization that professionals and even the public must continue learning new technology
programs to compete in an educational context, and in the larger picture of the global market.
Both new policies from politicians and expectations handed down from institutional
administrations suggest a need to incorporate increasingly more DL into learning and teaching.
Both Bertrand (2010) and Bailey et al. (2015) identify the potential of new policies and political
influence, expounding on how politicians and society’s current sentiment affects community
college redesign because the impression is that use of AT enables and improves data collection
that is measurable. For that reason alone, the meta-analysis of data collected offers college
administration the potential to predict how to amortize better their financial commitments to
providing a balanced education environment (Bertrand, 2010, Bailey et al., 2015).
Access to support digital technology sustainability. Scott-Clayton (2011, 2012) and
Bailey et al. (2015) argue that having secure Internet broadband access is a factorial issue that
affects the success of (digital) AT. At the institution/faculty level, secure Internet access
influences inclusion of such digital technology programs in curricula, from the viewpoint of
faculty when assessing students’ digital efficacy in relation to their demographics (Bailey et al.,
2015; Scott-Clayton, 2011, 2012). The national telecommunications and information
administration’s (NTIA) broadband technology opportunities program (BTOP) publishes details
and statistical information regarding broadband access and sustainability statewide. Smith (2010)
alludes to Pew Research Center surveys, which ask the public about its attitudes and access to
broadband, and reported that as of May 2010, 66 percent of Americans have high-speed
connections. Some segments of the population are still not part of that group, where ScottClayton’s (2011, 2012) corroborates earlier findings, and Bailey et al.’s (2015) most current

81

evidence. Similarly, Carmichael, McClure, Mandel, and Mardis (2012) continue research into
broadband sustainability, metric assessment, and people’s perceptions that rural libraries,
schools, colleges, and training institutes became central technology hubs as community anchor
institutes (CAI), providing sustained public broadband access. These CAI’s provide a truer
picture of the most reliable data on broadband penetration (Carmichael et al., 2012). In 2011 and
at the national level, the University Corporation for Advanced Internet development (UCAID),
known as Internet2, began the upgrade of advanced broadband technology access to extend
across 50 states. The upgraded network will enable high-speed broadband connectivity for up to
121,000 additional CAIs. The project plan is to connect across all disciplines into virtual
communities with shared goals and objectives, including colleges, universities, and libraries
(http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/grantee/ university-corporation-for-advanced-internet-development).
Consistent, high-speed broadband access is a component of digital technology, where the
Internet supports the spectrum of digital programs.
In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided a combination
of broadband grants and loans, with priority given to underserved rural areas. The national
telecommunications and information administration (NTIA) appropriated 4.7 billion in funding
for the Broadband Data Improvement Act (P. L. 110-385) to overcome the digital divide among
sectors of society. Kruger and Gilroy (2013) argue that the definition of the term broadband
access characterizes a gap among people who have information access. The difference between
these sectors is known as the haves and have-nots regarding digital broadband information
technology, primarily because rural and low-income areas do not have access to high-speed
Internet that is broadband technology (Kruger & Gilroy, 2013).

The Rural Telecommunications Congress with the NTIA (2012) web resources, in
connection with the West Virginia Office of Telework Promotion and Broadband Access as a
partner, the West Virginia statewide broadband infrastructure project intends to spur affordable
broadband service by allowing local Internet service providers to connect to the project's open
network. In 2013, 17 community colleges and 19 other higher institutions of education were
connected to broadband access (http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/grantees/WestVA). A statement from
the director of comprehensive community infrastructure for NTIA’s broadband technology
opportunities program (BTOP) commented that in southern West Virginia, McDowell County
was able to use high-speed Internet connections for education services. The NTIA West Virginia
broadband grant helps fund establishment of continuing BTOP connectivity
(http://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2013/broadband-expanding-possibilities-students-west-virginiaand-nation).
Community college digital technology and information literacy inclusion. In the
United States, community college programs are divided between student instructional
preparation for further education and career/technical education through hands-on vocation. IL
literature offers an outline of the vocational/technical IL programs found in community college
libraries. Bird et al. (2012) recommend reassessing the importance assigned to career technical
education (CTE) curricula and inclusion of tailored vocational IL programs. The study explores
what is meant by informational need; recognizing when one’s knowledge is insufficient to fulfill
a particular activity is central to IL, described first in information practices in business by
Zurkowski (1974). The study suggests that information behavior is the interaction between
information need and the environment or context of a user (Bird et al., 2012). IL standards from
ALA and ACRL emphasize critical thinking (Association of College and Research Libraries,

83

2000; Digital Literacy Task Force, 2013). Bird et al. (2012) reemphasize that the need for
information technology skills have been identified in many types of professions, but little
research exists regarding factors of vocational curricula, especially in a vocational workplace
context since individually, traditional IL skills might appear inapplicable to those vocations.
Understanding community college CTE programs, with unique student demographics, to develop
new ways of thinking about IL and with relative value for vocational professions is challenging
(Bird et al., 2012). The study also explains state-of-the-art practices for contemporary
community college librarians (Bird et al., 2012, p. 24). A survey was employed with open-ended
responses and questions designed to differentiate IL in vocational/technical programs and IL in
college-preparatory/transfer programs. Responses illustrate that instructors must determine
whether there is an IL need, and the tendency for IL program elements to be customized to
instructor requirements and student needs. Vocational technology programs do not ask for library
instruction, assuming students receive IL in general education classes. Bird et al. (2012) argues
that IL is a set of skills that is learned, without consideration of context, suggesting a
misinterpretation of IL and that vocational instructors from industry lack an IL concept. A
further barrier to collaboration in IL instruction is instructors’ adjunct or part-time statuses (Bird
et al., 2012). The study also identifies that vocational faculty members do not necessarily
consider information-seeking a part of learning outcomes. They might be unaware of the
library’s modern electronic services, and perceive that information skills should not be integrated
into the curricula of individual disciplines.
Bird et al. (2012) advocate context-sensitive IL instruction relevant to the modern
workplace, during which librarians are introduced to modern workplace technology IL needs,
and useful redesign of IL and core curricula should be established. Bruce et al. (2006), Kuhlthau

84

(2008), Lloyd (2010), and Bird et al. (2012) indicate that more research is needed to understand
best practices to facilitate future collaborations in the complex landscape of part-time and
adjunct instructors at community colleges. It is also essential to study faculty and librarians to
promote lifelong IL and recognize the bigger IL picture that Bruce et al. (2006), Lloyd (2010),
Kuhlthau (2008) and other IL researchers describe. The present challenge is DIL that
incorporates AT because as Wesch (2011, 2014) and Swanson (2010) demonstrate, digital
literacy is becoming the new norm, and earlier, Bates (2000) cited that faculty must overcome
their DL inertia and adopt new AT (Swanson, 2010; Wesch, 2011, 2014).
Integrating digital literacy with pedagogy into community college. Addressing DL
adoption with AT integration at community colleges, Moser (2007) explains that there are
critical phases involved during DL adoption —understanding the implications for faculty
investment in curricula development using AT applications. Mosley (2010) argues that the
institution provides an environment that fosters DL technology, and a faculty educational
technology adoption cycle. There is consensus across scholarly literature regarding the transience
of technology, which influences faculty DL adoption and the uses of AT as part of pedagogy,
thus, institutions need to be cognizant of the implications, documented in the New Media
Consortium 2015 Horizon Report (Johnson, Adams Becker, Estrada, & Freeman, 2015). LindervanBerschot and Summers (2015) explore implications of technology transience on instructional
design. The study provides examples of programs, assuming a purposeful approach to creating
DL quality levels with AT in online learning opportunities, and recognizing myriad issues that
arise with the transience of technology. The study explains the influence on quality, currency,
and effectiveness during design of learning experiences that need to be considered in a
relationship with the ways technology changes the learning environment, especially when

85

making recommendations for practices and standards for instructional designers to work with
faculty in the challenge of DL inclusion in pedagogy (Linder-vanBerschot & Summers, 2015).
One issue is that institutions do not have easy access to instructional designers for AT support.
In the United States, typically community and technical college faculty are characterized
as having full teaching loads, lacking teaching/clerical support, involved in community service,
and having regular business and industry relationships (Cardwell-Hampton, 2008). In addition,
the study examines faculty attitudes toward incorporation of technology generally, and with
specific applications, including perceptions of the status of technology support and services, and
perceived barriers to technology use. The study used an online survey to gather data, focused on
predictor variables such as faculty gender, age, professional status, years of experience, tenure,
and degree of technology use/confidence (Cardwell-Hampton, 2008). While Mosley (2010)
acknowledges that community college faculty, much like in other institutions of higher
education, are pressured to respond to students’ expectations of technology incorporation, and
adapt instruction methods accordingly.
Butler & Sellbom (2002) stated a main barrier to the adoption of AT is that certain
faculty members believe technology is worthless (p.26), whereas Wallace (2004) argues that
faculty and instructors overcome the misconceptions of DL and AT convenience, prestige, and
satisfaction (p. 29). Hence, for faculty members to integrate technology, they should have
proficiency and confidence with use, and find value in time invested developing greater
technology inclusion in their teaching discipline methods (Bertrand, 2010; Cardwell-Hampton,
2008). Cardwell-Hampton (2008) argues that for institutions to overcome faculty barriers and
make changes, implementation of new strategies requires broad, collaborative involvement of all
stakeholders when there is absence of conclusive data. The benefits of new, best strategies have a

86

progressive influence, altering the way faculty teach and students learn (Cardwell-Hampton,
2008).
Hardcastle (2008) clarifies that for technology effectiveness and training, the priority
should include electronic content, assessment, and communication tools, an efficient source of
training includes self-taught/self-study methods since faculty do not believe they have adequate
technical support to use technology during teaching; additional training for teaching and learning
technology is necessary. Also, faculty primarily become aware of technology from fellow
instructors as significant resources, that professional conferences and workshops are another
avenue, and college IT departments, college librarians, and instructional designers, making them
more technology aware. Accordingly, demonstrating that faculty attitudes toward the benefits of
technology are positive in that use of technology increases student learning, and reports that only
nine percent of faculty members believe technology diminishes their roles in a student’s
education—very different findings to prior studies that intimated that a majority of faculty
perceptions were unfavorable toward AT Hardcastle (2008). However, faculty agree that
technology inclusion in a curriculum and teaching model requires additional time and effort to
expand use of technology. Student expectations motivate them to learn more about instructional
technologies. Faculty focus-group comments clarify some survey comments, and identify
underlying challenges such as opportunities for future use of teaching and learning technologies,
including institutional pressures to use technology, lack of faculty input, advanced needs of early
adopters, early adopters as trainers and mentors, effective tools and practices, assumptions
students have regarding technology skills, technology skills assessment, and developmental
technology courses (Hardcastle, 2008). These implications reveal how faculty learn about
teaching technologies and tools, their training preferences, and personal perspectives.

87

Hardcastle (2008) reports that many educators, faculty, and instructors perceive that
college classrooms are underequipped and lack proper hardware and software infrastructures
necessary for technology use. Faculty commented on the critical value of peer-to-peer networks.
Most instructors reported that they lacked sufficient training opportunities, and the need for more
training and time to use technology. They also reported inadequate allowance of time or
technical support for practice to apply new technologies in courses, and institutions should
leverage the experiences of effective, technology-use faculty members to share and train across
departments and the institution (Hardcastle, 2008).
While exploring community college faculty perceptions of student outcome contributions
to the subject matter, to recognition of similarities or differences among various paradigms,
which is paramount to gaining an understanding of the paradigmatic faculty perceptions (Fruge
& Ropers-Huilman, 2008). Regarding diversity of faculty that credentials and majors offer,
faculty tend to follow self-classifications along the paradigmatic continuum. The implication of
student outcomes refers to both cognitive (i.e., intellectual growth) and non-cognitive (i.e.,
social, emotional, and cultural development) outcomes. Equally important is that findings
highlight issues associated with cross-discipline curriculum policies since faculty perceptions are
often reflected and relevant during institutional accreditation. Further research should be
conducted on paradigmatic differences, and extended to four-year colleges and universities, as a
tool to explore effects of classroom instruction, student experiences, and educational outcomes
(Royal, Eli, & Bradley, 2010). During the last decade, studies from Babson Survey Research
Group, ECAR, Lumina Foundation, and Gates Foundation of faculty perceptions of digital
technology self-efficacy and inclusion reinforce Hardcastle (2008) and Royal et al.’s (2010)
findings (Allen, Seaman, Lederman, & Jaschik, 2012, June; Allen, Seaman, Lederman, &

88

Jaschik, 2012, August; Dahlstrom, & Brooks, 2014; Jaschik, & Lederman, 2014; Moran,
Seaman, & Tinti-Kane, 2012; Seaman, 2009; Seaman & Tinti-Kane, 2012).
An important aspect of contemporary teaching and learning is technological innovation,
exploring faculty attitudes toward use of technology in the classroom at each university. Marzilli
et al. (2014) assess technology in higher education and IL using a mixed-methods study of a
faculty-developed, electronic survey, the purpose of which was to develop a community of
practice to improve education built on a faculty-led initiatives. Those unfamiliar with this school
of thought might be interested in learning from Marzilli et al.’s (2014) findings that faculties’
primary barriers are summarized by perceiving digital technology as a distraction, lack of DL
knowledge regarding technology for faculty and students, insufficient resources, and unreliable
hardware or software platforms. Faculty also mentioned other challenges concerning
administrator and student pressures to include DL, which compound problems when coupled
with outdated, legacy platforms and tools. Marzilli et al. (2014) suggests that technology
pervasiveness will increase, contrasting with faculty perceptions of the future of technology in
higher education. Further developments of hybrid formats, online learning, and better use of
technology to prepare students for the workplace will also occur. Faculty expressed concerns
about losing full-time employment statuses under the new model of education. These findings
both corroborate and contradict extant research. The future of technology is promising since
mobile learning is an emerging theme, making education available anytime and anywhere. One
concern for faculty is that technology diminishes the humanistic perspective in education
(Marzilli et al., 2014). Morrison-Garcia (2011), Mitchell (2012), and Bucker and Kim (2014)
expect IL integration in teaching since contemporary students have spent much of their lives
surrounded by digital technologies, and thus these technologies, with portable online

89

connectivity, challenge educators to be on par with students. These topics were noted by
Swanson (2010) and Wesch (2011, 2014), and reaffirmed by Hennefer (2013) and Meland's
(2014) current cyberactivism research.
In reference to Kuzweil’s (2011) prediction that the world is fast approaching a
technology tipping point Poushter, Bell, and Oates’s (2015) study by the Pew Research Center
(PRC) reports that 60 percent of experts and stakeholders forecast that by 2020, there will be an
innovative technology shift that will occur in higher education. PRC research into global, public
perceptions suggests that the Internet is having a positive influence on education, but a negative
influence on the morality of its users’ society. The most common users of digital and virtual
information, and the Internet, are young, well-educated English speakers (Poushter et al., 2015).
Hargittai (2010) notes that there is a wide range in a person’s computer proficiency, and online
skills, among students. Dependent factors include students’ socioeconomic backgrounds,
personal technology self-efficacy, digital technology, access, and innovativeness (Hargittai,
2010).
When discussing twenty-first-century environments and ecosystems, one aspect most
scholars agree on is that students require multiple skills for lifelong success, including access and
completion of postsecondary credentials and critical thinking. Research demonstrates that
students learn better when designing education by steering content and accessibility to their
needs and goals, particularly when they receive real-time feedback. Another topic regarding DL
inclusion is the controversial issue of how effective education technologies are when faculty
personalize subject content learning, thereby tailoring and personalizing student learning, and
thus enhancing student achievement (Badke, 2012; Kulthau, 2004; Swanson, 2010; Wesch, 2011,
2014).

90

A Lumina Foundation (2014) study used faculty focus groups (N=55), during which
subjects discussed faculty use of online and blended/hybrid teaching tools and methodologies.
Participants were largely early adopters of technology, and thus were not representative of all
faculty. Nearly 87 percent of participants taught online courses, and nearly half taught using a
blended or hybrid format. The majority of participants were non-tenured (slightly over 80
percent), and only 19 percent were on a tenure track, with a spread across disciplines (Luma
Consulting, 2014). Primary attention was on student success, and knowing how to respond to the
needs and constraints of the new, traditional student. The power of technology tools for
instruction that enhance student learning, and the overall belief that current postsecondary
systems need to change from traditional models, were common themes. Given guidance and
assistance, faculty members, combined with institutional support, offer personalized learning to
students, and the potential of open-access education (Luma Consulting, 2014).
The study’s focus groups highlighted advantages and disadvantages of faculty adoption
of online learning, identifying barriers such as time and commitment to keep up with changing
technology. Faculty workload, lack of time, and inconsistent training were also reported.
Development and support of online and hybrid courses, and academic administration’s
misconceptions of what is needed to establish an online class, were also part of the discussions.
Also of concern were students’ misconceptions of their self-efficacy and the commitment needed
for online learning success. Faculty members are agentic as proactive change agents, and are
champions when promoting use of online tools among faculty (Luma Consulting, 2014).
Bucker and Kim (2014) contend that studies on educational technology inclusion and
reform should continue because more AT (i.e., software and hardware) in the classroom does not
ensure bridging the digital divide. Their research suggests that incorporation of advanced ICT in

91

the classrooms is problematic. The Stanford mobile inquiry-based learning environment
(SMILE) was developed to study AT inclusion, a framework of inquiry-based pedagogy and
integration of ICT technology in the classroom, particularly in rural contexts. A review of
findings from a series of SMILE and program effectiveness studies demonstrates that the
challenge of inquiry-based pedagogy is how to engage students in questioning content and
context of information. Questioning information while reading is core to inquiry-based learning
since students learn meta-cognitive skills, and focusing on students’ abilities to evaluate sources
and monitoring their comprehension are paramount (Bucker & Kim, 2014). Findings suggest that
the SMILE program is beneficial regarding promotion of student information questioning and
enhancement of student-teacher dynamics. However, SMILE success is influenced by the
school’s/country’s pedagogical context. Use of such constructivist teaching methods that
introduce students to learning by discovery and participation involves a proactive approach on
the part of both teacher and student. A programming framework designed in a technologyintegrated and developed educational environment cannot necessarily be integrated to develop
educational environments without contextualization. Thus, Bucker and Kim (2014) recommend
further research with programming framework at all educational levels—primary, secondary, and
postsecondary—and in urban and rural environments. Using samples from both the United States
and abroad, assessing the effectiveness of long-term SMILE interventions would offer
conclusive findings (Bucker & Kim, 2014).
In another study, U.S. Post-secondary Faculty in 2015: Diversity in People, Goals, and
Methods (Gates Foundation, 2015), McGoldrick et al. (2015) survey two- and four-year
institutional faculty members, suggesting innovation is creating a new wave of teaching.
Findings suggest that of 3,971 faculty responses, at least 40 percent expressed interest in

92

innovative digital technology, but only 20 percent were using some form of digital technology.
The most modern digital technology format was a flipped classroom, where 29 percent used the
form and another 27 percent reported that they included free, open-course digital content, a
model advocated by Eric Mazur at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 1992
(McGoldrick et al., 2015). McGoldrick et al. (2015) highlight that an important aspect of the
study was identifying hidden factors that encourage faculty to change. Postsecondary faculty
pedagogy guided their beliefs and attitudes, influencing local pedagogical decisions that
influence student learning outcomes. Adoption of digital technology is occurring erratically
across the higher education community. When faculty decide to alter their course delivery
format, they must believe that the change will benefit student learning goals and outcomes.
Faculty from two-year institutions were particularly interested in the application of theory in real
practice, mastering knowledge, and prerequisites needed for a discipline, and knowing how to
synthesize, organize, and analyze information and ideas into new, more-complex relationships
and interpretations (McGoldrick et al., 2015).
In many instances, peer-to-peer faculty support indicates whether they try the new digital
technology. Therefore, a major determinant of faculty perspectives on digital teaching
technology relates to opinions about colleague interactions, how they view their students and
themselves, and interrelations among these factors. Hence, relationships among these factors are
where barriers do occur, especially if time, training, and technology support are limited
(McGoldrick et al., 2015). McGoldrick et al. (2015) address faculty beliefs about digital
pedagogy, faculty/librarian methods of pedagogy concerning high-tech teaching, and why more
study is needed. Johnson, Adams Becker, Estrada, and Freeman’s (2015), Horizon report on
higher-education edition, cited a statement from panel experts, who believe significant

93

challenges are impending regarding DL adoption in universities and colleges. No longer do
traditional approaches support student learning outcomes. Similar to Bertrand (2010), New
Media Consortia experts criticized traditional teaching approaches, citing that they stifle
learning, and instead recommend a blended formal and informal DL learning environment. The
report also indicates that institutions need to improve digital literacy and develop student
personalized digital learning environments. An example includes virtual digital learning
commons that incorporate Web 2.0, found in many large university libraries (Johnson et al.,
2015).
The platform and format of much contemporary information production are presented
and guided by a digital medium. McGoldrick et al. (2015) provide a broad picture of two- and
four-year faculty opinions on types of digital teaching modalities and tools. The study suggests
the prominence of digital technology inclusion in educational programs and processes, but does
not explain the learning influence or DIL literacy benefits, nor does the study explore why twoyear faculty members choose not to incorporate digital technology (McGoldrick et al., 2015).
Is IL, and by extension DIL, limited to a single subject or discipline? Bruce et al. (2006),
Kulthau (2004), and Badke (2012) argue that the inception of IL to the new birth of DIL involves
actions of working with information, and that the context of information relates to its inquiry. In
turn is the ability to navigate AT with self-efficacy as part of the IR and ISP process (Kulthau,
1991, 2004), where ACRL (2000) standards explain that to be information literate, a person
determines a need, find and access information, understand it, and evaluate it, and then
synthesize and use it appropriately. Therefore, DIL can be applied universally to any subject or
discipline because IL incorporates information comprehension and critical thinking. DIL is the
digital bridge to finding and learning more about a topic. IL is commonly incorporated in general

94

education and English instruction, but has also expanded into humanities curricula; when a
faculty member assigns a research assignment or project, DIL research is required and involved.
Digital information literacy and the humanities. Bruce et al. (2006), Kuhlthau (2007),
and Head (2008) suggest that although IL is universal, DIL is ambiguous because IL is the
primary concept term and DIL is the new, digital literacy subtopic. Head (2008) explains that
faculty in the humanities and social sciences consider a research process involving knowledge of
the discipline through acculturation, and that information research is nonlinear. Conversely,
when students are new to a field, they have limited exposure, which derives from class texts and
lectures. The students are unfamiliar with the ambiguity and nonlinear aspects of research, and
are hampered by fixed cognitive development. Hence, DIL interjection and embedded support
redirects and enhances student research. Through active learning assignments, students expand
their cognitive abilities and overcome anxiety, gaining non-cognitive confidence with practical
familiarity of digital tools. Thus, they engage in a hybrid approach to research, in which faculty
and librarians collaborate to emphasize IL with a DIL module as part of the course (Head, 2008).
Head’s (2008) study of humanities and social-science majors’ information-seeking
behaviors examines how students conceptualize and operationalize course-related research.
Contrary to library literature of the time, which suggested a paucity of IL competencies, results
suggest that students interact with library resources, primarily electronic resources, through
library webpages. The assessment showed that students experience difficulties with determining
the extent and nature of the information they needed for a research assignment. Through selfreported responses, the students commented that they became aware of their research issues, and
learned how to achieve success by engaging in a hybrid research approach. The students
leveraged librarians and digital technologies to overcome IL limitations and achieve DIL

95

competencies within course requirements (Head, 2008). Within the humanities, general
education courses form the foundation of a common learning experience for all students.
Rockman (2004) suggests that IL inclusion bridges gaps across discipline boundaries (Rockman,
2004). Ragains (2006) expands on the idea that IL should be taught beyond general education
courses; incorporation of IL in disciplines provides students the ability to develop in-depth
subject knowledge, think critically, and act creatively (Ragains, 2006).
Clement (2012a), Baran (2013), and Lea (2013) argue that contemporary AT, and the
modern form of digital literacy, is now recognized as multimodality, which incorporates a
combination of the traditional, standard, lecture-style format and material, digital resources from
the Internet, LMS and online class programs, and other digital media. Clement (2012a) criticizes
the multimodality theory, where educators and faculty use a combination of digital technology
formats. Combined DL information instruction includes limitations, in part because of
traditional, conservative ideologies related to student learning outcomes, which are demonstrated
by either the institution or educator/faculty perceptions and forms of pedagogy. The traditional,
standard, lecture-style format does not automatically or naturally transpose into a digital medium
(Clement, 2012b).
Jumonville (2014) reiterates that using IL is a much better low-stakes introduction to the
digital information format, where students learn and grasp the basics of database searches,
avoiding plagiarism and thinking critically. Since the innovation of information, production is
spurred by electronic information creation, search, and retrieval. There is a debate among faculty
about the role of teaching and learning in the humanities (e.g., English, history, introductory
sciences, psychology, sociology, etc.), not to be confused the digital humanities (Jumonville,
2014).

96

Why Digital Information Literacy is a Challenge in the Digital Literacy Environment?
Information literacy in literacy in higher education. Researchers argue that the
definition of IL is complex given the ambiguous nature of IL inception and development that
exists (Bruce et al., 2006; Gross & Latham, 2007; Huvila, 2011; Lloyd, 2010; Rockman, 2004;
Seymour, 2012). Beetham and Sharpe (2013) and Sipple and Lightner (2013) recognize that IL
draws a parallel interpretive meaning, synonymous with the ubiquitous terminology for elearning and virtual technology. However, Covello (2010) considers IL as having a symbiotic
relationship with digital literacy as an element of ICT.
From the beginning, recognition and establishment of IL were conceptualized as an
information-learning concept, or a literacy process. IL was originally misinterpreted as an ICT
program (Badke, 2012; Belshaw, 2013; Zurkowski, 1974). Such ambiguity is due in part to
overlap between the traditional meaning of IL and the new counterpart DIL. The American
Library Association (ALA) and the Association of Colleges and Research Libraries (ACRL)
established standards for IL in 2000, and revised them in 2014 (Association of College and
Research Libraries, 2000). Also, in the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institute of Librarians
and Information Professionals (CILIP) developed standards. The Australian and New Zealand
Information Literacy (ANZIL) provided direction and guidance for IL, and the International
Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) released statements on IL and
lifelong learning, stressing the value and importance of IL (International Federation of Library
Associations, 2005). The overarching organization that guides best practices with global, IL
education policy comes from the central body of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (IFLA, 2005). Many of these policies and standards are being

97

promulgated out of necessity to both innovate and update educational pedagogy and practice to
align with technology influences on traditional paradigms.
Wiener and Jackman (2010) argue that a review of IL definitions and standards,
established in America by ALA and ACRL (2000) and internationally by Bruce et al. (2006) and
Kuhlthau (2004, 2007), suggests no consensus. IL’s underlying core values include knowing the
need for, being able to find, evaluating and synthesizing, assimilating, and understanding ethical
issues surrounding information. However, Bruce et al. (2006), and Wiener and Jackman (2010)
contend that through IL instruction, those issues and disadvantages are addressed. Ramaswami
(2009), Bruce and Hughes (2010), and Belshaw (2012) state that IL incorporates both a person
learning the skills that represent computer fluency and the ability to comprehend information in
the form of DL. Constant increasing advances in digital technology mean a person continually
needs to learn to know how to operate such technology. So much of information production and
processing is now digitally based that DIL is the new norm (Belshaw, 2012; Bruce & Hughes,
2010; Ramaswami, 2009).
Research brings the relevance of IL to the foreground of education policy and pedagogy
discussions in higher education. Head and Eisenberg’s (2009) Project Information Literacy (PIL)
program conducted a series of national studies. PIL is the first study to examine what causes
students to continue to struggle with conducting course-study and supplementary, everyday-life
research using academic and digital technology from a student’s viewpoint. Eisenberg (2003,
2008) suggests that secondary students have not had IL instruction; students’ search methods
take on the form of a laundry-list approach. The student is shown the how of IL basic skills, but
not the when and why. IL is necessary during the entire information search process (ISP), which
Kuhlthau (1991, 2004) identifies as dual interaction elements of information retrieval IR and IL,

98

stressing that metacognition represents a student’s understanding of thought processes. More
important is that all college freshmen study IL and receive practical application instruction
(Eisenberg, 2003, 2008). Head (2013) and Dubicki (2013) reiterate that PIL findings accord with
an earlier study from Ethnographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries (ERAIL), which
suggests students experience difficulties with all aspects of the search process and electronic
resources because they rely on Google for most of their searches. Survey data from students’
personal IL perceptions of self-efficacy are useful tools for instruction librarians and faculty to
find more efficient ways of teaching IL and critical literacy skills (Dubicki, 2013; Head, 2013).
Dubicki (2013) examines community-college faculty and librarian (liaison) contexts.
Recommendations include how faculty and librarians create informed and educated citizenry,
and how to help faculty, librarians (liaisons), and students meet digital technological, economic,
and social challenges (Head 2013).
A report from the Office for Information Technology Policy, ALA Digital Literacy Task
Force (2013) is a review of IL updates, and expands IL standards and outcomes to include higher
degrees of digital technology inclusion in higher education for more advanced instruction. In
light of new knowledge about learning, two questions are asked: are librarians expected to teach
digital research skills, and should librarians be adept at using all multimedia software and online
applications (Digital Literacy Task Force, 2013)? Cordell (2013) discusses that these standards
are attainable goals as benchmarks that IL programs are expected to reach. Thus, a revision of IL
standards should facilitate conversations with institutional colleagues, not simply leave it to
librarians to acquire new technological skills to support new demands of digital literacy learning
(Cordell, 2013).

Defining information literacy as a phenomenon. From America (Badke, 2012;
Swanson, 2010), Europe (Belshaw, 2012; Kerr, 2012), and Australia (Bruce, 2002; Hughes,
Middleton, Edwards, Bruce & McAllister 2005), IL is a global concern. Zurkowski (1974) and
IL researchers of the new millennium, Bruce (2000), Hughes, Middleton, Edwards, Bruce and
McAllister (2005), Samuels (2007), Kuhlthau (2008), Swanson, 2010, Badke (2012), and Kerr
(2012), explain IL in a broader domain, telegraphing IL history and evolution, and IL
fundamentals. Where the characteristics of adoption of key IL concepts have been usurped by
DL (Badke, 2012; Kerr, 2012; Kuhlthau, 2008; Rader, 2002; Samuels, 2007; Swanson, 2010;
Zurkowski, 1974). Belshaw (2012) and Mitchell (2012) argue that IL evolved into DIL. Bucker
and Kim (2014), Bird et al. (2012), Beetham and Sharpe (2013), and Cope and Sanabria (2014)
argue that explanations for the development of relational approaches and framework tactics, and
research focusing on emerging IL directions and digital literacy, inclusive of DIL, are needed.
Hughes et al. (2005) offered a relational approach to understanding IL developed from the
research methodology of phenomenography; the “outcome of phenomenagraphic research is the
identification of the different ways people experience a phenomenon, the structural relationships
between these alternative ways of experiencing and expressed as a finite set of categories, such
as Seven Faces model for IL” (Hughes et al., 2005, p. 11). Bruce (2004) posits, “IL is an
integral- part of learning where students learn to learn from available resources of thisinformation-rich ‘digital’ environment; IL should be totally inclusive of the learning experience”
(p. 3).
Zurkowski (1974) made the initial comment that traditional demarcations among formal
learning environments, workplace contexts, and community settings are increasingly blurring.
Therefore, the relational approach, as a form of informed learning, expanded into a variety of

100

new disciplines, originating from educational research, in which researchers use categorical
meta-tags to label and define people’s experiences. Bruce et al. (2006) and Lupton (2008) use the
seven faces of IL matrix, developed in 1997, which describes the experiential categories of the
fundamental, relational approach. Providing better understanding of educators’ various methods
of IL education, the six frames model presents a research-based framework that suggests (IL)
“learning occurs when variation in ways of understanding or experiencing are discerned” (Bruce
et al., 2006, p. 6), identified as variation theory. Lupton and Bruce (2010) comment an
alternative way of approaching IL from a literacy perspective is through three nested windows,
reframing them as the generic, situated, and transformative learning (GeSt) windows model
instrument developed by Lupton and Bruce (2010). These approaches play a role in informed
learning, identifying three perspectives of IL as: (1) Sequential; gather information and retain
information learning later, separating information and learning; (2) cyclical; gather information
to learn from it, repeating the process as needed, and then maintain and organize separation
between information and learning from it; and (3) simultaneous; learn from information as you
interact with it during the gathering and experience process; as a subset of IL, the informedlearning phenomenon focuses on use of information and learning simultaneously (Lupton &
Bruce, 2010).
Diehm and Lupton (2012) and Maybee, Bruce, Lupton, and Rebmann (2013) disclose
that developments in the phenomenographic approach are matched with informed learning; the
model considers informed learning in the university classroom by assessing the experiences of
using the information to learn as part of an informed-learning agenda. Recommendations from
Maybee et al. (2013) suggest that learning studies are a positive direction for phenomenographic
research since learning studies explore what is effective when encouraging learning. The legacy

101

of traditional learning models, with skills and attributes developed by experts and shared with
learners, is changing (Maybee et al., 2013). Gunton, Bruce, and Davis (2014) suggest that
contrasting the relational approach with IL education suggests that the relationship is between
learner and instructor, and at the same time, the teacher learns from the learner’s experiences
during instruction. Teaching represents a sharing of information and knowledge as a
multidirectional experience. Learning is experienced as an iterative sharing of information and
skills, and the experience occurs when educators and learners contribute to the mapping of what
to learn and how to learn it (Gunton et al., 2015).
In conclusion. The primary challenge of DL adoption and inclusion is influenced by a
combination of factors. Elements of the challenges vary considerably, depending on the
environment of the institution; urban and rural institutions have their own particular issues
pertaining to DL inclusion, from technology self-efficacy to broad arrays of degrees of AT
access, training, and support provided by an institution. The extent of faculty, librarian, and
personnel technology self-efficacy with AT instructional pedagogy determines the extent of DL
adoption. Although best practices and standards guide institutions, issues that comprise the
challenges are often unique to an institution due to diverse constituents and their particular
needs. For example, another misconception surrounding the argument of DL capability and
inclusion versus lack of DL adoption is the possibility that generation X, Y and Z might have
innate academic technological ability. Research from rural institutions suggests that a person’s
environment, educational heritage, socio-demographics, and epistemology play a role in how
acculturation and assimilation might occur with confidence into a digital ecology. Hence, more
research is needed in rural community colleges to identify the challenges faculty and librarians
face, from the perspectives of faculty and librarians, as educators with direct links to students,

102

and to understand student issues with DL that include possible barriers to AT. The significance
of this study is to show that faculty are not opposed to using DL adoption to improve curriculum
content, and that through collaboration with librarians, a way might be found to make faculty AT
resources for DL inclusion easier to discover. Therefore, making students’ digitally competent in
using DIL to improve the learning outcomes is possible.

CHAPTER III
Methods
Rationale for Qualitative Research
Regardless of the types of technologies faculty do or do not use, what is important is the
faculty’s epistemological concern for DL and DIL academic technologies developments to their
subject matter. Epistemology is a person’s perceived attitudes of learning understanding, and
epistemological congruency (EC) refers to the sharing of beliefs (Fruge and Ropers-Huilman,
2008), in this case, the concept of the DIL paradigm, with its relevance to faculty disciplines and
purpose in conjunction with student learning objectives and outcomes. Creswell (1998) argues
that the essence of qualitative research “is an inquiry process of understanding a social or human
problem, based on building a complex, holistic picture, formed with words, reporting detailed
views of informants, and conducted in a natural setting” (Creswell, 1998, p. 1). For the purpose
of this study, a qualitative approach is applied because of the abstract human perceptions
involved. The researcher seeks to understand the meaning of participants’ (i.e., faculty and
librarians) actions, or lack thereof, and the experiences of the individuals regarding a
phenomenon (Creswell, 1998). The study is an exploratory, phenomenological examination that
centers on concepts surrounding faculty DL affect (i.e., perceptions) and faculty understanding
of inclusion of DIL in pedagogy.
Conducting studies on DIL, Bruce et al. (2006), Head & Eisenberg (2009), Abbitt (2011),
and Shommer-Aikins and Easter (2015) agree that a socially constructed research method is
appropriate. The research questions are based on people’s beliefs and perceptions, not solely the
self-efficacy of technology skills (Abbitt, 2011; Bruce et al., 2006; Head & Eisenberg, 2009;
Shommer-Aikins and Easter, 2015). Denzin and Lincoln (2005, p. 40) discuss many

104

methodological practices of qualitative research, during which the researcher is a person who
assembles multiple images, bringing the pieces together in a patchwork montage of a real life
situation. Similarly, Carter and Little (2007) argue that the qualitative research method of
gathering data uses descriptive textual data rather than pure empirical evidence. Analysis of data
in the textual form views the natural occurrences of the phenomenon under investigation, instead
of changing data into an empirical results format—the interconnected, direct relationships of a
research design (i.e., methodology) among the epistemology, method, data, and analysis
justifications. Data evaluations become the basis of new knowledge, shown in figure 12 (Carter
& Little, 2007).

Figure 12. Carter and Little’s (2007, p. 1317) epistemologies, methodologies, and methods.
Kuhn’s (1970) theory suggests that learning proceeds according to a person’s paradigm—
the theoretical framework—and is useful because it elucidates a problem issue. Such progress
occurs in scientific theories as they become more articulated so they are matched with the nature
of the action and environment. From characteristic data observed and gathered, the puzzle of
their interactive influences can be solved (Kuhn, 1970). Denzin and Lincoln (2005) argue that

105

the qualitative method of data collection incorporates human interactions. The data themselves
have deep, personal, descriptive content; the research method is not what instrument to use, but
which combination of tools might be used to gain sufficient depth of understanding to form
provisional impressions of participants’ epistemology (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005)
The Qualitative Tradition
The focus of phenomenology is the description of an experience. During discussions of
phenomenological study, Moustakas (1994) and the Patton (2002) explain that the research
focuses on the nature and meaning of a person’s experiences, and phenomenology is the
description of those experience. Descriptions reveal hidden meanings or patterns, and show what
appears within the experience of the research phenomenon. To obtain the description of a
phenomenon, questions are asked and the answers recorded (Moustakas, 1994; Patton, 2002).
Both Creswell (2009) and Willis (2007) argue that the phenomenographic method enables the
researcher to distinguish from analysis data collected and the description of the experience under
review; “phenomenology (is) focused on the subjectivity of reality, continually pointing out the
need to understand how humans view themselves and the world around them” (Willis, 2007, p.
53). Creswell’s (2009) description of phenomenological research aligns with Bandura’s (1989)
triadic reciprocal determinism model. Patton (2002) suggests that phenomenological research is
rooted in philosophy, anthropology, and sociology. Moustakas (1994) discusses that during
phenomenographic investigations, researchers have personal interest and are likely to connect
with the phenomenon. Hays and Singh (2012) suggest that each perception begins with the
researcher’s sense of what is an issue or experience, and the relevant meaning attributed to it.

106

My Research Paradigm
As a practitioner/researcher, my perceptions of life are viewed through the lens of a
pragmatic constructivism concept (Lissack & Graber, 2014). I define my paradigm of pragmatic
constructivism as going beyond the practitioners’ basic epistemology. Each situation, the
interactions therein and the environment, require in-depth analysis and synthesis to capture the
essence and value of context or situation (Lissack & Graber, 2014). Including the researcher, the
members of the study are a heuristic group. An (analytical) heuristic framework normally asks
“who, what, when, where, and why.” A heuristic investigation employs independent discovery,
relying on common sense, creativity, and experiential learning (Merriam, 2009, p. 44). However,
Merriam (2009) argues that the method does not guarantee a solution to the problem. Therefore,
the study recognizes this heuristic concept while dealing with the complexities of individuality as
part of each of the environmentally dependent contexts (Merriam, 2009). Lissack and Graber
(2014) describe that going beyond the realist model, a pragmatic constructivist recognizes the
need for questioning the “what, who, and how much.” The baseline becomes modified, enabling
new evaluation of constraints, boundaries, and other possibilities in many interactive patterns by
autonomous and semi-autonomous agents. Applied modifications are grounded in the
researcher/observers’ understanding of the situation being studied that is influenced by the
participants and interactions they are observing (Lissack & Graber, 2014).
Information is a vital component of learning, coupled with the dynamic metamorphosis
of providing information from paper to digital technology; media are now at the core of
institutional and library mission strategies and resources. I was a librarian, information specialist,
and professional practitioner in the discipline of library science and knowledge management for
over twenty years, culminating to a point at which I now specialize in the Internet and instruction

107

of IL and DIL. Librarian-information specialists are situated at the foreground of information
management by digital technology in the contemporary library environment, serving incumbent
demand of providing IL, which has since progressed into DIL to a diverse cross-section of users.
Thus, the experience of constant engagement with educators, students, and the public,
nurturing their learning of IL and DIL comprehension, demonstrates my qualifications as a DIL
practitioner-subject expert.
Design
The design of the research model draws from Bandura’s (1989) triadic reciprocal
determinism as an example of a framework. The model incorporates social cognitive theory,
where a person’s behaviors, cognitions, and environments are interacting determinants that
mutually influence each other simultaneously (Figure 2, p. 13). Thus, an institution’s DL and
DIL practices and services naturally influence the faculty and librarians. What Bandura (1989)
identifies as environmental factors, and faculty and librarians’ personal and behavioral factors,
might be applied to a particular research area. In this study, it concerns discovering
epistemological beliefs and how they relate to DL and DIL of faculty, librarians, and institutional
characteristics, and perceptions and interconnections for the types of issues that influence all
three (Figure 13).

The purpose of this study explores faculty, librarian and administrators’ attitudes of
learning theory (i.e. epistemology) and digital literacy (DL) concepts of adoption with
instruction, while teaching and understanding incorporation of information literacy (IL) and
digital information literacy (DIL) at two-year community colleges. The logic model defines the
scope of work, and identifies relevant indicators and who study participants will be. The logic
model also provides a flow of information from data gathered, enabling the researcher to
evaluate and assess the data to offer recommendations, and show how expected deliverables
demonstrate intent, and the study’s validity and rigor. The logic model of this study outlines the
stages of discovery regarding how new ideologies and values are translated by faculty and
librarians to incorporate DL and DIL into teaching to improve student learning outcomes or
identify non-effective methodologies (Table 1).

Correlation does not imply causation, but by recognizing issues that participants
experience from identified indicators, the researcher explored those attributes for hidden effects
and interactive influences. To understand current issues of DL and DIL adoption and inclusion
into pedagogy, the table of specifications is a matrix that shows study participants’ environments
and attitudes (Table 2)—what develops from the start regarding incorporation of IL along the
continuum of the present state of DL and DIL in the institution and its methods or praxis. The

Shommer’s (1990) discussion of epistemology perceptions when discovering
epistemological beliefs is presented in three levels: (1) “Knowledge is simple rather than
complex” (i.e., simple knowledge), (2) “Knowledge is handed down by authority rather than
derived from reason” (i.e., omniscient authority), (3) “Knowledge is certain rather than tentative”

111

(i.e., certain knowledge), (4) “The ability to learn is innate rather than acquired” (i.e., innate
ability), and (5) “Learning is quick or not at all” (i.e., quick learning) (p. 499). Therefore, the
study explores faculty and librarians’ concepts and self-efficacy of DL and DIL. What are
community colleges’ AT standards and expectation of adoption? Are faculties’ DIL pedagogies
and epistemological perceptions congruent? The study considers that the transfer or achievement
of knowledge is both cognitive and non-cognitive (Table 2).
Cunha and Heckman (2008) define cognitive skills as the ability to understand, learn, and
remember, making thinking a learning and processing information activity, where non-cognitive
skills are defined as patterns of thoughts or behaviors that affect social interactions, equating to a
person’s perceptions and attitude. Findings suggest that non-cognitive skills foster and support
the formulation of cognitive skills, but the process does not operate in the reverse order.
Cognitive skills do not foster or promote non-cognitive skills. Based on Cunha and Heckman’s
(2008) arguments, a person’s DL concept comprehension does not mean they have DL selfefficacy with AT competency in pedagogy. Lea (2013) explains that learning technologies and
academic literacies are a contested space. Whereas Beetham, McGill, and Littlejohn (2009)
reports that technologists such as the Gates Foundation and Lumina Foundation advocate
learning technology benefits. Abbitt (2011) and Kim, Kim, Lee, Spector, and Demeester (2013)
find that teacher DL beliefs and technology integration differ individually; teachers’ and
educators’ fundamental concerns and methods of pedagogy (i.e., epistemology) are paramount to
student learning, regardless of technology use.
Design Instrument
The instruments of this study are a combination, with both directed and open-ended
research questions posed to community college faculty, library-librarians, and institutional

112

personnel. The questions are taken from Schommer’s epistemological belief index (EBI)
(Schommer-Aikins & Easter, 2009, Schommer-Aikins, Unruh, & Morphew, 2015). The
questions are framed to address directly faculty and librarians’ perspectives of the complex
nature of digital technology, and how it applied to DL and DIL pedagogy and the institution’s
DIL policies. Through investigation and learned understanding of the phenomenon, we examine
underlying influences (Hays & Singh, 2012). The framework of the research is the PRS model
shown in Figure 4, p.16, which is indicative of Bandura’s (1989) triadic reciprocal determinism
model because its strength is represented in social cognitive theory. The study is based on social
cognitive and non-cognitive perceptions between faculty and librarians’ DL adoption and
perceptions of DIL use interconnectivity and collaboration between these parties and the
community college as a continuum. The model suggests that a person’s behaviors, the
environment, and personal responses mutually influence each other. There is emphasis on the
person’s control of actions, also retains the authority to interact or not, so the individual defines
the degree of importance and progression (Bandura, 2001).
Focus
A variety of studies survey faculty at four- and two-year postsecondary institutions about
use of the newest digital tools, open educational resources (OER), and digital learning
technologies (Beetham & Sharpe, 2007, 2013). The studies ask whether participants use these
forms of new technology as part of their teaching tools. Although survey findings show some
inclusion of more than one type of AT being used, the percentage is not significant (Gates
Foundation, 2015; Lumina Foundation, 2014). Unclear is why faculty choose not to incorporate
DL as part of their pedagogy. In all studies, the objective of the surveys was to discover whether
faculty were using some form of AT to support their instruction, but did not specify whether that

113

use of AT was due to DL adoption. The frequency of the types of digital technology were being
used, but not the faculties’ epistemological concern for DL’s influence on their subject matter, or
the concept of DIL and its relevance to the discipline, in conjunction with student learning
outcomes.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of the study is to investigate through the lens of community college faculty
and librarians’ epistemological perceptions and perspectives of DL and DIL inclusion in
curricula.

1. How does epistemological perception bridge the connection between technology
skills and technology self-efficacy?
(a) What are Arts & Science faculties’ digital literacy (DL) epistemology (i.e. attitudes of
learning theory)?
i. What are faculties’ perceptions of the DL?
ii. When do faculty consider IL relevant to a course’s topic?
(b) What is the librarian’s/ library digital literacy (DL) epistemology (i.e. attitudes of
learning theory)?
i. What are community college librarians’ (library’s) DL perspectives?
ii. What are community college librarians’ (library’s) DIL instruction program?
(c) What are Arts & Science faculties’ concept of DIL?
i. How do faculty consider DIL relevant to a course’s topic?
ii. How might faculty & librarian DIL collaboration enhance student learning
outcomes?

114

The Research Objectives
1. Generate baseline data on the current degree of DL attitudes, adoption with self-efficacy,
and DIL provision for faculty, librarians, and community college personnel as non-active
faculty.
2. Develop recommendations for an exemplary organizational model and gap analysis, and
encourage a management approach to embed DIL into all academic programs.
Participants
The participants are faculty, librarians, and an administrator from a pair of community
colleges located in southwest Virginia and southern West Virginia, along the Central
Appalachian Plateau and known as part of the “Horseshoe” Virginia region. The study identifies
current degrees of DL adoption and individual self-efficacy used, what methods of DL with AT
tools are used, and how DL’s are incorporated into teaching DIL from the perspective of faculty
and librarians. The study also examines community colleges’ institutional DL policies, or at least
DL standards and procedures, pertaining to expectations of faculty and librarian DL inclusion in
teaching.
Sampling Logic
Leedy and Ormrod (2013) argue that purposive sampling is used because participants are
appropriate to a phenomenon. The rationale for purposeful sampling is that participants are
representative of diverse perspectives on the issue under investigation—EC (i.e., attitudes of
learning) relevant to DL inclusion and DIL. A purposive sample was drawn from humanities
faculty, librarian-library and administrative personnel. The pilot study sample size will be N= 25,
also to assist in identifying the purposeful faculty participants the research will contact the Arts
& Science Deans from the respective participant institutions to ask for examples of faculty who,

115

in the Dean’s view, fall into Rogers (2003) 4 stages or functions individuals pass through in the
innovation - decision process. The plan was to interview 5 to 6 participants from each purposeful
sample selection of the Arts and Sciences full-time faculty and 3 to 5 adjunct faculty; (i.e.
general studies, English, Psychology, Sociology, History and General Science disciplines), 1 to 3
librarian(s) and liaison personnel, 1 or 2 senior administrators. Therefore, the total sample was:
16 to 28 faculty, 2 to 6 for librarians, and 2 or 6 institutional personnel. This provides a
minimum sample size N= 25 and a maximum size N = 40.
The study explored community colleges to discover what faculty consider appropriate
inclusion of DIL, and how DIL is included in curricula. It also assessed to what extent librarylibrarians consider appropriate inclusion of DIL, and how faculty include DIL in their curricula.
Data will be compared between the two community colleges.
The Protection of Human Subjects.
After receiving approval from the Old Dominion University Institutional Review Board,
the researcher contacted all the sample colleges to gain permission to perform the study at their
institutions and, in the process, recognize the importance of taking steps to protect the privacy of
all participants involved in the study. Fontana and Frey (2005) stress the value in gaining access
to the sample under investigation, and the willingness to share their experience and environment
to the researcher. A letter of invitation to the study will be emailed to all participants clearly
outlining the purpose and scope of the study, the ways that data will be used and stored, and
underlining that participants may withdraw from the study at any time. This informed consent
information will be reviewed with each participant at the start of the interview. Once participants
agree that they are comfortable with the process, then the interview and recording will be started.

116

Following all the interviews, the recordings will be digitally transcribed and encrypted.
Participants will be offered to review a copy of the transcript to ensure accuracy.

All participants will be asked to complete a letter of informed consent for participation in
the research study (see Appendix D). This acts to inform all parties that the information collected
will be anonymised, and personal identifiers replaced with a code. Only the researcher will
maintain the information to connect participants with this code. The data will be stored in a
separate password protected file and kept in a secure location accessible only to the researcher.
At any time, participants may request transcript copies of any of the data collection instruments
they completed. They will be informed that they are free to withdraw at any time with no
repercussions. All participants will be given a clear explanation for the study and the reason for
the value of their contribution. When the final research is complete and ready to be published
data will be reported at the aggregate level.
Measures
A pilot test of the instrument was performed to assess content validity at a comparably
sized, southern West Virginia, historically black college. Leedy and Ormrod (2013) argue that
the “validity of the measurement instrument is the extent to which the instrument measures what
it is intended to measure” (p. 89). A pilot test is used to assess the content validity of an
instrument during data collection. A sample of faculty, librarian, and institutional administrator
will be asked about their epistemological congruency regarding the DL adoption and DIL
paradigm of pedagogy, using all three instruments—an online survey, interviews, and field notes
from site visits. Charmaz (2000) espouses the importance of the assistance of an interrater
research faculty member to test content accuracy of the questions for both the questionnaire and
interviews, also providing evaluation of the relevance of the instruments.

117

Interview Protocols
This instrument has the broadest potential for reaching the greatest number of
participants, in part because of the time and distance between the researcher and participant. A
brief questionnaire (five to six minutes max) that uses a Likert scale and multiple choice answer
design will be emailed to all participants. As a precursor, to introduce to the researcher the
respondents level of DL adoption and technology self-efficacy. Thus, help to prevent question
repetition for the participants’ one-on-one interview (approximately 45 to 60 minutes) on
participants’ DL cognitive and non-cognitive attitudes. Then a follow-up onsite visits for focusgroup discussion with the librarians- library personnel and institutional administrator Table 2.
1. The online questionnaire’s main subject content includes: (i) demographics (ii) participants
professional background (iii) DL comprehension, what types of AT program or process
inclusion is incorporated into teaching, and possible knowledge of DIL.
2. An Interview: the primary method of phenomenological research since the instrument offers
the unique potential of gaining insights and access to descriptions of everyday experiences.
(Moustakas, 1994; Patton 2002, Rubin & Rubin, 2005). Depending on participant location,
contact will be through wither Skype or telephone. The interviews follow similar content to
the online survey, and will be conducted using open-ended questions to explore interviewees’
epistemological attitudes. The subject content includes: (i) familiarity and self-efficacy with
DL adoption and technology in teaching, (ii) familiarity with IL and DIL, and (iii) access and
use of DIL, and training/instruction with DIL. This instrument is used to interview a
purposive sample of on-campus faculty, librarians, and information technology personnel.
3. Field notes, in the form of a visit with focus-group meetings, provide insights and a picture of
what might not be heard or expressed in a recording (Patton, 2002). A reflective journal

118

allows the researcher to audit how the research might influence him/her, and helps prevent
bias when coding and analysis of data. Also, data collection might require adaptation to
changes to the sample, research environment (i.e., face-to-face versus virtual), and instrument
(Appendices A, B, and C).
Data Collection
Three instruments will be employed. First is a mixed method, brief online questionnaire so
both on-and-off-campus faculty are reached. This acts as a precursor and preparatory
introduction to the one-on-one face to face interviews with on-campus faculty, to collect
cognitive and non-cognitive data on interviewees’ DL adoption attitudes and AT self-efficacy.
Then the on-site visit focus group with faculty, librarians and institutional administrators is to
gather cognitive and non-cognitive data on interviewees’ attitudes of self-efficacy with AT and
epistemological perceptions (i.e., attitudes toward DIL) shown in table 2 & 3.
The face-to-face interviews will be recorded electronically (with the interviewee's
permission) to ensure accuracy of the transcription of the conversations. All data collected
electronically or in field notes will be stored in a separate, secure location, accessible only by the
researcher. Participants will be asked for consent, and advised that they are free to withdraw
from the study. They will also be informed that at any time, they can request a copy of their
survey, interview, and focus-group transcripts. They may also request a copy of the research
study.
A table of specifications (Table 2) represents a blueprint for the survey research tools,
acting as a guide for the type of content questions posed in the open-ended survey and during
focus groups. The themes for the questions are: (1) the concept of IL, (2) the idea of DIL, (3) DL
with various AT programs and processes as a teaching tool, where dimensions are sequential,

119

cyclical, and simultaneous information interactions through faculty perceptions, librarian
perceptions, and community college digital policies about the themes. As a subset of the
learning-issue phenomenon, the researcher can focus on use of information, and learn
simultaneously (Lupton, 2008).

Data Analysis
Data will be analyzed once all data are gathered and transcribed to search for hidden
meaning units through coding. Analysis will identify emerging trends that reflect various aspects
of the experience. This meta-interpretive form of analysis demonstrates integration of the
meaning of units into a seemingly typical experience (Miles & Huberman, 2013). Since coding
often returns linear assumptions of qualitative analysis (Patton 2002), distorting the true meaning
or value of data regarding their story, Creswell (2007, p. 152) suggests beginning with 25 to 30

120

categories, and then reassessing data and condensing to five or six specific categories to create a
narrative. Guidelines concerning category development suggest the frequency of a word/phrase,
and data context categories, eventually show patterns. Some data are unique and make it obvious
to find connections to the path of a pattern. They also indicate inquiries unknown prior to
collection, even showing specificity and leverage for an issue or phenomenon (Guba & Lincoln,
2005; Merriam, 2009). Marshall and Rossman (2006) demonstrate that this method of analysis
reveals clusters that point to hidden patterns.
From a discussion of the classification of information as early as Ranganathan (1951) and
Beghtol (1995), one controversial issue has been how a classification is relevant to the discovery
of thought-content of a written or expressed unit of thought. Discussing information theory,
Pierce (1980) argues that the same thought classification issue is also present when information
is provided in a digital format. Use of classification schemes by human thought
identification/keyword is applied in the ultimate stage of research, making the action connect
with IL and thus affecting contact between the reader and the relevant unit of thought in a
personal way (Beghtol, 1995; Ranganathan, 1951, p. 116). Ranganathan (1951) argues that when
reading text, a researcher develops an interpretation of the contextual content of the
interviewees’ responses, attitudes, and perceptions of the object of discussion (Beghtol, 1995).
The faceted classification system methodology for the organization of information
introduced by Ranganathan (1951) is similar to common, qualitative, social-science methods
such as grounded theory. The researcher uses critical thinking to interpret meta-data through
evaluation, assimilation, and synthesis, thus organizing data into classified categories (Glaser,
1978; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Ranganathan, 1965; Strauss, 1987; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). All
forms of faceted classification look for deep, semantic similarities, and much the same as

121

qualitative analysis, the researcher writes about the concepts and their interrelationships (Glaser,
1978; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Ranganathan, 1965; Strauss, 1987; Strauss & Corbin, 1990).
Axiology, the study of values, has twofold relevance here: (1) the concept framework of
the study is EC (i.e., sharing similar beliefs in attitudes of learning), and (2) the researcher’s
judgement of values reflects the choice of context. Using reflexivity, the researcher can
recognize their epistemological influences on the research process, and question and review each
step of the process to divine objectivity to be credible. If possible, the researcher collaborates
with an external subject expert (e.g., pilot test interrater), avoiding bias and adding rigor (Denzin
& Lincoln, 2005). Purposeful sampling allows collection of accurate data to meet the challenges
of construct validity, internal validity, and reliability. Data collection methods include primary
principles of using multiple sources of evidence, creating a secure project database, and
maintaining a clear chain of proof. These principles are essential to all types of sources of
evidence, forming a firm basis for evaluation and analysis of data content strength and
weaknesses (Yin, 2013). A study must consider methodological congruence (i.e., rigorous
appropriate procedures) for thoroughness if phenomenological research is to be judged valid.
Validity and reliability concerns of the instruments include applying proper procedures in terms
of plausibility and illumination about an issue or phenomenon (Christensen, Johnson, & Turner,
2010).
The framework of this study is drawn from a combination of Bandura’s (1989) triadic
reciprocal determinism model and Fruge and Ropers-Huilman’s (2008) research model,
combined with Saracevic’s (2007) theory. I explore EC (i.e., attitudes of learning) among faculty
and librarians regarding DIL and the effects of these perceptions on how to create a DIL
paradigm. Little epistemological research focuses on teacher/faculty DL epistemological beliefs,

122

and how their views influence classroom practices. Astin (1993) suggests that student-faculty
interactions correlate positively with self-reported personal and intellectual growth.
Tinto (1993) suggests that colleges and universities consist of both academic and social
systems, where each contains its own macro/micro formal and informal structures of faculty and
student groups. Where there is an issue of EC, students hold a perception of isolation or
incongruence that they do not fit into the environment, affecting students’ learning ability (Tinto,
1993, p. 50). There is need to establish a learning environment with openly outlined learning
objectives and outcomes so faculty and students both understand the commitment to the class.
Experience holds particular importance to community college students since they have minimal
to no out-of-class activities (Tinto, 1993).
Triangulation
Corbin and Strauss (2008) argue that a significant methodological underpinning of
research lies in data triangulation, which is vital for theory development. The triangulation
approach is justified since it offers a three-dimensional description of construct validity (Corbin
& Strauss, 2008). Merriam (2008) and Miles and Huberman (2013) expand the discussion,
arguing that sources are reliable when they offer a multi-dimensional view of congruency
between beliefs. Olafson and Schraw (2002) suggest that both faculty and librarians, as subject
experts, are information gatekeepers who have the capacity to offer detailed accounts of DIL as it
pertains to their forms of pedagogy. Therefore, triangulation will be used to ensure the
trustworthiness of this study. Data will develop and influence the methodology. A combination
of data collection methods such as questionnaire, interviews, focus group, and when available,
participant member checks of data transcripts or respondent validations, adds many layers of
cross reference (Merriam, 2009). Data collection, evaluation, and analysis will occur

123

consecutively (Hays & Singh, 2012). Thick descriptions from data will offer detailed accounts of
the research process and outcomes. The epistemological viewpoint of this study can be modified
in subsequent studies to obtain a complete view of the complexity of faculty and librarians’ DIL
inclusion in methods of pedagogy.
Limitations and Delimitations of the Study
A challenge of qualitative analysis is vacillation through data to filter/analyze what a
phenomenon is demonstrating. The interpretations from the descriptive data oblique meanings
and complexity might signify when data analysis reaches saturation. A good way for a researcher
to determine that analysis is complete is to visualize how categories interact by drawing a model
or diagram (Creswell, 2007; Merriam, 2009). Interpretations from descriptions and complexities
of reality influence analysis. Use of an interrater reviewer adds credence to reliability and
validity. Maxwell (2012) posits that validity is a goal, not a product, and credibility lies in
findings (Creswell, 2007; Merriam, 2009).
Lankshear, Peters, and Knobel (2000) argue that although the standard concept of
epistemology is individualistic, in the new digital era, established epistemological ideas or
beliefs are disturbed. New trends, practices, and phenomena connected with the digital age and
computer information technologies mean we need to ask ourselves about relationships among
DL adoption and DIL inclusion into education (Lankshear & Knobel, 2008). Faculty and
librarians’ might be concerned that their DL and DIL epistemological beliefs and teaching
methods are being evaluated. Therefore, it is imperative that there be a purpose, with clear
guidelines, for all participants so they realize the benefits of the study. The recommendations
will describe various approaches to engage in DL adoption and encourage DIL instruction in
tandem with faculty course curriculum to benefit student self-efficacy at rural community

124

colleges. Another concern is whether it is possible to identify a relationship between a person’s
epistemological belief for DL and DIL teaching practice to identify variables that affect DL and
DIL inclusion.
Significance
Regardless of how ambiguous the terminology, DL is synonymous with eco-learning,
virtual learning, and ubiquitous learning, depending on the author (Gates Foundation, 2015;
Lumina Foundation, 2014). One aspect is clear—all concerned faculty, librarians, institutions,
and students must interact with digital information, AT and digital technology as part of DL.
Contrary to critics such as Bertrand (2010), faculty and librarians regularly interact with AT, but
may not be aware of the extended DL paradigm. Subject experts, faculty, and librarians need to
collaborate not only with each other, but with the institution to find the most suitable AT that
promotes DL for their constituents. In this case, participants are relatively small, rural, highereducation institutions, specifically community colleges and historically black colleges and
universities (HBCU). The majority of studies so far have been at larger, urban universities and
colleges, at which stakeholders and constituents have different learning environments and socioeconomic characteristics, and sustained digital technology access, services, and possibly
equipment (Gates Foundation, 2015; Bailey, Jaggars & Jenkins 2015; Lumina Foundation, 2014;
Scott-Clayton, 2011).
This study provides insights into DL adoption experienced by institutions, faculty, and
librarians, and more specifically, what faculty and librarians deal with when incorporating AT
daily while interacting with students at small, rural, community colleges. The researcher will
offer recommendations on faculty and librarian DL and DIL collaboration for future,
longitudinal research to investigate performance measures of DIL curricula inclusion and

125

success, and student learning outcomes. The research might not offer generalizability, but the
intrinsic value of faculty and librarian collaboration to include DL as part of their pedagogy is a
move in the right direction. The value of this study is simple. Demand for DL with AT and DIL
inclusion and use by faculty, librarian(s), and students is ongoing. Identification of why faculty
are tentative to incorporate AT and DIL into their teaching, and how to find positive
collaborative methods to overcome barriers, are explored. This study searches for
recommendations, under participant ecologies and environments, that librarians can use to
encourage faculty and institutions to incorporate more DIL. Recommendations are expected to
increase motivation for DIL training that benefits community colleges’ institutional DL policies
and services.

126

Chapter 4 Findings
This chapter is organized into two sections, beginning with a summary of participant
demographics and subject disciplines, and followed by a description of major themes that
evolved. An analysis of findings that correspond to how community college administrators,
faculty members, and librarians conceptualize and operationalize digital literacy with their
instruction and curricula follows. The research method was divided into three stages. All
participants, faculty, librarians and administrators completed a brief online questionnaire, a oneon-one survey interview with the researcher, and a focus group. Purposeful sampling was
applied, and, faculty members, and administrators participated voluntarily. The digital
component was useful because it offered accessibility to all parties, and interviews were
conducted on the participants’ own time. The stage-two survey and stage-three focus group
involved logistics of scheduling coordinated attendance, limiting response participation from
participants. The alternative peer institution that agreed to be a sample location provided some
challenges to the researcher. The contact person at the institution retired unexpectedly,
influencing timely distribution and connection with faculty members, and consequently, data
collection did not resume until August 2016. A single researcher conducted all interviews.
Participants’ subject disciplines, years of teaching experience, and professional development
demographics were collected.
A mixed method of quantitative and qualitative approaches was applied because of the
abstract human perception variables involved; the researcher sought the meaning and
experiences of individuals concerning a phenomenon (Creswell, 1998). Quantitative research
allows a researcher to ascertain participants’ individual perceptions of self-efficacy, and
qualitative research allows a researcher to discover hidden meanings from participants’ personal

127

expressions of their beliefs, aspirations, and expectations of digital literacy (DL), information
literacy (IL), and digital information literacy (DIL) programs from rich data responses. This
study explores faculty members’ attitudes of learning theory (i.e., epistemology) and perceptions
of DL adoption with academic technology inclusion in their modes of instruction. The new
digital technology trend has influenced society by suggesting assumptions. The expectation is
that DL has become a standard component in higher education culture, where literacy is
redefined as a social practice for interactive learning with technology, instead of traditional,
historical understanding of literacy as a cognitive and technical skill (Jones-Kavalier &
Flannigan, 2006, Croxall, 2012).
A pilot study was conducted to test the research methods and provide the researcher with
experience with conducting interviews. Findings from the pilot accord with views on disparities
on DL adoption in higher education between scholarly literature and contemporary digital
technology reports (Gates, 2015; Lumina, 2014). Deductive reasoning was used to assess the
pilot study’s brief questionnaire, confirming that the a priori codebook reflected themes
identified as criteria for the study’s research questions. From a reflective review, the researcher
modified focus group questions, but made no changes to the survey interview instrument. Once
the research proposal was approved, and IRB permission received, the sample locations were
contacted in April 2016 to commence data collection.
All participants who completed the initial brief questionnaire provided years of service
demographic data that included time spent working in higher education. (See Appendix A, p 253).
Synthesis and review of the questionnaire responses data demographic variables, gender, years of
teaching/service in higher education, discipline and professional development were considered
for possible influencing factors with participants’ self-reported assessment of individual DL self-

128

efficacy. These multiple variables were used as a proxy when calibrating the participants’ overall
self-efficacy scores for the three literacy categories under investigation, and that identified,
which level of Rogers innovation of technology had been reached. Whereupon, the researcher
factored these variable results into the survey and focus group respondents’ qualitative data
analysis to answer the research questions.
The table of specifications (table 2, p. 110) in chapter three acted as a blue print for the
more specific questions then posed to the participants in the survey interview and focus group
(see Appendix B and C) following the three literacy categories of digital literacy, information
literacy and digital information literacy. A cross reference of the research questions with the
survey interview protocol questions (Table 4) and focus group questions (Table 5) demonstrates
how the open-ended interview questions relate to the study’s research questions. Through the
analysis of the participants’ survey interview and focus group responses to the questions in the
three literacy categories the researcher was able to answer the respective research questions.

The transcriptions were then given to participants for review to ensure validity.
Participants received the interview protocol electronically before the interviews. The face-toface interviews were recorded using a high-quality audio recorder, and the teleconference survey
interviews were conducted using the researcher’s toll-free account, which allowed the sessions to
be recorded digitally. To ensure accuracy of participants’ responses to contextual content, a
professional transcription company transcribed digital audio recordings of the interviews. The

Participant and Institutional Summaries
State Education Systems Represented
Mountain One Community College is location A, and is part of a statewide Community
College System that adheres to the policies from the central governing body. Mountain Two
Community and Technical College is location B, belongs to the Community and Technical
College System that follows the policies under the Chancellor for the State Education
Department. Both location samples participants work and teach at midsized (i.e., 2000 to 3000
fulltime enrollment), rural community colleges in southern Virginia and West Virginia.

130

Institutional profile, location A. The community college is a public, two-year,
coeducational college, directed under policies established by the State Board of Community
Colleges and a local college board. The college operates on a semester system, and is open yearround. It is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College
and Schools to award Associate’s degrees in arts & science (AA&S) and applied science (AAS),
a career studies certificate (CSC), and other certificates and diplomas. Faculty members’
qualifications range from Master’s degrees to doctoral and other terminal degrees, and most have
professional experiences that support their qualifications. There are approximately 40 fulltime
and 129 part-time faculty members, with no tenure track, and 31 are humanities faculty. The
student-faculty ratio is 17:1.
The library is automated, acts as a focal point for research and study found within the
Learning Resource Center on campus, and provides digital resources, services, and IL that
support and enhance the educational programs of the college. The institution’s learning
management system (LMS) is Blackboard (Blackboard, Inc., 1997). The Distance Learning and
Instructional Technology (DLIT) department functions as a service for instructional design,
development and support, instructional server management integration, and the Learning
Assistance Center (LAC). It provides continual training and support of Blackboard for faculty
members and students. The LAC offers supplemental, specialized instruction to assist
individuals with meeting their educational goals. The DLIT also helps faculty members and
administrators plan, develop, and produce audio-visual materials for college publications.
As part of the instructional framework, the institution established an administrative policy
for a continuous learning program for employees. All fulltime and adjunct faculty members are
eligible to take up to six credit or non-credit hours each semester. The 2014/15 College Report

131

notes accomplishments that include DLIT continued faculty technology institute training to
expand faculty use of Blackboard, Instructional Technology, and Open Education Resources
(OER). Continuous work with faculty members and instructors ensures uniformity of syllabi in
the SWCC template (online) and review of class material, and an LAC faculty survey addresses
specialized (technology) workshop offerings and additional areas of (digital) interest.

Institutional profile, location B. Unforeseen issues in the state in which Mountain Two
Community College is located experienced significant budget shortfalls that threatened a state
employee shutdown or furloughs that included all higher-education employees. The economic
downturn in the area influenced Mountain Two personnel prompting them to withdraw from
participation in this study in April 2016. Therefore, an alternative peer West Virginia
community college was contacted in May 2016 and assumed the pseudonym Mountain Two
Community College. This community and technical college is one of nine publicly supported,
two-year institutions of higher education in the state. The institution’s governance system
underwent changes of legislatively directed expansions in academic, workforce, and community
service offerings, and thus an expansion of its service region to include facilities located
throughout the southern region of the state. The system operates under the direction of the
Council for Community and Technical College Education, whose master plan is strategic and
innovative planning and program delivery using cutting-edge technology. Delivering relevant,
rigorous, and modularized curricula, while allowing each member institution to operate under a
local board of governors, the council serves as a state-wide policy and coordinating body. It is
accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, from which it obtained a 10-year
reaccreditation in 2013, and it holds select programmatic accreditations. The institution
represents one of nine community and technical college districts in West Virginia. The

132

institution’s purposeful sample was taken from the primary campus of a formal service area in
the core of coal country, encompassing approximately 1,900 square miles and five locations.
Across these five locations are approximately 150 faculty members, including 65 fulltime faculty
members and 75 adjunct instructors, where 15 are part of the humanities department. Faculty
credentials vary, including holding Master’s/doctoral degrees or other terminal degrees, and
professional experience that supports their qualifications. The student-faculty ratio is 15:1.
Faculty members participate in college governance, serving on institution-wide and divisionbased committees, and engaging in planning, program assessment, and curriculum development.
Faculty members who have fulltime appointments (the college has no tenure track) design online
instructional and other alternative delivery systems.
The college’s 2010 to 2015 strategic goals shape and guide the college community, with
focus on the future. The goals direct members of the institution to assess and adjust the college’s
direction in response to changes periodically. One priority is to build and maintain facilities,
with a focus on improvements to facility infrastructures, including enhancing use of technology
and prioritizing deferred maintenance projects. Technology and library services enable the
institution to fulfill its mission and vision to enhance student learning success and improve the
efficiency of education delivery, where digital literacy (DL) and information literacy (IL) are
incorporated into the learning structure. The college integrates and supports innovative
technologies. Institutional policies include technology guidelines and rules about e-mail as an
official form of communication, and digital information technology acceptable use. These act as
security measures to protect the college technology platform and information content.

133

Purposeful Sampling

The sample included community college administrators, faculty, and librarians. Data
were obtained through a brief online questionnaire, personal interviews, and focus group
sessions. Cumulative data were coded and analyzed. To mask institution and participant
identities, pseudonyms for Mountain One (SPLA- 1 through SPLA-22) and Mountain Two
(SPLB-1 through SPLB-16) are used to protect participants’ anonymity. The brief questionnaire
was a quantitative survey. The questions asked participants about their epistemological
perception (i.e. attitudes of learning) with academic technology for instruction and beliefs
regarding digital and information literacy (DL and IL) adoption in teaching. Where the
overarching main question was how does epistemological perception bridge the connections
between technology skills and technology self-efficacy is explored from the perspectives of the
professional roles of the Arts and Science faculty, librarians and institutional administrators.
Gallardo-Echenique et al. (2015) suggest a preferred encompassing term of digitals
learners since digital technology makes everyone a learner in varying degrees. Sample
participants were identified from their professional position as a natural selection, thus, classified
into faculty/adjunct, librarians and administrators’ groups, and how the subject discipline also
influenced the extent of individual DL comprehension and inclusion. This classification is
relevant to the theory model of the study, and the research questions, which explored whether a
person classified as either a faculty member, librarian or administrator predisposes him/her to
avoid DL or IL technology adoption, making him/her less digitally information literate. Bertrand
(2010) characterizes academia and higher education as being slow and behind the global market
regarding adoption of DL, and thus a person’s use of digital technology might correlate with

134

his/her DL, IL and digital information literacy (DIL) perceptions and self-efficacy, influencing
the effort he/she expends on and persistence applied to the action (Bandura, 1989). The
questionnaire indicated the participants’ biographic information, including an individual’s
subject discipline and adoption/non-inclusion of DL. Moreover, teaching experience, gender and
professional development were reviewed for possible inferences, although not specifically
addressed in the research questions at this time. The questionnaire also provided individuals’
perceived DL self-efficacy, indicating the form of perception, levels of inclusion, and type of
adoption of DL, IL, and DIL. Deductive reasoning was used during the pilot study’s
questionnaire analysis, which confirmed that the a priori codebook reflected themes identified as
criteria for the research questions. Appendix F contains a table of response scores for both
locations.
The qualitative survey interviews and focus groups examined individual’s particular
perceptions of DL relative to technology skills and technology self-efficacy within the specific
subject discipline and personal beliefs. The concept framework, a Point of Reference Spectrum
(PRS) showed how an environment’s effect on self and behavior variables is used to determine
whether faculty DL and librarians’ perceptions and activities in regards to the inclusion of DL
and what might that level of inclusion involved DIL in instruction.

The schema is A + B and B + C shown in figure 4; where A = technology skills
(cognitive), B = participant epistemology (non-cognitive interpretation & learning), and C =
technology self-efficacy (cognitive learning techniques). Thus, A is the predictor, B becomes the
moderator, and C is the outcome. The PRS provides a basis of recognizing participants DL
cognitive and non-cognitive issue levels, and possible occurrence of correlation in the areas
where clusters appear from the data analysis. The result provides a starting point from which to
offer constructive recommendations to build collaborative solutions.
Stage One: Location A, Brief Questionnaire. At Mountain One the researcher met with the
dean of the humanities department to identify participants for stage 1 of the study, during which
20 people were identified as candidates for the online questionnaire, which was distributed over
e-mail to the candidates. Sixteen questionnaires were returned for an 80% response rate. The
response group comprised two administrators/ instructors, an instruction librarian, and 13 faculty
members from the humanities department, representing the English and speech, sociology and
psychology, developmental English and math, math and general science, early childhood
education, and library sciences disciplines. Location A, figure 15 shows Mountain One

Stage One : Location B, Brief Questionnaire
At Mountain Two, the researcher renewed contact during the 2016 summer break with a
community college administrator, who distributed the questionnaire to 28 members of the faculty
body, librarians, and administrator. The majority were unavailable or unresponsive, and the
researcher was informed that the best time to reconnect was at the start of the fall 2016 semester
during preschool preparation (i.e., the community college’s convocation event). A new round of
questionnaires was distributed to humanities faculty members as per the president’s new
appointee directions. The researcher sent follow-up e-mails to maintain communication with
participants. A request was made to the new provost for a site visit and meeting dates for
collaboration to be reinstituted. Since the research method required purposeful sampling, and for
the researcher to continue to stages two and three of the survey, discussions with the provost, or
an appointee, was necessary.
For the brief questionnaire at location A, the questionnaire was distributed as a Microsoft
Word attachment because the site B representative reported that there would be technical issues
with the document over e-mail. The document was reformatted using Google forms to give
participants greater accessibility to the questionnaire. The researcher communicated with the
institution’s presidential appointee to identify participants for stage one. Twenty-eight candidates
were identified, to whom the questionnaire was distributed using e-mail. The 14 questionnaires
returned represented a 50 % response rate. The response group included three administrators,
two librarians, and nine humanities faculty members from English and psychology, applied
science and information technology, math and general science, and library science. Location B

Stage Two: An Open-ended Survey Interview One-on–One
Stage two included a survey interview, a qualitative tool of open-ended questions that
allows inductive reasoning and analysis. All participants who completed the initial brief
questionnaire provided years of service demographic data that included time spent working in
higher education. (See Appendix A, p 253). The researcher collaborated with the lead contacts at
the two locations this verified the purposeful sampling candidates.
Location A, Mountain One. From the dean of arts and sciences, who had knowledge of
which faculty members have or have not adopted DL, and whether faculty members have

143

familiarity with the latest DL concepts of DIL. From the suggested candidates, the researcher
purposefully selected on a list of possible candidates. Ten Survey interviewees were contacted,
two administrators/instructors, seven faculty members and an adjunct faculty who demonstrated
both limited DL inclusion and adoption, and minimal or no IL, as part of their pedagogy were
chosen, and seven responded.

is actually a learning standard.
From the aspect of the administrator the
digital technology is very useful in helping to

-Continued development and

outcomes.

Looking at the concept definitions provided
within the committees that I am on we still
consider information literacy as the leading
concept. Since four years ago, our campus
conducted an IL assessment for the CCS.
This institution adheres to the CCS
standards. The IL assessment was a
concentrated effort by the library of
information disbursement on (digital) IL

-Incorporated IL concepts into academic
technology, and is involved to keep up
with constant digital technology advances,
since the Internet enables a person to stay
current.
-Collaborated to develop curricula with
librarians incorporating IL in instruction
because of the benefits IL provides as a
critical thinking tool.
-Recognizes the challenges of DL
adoption as part of an instruction model,
which is contingent on the institution’s
guidelines, where DIL incorporates DL
through information research learning
assignments.

When I first became aware of information
literacy, at the institution where he was
working at that time, the library director
collaborated with him to develop a research
project.
Since completion of the class assignment
involves IL research with critical thinking,
where the students have to conduct research
using the library’s electronic databases.
The IL concept was a natural fit where now
DL with academic technology is the tool to
achieve the critical thinking assignment.

My point of view is DIL is just a given, since
digital technology is how we manage
information and how we put it (information
disbursement and distribution) out there. So
it (digital technology) is a way to get
information dispersed to everybody. So when
I of digital, because what you are learning is
about how they (computers and technology)
work and what you do with PCs to get to
information and get you to become IL
literate. So perhaps you might just call that
digital literacy.

Let me think about that for a second. I do
think there’s a difference between digital
literacy and information literacy but…. Again,
here everyone uses Blackboard for face-toface and for online classes. I really think that
for most of us, it’s just become a very
seamless part of the way we move toward
meeting the student learning outcomes. I
don’t have any student learning outcomes
that deal with mastering technology. I use
technology to help students meet those
student learning outcomes in literature,

I really love Blackboard with the speech
because I can use it as a distance teacher.
And with my AP English I've enjoyed it with
that as well because we use discussion
boards and creative writing and I can upload
PowerPoint and YouTube videos and
students can constantly check their grades
and their progress. So I love that but you
know that I'm just a huge fan of library
databases too and when my students are
doing research, I definitely want them using
those databases. For me teaching, my
teaching tool I guess the best one is
Blackboard.

institutional appointee, whose knowledge included which faculty members had fully adopted or
integrated DL into their style of instruction, and whether the faculty members had familiarity
with the latest DL concepts, especially DIL. The choice of survey interviewees reflected
questionnaire responses, and those the appointee identified as Humanities faculty
members/instructors. A list of candidates was purposefully selected, and 12 requests were emailed to participants. Two weeks later, the researcher followed up with an e-mail reminder.
Three participants responded to the survey interview request—a faculty member/administrator

Stage Three: A Focus Group Meeting with Open-ended Questions
Stage three was a focus group meeting, a qualitative tool of open-ended questions that
allows inductive reasoning and analysis. These structured interview questions continued to
explore sample participants’ perceptions of DL, expanding on the survey interview questions.
This process examined how participants considered DL and DIL influences student learning
outcomes, or not; and what was the institution’s positon on DL adoption (see Appendix C). The
meetings were conducted both face to face and via conference call. All the meeting interviews

147

were recorded and sent to a transcription service. The participants were asked to review the

My perspective is doing academic

large part of his daily routine and work
environment. Some faculty were very
involved, really gone the whole nine yards.
Others very little, but sometimes it’s the
nature of the program. Although, it's amazing
some of even the trade area programs did
develop a digital and distance presence, but
varies from instructor to instructor and
program to program. Certain programs are
100% via distance learning that need DL,
maybe the very last class that would be the
Capstone or the internship that incorporate

important. In Southwest Virginia, we have a

they have a unique culture and it has to be
the right fit for the instructor, for the student,
for the course content, or it's really not the

all digital kinds of things on how to

of these steps on their own, plus if a student
was very unsure of how to do that, we now
have in place, little labs, a couple of staff
members that are there, and my students
told me they have gone. I think it's going to
increase DL self-efficacy and it's all based on
the idea of how you access information and
then how you access appropriate information
... It boils down to, I think, showing is better
than telling.

Analysis of the Findings
At both sample locations, administration participants communicated that their respective
state and local governing organizations considered development and establishment of DL and IL,

150

a priority due to contemporary professional career and global market digital trends. To stay
current with their accreditation, IL and now DL became institutional academic assessment
criteria. Location A has an initiative to get all faculty onboard with DL as a directive, and
location B has the infrastructure to support DL across all disciplines for faculty adoption, but it is
not yet policy. Faculty survey participants reported various reasons for why they chose not to
incorporate DIL in their instruction based on individual choices because of their perceptions and
concerns about DL. Faculty responses provided consensus of perceptions that DL was a
recognized concept, though comprehension of the definition might not be understood fully, nor
considered relevant to their disciplines, and DIL was an unfamiliar term or concept.
From the data collected the findings discovered participants’ epistemological congruence
(EC) (Fruge & Ropers-Huilman, 2008) and how this bridges the connection to DL and DIL
between the different groups’ technology skills and self-efficacy characteristics and perceptions
that indicated the interconnections for the types of issues that might influence inclusion in
instruction. (Figure 19).

Figure 19. Participant Sample Framework
In answer to the main question how does epistemological perception bridge the
connection between technology skills and technology explored further that frequency of digital

151

academic technology usage may not truly demonstrate a person’s digital literacy self-efficacy.
Answers to the research questions 1a-1c.
What are Arts & Science faculty digital literacy (DL) epistemology (i.e. attitudes of
learning theory)?
Faculty at both locations consider themselves digitally literate. One reason for this is that at both
locations all sample participants were actively involved in using the digital academic technology,
whether for administrative purposes and/or online teaching via the LMS Blackboard online class
instruction. Therefore, all participants considered themselves to have a basic level of DL selfefficacy.
What are faculty perceptions of DL? Among the faculty and librarian sample
participants, there was a difference in opinion as to what exactly constituted the DL paradigm.
Some considered DL as the skills and self-efficacy attributed to using digital AT programs such
as the LMS Blackboard system. Whereas others believed, DL self-efficacy involved more than
just digital technology skills but also included IL critical thinking skills. The variance in faculty
DL perceptions seemed to depend upon the individuals own espoused theory of DL.
Mountain One community college, the state in which Mountain One is located requires
all faculty to establish an online class presence as part of their continuous learning policy. So, the
campus is proactively involved in the adoption of DL as part of pedagogy. Some faculty support
this initiative as beneficial to student learning outcomes. For example; In General ScienceParticipant EMS SPLA-16 considers inclusion of DL literacy part of online teaching, and SPLA15 includes electronic database use and research in lessons, using Web 2.0 YouTube. Since the
library conducts in-class IL orientation with students that incorporates “digital” IL with academic
technology while preparing class content. Compared to SPLA-13, who believes familiarity with

152

IL is important but assumes that students have exposure to IL concepts and practices before
entering her classes. In comparison, English- Speech SPLA-4 indicated that DL with academic
technology does not assist with classroom instruction. She also has the expectation that students
go individually to the library for IL support concerning Internet. The librarian SPLA-8
commented that for face-to-face classes in the library’s instructional lab, students can participate
with hands-on searches, for “digital” IL activities. She incorporates the “digital” IL with
academic technology instruction for “digital” IL on campus. The instruction modules are
provided as written library guides shared with the faculty to post in their online classes as a form
of embedded librarian resources. Moreover, SPLA-10 considers DL with academic technology
does not necessarily fit his discipline. “…students can connect with DL but might be bombarded
by “digital” information to access distracting entertainment” (SPLA-10). He was familiar with
both IL and Web 2.0 database research for instruction. Students get library Internet and
electronic database assistance.
At Mountain Two community college, administrators and library sample participants
considered DL incorporating both digital technology self-efficacy skills and digital literacy
critical thinking skills as necessary components of pedagogy. Here, the faculty members were
more divided in their belief of DL classroom incorporation and instruction adoption. Certain
faculty were under the assumption that teaching online constituted DL self-efficacy. SPLB-9
believes DL with academic technology incorporation might be non-beneficial because,
“…if the technology is difficult to use, then the students spend more time figuring
it out than they do learning the material being taught, and General Science SPLB11 was unfamiliar with the term or concept of DL, also is unaware of an

153

institutional or departmental DIL expectation. Commenting such “terms not
bandied about with faculty.”(SPLB-9).
SPLB-8 adds that there is an institutional expectation that DL is included but the
implementation of such appears to be far from perfect. And SPLA-10 considers that DL with
academic technology does not necessarily fit his discipline. Students can connect with DL but
might be bombarded by “digital” information to access distracting entertainment.
Conversely, there were faculty members who proactively included DL in their
pedagogy. For example; English SPLB-12 considers that the LMS training on Blackboard covers
DL specifics for incorporating digital literacy activities and assignments as part of instruction.
DL applies to her discipline since Web 2.0 database use and research are an integral part of the
class. Applied Science and technology SPLB-14 believes digital technology facilitates digital
literacy, and the new president intends that the faculty and professional instructors, to continue
developing strong digital information literacy curricula relevant to academic and career
credential programs.
When do faculty consider IL relevant to a course’s topic? There was no mention of a
specific IL mandate at either location that faculty must include IL into their pedagogy. On the
other hand, at both locations the libraries provide IL orientation for all new incoming freshman.
Inclusion of IL library instruction as part of the class and/or student’s individual IL mentoring
and development through class assignments is up to the respective faculty. Traditionally IL has
been mainly part of the English, Psychology and Sociology because of the research assignments
involved in those subjects.

154

Mountain One, Virginia, Sociology SPLA-7 recounted a detailed description, how it was
through the library that he first learned about, and introduced IL assignments that are a major part
of his class student learning outcome.
What is the librarian’s/ library digital literacy (DL) epistemology (i.e. attitudes of learning
theory)?
What are community college librarians’ (library’s) DL perspectives? Both samples of
community college location library directors professed that their perspective on attitudes of
learning theory for DL were that the concept of DL came from the innovative influence of digital
technology to the IL paradigm. Each of the librarians agreed the traditional library bibliographic
instruction (BI) was transformed by Zurkowski’s (1974) introduction of IL, how much of library
resources and services connected to and involve the skills, understanding and comprehension of
an individual need for information. Searching for this information is rooted in the IL paradigm,
and is now changed to a technology Web 2.0 environment (SPLA- 1 & 8, SPLB-1 & 15).
Libraries adapted by incorporating digital technology resources, so as to be able to instruct and
mentor students’ information needs when using the library’s electronic resources such as the
online electronic catalog, electronic journal databases for the different subject disciplines class
assignments (SPLA- 1 & 8, SPLB-1 & 15). The library continues its student support on the
basic usage and knowledge of the different academic technology and Web 2.0 resources used in
the current educational environment, where the advent of DL is just an extension of the IL
paradigm (SPLA-1 & 8). The library promotes and believes in nurturing the development of
students’ digital self-efficacy in becoming digitally literate, thus, citizen centric (SPLB-1 & 15).
Mountain One community college, SPLA-1 explained that even with the arrival of digital
resources there is still an expectation from the different subject bearing degree accreditation

155

associations that the library continues to maintain a balanced approach of hardcopy content apart
from the digital technology resources. The number of classes/students that attend the library for
DL instruction fluctuates depending on the faculty members. Although now that the library has
more than one digital instructional lab that has been an uptick in faculty bringing the classes to
the library for DL instruction (SPLA- 1 & 8).
Mountain Two, librarian SPLB-15 commented that her biggest concern was that students
do not necessarily have adequate or appropriate digital technology at home. So, the library needs
to be available to provide the resources and instruction. In addition, that it might further
encourage students to attend the library sessions when faculty would set an example by
accompanying their class.
What are community college librarians’ (library’s) DIL instruction program? Both
sample location community colleges provide and promote the libraries’ Web 2.0 digital
resources. The development of their IL instruction program is a work in progress, but the method
of delivery has been updated to the digital platform resources.
At Mountain one community college, to support the institutions continuous learning
initiative and to remain proactively involved with the distance learning component, both the
library director and instruction librarian regularly prepare the (digital) IL instruction materials.
They are posted online into the faculty members online classes as a type of embedded librarian.
In this way, more faculty have been introduced to the libraries’ Web 2.0 digital resources,
therefore, becoming more familiar with the broad range of library digital resources. For example;
SPLA-1 stated that;
“…it is her impression that digital information literacy (DIL) is not yet recognized as a
new paradigm, but is a subset of the DL and IL concepts as defined by the ACRL standards.

156

Among her peers in the library community, she believes IL is the defining paradigm that is being
transposed with the advent of DL” (SPLA-1).
At Mountain Two community college, West Virginia, SPLB-1 coordinates library
instruction for both the main campus and satellite locations. Library digital IL instruction,
mentoring and support is provided mainly at the main campus, and library personnel at the
satellite locations offer digital reference support. This includes an introduction to the basic usage
and knowledge of the different academic technology and Web 2.0 resources used in the current
educational environment, where the advent of DL is just an extension of the IL paradigm.
What are Arts & Science faculties’ concept of DIL?
How do faculty consider DIL relevant to a course’s topic? In general, most faculty
sample participants stated limited knowledge, training or exposure to a DIL paradigm. Certain
faculty members voiced a concern that DIL is a paradigmatic paradox, in their opinion the
paradigm is that IL uses and incorporates the modern digital Web 2.0 digital resources, an echo
of what Mountain One library director had stated (SPLA- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 & 22; SPLB-2, 7,
10, 11 & 14). The faculty have the choice to include (digital) IL into their class subject
instruction (SPLA-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 & 22; SLPB-2, 4, 7, 9, 10 & 12). On the
other hand, at both locations different senior administrators are strong advocates for the more
current DIL concept, since DIL self-efficacy is a needed ability for all students entering the main
stream 21st century society career fields and/or continuing education programs (SPLA- 1, 10, 20
& 21; SPLB- 4, 9, 15 & 16).
Mountain One community college, Humanities faculty members consistently follow the
traditional subject disciplines, i.e., English, Sociology, Psychology and maybe general studieshistory that typically incorporate and use the library’s digital resources. One addition is that the

157

Nursing/ Rad tech school added Blackboard’s Flipped classroom module into their online
instruction program. They have incorporated student DL preparation where critical thinking is an
integral part and big component in the learning module. Hence, the library/ librarian is being
asked to do more embedded librarian materials. For example; SPLA-9 explained how faculty
such as SPLA-13 & 14 who expressed these DL inclusion initiatives.
“In the nursing Rad Tech program clickers are used extensively and the institution
also incorporates the use of the interactive remote access clicker program for
professional development with faculty and personnel. The program used in
nursing Rad-tech is called the flipped classroom-this is a concept-based
instruction method- with lecture capture through Bb. Students must read the text
and view to study the online lecture video before class. To then have studied and
learned the subject content material before attending the face-to-face class. This
environment means students are being prepared to answer questions or complete
activities that are grounded in problem-based learning to gain subject knowledge
and understanding. This of course relies on digital technology of Bb and Pod-cast
to establish the environment for intensive critical thinking” (SPLA-9).

At Mountain Two community college, the response was much the same as Mountain
One. Humanities faculty members are consistently following the traditional subject disciplines,
and typically incorporate and use the library’s digital resources. There are a few exceptions, such
as SPLB-14 where the faculty in the Applied Science and technology field are requesting DIL
developed instruction.
How might faculty & librarian DIL collaboration enhance student learning outcomes?
As the sample participants’ response data showed, there remains an ambiguity in the perception
and comprehension of the DIL concept. While participants are just now adjusting, and becoming

158

familiar with DL incorporation and adoption into pedagogy, a discrete DIL difference with a
clear definition is not a consideration presently at these two sample locations. For example;
“…certainly for the students who are in the developmental classes in my analysis
of the student outcomes has shown these students need face-to-face lab time was
faculty direction to feel confident in using and understanding the technology to be
able to complete their class work” (SPLA-9).
“ …I Believe digital literacy with academic technology incorporation might be
non-beneficial because-if the technology is difficult to use, then the students
spend more time figuring out the program than they do learning the material being
taught” (SPLB-9).

For both Mountain One and Mountain Two locations faculty and librarian responses
voiced a consensus on the adoption of the DL concept into instruction is a work in progress.
Faculty members and librarians are on the frontline with students’ means being actively involved
in instruction that incorporates varying levels of DL using Web 2.0 and the LMS online classes.
Consequently, their practical knowledge real-time experience provides valuable insight into the
challenges and issues the students’ encounter with DL incorporation. The integration of DL
adoption needs institutional support and infrastructure assessment for a fit with the subject
disciplines and to best suit the student constituents’ needs. Currently collaboration tends to fall
among the faculty limited to regular library users. In their opinion because students’ work and
learning outcomes showed an improvement and academic success correlated to library DL
instruction. Therefore, collaboration with faculty members and librarians will help to find

159

solutions and promote transparency. As a valid information resource for leadership and
departmental directors DL decision making, institutional policy and training.
However, Mountain One librarians mentioned they are exploring avenues of greater
involvement with other subject discipline faculty beyond the traditional faculty members, for
example in the Rad-Tech nursing flipped classroom (SPLA-1 & 8). In addition, Mountain Two
president (SPLB-15) relayed that the strategic plan incorporates Web 2.0 professional in-house
development, and expands the library’s digital information presence. Now with the library’s new
virtual introduction demonstration to incorporate library Web 2.0 workshops at the institutions
governance day training events. Perhaps a response to general science SPLB-4 reaction when
asked about DIL and the library, SPLB-4 stated how she was unaware of whether the institution
has a DIL policy, or whether faculty members and librarians collaborate for DIL training.
Consequently, participants’ responses across all the subpart questions for their respective
subject disciplines and fields represented the individual assimilation of varied beliefs for what
might be considered basic AT knowledge and skills, and how that amounted to the bridge that
connected DL, IL and DIL self-efficacy EC.
Relationship of Research Questions, Data Collection and Data Collected
The literature review outlined the complexity and ambiguity connected with the
comprehension of DL, IL, and DIL concepts. For this phenomenological inquiry, the design of
the research instruments was guided by the research questions All three research instruments, the
brief questionnaire, the survey interview, and the focus group survey, guided the interviews; and,
ultimately, the collection of data.
Participants in each of the two venues in which data was gathered, were asked to consider
their individual perceptions of learning connected to DL, IL and DIL. The interview protocol

160

was semi structured, designed to keep participants and me focused on the topic, and permitted
the flexibility to enable the exploration of other topics introduced by the participants.

themes that provide the researcher with a guide to build the coding framework for the
identification of the subsequent detailed themes found in the participants’ questionnaire, survey
and focus group responses.
Tables 4 and 5 (p. 129-130) identified the relationship between research questions and
structured interview questions and between research questions and survey interview questions.
Synthesis of the response meta-data led to the development of the overarching parent themes
shown in table 12. Table 13 presents the parent themes, which then evolved into the major theme
subcategories.

161

Research Question Subpart (a) with subsections
Research question (a) asks: What is Arts and Science faculty’s digital literacy
epistemology (i.e. attitudes of learning)? This question considers what the individual participants
understood as DL attitudes of learning. Responses introduced and explored participants’
individual attitudes of learning philosophy perspective for their subject discipline attributed to
their personal learning and teaching paradigms. This clarified a participant’s mindset respective
to their professional role(s) within the sample location’s institution for how they understood the
concept of DL. It also helped identify when and where the inclusion of DL appeared in the
learning/teaching environment.
The administrator participants often had the dual role of management and teaching. They
could provide rich commentary from practical experience that was related to both perspectives
that recognized the institution’s DL justifications, and faculty and librarians’ similarities and
differences for DL adoption in instruction. The analysis of associated survey (ISQ) and focus
group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5 and FGQ 1, 2, 3 responses provided the
data to answer the first research question.
Research question (a) (i) asks: What are faculty perceptions of DL? This directly
questions how individual participants understood the concept of DL. Faculty members’ replies
steered the researcher to ascertain, through a description of the type of instructional environment
(i.e. class curriculum or online class environment) that explained the faculty interpretation for
what being digitally literate means, and whether in their opinion they had adopted DL, in some
form, as part of the teaching process. Consequently, participants’ perceptions defined the selfassessed recognition of DL self-efficacy and personal competence. The respective DL content
value related to student learning outcomes tied into the perception of DL incorporation and

162

adoption. The analysis of survey (ISQ) and focus group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 1, 2a,
2b, 3, 4, 5 and FGQ 1, 2, 3 responses provided the data to answer to research question 1 (a).
Research question (b) (ii) asks: When do faculty consider IL relevant to a course’s topic?
This question explored the participant’s possible knowledge and recognition of the IL concept. I
examined the participant’s interpretation of the IL concept, through a description of the type of
instructional actions (i.e. class curriculum and syllabi) that explained their personal meaning of
digital literacy, and whether in their opinion they had adopted DL in some form as part of their
teaching practice. Participants’ perceptions defined the self-assessed recognition of IL selfefficacy and personal competence. The IL instruction content value towards the subject
discipline student learning outcomes tied into the perception of IL adoption. I interpreted the
faculties’ responses that found positive incorporation, objective reasons for IL limitations and
reactions why it might not be not included. The analysis of associated survey (ISQ) and focus
group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5 and FGQ 1, 2, 3 responses provided the
data to answer to research question 1 (b).
Research Question Subpart (b) with subsections
Research question (b) asks: What is the librarian’s/ library digital literacy (DL)
epistemology (i.e. attitudes of learning theory)? Similarly, the question asks what the librarian
participants ‘individual understanding and knowledge for the definition and application of DL.
The analysis of associated survey (ISQ) and focus group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 1, 2a, 6
and FGQ 5, 6 responses provided the data to answer to the research question.
Participant librarian DL perspectives were broader than those described by faculty. All of the
librarians explained that they have to know about IL concepts as part of the national ACRL

163

standards to be in compliance with ALA simply because the majority of library services and
resources are now managed and provided digitally (SPLA-1 & 8; SPLB- 1 & 15). For example;
“…librarians through training and all conference attendance have to stay up-todate with IL concepts and the incorporation of DIL. To be able to instruct face-toface digital IL activities in the use of the libraries Web 2.0 electronic resources.
Also with the library/institutions online classes providing the embedded librarian
digital services and the institutions Internet live chat student support system”
(SPLA-1)
“… As the library director it is important to be able to understand and provide
instruction for faculty and students in the use of all the libraries and electronic
resources that include the web 20 online materials” (SPLB-1).

Perhaps this is because librarians support all the subject disciplines. Some of the
participant librarians had the dual role of administrator and instructor. This meant that these
dual-hatted individuals were aware of both the institution’s standards, faculty requirements and
students expectations to achieve DL. The task of keeping library services and personnel current
with rapidly changing DL resources was expressed as a challenge but a responsibility needed to
survive in today’s competitive education environment. The analysis of associated survey (ISQ)
and focus group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 1, 2a, 6 and FGQ 5, 6 responses provided the
data to answer research question 2.
Subpart (b) (ii) asks: What is community college librarians’ (library’s) DIL instruction
program? Here again the response data provided a more in-depth perception of the possible
advantages and challenges DL presented at an institution related to faculty members’ DL

164

expectations compared to student learning outcomes. All the librarians’ commentary identified a
belief that DIL is an extension of the IL concept, just in a different mode; that learning and
teaching is carried out via the digital platform. The librarian participants reported that
understanding and adoption of the IL to DL is a concept that libraries and librarians have been
involved with since Zurkowski (1974) initiated the concept. Also, many library information
research and instruction services have been electronically based for a long time. The analysis of
associated survey (ISQ) and focus group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 1, 2a, 6 and FGQ 5, 6
responses provided the data to answer to the research question.
Research Question Subpart (c) with subsections
Research question (1c) asks: What are Arts & Science faculty’ concept of DIL? Digital
information literacy (DIL) is a new concept. So, the expectation was that participants might not
have a clear understanding of DIL. Hence, I wanted to hear from the administrators, faculty and
librarians alike what level of DIL was recognized, and how DIL might currently be incorporated
in a course to enhance student learning outcomes. The analysis of associated survey (ISQ) and
focus group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 7, 8 and FGQ 4 responses provided the data to
answer to the research question.
Few participants had heard of DIL. Applied Science and IT instructors had some idea, but
the English faculty members’ educated opinion expressed DIL as, “educationese” or trendy
jargon and reported that from their perspective digital was the platform or tool. The belief
seemed to be that DIL is a combination of interconnected digital services. The analysis of
associated survey (ISQ) and focus group (FGQ) interview questions ISQ 7, 8 and FGQ 4
responses provided the data to answer to the research question.

165

Subpart (c) (ii) asked: How might faculty & librarian DIL collaboration enhance student
learning outcomes? Faculty, administrators and librarians associated DIL more with a DL
paradigm of incorporation and instruction. The discussion among participants focused on how
the library engaged in more outreach, as collaborative online presentations and training webinars
within the institution. When participants were asked this question directly they felt this was the
chance to voice their ideas and explain the institutions different professional development
training opportunities. Administrators expressed the wish to gain faculty support and continued
commitment to developing further the online class instruction inclusive of more DL programs.
Faculty reiterated the feeling that the institution should take time to be sure the digital
technology infrastructure was properly operationalized before providing it to students.
Librarians want faculty to use the Web 2.0 DL resources and hope students continue to request/
attend the library either in person or virtually. All participants responded that the digital teaching
environment is interconnected across disciplines and job positions; that everyone needs to
support each other and strive for successful adoption and incorporation for enhanced student
learning benefits. The analysis of associated survey (ISQ) and focus group (FGQ) interview
questions ISQ 7, 8 and FGQ 4 responses provided the data to answer to the research question.
Data Analysis
How does epistemological perception bridge the connection between technology skills
and technology self-efficacy? In table 13, it shows the development of inductive reasoning from
the participants’ qualitative responses, and identification of the development of evolving major
themes from all the participants’ open-ended questions in the survey interviews and focus group
responses. Synthesis of context from the responses content identified key points to the main

166

overarching question. Data descriptive statistics and probability of variance are shown in

Table 13. Lists the parent themes as the overarching themes that are a starting point for coding.
Parent Overarching Theme. Understanding: understanding is an overarching theme where
participants are familiar with the concept definition of DL, IL and possibly DIL. Also, that they
comprehend what type of actions are involved for DL, IL and possibly DIL to take place with
instruction and teaching methods. Certain attributes such as student/ class assignments that
incorporate Web 2.0 recourse, library instruction, and embedded librarians for online class
resources are recognized that show when DL and IL might occur.
Major Theme Identified. (1) concept and meanings; how the different faculty,
librarians, and administrators interpreted understanding the concept of DL as it applies to
teaching and learning was a common theme with the most varied perceptions and
comprehension. In the analysis from both sample locations, the two qualitative instruments, the

167

survey interview and focus group responses showed the correlation between understanding IL
concept and meanings for most of the participants. Faculty subject discipline influenced how
confident faculty felt about their DL level of self-efficacy. As such, faculty members from the
more science based subjects, i.e., Math and IT measured DL as being digitally literate on par to
digital fluency with the LMS online Blackboard class program. Therefore, how the faculty
perceive DL self-efficacy is the core factor, whether they interpreted DL as competence with the
LMS online or DL adoption in the form of research and critical thinking as applicable for
teaching their subject matter to achieve the necessary student learning outcomes.
SPLA-1: The thing is it’s not necessarily digital literacy, but information literacy is
definitely an academic standard that is assessed. Digital literacy and digital information
literacy are still so new. To be clear of the term and concept description is why one asks
questions. That is, is it digital literacy instead of information literacy or by having digital
technology the new concept is digital information literacy (administrator/librarian).
SPLA-9: One comment I would make; digital technology has definitely changed the way
I do my job as Dean. The work as an institutional administrator, student administration
has changed into being managed, provided and supported through the digital technology
platform (administrator/faculty).
Major Theme Identified. (2) Cognitive actions and learning; all faculty believed they
were digitally literate to an extent because both institutions use digital technology as part of the
teaching administration and learning platforms in the Blackboard LMS. The English, History,
Sociology, and Psychology faculty were more concerned with subject specific critical thinking as
part of the student learning outcomes. This group expressed a familiarity and preference with the
more traditional IL concept, and is mirrored in the librarians’ responses. In the area of DL and IL

168

cognitive action, there was a degree of separation. The administrators believed that faculty would
follow institution policy whereby using the LMS Blackboard system meant the faculty had a
level of DL. The faculty would decide the scope of how much DL was incorporated included
into instruction, depending on the faculty member’s interpretation that might be simply using the
LMS online class program. On the other hand, the faculty may perceive DL according to the
Digital Literacy Task (2013) force definition to include critical thinking activities and programs,
for example, Web 2.0 research, podcasts and blogs. However, faculty members reported
approximately only a 60% to 40% comprehension of DL beyond the basic LMS online digital
fluency usage that is explained by their perception and lack of DL cognitive activities in
instruction.
SPLA-1: Faculty do cross collaborate with each other, most definitely it’s very much a
team spirit, team effort. The faculty is the lead person, but yes there are still faculty who
don’t necessarily fully appreciate the concept of digital technology and digital
information literacy, that is their belief that digital literacy is not necessarily applicable to
their subject discipline (administrator/ librarian).
SPLA-8: Obviously we are using more and more electronic resources stop i.e. digital
technology. We also provide research guide in the form of “Lib Guides”. Those are
perfect for embedding us into a class online as the information links to particular subject
area for the class-not only what we (the library) do for orientation and research, also
provides information for what professors do as subject content instruction and learning
(instruction librarian).
SPLB-1: I do stress to them when I go to their Faculty members that are ...at meetings,
that they need to let them know when they've given them an assignment, they give them

169

the syllabi that lists all their assignments usually. That they know this is where you can
come for information (administrator/ librarian).
SPLB-16: I'll tell you the ones we have are mostly English, psychology, speech, theater.
Those are mostly the classes we get. Science, Math don't ... No, not really. Mostly those
subjects I mentioned, most of them come in and see what we have and set up orientations.
Yeah, they do (instruction librarian).
Major Theme Identified. (3) Professional development and training; Both institutions
encourage faculty to attend conferences for professional development both to stay current in their
subject disciplines, but also to gain an understanding of new possible digital technology that
would better support DL. Senior administration at both institutions appreciate all personnel needs
to be onboard and understands the implications of properly understanding the concept of DL in
the academic environment. Also 95% of all participants agreed on the need for professional
development training to support faculty, librarians, and personnel to improve their DL
comprehension.
SPLA-1: Also the institution promotes faculty engagement in professional development.
There is regular Blackboard (Bb) training, most faculty do this on an annual basis. In fact,
all faculty has to complete an online training program to learn the system and how to best
develop a class, before they actually then post their class. This is an institutional policy,
because you cannot let someone go and develop a class in an LMS when they don’t know
how to best use or understand the functions of the program. The central office has their
own training programs “TOP or IDDLE” we use our own training which work well for us
and that also have been very successful for adjunct faculty too (administrator/librarian).

170

SPLA-21: To be able to have an online presence all faculty and instruction instructors
have to go through the course and must pass the course to be able to develop and deliver
online instruction. By doing this we have seen a difference in the class structure, there is
consistency in the way classes are developed overall. Therefore, it is a requirement of all
full-time faculty new or otherwise to complete the training course. Regardless of whether
they have taught online elsewhere since we may have different procedures. Faculty have
to show that they are capable of navigating and making proper use of Bb functions to the
fullest advantage of the class content (administrator)
SPLA-9: My job as the Dean is to make sure the faculty have all the tools they need to
make students successful in achieving the learning outcomes. And of course I have to
make sure that the faculty know how to make the best use of these different academic
technology tools we have available for them. So that part of my job is a very, very good
thing, anything that I can provide my faculty with that makes them more effective
teachers with students. The institution provides training and also incorporates the use of
the quality matters (QM) program to show faculty-instructors how to develop well
structured, properly developed online classes that meet the specific learning outcome
criteria for the different subject discipline areas. QM professional training is expensive.
This is provided through the Distance Learning department, who also maintains and
supports the Bb platform for all faculty/adjunct have to successfully complete an online
training component in order to establish their online instruction class environment. This
makes the consistency of structure and content organization as well as training faculty
how to use and interact with all the different Bb functionalities (administrator/faculty).

171

SPLA-19: You know the first couple times, I've done a few things with Quality Matters
and I'm going to be honest about it, I walked in there thinking, "My stuff is good. I've
worked with great instructional designers. My stuff is good", then I sat through the
instructional sessions and I said, "Oh my gosh. I need to do so much alignment." My
stuff is not so great. I do need to work on my stuff, you know, so it was eye opening to
me and I do know I need to work on it. Audrey and I are talking even this year about it
and I said, "If we ever want to get to the point that we are truly quality, we are going to
have to get faculty stipends like we used to when they originally designed it’, this goes
for both higher Ed institutions where I work (adjunct faculty)
SPLB-1: I think, as we both know, faculty could do with some more Professional
Development. Where the faculty meets. It's 4 times a year. Well, everybody meets.
They have committee meetings at that time. I know that they do, do different training's,
and I have been encouraged ... I know when I tried it before, it didn't work. Out of the
15 people who signed up, 4 showed up. But, they have encouraged me to set up, on one
of their All College Days, a time where the Professors can come in, and be shown these
data bases. But, the one's that come to their Library Orientations, already know how to
use the data bases. I can assure you, that when we were meeting, Face Timing, in our
last Consortium Meeting, they were asking, "Who got responses?" And I had gotten 6
or 7 responses out of my faculty. And the others had not. They were very interested in
knowing how my faculty felt about different data bases that we were using, and
considering. I think that I'm doing a pretty good job, about showing them how to use
library electronic resources such as databases. Unfortunately, I do believe it's not that

172

the faculty don't mean to. They have the best of intentions. They just somehow, just
don't seem to have time (administrator/ librarian).
SPLB-16: If I wanted to? I think they would help us out, especially Angel, being that
she's the director, they would be really good about making sure, because she would just
impart it to us. Do you see what I'm saying? They would make sure Angel got what she
needed. They allow in our budget for things like that, so yeah. Again, mostly just
Angel. She went to the West Virginia Library Association meeting, but that's about ...
We don't, she doesn't really get too much of an opportunity to do that. It's not that she
can't, it's mostly budget restrictions (instruction librarian).
Parent Overarching Theme. Incorporation: incorporation is an overarching theme wherein
participants go beyond just the understanding of DL, IL and possibly DIL to actually incorporate
the concept and application of DL and IL activities into their instruction and teaching methods.
The attributes identified show the levels of DL and IL that might occur:
Major Theme Identified. (1) Practical skills; all senior administrators at Mountain One
and Mountain Two stated the importance of having appropriate digital learning lab/distance
learning centers, librarian instructors and labs, and library/technical support and mentoring
available for students. Here administrators, faculty members and librarians’ responses arrived at
a consensus to the extent that they all believe they incorporate some form of DL into their
instruction because the digital technology is how they facilitate both teaching and learning
services. Also, most teaching and learning resources are provided for information distribution
digitally. The institutions offer a range of support and in-house training to help keep faculty and
librarians abreast of new digital technology for both the administrative aspect as well as the

173

teaching end. This happens to be beneficial and a great support resource to faculty that includes
adjunct members.
SPLA-18: Again, everyone here uses Blackboard for face-to-face classes and for online
classes. I really think that for most of us, it’s just become a very seamless part of the way
that we move toward meeting the student learning outcomes. I don’t have any student
learning outcomes that deal with mastering technology. I use the technology to help
students meet those student learning outcomes in literature, composition or technical
writing.
It is true that in the first, say, 30 years ago when composition classes were just beginning
to use Word processing software, some of our student learning outcomes dealt
specifically with the technology. I don’t have any of those anymore and I don’t believe
that anyone else has those. We just assumed that students are going to be ready to go
when they arrive in a freshman comp. That’s not quite true, of course, but it’s an
assumption that’s shared (faculty/senate committee chair).
SPLB-16: Well, probably the ... This probably seems very small and insignificant, but it
matters to me. When the class comes down and has an orientation and the teacher stays
and hears what they hear, I think it helps more. Compared to when the teachers just send
them down and then they don't know what we've told the students I think it holds it back.
They're not using what we've told the kids to help them when they assign the papers or
whatever kind of research they're doing. I know that's being kind of small, but I think
that's important that the teachers know as much as the students are learning, because ...
That's another thing. Some big technology wiz, because I am not, but I try to learn as
much as I can so I help the students, but we have some faculty who are very intelligent,

174

very good teachers. Nothing against that part, but technology-wise, they can't ...well
don’t think about how electronic information resources could be used to the students’
advantage. It’s a small thing but for example rather than students having to come and
make copies of an articles or chapter on reserve we could scan it and distribute it via
email. That would also save the students the copying fees (instruction librarian).
Major Theme Identified. (2) Self-efficacy and personal confidence; Faculty and
students access their materials digitally using the learning management system (LMS). When the
library provides access to the electronic resources and supports IL instruction for learning
information research they utilize the digital platforms, i.e., digital electronic databases, digital
library online catalog, institution’s and student support services website and the LMS system.
Each participant’s reported perception of digital literacy self-efficacy from the brief
questionnaires charted along the scale of self-efficacy and personal competence ranged from 5%
to 99% with the incorporation of DL into methods of instruction.
The questionnaire asked participants to self-assess their DL, IL and DIL technology selfefficacy, reporting the rating as a Likert scale value from one to ten (one is low and ten is high).
A detailed full listing of location A, Mountain One participants sample mean Likert scale selfefficacy responses and location B, Mountain Two participants sample mean Likert scale selfefficacy responses are found in Table 14 and 15 in Appendix F. Participant responses indicate a
variance amongst faculty members’, librarians, and administrators DL, IL and DIL self-efficacy
score values shown in figures 20 and 21.The participants’ DL, IL and DIL self-efficacy selfassessments was investigated in the survey and focus groups.

IL

DIL

At Mountain Two, the librarian group had the highest overall DL, IL and DIL cumulative selfefficacy scores. Comments from the open-ended survey and from focus groups sheds light on the
reasons for the variances. For example;
SPLA-18: I like the phrase appropriate technology. As a student or a faculty member or
as a citizen, don’t give me technology for the sake of technology. Give me technology

176

that allows me to do something efficiently. With computers, we’ve had very, very few
changes since about the late ‘90s. Before that, the rate of change was just incredible.
We’ve gotten to the point, at least with desktops, laptops and tablets, where it’s going to
be pretty hard to substantially improve on what we have.
I did see a book in my e-mail just a few minutes, Open and Integrative: Designing
Liberal Education for the New Digital Ecosystem. It’s from AACU. I did read part of
their excerpt but it does make the argument that technology should be supportive of what
your overall student learning outcomes are instead of vice versa. They used the phrase
digital revolution quite a bit (faculty/senate committee chair).
SPLA-19: So included in the continuation of business plan is that faculty have a class
shell that they do consistently and remain current with posting class materials regardless
of whether school is open or not. The faculty must post materials on snow days or if any
reason the institution i.e. community college site is closed because class-learning must
continue regardless. A problem with this is location-many students still have only basic
technology connection off-campus using “dial-up”. But the class material is posted and
available and accessible online so students who do not have consistent stable online
access from home they are expected to go to the local library or vocational tech centers.
Students are made aware of their different possibilities i.e. where they can find reliable
local Internet access as they are expected to continue their studies on schedule
(administrator/ faculty).
SPLB- 1: We do recommend when they (students) registering for classes, come in here
and get their Student Id's created. We show them some little things about how to log on
to Blackboard, and other such things. Of course, they ask, "What is this?" Its like, "Well,

177

I saw that you had an online course." And then some of them are like, "What?" They
didn't even know they had registered for it. We end up showing them how to go into it.
But ... and we recommend ... that they go in and use it, every day. Until they feel
comfortable with the information literacy resources and digital literacy programs.
Because again, you've got some students that are very comfortable with it, and then
you've got these other students that are not quite ready for that dive in ... that deep of a
pool. The ones that are ready, and are excited, seem to do extremely well
(administrator/librarian/instructor.)
SPLB-15: Well let me say it's a mixed bag. We have a lot of faculty who really use it and
some who don't use it at all. A lot would really like to learn more about using technology
and doing some literacy and research. We have a whole IT class that's devoted to nothing
but internet researching.
I think a big part is the amount of time and the load that faculty have, that they don't
really have enough time to get that comfortable with all that, to go through everything. I
think as level of support increases, they become more comfortable. It's all a factor of time
and support to increase usage. That relates to funding. The ones (instructors) who use it
are pretty comfortable, but there are some who still do not use it at all. They getting more
comfortable at using more technology but there still a learning curve there.
Major Theme Identified. (3) Benefits: both location participants who were institutional
administrators all agreed there were numerous benefits to have the digital technology, which they
also agreed had taken some time to learn but would not be without those digital programs now.
The digital programs provided better communication with speed and accuracy. Also, adding
efficiency to their administrative tasks. Faculty and librarians on the whole would agree with the

178

administrators that the digital technology potentially provided better communication and access
to information. On the other hand, not so much for DL with academic technology because of the
learning curve and all of the different programs in use.
SPLA-9: One comment I would make; digital technology has definitely changed the way
I do my job as Dean. The work as an institutional administrator, student administration
has changed into being managed, provided and supported through the digital technology
platform. We have a particular tool called “Quinn” where I can set up and run queries
(information search questions) across the metadata in the databases. And it will provide
information for me, for example I can see how successful my developmental English
students are as they progress through their other English classes. I’m able to see their
grades, their attendance etc… Which enables me to make informed decisions.
SPLB-16: I do like that a lot of times you can find answers quickly because then that
gives you time to move on to other things and you can even learn more. It's wonderful.
Being one that grew up with a typewriter and now they can change ... They can print out
a paper and it be perfect the first time, where how many times did we have to rip a sheet
out and start totally over, you get halfway through a page and you think, "This looks
terrible, or I didn't indent right." I love all that and I live that they don't have to take all
that time like we did with the Reader's Guide and they can go to the databases and choose
the databases that fit their subject and type in their subject that they want full text, peerreviewed, whatever, and it's there. They have a list. They can just go down through the
list and pick and choose what they want. I like that, so yeah, it's great. It's great!
(Instruction librarian).

179

Major Theme Identified. (3) Limitations: All participants from both locations, whether
administrators, faculty or librarians commented that the DL training that was made available
was not always enough, and expressed the need for more practice time to gain the practical skills
involved with incorporation of DL and IL into methods of instruction. Similarly, all participants
agreed that the possible impact of DL limitations was concerned with student digital technology
self-efficacy as it related to the students’ technology skills and sustainable technology access off
campus. Another potential limitation stems from the local culture, which is a rural low-income
environment. Students may not own or have access to the appropriate technology equipment,
which might be a barrier to student learning and success. Although, a Mountain Two senior
administrator noted; “this has changed somewhat now that the incoming high school students
tend to be more digitally savvy.” While a Mountain One faculty senate member said: with digital
technology learning is and will always be a continuous activity, since digital technology is going
to keep on changing. So we must change with it.”
SPLA-1: Our students are a great mixture of the very modern and the not so modern.
Then in that many of them like to print off the class information/materials/reports. They
still like the effect of having hard copy to put into a binder and study from these paper
materials (administrator/ librarian).
SPLA-8: Other classes such as STV 108 and including English 111 and 112 most of the
instructors are supportive of the library. What happens with our students is the library is
included in these classes so by the time students get to English 112 they might be sick of
the library. We are hitting them pretty constantly and they/the students’ sort of shutdown.
They feel they’ve had enough library instruction as this particular group of students get
hit hard.

180

SPLA-18: Two points. Number one, with schools in the Southern Association
accreditation area, we have to verify that for most of those assignments online or in class,
for that matter, that the person completing the assignment is actually the person enrolled
in the class. In a society where, and at Mountain One community college, it’s not unusual
for parents to want to sit in the class with their 17 or 18-year-old children.
A faculty comment on students’ attitude with digital technology and learning. I was
talking to a faculty member on Wednesday. She was saying it’s they don’t want to think.
They’re just happy. “Oh, well. It’s all out there in electronic la-la land. They don’t need
to worry about it,” and trying to get them to understand that they would actually be better
and stronger if they didn’t rely on the technology alone (faculty/senate committee chair).
SPLA-19: Okay, so a limitation where DL is non beneficial and students might find it a
barrier. Well, the only way I can imagine that it would be non-beneficial for a student is
if that student just had zero experience with technology and became overwhelmed in
trying to use it. But that rarely, rarely happens. It's usually just adult learners who
struggle a little.
Because they have to do a test or whatever and they get timed out because they don't have
a very good connection. I think that that's just a little bit the type of students and the area
that we live in. That can be an issue as well, them saying they don't have access but you
know, I've just learned to respond to mine and say, "I expect you to go to where you'll
have reliable connection." Then that becomes a new issue when I say, you know, "You
can usually drive 30 minutes down the road and find good connection."
SPLA-21: Even though the tutorials are out there and all the face-to-face instructors’
kind of go over that with their students, I think it's still kind of, a learn as you need to

181

kind of thing. We probably don't do as much of that as I would like for us to do, I'll be
honest. That's just from a lack of hands, lack of resources, from a staffing perspective, but
with regard to if they don't have the technology at home, most of our, if not all, of our
courses that utilize video lectures, we actually burn to DVDs and the students can check
those out free of cost. So that if they don't have reliable internet or they don't have highspeed internet or they don't have a computer, then they can check out the DVDs, and
keep up with the syllabus, and watch them at home (administrator/ instruction/ technical
support).
SPLB-1: I think that we need to come to terms with ... there is a level of comfort that
students sometimes will not go beyond. They will go so far, and then stop. It's almost as
if, the younger generation still wants to Google, but will only go through, like the first 2
or 3 pages of the Google searches. The older generation, prefers to use the data bases.
What I'm doing is spending a whole lot of time getting everybody on to the data bases.
Well, I've found that what I was constantly telling the students is, "Okay, I know that
you're going to Google. I know that you're going to Dog Pile, or whatever it might be that
you use. But, when you use the data bases, it pin-points. It gets rid of all the
advertisements, and it gets rid of all the things that are not peer reviewed (administrator/
librarian).
SPLB-15: Sometimes it (digital technology) makes it too easy to access information.
They (students) tend to find versus think. That ease of find (digital technology) makes
them (students) in acquiring and retaining knowledge. I (student) don't have to know it. I
just have to be able to find it. I think that is an issue with technology that has
handicapped in some way the current population of kids.

182

Then of course in Appalachia, we do have that barrier and keeping current with it. A
perfect example is a student right now that is taking an online class. Calls and says, "I
don't have internet service at home." That was the second example was going to be.
She's taking a Microsoft Office 2013 class or 2016 class. She has Windows XP and can't
load Office on her machine (administrator/ instruction/ technical support).
SPLB-16: I feel like sometimes they don't have to do as much research. It's all at their
fingertips and so I don't know how much they really are taking in other than just copy and
paste and just reword it a couple of ... You know what I mean?
Hmm. It kind of goes with what I said earlier. It almost makes it too easy for them. A lot
of times I feel like they're not finding the information themselves, it's just handed to
them. Just like me, if I want to know something I just Google it, instead of like I used to
have to do, look it up, and study it out or ask people, or ... You know, it's so much easier
now, which is a good thing, but sometimes I think it limits you because it doesn't make
you exercise your brain or your critical thinking or anything like that (instruction
librarian).
Parent Overarching Theme. Adoption: participants have a well-perceived understanding of
DL, IL and possibly DIL and include the concept and application of DL and IL activities into
their instruction and teaching methods. The attributes identified demonstrate the sort of influence
DL and IL adoption might bring, plus its perceived impact.
Major Theme Identified. (1) Self-efficacy and personal competence; at both locations,
the respective librarians, and all faculty/ instructors participants identified the challenges of DL
adoption in the institution environment. All the administrators, faculty and librarians and support
personnel agreed that for positive DL adoption, the infrastructure for support and maintenance

183

must be available, participants also agreed that institutional leaders should also take a unified
approach when the teaching members recognize barriers to DL and IL comprehension.
SPLA-19: They also have worked with faculty to use the Quality Matters as a
professional development to support faculty in developing well-structured online classes.
Although Dr. PQR was saying he doesn't like or dislike what... His personal choice is he
doesn't think Quality Matters is quite as wonderful as some people say that it is. Were
you given an opportunity to do that with them?
You know we haven't talked about using Quality Matters and I would be interested in
doing that but the problem for me is as a faculty member when I'm asked to update my
courses using something as amazing as Quality Matters, I'm just not going to do it unless
they compensate me to develop the course (adjunct faculty).
Major Theme Identified. (2) Non-cognitive value and content; Much of the faculty by
reason of their subject discipline already have adopted DL as part of their instruction. Most other
subject discipline areas are updating their curriculum with a caveat that all students also need to
understand DL and have DL self-efficacy in order to succeed, and achieve the necessary student
learning outcomes. Faculty members had concerns about digital technology suport for DL, and if
DL provides value for student learning outcomes, and students’ digital literacy self-efficacy.
When recognizing students personal level of DL self-efficacy as a possible barrier for learning
the subject matter to achieve the respective student learning outcomes.
SPLA-21: We've recently kind of transitioned our previous orientation model, which was
an actual 1-credit course, an SDV 100, and we used to kind of do that and work in some
of the student services side and kind of go that direction. We recently have transitioned it
as part of our QEP to incorporate critical thinking, and that's kind of our focus for the

184

next five years, at least, to kind of integrate that and move that up through some
additional courses as well, but that's the introduction to it. I think as we look at the results
and we look at the interaction from those things, I think we'll see that a lot of those
students that don't have those digital literacy skills, it's going to pop up a lot earlier
because of the increased demands in that SDV class. Academic and more content based
with regard to an academic topic as opposed to college skill topics, so I think those digital
literacy needs are going to become a whole lot more front and center because it's going to
pop up earlier. I think a natural thing to do with that is to incorporate some digital literacy
into the SDV. I don't know that we have room in a 1-credit course packed full with
critical thinking (administrator/ instruction/ technical support).
SPLA-1: Another one of the digital technology programs that is very useful is an early
alert program called “Starfish” that alerts faculty and myself as Dean when a student for
whatever the reason seems to be struggling with their class work. That way reach out to
the student to find out what seems to be causing the challenge they are experiencing with
class work, missed attendance et cetera. This program has made a great difference and it
allows for direct contact between faculty and student to give kudos, also making the
student aware that we are concerned about you as a person. Letting the student know that
individually each one of them matters, using email as the communication connection
beyond what is considered regular class communication. Leading the student know you is
the faculty are there for them, faculty can reach out and invite students to come and see
them in person to offer that support (administrator/faculty).
Major Theme Identified. (3) Motivation and policy; both sample locations encourage
faculty/ instructors to attend professional development, provide in-house training and support

185

dedicated days for all personnel to attend training workshops to improve the DL adoption levels
and standards. For example at Location A there is a requirement, even for instructors of the face
to face classes, for all faculty and adjuncts must complete a Blackboard online course shell. In
comparison location B faculty are still in the growth stage of establishing the adoption of DL
across all the different academic and instructional technical programs.
Motivation
SPLA-9: Digital literacy is a general education outcomes standard in [the state in which
Mountain One is located] there are actually learning standards, digital literacy being one
of them. From the aspect of the administrator the digital technology is very useful in
helping to gather a lot of data together in a timely fashion, to be able to organize it
creatively by demonstrating descriptive data graphically. Since with the generation of
assessment reports will show how the institution is meeting the [system] as well as state
performance measures.
So that is why I’m gonna be putting my money, into the types of digital programs and
training that will fulfill this mission. After all it’s because of the students that we are here.
If we can’t take care of the students then we might as well go home, students are why it
says college on the sign (administrator/faculty).
SPLA-21: I think it absolutely impacts the learning outcomes because if that digital
literacy level is low, and that includes environmental barriers that we have a
tremendous amount of in our area, which is the lack of high-speed internet or any
internet at all, or a computer, or dependable device. They absolutely, we often see that
students that come from parts of our service region that don't have those advantages as
a standard, they have to come to campus more, and they have to put forth more effort to

186

develop those skills and to utilize those technologies. It's a delicate balance and I think
it's kind of hat's off to our faculty because they have to balance both sides of that
spectrum and keep it as equal as they can (administrator/ instruction/ technical
support).
SPLB-17: The speed of education has tremendously increased because of the technology
environment we are in right now. It is a very demanding situation and apparent that the
faculty because of students’ digital literacy ability and expectancy means
faculty/instructors must be digitally literate themselves and incorporate as much as
possible into their instruction process. Also tying it into the specific learning outcomes
they have written into their syllabus. The more of this they (the faculty) can do I think the
more higher learning will take place. Keeping the student engaged in the classroom
regardless if online or face-to-face is an imperative (senior administrator).
SPLB-18: There are a combination of ways we encourage our faculty, instructors and all
personnel to stay current with the new digital technology. From in-house on-site training
workshops to different institution wide programs. For example, Governance day and
Convocation day. Since it is apparent that to be able to compete with other colleges for
student enrollment the institution, programs and faculty are going to have to develop
more programs and services using the digital platform. Therefore, all of us are going to
have to be more DL adept (senior administrator).
Policy:
SPLA-18: I think, and the VCCS is partly responsible for this, they keep pushing
students, faculty and staff toward “mobile apps.” They really want students to be able to
take the entire gamut of online classes with their phones. It’s just not possible to do a

187

composition class that way.
SPLB-1: We, in this State, our Chancellor of Community Colleges, in this past year, has
asked the Academic Librarians of the Community Colleges to meet and to create a
consortium. We have all agreed that we would study these data bases and these sites, and
that we would go with what the majority liked. Last year, and definitely this year. They
(faculty) still want to see that the resources are provided, but obviously, they're looking
for ... if I may use the phrase, "their best bang for the buck."
SPLA-21: We have an online teaching policy for our instructors, so every instructor that
teaches at Mountain One community college, be it adjunct or full time, is required or
supposed to have a presence in our LMS, or learning management system, which is
Blackboard, at least one course each semester. Now, we don't have a mandate that
requires instructor to use Blackboard in all the courses or anything like that, but we
instituted the online teaching policy so that everyone can keep up their skills to a
minimum degree of posting. It actually says to posting grades, a syllabus, and
announcements is the minimum required for that utilization, for at least one course each
term. Then, they also have to take an ITE 198 class, which is taught out of the distance
learning and instructional technology area, which is a 1-credit, basic, kind of introduction
to Blackboard and online teaching class (administrator/ instruction/ technical support).
SPLA-18: We are each other’s strongest supporters and allies. Our Southern Association
Quality Enhancement Plan for 2016 through at least 2021 deals with critical thinking.
They were an integral part of planning and implementing that Quality Enhancement Plan.
We came up with our own definition of critical thinking. The first part of it was
collecting data. We had a big fight over this term which the librarians say is used by

188

librarians nationwide. The term is relevant. We were making the point that the library’s
role in this critical thinking initiative would be “more relevant.” A lot of people didn’t
like that. I think that most humanities and social science faculty members have their
students in the library for an orientation and they’re using current refereed sources in
their sociology and psychology classes and history classes. The librarians collaborate
willingly. Sometimes, they push us to be more academic (faculty/senate committee
chair).
Summary
The chapter aimed at documenting the results of rigorous and detailed analysis of the
three data collection instruments utilized in this research project. A constant comparison
approach was used to identify concepts and themes (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). I also reviewed
institutional reports, state and governing documents for comparison. Analysis of participants’
responses to the research questions developed themes that emerged and allowed for framing of
relationships between the participants’ perception of digital literacy (DL) and the focus of DL
adoption in teaching. The hermeneutic cycle of examination of the study’s data showed to what
extent the influences of digital ecology had on all participants (Laverty, 2003). What became
clear is that the action of digital literacy adoption and incorporation impacts institutional
administrators, faculty and librarians uniformly. The research meta-data shows how faculty
members and librarians DL/IL attitudes of learning are the moderators working in unison for the
students’ best interests towards achieving learning goals. Faculty who collaborated with
librarians were more conversant with the concept of DL and IL, since they were already actively
incorporating it into their curriculum. An underlying factor that did show up is that DL selfefficacy gets confused with digital fluency, i.e., computer fluency skills.

189

Amid the rhetoric of participants’ responses, the core thread weaving throughout is the
importance of student learning outcomes success. This finding makes sense since colleges
“raison d’être” is the student. The response data indicated that to some extent faculty and
students’ opinion of the library and its resources are trapped in the old reputation, which
overshadows the transformation of libraries and electronic resource services to the new Web 2.0
digital technology. The inference drawn is that faculty and students’ interpretation of DL is often
limited to the LMS blackboard digital technology. Many have not used the libraries Web 2.0
resources, and have no idea of all of the benefits. This behooves the library to reach out to the
administration for collaboration with faculty through forums such as the faculty Senate and
institutional workshops to demonstrate the learning outcome value tied to the library Web 2.0
engagement. Chapter 5 describes the findings from the meta-analysis of the survey interviews
and focus group responses aimed at providing a holistic picture of faculty DL adoption in
education via answers to the three research questions and sub-questions.

190

Chapter 5
Discussion
Summary: This chapter connects a summary of the study, which highlights pertinent
conclusions drawn from data presented in Chapter 4, with the literature review. The overview of
the problem is the scant amount of research that addresses the issue of how the phenomenon of
digital literacy (DL), with academic technology (AT), influences faculty members’ and
community college librarians’ inclusion or non-inclusion in instruction, and whether DL
adoption improves student learning outcomes for community college students.
Purpose. This study addresses faculty members’ attitudes of learning (i.e., epistemology)
and DL adoption, with AT inclusion, while teaching and understanding incorporation of DIL in
higher learning. It examined two community colleges in Virginia and West Virginia, located in
rural areas in which digital technology and digital literacy present challenges to implement in
educational contexts. A mixed method of quantitative and qualitative approaches was applied
because of the abstract human-perception variables under study; the researcher sought the
meaning and experiences of individuals concerning a phenomenon (Patton, 2002). Purposeful
sampling was used to identify participants, and included completion and analysis of three
instruments—a brief questionnaire online, an open-ended survey interview, and focus groups—
during which triangulation was used with all three instruments meta-data.

Summary and Discussion of Findings
The big picture findings are that all sample participants surpassed Rogers (2003) chasm
measurement using Gladwell’s (2000) espoused tipping point eligible standard, indicated by the
quantitative data. The effect of participants’ digital literacy (DL) perspectives and self-efficacy
are demonstrated by espoused theories. The individual’s espoused theories affected to what
measure participants incorporate DL into their subject discipline and instruction. As the data
showed a basic level of DL was expected since both sample institutions required all faculty and
librarians to incorporate the digital literacy technology, namely the LMS blackboard online class
and subject content instruction materials. Therefore, participants explained their DL perception
measurement of self-efficacy depended on individual DL paradigm interpretation. Also, the
relative value of adopting DL concept incorporation into pedagogy was aligned to the subject

192

discipline. The difference is the difference in opinion where English, sociology, psychology
faculty had already adopted DL as an extension of the IL paradigm. Whereas Math, IT and
general science faculty did not believe DL defined as DIL to be relevant to the discipline and
student learning outcomes. The library is in the position to allay any possible tension from these
differences providing the subject specific DL instruction, general access, instruction and
mentoring for DL. Since much of the library’s information and services are digitally based via
Web 2.0. One surprising factor was that the sample librarians’ perception of the DL/DIL concept
and definition considered the ACRL standards of IL as the learning paradigm, and that the IL
epistemology had just been transferred onto the digital platform environment. When asked why
both location librarians answered that in response to the student constituents level of DL, selfefficacy knowledge and adoption is in a constant state of flux. Students are easily influenced by
transience of technology trends, thus, responding to the sudden and intense technology
innovation is a constant work in progress for the institution, faculty, librarians and student body.
On the positive side, from the point of view of both the institution, faculty and librarians
where DL with academic technology promote student learning outcomes at the fundamental
level. Students have greater accessibility through digital technology also supporting program
services sustainability of the continuous learning institutional policies. On the negative side
faculty and librarians are among the primary contacts with the students’ work to achieve student
learning successes. In a balance of the pros with the cons value of DL the inference is the
benefits of DL demonstrated through digital information literacy is thought outweigh any
particular drawbacks.
The institutions continue to work on providing consistent infrastructure support in
training, IT helpdesk and digital technology online class development. The faculty members and

193

librarians are encouraged to use these resource avenues. When challenges arise there are
mechanisms in place to help resolve the issues will stop however, transience of technology and
DL adoption area is attributed to faculty feeling pressured to having to develop online class
materials. When in the faculty members’ judgment either that subject content or their students’
academic DL self-efficacy is not up to par for achieving the necessary student learning
outcomes.
A parting thought from the librarians at location A, is that in the long term the digital
technology influence would subsume the physical presence of the library, personnel and possibly
hardcopy. Ultimately, the library would go to a virtual information clearinghouse. I disagree with
this prediction because in the learning environment students all have varying abilities to
understand and use DL successfully. From more than 20 years of experience in the education
field, and in library instruction and digital development, my observation is that technology
remains the program tool and a platform by which learning and teaching is made more
accessible, while students better understand by showing and learn by practice.
A hallmark of American community colleges is to assert their prevalence and status of
preeminence for diffusion of digital innovation in global higher education. Bertand (2010) refers
to what Bates (2000) calls barriers of inertia as “techno-sclerosis of higher education” (p. 1),
challenging American academia to become more technologically applied and international by
conducting a meta-analysis and redesigning digital, technology-delivered higher education.
Scholarly groups such as the Babson Research Center (BRC), Educause, Lumina, and the
Community College Research Center (CCRC) identify many institutional and faculty digital
literacy (DL) barriers with academic technology as legitimate issues that can be overcome
(Lumina Foundation, 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2015;), though they do not agree with Bertrand’s

194

(2010) negative critical assessment of faculty and the higher education system. In contrast to
Bertrand’s criticism, the current study’s findings demonstrate transformation, expressed by an
institution’s administration, faculty members’, and librarians’ perceptions of DL, as positive
change to an accepted congruent level of understanding and self-efficacy. The development is
improvement to Bertrand’s implied lack of faculty member and librarian DL inclusion, which
occurs through a combination of daily academic administration and more DL incorporation in
online instruction—namely Blackboard online classes used across most discipline curricula.
Faculty members and librarians, particularly librarians SPLA-1, SPLA-7, SPLB-1, SPLB-15, and
administrators SPLA-21 and SPLB-17, commented that they still have concerns about DL
adoption relative to students’ demographics, similar to the BRC, Educause, and Gates
Foundation studies, not so much regarding faculty barriers, but of limited time to practice new
applications and learn new DL programs before they get implemented into the institutional
infrastructure, and concerning student accessibility to reliable digital technology and Internet
(Scott-Clayton, 2011; Johnson et al., 2015). Participants’ individual years of service, gender and
professional development demographic was not a specific element of the research questions. On
the other hand, empirical analysis of participant's individual disciplines questionnaires data sets
assessed perceptions of DL, IL, and DIL, providing self-efficacy scores based on a Likert-type
scale (1 through 10; 10 is highest) the detailed tables 18 and 19 is found on Appendix F. The
research data provided new evidence of how the previously unknown administrator, faculty
members and librarians DL, IL and DIL self-efficacy reported vales on the normal distribution
curve when compared to Rogers and Gladwell Tipping point standard exceed the standard
eligibility value.

Tipping point

Figures 22 and 23 demonstrates that both Mountain One and Mountain Two sample
locations discipline values distribution with Rogers and Gladwell Tipping point standard.
Considering Rogers’ (2003) diffusion of innovation bell curve, Gladwell’s (2002) study
suggests that when a phenomenon under investigation surpasses what Rogers calls the “chasm”
(i.e., passing 18% to 20%), a tipping point is achieved (p. 24, Figure 3). In the current study, the
number of participants who reported DL perceptions and self-efficacy ratings above the median
surpassed that tipping point. The inference is that both locations achieved an overall institutional

196

tipping point for DL adoption. By tipping point, I mean that at the two locations, most
administrators, faculty and librarian participants considered themselves digitally literate by
incorporating both DL and IL into their instruction, thus meeting a recognizable, basic degree of
digital information literacy (DIL) adoption. These basic DL actions include a library’s digital
electronic resources, Web 2.0 online catalogs plus databases, and use of the LMS-Blackboard for
online classes. This finding accords with Kurzweil’s (2011) prediction, which has since been
corroborated with a recent Pew Research Center study, that 60% of experts forecast that by 2020,
the Internet and digital technology will have a positive influence on education (Poushter, Bell, &
Oates, 2015).
Allen et al. (2012) and the Gates Foundation (2015) imply that inclusion of DL with AT
as a component of curricula and faculty syllabi in higher education continues to be sporadic.
However, the studies used limited two-year community college data, and the basis for results was
faculty types of AT frequency, not DL self-rated efficacy and adoption (Allen et al., 2012, June;
Gates foundation, 2015). DL development is a core factor in AT that leads to DL competency
and individual self-efficacy for faculty, educators, and librarian professionals (Covello, 2010,
Head, 2013). As the questionnaire, interviews, and focus groups demonstrated, administrators,
faculty members, and librarians in both groups reported overall strong personal confidence with
IL, and self- rated efficacy for DL in the broader sense. Considering the structure of the groups,
everyone was involved in a socio-technology environment that contains both human and digital
technology resources, and thus personal self-efficacy influences the individuals’ perceptions.
Each person draws support from one another to support both DL initiatives and self-efficacy
(Bandura, 1989), but the current focus is on differences and links between these groups within
the major groups of faculty members and librarians, and thus synthetic, ad-hoc groups might

197

occur whereby internal group members support, coach, and develop the degrees and types of DL
deemed useful to a discipline, curriculum, and learning outcome. For example, SPLA faculty
members group were more inclined to incorporate DL, and explained that IL had been adopted
into their instruction.

Adoption

Since the inception of IL 40 years ago (Zurkowski, 1974), humanities faculty members,
particularly those involved with English, speech, and sociology, have included IL and

198

interactions/collaborations with librarians as an active component of curricula because the
critical-thinking component enhances student learning outcomes. Now that the institution has
adopted more digital technology through Blackboard, general studies and nursing programs have
adopted DL with critical thinking, making them DIL.
Among the group members, a small contingent identified subject discipline as the primary reason
for lack of inclusion of IL or DIL with library electronic resources and services, but that they
were digital literate since they used the LMS Blackboard online class program and some Web
2.0 resources relevant to their subjects such as Khan Academy and YouTube videos. SPLB
faculty members expressed subject discipline as the primary reason for lack of inclusion of IL or
DIL with the library electronic resources and services, but that they were digitally literate since
they used the LMS Blackboard online class program and some Web 2.0 resources relevant to
their subjects such as Khan Academy and YouTube videos. Humanities faculty members from
both locations expressed being digitally literate, at Mountain Two the range of DL and IL selfefficacy was a higher score than at Mountain One. Table 19 show the participants reported
identified perception of DL, IL and DIL understanding, incorporation and adoption self-efficacy
in the different categories into instruction and relates to the major themes identified in chapter 4.
What did come to light during the data analysis is that at both locations certain participants’
classifications made them fit simultaneously into two of the groups, i.e., administration and
faculty, or faculty and librarian. The mediating factor between an administrator/faculty
participants was the moderating attribute of institutional policy, and the mediating factor for
faculty and librarians was the same moderating factor that basic DL and IL inclusion occurred
because of using the LMS. Hence, the overall effect remains the same that the findings
demonstrate both locations met the DL adoption tipping point standard (Gladwell, 2000).

199

Discussion of Major Themes
A review of the literature revealed that although extensive research has been conducted
related to the practice and inclusion of IL with instruction and class assignments the situation is
not similar for DL. Significant gaps exist regarding understanding of relationships among
foundational concepts, individual beliefs, and practical theories-in-use for DL. Questions remain
concerning how faculty members and librarians perceive DL and its practical theories-in-use
since they might shape instruction initiatives. This study examined these relationships, adding to
the literature by providing an explanation for some of the complexities that faculty members and
librarians face during DL inclusion and/or adoption while teaching. The previous chapter
describes research findings in relation to the major research questions and sub-questions, and the
data analysis builds toward understanding diverse DL perceptions and practical theories-in-use
relationships that faculty members, librarians, and administrators attribute to DL, IL, and DIL.
Varied definitions of DL are reflective of its contradictory nature and the incongruence found in
its current definition.
Understanding concepts and meaning of DL, IL, and DIL. The definition of DL is
inclusive of IL since IL applies to the digital technology format. Therefore, a digitally literate
person can perform tasks effectively in a digital environment. Literacy includes the ability to
read and interpret media, reproduce data and images through digital manipulation, and evaluate
and apply new knowledge gained from digital environments (Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan,
2006). IL is a set of abilities that requires individuals to recognize when information is needed,
have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use the needed information effectively (American
Library Association, 2000, p. 2). For example, SPLA-7, an instruction librarian, reported that

200

she believed that DL is synonymous with digital information fluency and DIL since they are all a
subset of each other, requiring the same types of skills in use in digital technology programs.
Cognitive actions and learning. Gunton, Bruce, and Davis (2015) suggest differences
contrast in the relational approach of IL instruction and more recent incorporation of DL
relationships between learners and faculty members/instructors. Learning is experienced as
iterative sharing of information and skills since teaching represents a sharing of knowledge as
both multimodal and multidirectional. Simultaneously, instructors learn from student
experiences during instruction (Gunton et al., 2015). IL and DL are not competitors; they are
complementary, whose concepts interconnect closely for higher education faculty and students.
DL concepts and skills provide the fundamentals of managing digital environments that students
need to succeed with IL and other areas of study. DIL is the application of IL standards and
skills with digital technologies (Cordell, 2013). For example, SPLB-16, an instruction librarian,
concurred, adding that many students still do not understand or grasp how to use the library’s
electronic Web 2.0 resources, though they are millennials and generation X, Y and Z group and
are tech savvy, but are still digital learners. SPLA-1, a library director, stated that IL is the parent
term of DIL, where DL is the congruent concept and skill for both IL and DL.
Professional development and training. When discussing the possibilities of
professional development, participants at both locations explained that they offer a variety of
avenues that faculty and adjunct faculty can take advantage of, including off-site state and
discipline-appropriate conferences, in-house training workshops, and professional all-day events.
Location B annually conducts all-day training events called governance day, during which all
institutional personnel must attend in person. The event offers a forum for discourse, training,
and collaborative DL troubleshooting, and demonstration and instruction of new DL programs.

201

Collins (2014) suggests that when institutional leaders provide infrastructure for collaborative
training such as faculty training centers or workshop events, they produce positive results,
establishing valuable connections among faculty members, librarians, and personnel who support
each other’s online and DL endeavors. Both locations’ participants confirmed this argument.
One aspect that emerged that was not obvious from empirical data was faculty members’
experiences with institutional initiatives to incorporate quality matters (QM) as a class online
training tool to achieve consistently high standards for online classes. Faculty members reported
mixed reviews regarding discipline content assessment benefits of QM evaluations. Conversely,
they also reported that students who completed QM-reviewed LMS classes completed the classes
more often, a positive reaction that led deans and directors to consider tracking such results
longitudinally. One dean explained that QM programs are expensive, and faculty members
reported that QM training is time-consuming, and continued budget cuts prevent renewal of QM
programs. However, in-house faculty members and personnel who completed the training could
advise and collaborate with colleagues concerning online class content and structure. Using the
QM program had a positive effect on production and continuity of structure across disciplines,
and offered consistently high standards of class content presentation.
Incorporation
Practical skills of incorporating DL, IL, and DIL. Kurzweil (2011) posits that by the
1990s, computer and Internet technology revolutions occurred faster than Moore’s (1965) law of
exponential development, and by 2005, the world approached a technology tipping point.
Considering the positive influences of new technology, digital advances improve
communication—the ability to connect over great distances with accuracy and speed— thus
enabling global community members to communicate (Kurzweil, 2011). Incorporation of new

202

DL concepts of AT applications in existing institutional cultures influences an organization’s
information transfer cycle, which begins with basic assumptions and moves to espoused values
and artifacts that include information systems incorporation (Schein, 1985, p. 57, Figure 9). For
example, SPLA-7, a professor of sociology and director of international outreach, agreed with
this statement since he had studied and taught abroad, and uses the Internet and digital
technology to maintain international connections. By using technology and incorporating DL,
students benefit from diverse learning and are introduced to the global community.
Self-efficacy and personal competence. Bruce and Hughes (2010) and Belshaw (2012)
argue that incorporation of IL influences a person’s learning of computer fluency, and the ability
to comprehend information in the form of DL self-efficacy. So much information is produced
and processed digitally that DIL is becoming the new norm (Belshaw, 2012; Bruce & Hughes,
2010). Participants reported demographics that included teaching experience, and years of work
in higher education, age, and subject disciplines used to assist with the DL, IL and DIL literacy
categories self-efficacy interpretation among the administrator, faculty member and librarians’
group classification, since this was relevant to the theory model of the study and research
questions (p. 15, Figure 4). Both Bandura (1989) and Bourantas (2008) posit that a person’s use
of digital technology correlates with his/her DL, DIL, and DIL perceptions and self-efficacy,
influencing effort expended on and persistence with an action. Current results suggest that both
locations expect faculty members and librarians to maintain and support online instruction
through the LMS Blackboard system. Therefore, it is unsurprising that all participants reported
reasonable DL self-efficacy and personal competence. At both locations, gender distributions
were similar, but experience with teaching ranged from new faculty members to more than 20
years in higher education. DL inclusion in instruction was a personal choice relative to

203

discipline, self-efficacy, and DL competence reported in Chapter 4 findings (Figures 14 through
19).
Benefits and limitations. Cunha and Heckman (2008) argue that being digitally literate
does not automatically mean that a person has DL self-efficacy in an academic environment.
Lea (2013) explains that learning technologies and academic literacies occupy contested space.
DL, IL, and DIL interconnect if only because they are all action processes conducted on a digital
platform. Except for basic skills, all three are interchangeable, but self-efficacy and learning
concerning knowledge comprehension are not. Although using an LMS (e.g. Blackboard)
affords a person reasonable DL capabilities due to being part of an online classroom
environment, areas of self-efficacy still require support and instruction. Therefore, when face-toface classes are partnered with LMS online classes, they require greater DL support. Using IL is
a much better, low-stakes introduction to digital information formats, in which students learn to
grasp the basics of Web 2.0 resources such as database searches and critical thinking
(Jumonville, 2014). SPLA-15 from Mountain One pointed this out regarding developmental
math and English. When the college generated a report to review student success, it became
apparent that students needed added face-to-face time in digital labs while completing DL
assignments, with faculty members and help-desk mentors present. Once the college combined
these two resources, students showed much improvement.
Adoption
Perceptions of adoption of DL, IL, and DIL. Rogers (2003) argues that people adopt
new technology at varying rates. The speed of adoption follows a bell curve, during which the
primary difference is an individual’s psychological disposition to innovation. An individual
passes through four stages during decision-making, from knowledge of an innovation, to

204

persuasion (i.e., attitude formation and change), the decision to adopt or reject, and confirmation.
Rogers (2003) suggests that diffusion of technology transformation has measurable areas such as
relative advantages, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability, and thus
application of DL adoption relates to individual acceptance. Therefore, people unofficially selfselect into internal groups such as innovators, users, technologically savvy, and DL technology
support. These groups are interdependent, and characteristics that define to which group a
person belongs remain constant, but a person can, by professional development training or
personal interest, move or change to another group. There is fluidity that is in this case dictated
by DL adoption and/or innovations since the defining trait is self-efficacy and confidence in DL
adoption and use during instruction. For example, both SPLA-7 and SPLA-16 reported that
when working with students on assigned projects, they required DL skills and collaboration with
faculty members by providing step-by-step DIL library information guides that could be
embedded into online classes for student reference. They thus made discovery of Web 2.0
resources both more accessible to faculty members and easier for students. SPLB-17 said that
much the same occurred with students when instructing them on IL for assignments that used DL
actions.
Non-cognitive value and content. Since general education courses form the foundation
of education in the humanities, IL inclusion of DL might bridge the gap across discipline
boundaries (Rockman, 2004; Ragains 2006). The newest forms of DL are recognized as
multimodality that incorporate a combination of lecture-style formats and material, digital Web
2.0 resources for the Internet, and LMS online class programs (Baran, 2013; Clement, 2012a, &
Lea, 2013). Expanding on the idea of DL inclusion beyond general education courses provides
students with the ability and opportunity to gain in-depth subject knowledge, think critically, and

205

act creatively in a modern digital environment (Wesch, 2011). All participants were agreeable to
the benefits of online LMS classes offering students accessibility to subject matter, and that
faculty can use this modality to maintain a continuous learning environment, though there were
concerns regarding DL self-efficacy of students in rural environments due to low incomes and
underserved demographics (Scott-Clayton, 2011, 2012).
Motivation and policy. At the institutional level, motivation for DL adoption has dual
relevance and potential. An institution must develop and maintain a DL infrastructure in
accordance with state and accreditation agency standards. Participants from Mountain One
explained that their state’s policies include a DL standard, and therefore the institution chose to
develop and initiate a DL policy as part of the state’s directive on continuous learning. Mountain
Two does not have a specific policy since it is reviewing and developing a strategic plan that
considers the future vision of the institution. The senior administrator expressed the importance
of digital technology platforms as a means of providing higher education, and the hope that
through greater DL training, high-quality DL instruction programs will be made available to the
student body. One motivational force is that DL training for faculty members and personnel will
enhance individual DL self-efficacy to produce polished educational materials comparable to
contemporary business community standards, improving the institution’s reputation and
providing digitally enhanced information that will attract and improve student enrollment.
Another aspect of DL program inclusion and adoption is the positive effect software
programs offer when engaging in information administrative actions. Senior administrators,
deans, and library directors stated that digital programs enhance the efficacy of information
collection and assessment, and make creating and running information query reports and tracking
any type of data much easier. All institutional personnel need to be trained and know that DL

206

support is available, but digital technology also gives administrators, faculty members, and
librarians’ instant access to student and class instructional data. Senior administrators at both
institutions appreciated, regardless of whether people are classified as faculty members,
librarians, and adjunct instructors that all personnel need to be on board and understand the
implications of DL in academic environments. The expectation is for faculty members and
librarians to maintain subject-relevant DL self-efficacy. Mountain One expects faculty members
to attend an in-house DL online training program to demonstrate DL self-efficacy regarding their
ability to prepare online class shells, an institutional policy that confirms that faculty members
can navigate the LMS Blackboard system, and ensures a reasonable standard of class content
preparation and structure. There is also an implication of ensuring that students who attend
classes online receive quality instruction and reliable faculty interactions to achieve learning
outcomes and complete online classes. Mountain One’s dean reiterated tracking this policy
during the past three years, reporting that most faculty members had completed the online
training course, but a few outliers had not managed to prepare an online shell that coordinated
their face-to-face syllabi with instruction materials. She mentioned that it is no longer an option,
and faculty members are told to become compliant with the institution’s policy. Anyone
developing a class shell or posting information to the institution’s website must have passed
online training before being allowed to upload information and this also operates as internal
quality control. On campus, DL, IT, and Blackboard support is available to assist with
development of online classes.
Research Objectives
I.

Generate baseline data on the current degree of DL attitudes, adoption with self-

207

efficacy, and DIL provision for faculty members, librarians, and community college
personnel as non-active faculty.
II.

Develop recommendations for an exemplary organizational model and gap analysis, and
encourage a management approach to embed DIL into all academic programs.
Implications for Practice
Literacy is a condition, not a threshold, and therefore the plurality of DL concepts and

skills suggests that understanding DL as “one literacy to rule them all” is loaded with
ambiguities (Belshaw, 2010, p. 223). The legacy of sage-on-the-stage, traditional learning
models, during which an expert shares skills and knowledge with learners, is changing rapidly
(Maybee, Bruce, Lupton & Rebmann, 2013). Faculty members, instructors, librarians, and
institutional administrators interpret DL variously, defining DL as either an overarching parent
concept or as the practical application and skill of using digital technology programs. Context is
essential to how disparate groups consider DL as a valuable component that enhances modes of
instruction and student learning outcomes. The researcher realizes that participants’ responses
added richness to the findings, and that their commentary suggests that DL theories-in-use must
be inferred from their behaviors or representations of action and practice (Saracevic, 2007). The
implication is that people unintentionally espouse theories when they intend to discuss them,
hence the importance of cross-referencing participants’ responses to institutional- and state-level
guides, policies, and other documentation (Kuhlthau, 2004, Wesch, 2011).
One explanation for incongruences observed during DL practice or inclusion relates to IL
research from Bruce (2005), which suggests that theoretical positions determine strategies
employed in practice. DL definitions offer multiple interpretations of use, including practical
implementation in classrooms, face-to-face or online, by faculty members and librarians. Bruce

208

(2005) and Badke (2012) argue that IL use is not limited to skills needed to operate information
technology, and the same is true for DL; digital technology skills do not equate to DL use and
comprehension in an academic environment. Consensus found in the literature recognizes the
effects that transience of digital technology has on DL. Institutions are responsible for providing
an infrastructure that fosters DL technology and faculty members’ DL adoption cycle (Mosley,
2010). The Annual New Horizon report documents that institutions must be conscious of the
influences that DL adoption has on faculty members, librarians, students, and the community
(Johnson et al., 2015). The current study recognizes the dilemma, where faculty are the main
moderating force to what extent of DL adoption and inclusion beyond the basic usage where the
online class inclusion is the mediating attribute. Also, identifying the different participants’
issues with DL adoption considering such mediating attribute as relevance to subject discipline,
student DL capability and faculty/ instructor or librarian self-efficacy, thus, offers
recommendations to deal with the challenges.
The state board, policy-makers, and accreditation agencies believe that colleges should
provide and maintain digital technology equipment (i.e., hardware) and services (i.e., software)
infrastructures, keeping with current higher education standards. Technology pervasiveness will
increase in contrast to educators’ perceptions of the future of DL in higher education, particularly
regarding new mobile-learning resources. Faculty members expressed concerns that such
technology diminishes students’ success and has a major influence on the humanistic perspective
in education (Marzilli et al., 2014). The new provost at Mountain Two, a self-described IT
activist and supporter, endorsed this statement in that there are many instances in which digital
communication does not always project or express clear contextual interpretations for receivers.
For example, in his experience, when writing investigative e-mails, instead of receiving direct

209

replies, the other party’s response is either delayed or the party asks questions rather than
providing an answer, where it is far more productive to address the party face-to-face. He
commented that there are times when a message can get confused or lost in translation, but he
remarked that this is changing rapidly, especially with video calls and conferencing available.
A high priority that senior administrators, deans, and directors of libraries expressed
concerned dwindling budgets, and that digital technology equipment and services required for
higher-education programs account for a high percentage of budget expenses. Common
knowledge suggests that digital technology offers administrative efficiency, and state and
accreditation agencies have similar expectations that digital technology will enhance student
learning outcomes (Bailey et al., 2015). Therefore, the college’s senior administrators, deans,
directors, faculty members, and librarians must have sufficient DL knowledge and self-efficacy.
Professional development funds are often used to support training personnel (Mountain One,
2001). Lea (2013) suggests that learning technologies and academic literacies occupy contested
space, and Beetham, McGill, and Littlejohn (2009) contend that technologists such as the Gates
Foundation and Lumina Foundation advocate learning technology benefits. Abbitt (2011) and
Kim, Kim, Lee, Spector, and Demeester (2013) argue that teachers’ DL beliefs and technology
integration differ individually, and teachers’ and educators’ fundamental concerns and methods
of pedagogy (i.e., epistemology) are paramount to student learning, regardless of technology use.
Regarding remaining current with digital technology, all participants reiterated that there
is never sufficient time to complete all training and keep up with constant technology changes.
On campus, there are the advantages of IT help desks, distance learning personnel who support
everyone, and in-house training and workshops. There is no option to fall behind technologically
due to competition with other education institutions, and for students, it is imperative to offer the

210

right modern digital amenities. One-way training is provided is through online webinars, a cost
saving option, but they are unpopular among traditional faculty and library staff members.
Adjunct faculty members especially experience stress when having to learn new digital
technologies for their classes.
State education departments and policy-makers advocate more adoption of digital
technology programs in learning environment in the form of OERs since these digital software
tools are counted as low-cost additions with high learning value. What has not been considered
fully is the logistics of how to support faculty members’ and librarians’ decisions of which OERs
to adopt because so many resources are available, and there is also the question of compatibility
with an institution’s legacy digital technology platform and LMS programs that are already in
place. As senior administrators reported, they are constantly reviewing their institutions’
strategic models to find ways to adapt current digital technology policies and improve DL
adoption with faculty members’ instructional models, but it is a work in progress.
Among faculty responses, some individuals believed that DL is digital fluency, and as a
skill was important for students, but it was unnecessary as a research assignment to be included
in their disciplines (e.g., math, general science, and applied science). The subtle nuance is the
paradox of the two varied DL interpretations. At its most basic DL is digital technology
fluency/skills with computer technology but in its fullest sense DL is the self-efficacy of both the
fluency and the comprehension of digital information for critical thinking. Consequently, all
faculty members and librarians remarked that over the last few years, students entering their
classes had changed, with more than 50% demonstrating basic DL self-efficacy. Among the
remaining 50%, it was uncommon to find students unfamiliar with digital technology. If a
student has difficulties with DL self-efficacy, the institution has the student use support programs

211

and resources such as TRIO, the distance information learning technology center, and the library
to acclimate them to learning how to use digital technology (e.g., LMS) and integrating DL skills
into learning.
At rural institutions, the topographies do make it difficult to sustain and support
consistent accessibility to the Internet, particularly true for adjunct faculty members making
teaching complicated when it comes to students taking online classes. Both institutions provide
access to free downloadable digital programs (i.e., Microsoft Office and anti-virus software) to
help students reduce technology costs since local demographics include low-income areas. Such
access occurs over the Internet, which is problematic in areas with poor cellular tower
transmissions, and even weather events that disrupt satellite transmissions make online studies
challenging (Scott-Clayton 2011; Bailey et al., 2015).
Recommendations
Each college, where participants worked, offers training and professional development
events on the schools’ calendars. From an outline of these methods and the literature review, it
is possible to offer recommendations regarding how to continue to incorporate DL that supports
faculty curricula and student learning outcomes at similar, midsized community colleges.
Collaboration of shared DL experiences and knowledge is essential to supporting the suggestions
that follow.
One recommendation is to establish a forum among faculty members, librarians, and IT
or student support services to collaborate on identifying unexplored DL adoption initiatives with
in-house DL experts. Feasibility of this recommendation requires support from department
heads, deans, and directors for the group to be recognized and consists voluntarily of faculty
members, librarians, and IT personnel. An indirect issue not fully addressed in the study was that

212

the group would have to overcome any faculty and personnel who are either unaware or unsure
of DL definition from the Digital Literacy Task (2013) force, and the value of adding more
programs. If people invest in developing or adding more DL curriculum online, to ensure that
there are definite guidelines and policy to support the individual faculty or librarian’s intellectual
property rights. Also, faculty need to know their intellectual freedom is respected and recognized
as the creator of the subject content instruction, even with LMS online classes. The group should
develop a plan, including:
1. Opportunities to coordinate with similar peer institutions to open a dialogue and
compare current DL issues, and to discuss how to troubleshoot and find solutions to
challenges that might be unique;
2. How the group will identify faculty members who have adopted DL, and set up crosstraining with faculty members/ librarians at the DL work-in-progress stage and new
faculty members regarding DL programs and resources that enhance student learning
outcomes. An example is making a list of resources to be distributed among
departments.
3. Since IL is an integral part of DL, request library directors and/or instructional
librarians and designers (if available) to prepare digital IL guides of all library
electronic digital resources, which should be posted in online classes as an embedded
librarian service for both faculty members and students. An example is library DL
information reference guides that are pertinent to faculty members’ disciplines,
especially syllabi assignments;
4. Outreach presentations by a library director or an appointee should be scheduled that
demonstrate all of a library’s DL Web 2.0 resources available to faculty members and

213

students at in-house workshops and institutional training events since some faculty
members are unaware of such electronic resources and services;
5. Connections should be made with faculty members who write grants to explore grant
opportunities for training and research for faculty members and librarians in support
of current discussions from policy-makers’ suggestions made to an institution’s
administrators regarding more open education resources (OER) inclusion to
reduce budgets.
Conclusion and Future Research
Complexity in literacy Interpretation. Badke (2012) provides an explanation of how
multiple types of literacies include an interconnectedness through the intermediality that is the
relationship of the person with the cognitive process of information production (i.e., self-efficacy
skills) and the non-cognitive process of information comprehension and creation. When
considering the six foundational types of literacy, digital literacy and information literacy are
depicted within the hierarchy (Mackey & Jackson, 2011). Each term might be considered
independently or understood as the main central (parent) term and the other terms evolve as
subsections dependent upon the perspective that the person chooses as the defining concept. In
fact, the different types of literacies are interconnected (Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan, 2006). A
person therefore decides what the dependent factor is that makes one term the key, i.e., main
central term. Generally, the dependent factor that makes either DL, IL or DIL the main key term
is relative to the context of the person’s environment. (Belshaw, 2012). Unintentionally, the
instruction librarian at both locations frustration with the paradox of DL self-efficacy perception
caused the rationalization to sound convoluted, but was seen clearly in this study’s participant’s
responses. Certain faculty consider DL the understanding and application of self-efficacy skills

214

more so than the need or relevance of IL or digital information literacy (DIL) as applicable to
their subject discipline.
Data Analysis Outcomes
Respondents Concerns to DL Adoption. Unexpected was that at both locations
combined participants’ DL inclusion and self-efficacy responses surpassed Rogers’ (2003)
chasm between early digital technology adopters of mainstream digital technology and achieving
what Gladwell (2000) calls the tipping point of DL adoption. Although promising, this finding is
not generalizable, but faculty members, librarians, and administrators cautioned that DL in the
form of LMS online classes should not replace face-to face classroom instruction. Another
concern was that only some students entering post-secondary education are ready for full
emersion in a digital technology environment as a learning system (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008).
Education institutions should not assume that new students arrive with IL self-efficacy
awareness, or that they are digitally literate that includes DIL self-efficacy. Katz (2007)
recommends indirect incorporation of IL and DL as part of Educational Testing Service (ETS)
questions regarding college readiness, which would at least confirm recognition of IL and DL.
Faculty members and librarians, having direct contact with students, are sensitive to students’
needs and capabilities, and know to what extent DL inclusion would benefit learning outcomes.
In 2009, President Obama announced a plan to reform the nation’s student college
completion rates, and among the administration's strategies was to improve DL (American
Association of Community Colleges, 2011). Schweitzer, Ancis, and Brown (2001) argue that
digital technology altered organizational structures, changing traditional processes and
instructional models for academic departments and administrators on two levels. On one level,
incorporation of digital and online education blurs boundaries that impose disruptions among

215

established cultural dynamics of curriculum pathways. The second relates to an institution’s
teaching philosophies, and faculty members’, librarians’, and students’ expectations regarding
academic achievement (Kezar & Eckel, 2002, Garza-Mitchell, 2010). Cohen et al. (2013)
suggest that community colleges possess unique institutional cultures that help them determine
which strategies should take prominence during change. Community Colleges align much of
their academic visions with career and technical certifications, incorporating digital technology
as it pertains to keeping current with the industry (Cohen et al., 2013; Silverman & Williams,
2014). With adoption of new digital technologies, there might be challenges that prompt
additional training and continued support for faculty members, librarians, administrators, and
students, particularly in rural areas in which sustainable, high-speed access to and
comprehension of new digital technologies are limited (Scott-Clayton, 2011; Bailey et al., 2015).
What might be learned from this study is that at both community college locations all the
sample participants viewed DL as a standard form of practice because digital technology is part
of basic education administration. Then in the areas where DL is included in instruction, the
participants believed the benefits seem to outweigh possible issues. What became clear from the
varied group of participants’ responses to the open-ended survey interviews and focus groups is
that when challenging factors arose, they would be addressed and solutions found to solve the
issues. Such an attitude implies a pivotal development beyond the basic DL inclusion towards a
trend of more DL adoption. Faculty, librarians and administrators in this study, regardless of
their subject discipline differences perceive DL as a fluid combination of DL, DIL and digital IL
(DIL) as the newest and unconfirmed category. Where the belief is that DL is the understanding
and adoption of computer technology skills, digital technology programs (software), and that
everyone knows how to use the necessary software, i.e., College website, LMS e.g. Blackboard

216

and Internet resources. Beyond this, where subject content is concerned, the level of adoption
and inclusion of DL is up to the individual faculty member. Certain faculty stated using DL in
their teaching model is a natural development from IL since the subject, e.g. English, psychology
and sociology require information research for critical thinking. These faculty members are
major users and supporters of library electronic Web 2.0 resources and services. The other
faculty/instructors do not discount the library Web 2.0 resources DL value, only that they believe
there is no specific relevance for their subject content and student learning outcomes.
The point of view of the administration participants’ perception intimated how increased
DL adoption would have a continued influence on educational programs. Therefore, greater
collaboration between the institution inviting the faculty, librarians, and IT support personnel to
join these committees to invest their tacit knowledge of the DL concept in programs and/or
services. The administration will need to show support of an infrastructure that recognizes and
understands the possible levels of adjustment and inferred value of incorporation more DL
adoption into pedagogy brings with it.
At both locations, there was definite commitment from administrators to encourage DL
self-efficacy among all campus personnel, whether part of the educational administrative process
or teaching. Cross training on various digital technologies that were incorporated in
administration and teaching was encouraged. At one location, administrators demonstrated
commitment to be more digitally literate, whereby the institution mandated that all faculty
members had to create an LMS class shell to accompany all face-to-face curricula so students
could complete coursework online, which was partly in response to the state’s continuous
learning policy (Mountain One, 2015).

217

All participants showed genuine interest in DL since it affects so many areas of a
college’s environment. Participants were candid with their responses when explaining their
positons regarding DL adoption in instruction. Consensus was observed that DL is an integral
part of academic learning, but concerning the extent of DL inclusion in instruction, there were
varied responses from faculty members based on espoused theories of DL relevance to
disciplines. When discussing the library’s digital electronic resources, Web 2.0 and DIL
integration in instruction received mixed consideration. Faculty members believed that the
library’s digital electronic resources, Web 2.0, and DIL integration offered value to a subject’s
content. One factor common throughout the interviews was that the advent of digital technology
means that nearly everyone will be continuously learning DL.
Future Research Considerations
The transformation that digital technology has made to education, and new federal policies
to improve DL, indicates a need for more research. Chapter two mentioned a brief discussion on
faculty members’ academic freedom involved with the development of the DL instructional classes
and subject materials in the LMS online program software. AAUP has set out certain guidelines
to assist faculty in their contractual responsibilities and intellectual property rights, an area that
needs closer examination and research. The question of who owns the digitally developed online
class syllabi, curriculum and content must have clarity for institutional leaders. Also, since the
uncertainty influences some faculty and librarians in avoiding embracing the DL trend for online
class development.
Whereas this study examined faculty members’, librarians’, and administrators’
perceptions of adoption of DL in instruction. Findings suggest general adoption to varying
degrees, depending on the discipline. General education courses form a foundation in the

218

humanities, beyond IL inclusion of DL that might bridge gaps across discipline boundaries
(Rockman, 2004; Ragains 2006). Expanding on DL development inclusion beyond general
education courses is paramount since incorporating DL in other disciplines provides students with
the ability and opportunity to gain in-depth subject knowledge, think critically, and act creativily
in a modern, digital environment (Wesch, 2011). The next step is to identify faculty members who
have incorporated DL in their instruction beyond basic LMS shells, and study the benefits of DL
and embedded library 2.0 with a class that does not use these tools during instruction and class
assignments. A mixed-methods study is needed that uses a qualitative approach that observes
students’ library Web 2.0 use and resources that also includes a quantitative review of their success
with completing class assignments and what effect DL had on the outcomes. The research model
should be based on Mishra and Kohler’s (2006) TPACK theory, assessing the benefits that DL
offers to learning outcomes.
Maybee et al. (2013) argue that developments in phenomenology pair with informed
learning since the model considers informed learning in college classrooms by assessing
experiences with using information to learn as part of an informed-learning agenda. Coinciding
with assignments and student learning outcomes, assessing whether learning studies are a
positive direction for phenomenographic research is necessary since learning studies explore
what is effective when teaching (Maybee et al., 2013). Such research might reveal how
community colleges can stabilize retention and improve student completion rates since the
American Association of Community Colleges (2011) suggests that DL represents a cogent
strategy to facilitate such improvements.

Appendix B
Survey Interview – questions, conducted either face to face or via Skype. Participants are told
the interview will be recorded electronically, and then transcribed into a secure digital file,
password accessible only to the researcher.

Interview Introduction: The approach of the interview questions is to collect information
that will identify the faculty member’s and librarian’s perceptions and attitudes of digital
literacy (DL) using academic technology (AT).
These may be conducted either face to face or via Skype. Participants are told the
interview will be recorded electronically, and then transcribed into a secure digital file,
password accessible only to the researcher.
Would you agree with these definitions; glossary of terms:
Information literacy. Information literacy is a set of abilities requiring individuals to
"recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use
the needed information effectively." Information Literacy Competency Standards for

Higher Education. (American Library Association, 2000, p.2). Information literacy and
digital literacy are not competing concepts; they are complementary areas for students
in higher education. Digital literacy concepts and skills provide fundamentals of
managing digital environments that students need to succeed in IL and their other areas
of study (Cordell, 2013).
Digital literacy. Digital literacy is the ability to use information and communication
technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both
cognitive and technical skills (Digital Literacy Taskforce, 2013).
The definition of digital literacy is inclusive of information literacy (IL) since IL applies to
the digital technology format. Therefore, a digitally literate person has the ability to
perform tasks in a digital environment. Literacy includes the ability to read and interpret
media, reproduce data and images through digital manipulation, and evaluate and apply

265

knowledge gained from digital environments (Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan, 2006). Digital
literacy is synonymous with digital information literacy and digital information fluency.
Digital information literacy (DIL). DIL is the application of information literacy
standards and skills with digital technologies. It is not only application of information
research, but also involves incorporation of spheres of philosophy of information (i.e.,
epistemology) (Badke, 2012, p. 102). Another term used in this context is fluency; digital
information fluency (DIF) is the ability to find, evaluate, and use digital
information effectively, efficiently, and ethically. 21st Century Digital Information Fluency
(DIF) project and model (2009, Oct).

Participants Data Findings Statistical Analysis
As the research questions reviewed participants’ perceptions of DL and self-efficacy a Chi
square and Fisher-Irwin tests is chosen for probability of variance where N-1 Two Proportion
test is for comparing independent proportions for small sample sizes (Campbell, 2008). The test
assessed whether the goodness of fit of the mean observed difference represented statistical
significance between the two groups of two by two tables with small sample recommendation.
When the expected occurrence counts fall below 1, the Fisher Exact test is used, where the
variables under examination, (a) and (b) are mutually exclusive events. In this case participants’
(N=41) professional development probability of variance ratio for group one faculty including
librarians and group two factored the variables influence of professional development; (a)
conference attendance and (b) discipline specific digital literacy training.

The conditional probability formula P(A | B): results shown in table 16. Demonstrate a statistical
significance implied that professional development variable (a) conference attendance had a
greater influence on group one faculty, librarians than group two administrators DL self-efficacy.
A more in-depth probability of variance analysis should be performed that includes the sample
participants’ years of experience, gender and subject disciplines to understand better the
implications of DL and DIL data to recognize the differences and identify correlation between
variables.

Participants Descriptive Statistics Analysis
Descriptive statistics for all participants in the three classification groups of administrators,
faculty members and librarians’ also suggested variation in the three literacy areas means shown
in table 17 and 18. At location A across the three groups DL, IL and DIL self-efficacy responses
reported a high cumulative mean value for IL, and lower DL and DIL mean values scores, shown
in table 17 as expected.

In a comparison between the two locations a couple of discreet differences were found. Location
A faculty members and administrator participants show an average of approximately < 30 score
higher IL cumulative self-efficacy value rating compared the location B groups. Location B
faculty participants’ groups show an average almost even score match in DL and DIL cumulative
self-efficacy value rating compared the location A groups. The unexpected participant group
anomaly was between the two locations librarian’s scores, IL comparatively the same but the
location B librarians DL and DIL scores showed more than a 50% higher cumulative mean
scores. These results are interpreted as evidence of the different faculty disciplines that location
B librarian support with IL instruction, but also DL and DIL support with the institutions digital
technology and LMS programmatic demands.
