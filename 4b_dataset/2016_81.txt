ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to thank all the many loyal family, friends, and colleagues who
supported me through this process and never gave up on me actually finishing this
dissertation. I am grateful for all the nights my husband Trey entertained the children and
took care of our lives, enabling me to work. Without his constant help and support, I
would not have been able to complete this study. I am so proud of Connor, Kaitlyn, and
Andrew for pitching in around the house to help mom get her work done. I am so
fortunate my parents and in-laws were willing to babysit so I could attend class or write.
Without our wonderful family, this dissertation would still be incomplete. Now that this
challenge has been conquered, I’m looking forward to more family game nights and
relaxing free time with all of you.
I am indebted to Dr. Sylvia Vardell for her unending encouragement, especially
during the last stressful months. She never failed to calm my nerves while guiding me
forward. I am thankful to Dr. Lynn Akin for being an amazing advisor during my

ABSTRACT
KIMBERLY CAMPBELL KINNAIRD
AUTHENTICITY AND EMPOWERMENT: FEMALE ROLE MODELS IN
HISTORICAL FICTION FROM THE AMELIA BLOOMER PROJECT
MAY 2016
Due to the shortage of female characters in historical texts, it is important for
librarians and educators to share historical fiction novels containing strong female
protagonists with children. While guidelines are available for critiquing authenticity in
historical fiction and empowerment of female characters, these approaches are rarely
combined.
This study posed the following research question: What is the relationship
between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s
three levels of female empowerment (2002) in the historical middle school novels
selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia Bloomer Project list?
To examine authenticity and empowerment, twenty-seven historical fiction novels
were selected from the Amelia Bloomer Project. Each conflict between the female
protagonist and society’s expectations was assigned one of Boreen’s authenticity levels
and one of Brown and St. Clair’s empowerment stages. Frequencies and correlations
were analyzed, showing a strong correlation of .863 between female protagonists’
authenticity and empowerment.
vi

Boreen’s most historically accurate protagonist (30.8%) correlated most often
with Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited scale (34.6%). Boreen’s
historical role model acting courageously within society’s bounds (56.8%) correlated
most often with Brown and St. Clair’s female character that defies society for personal
ambition (55.9%). Boreen’s social renegade (12.4%) correlated most often with Brown
and St. Clair’s role model that acts as a catalyst for change (9.5%).
Secondary analyses showed the largest percentage of books was set in the United
States (44.4%), accounting for 52.2% of all the books placed in the 19th and 20th
centuries. The sources of conflict correlations gradually increased following the
escalation of the protagonists’ actions from internal conflict, to interpersonal disputes, to
eventually confronting society. These results mirrored the progressive stages of Boreen’s
(1999) historical role models and Brown and St. Clair’s (2002) female empowerment
levels.
In conclusion, analyzing female characters’ levels of authenticity and
empowerment is one method of evaluating and understanding historical literature for
young people. The depiction of brave girls struggling to make their own choices in life
may be particularly motivational for today’s readers.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
In 1970, the Feminist Task Force of the Social Responsibilities Round Table of
the American Library Association (ALA) was formed to address women’s issues in
librarianship. One of their committees, the Amelia Bloomer Project committee, began
selecting an annual list of high-quality feminist literature of all genres for children and
young adults in 2002 to “encourage and inspire girls to be smart, brave, and proud”
(Amelia Bloomer Project committee 2016).
Since the 1970s, researchers in several fields have joined ALA’s “girl power”
cause. In addition to library science, publications in education, sociology, and women’s
studies discuss the need for strong female characters in children’s and young adult
literature as a role model for readers (Trites 1997; Taft 2007; Weisbard and GrapentineBenton 2007).
Several articles published by educators detail their experiences using feminist
literature in their classrooms, with boys and girls. Ruggieri (2001) described her high
school students’ responses to Shabanu, the story of a young Pakistani girl’s arranged
marriage and the effects of domestic violence. Hubler shared her research teaching
readers how to map social reality in feminist literature as a means of understanding “the
large, powerful, but historically alterable structures of the social world” (2000, 95).
Boreen (1999) explained her search for historically accurate female role models in
1

historical fiction as alternatives to the female characters found in the traditional
classroom canon. The powerful student discussions these teachers shared encouraged
others to examine gender issues through the lens of children’s and young adult literature.
An appropriate genre for exploring feminism with young readers is historical
fiction. According to Cart (2006), within the last twenty years historical fiction has
become increasingly popular, especially among girls. Cart’s Booklist article (2006) listed
several recent historical fiction Printz and Newbery honor books featuring female
protagonists as well as reference books focusing on girls and women.
Educators have long understood the importance of sparking students’ interests in
subject areas as motivation for learning. Hickman (1990) focused on how to turn
children’s natural love of storytelling into a curiosity about historical subjects through the
use of historical fiction and drama activities. Incorporating novel studies into the
traditional Social Studies curriculum allows students to read multiple perspectives found
in historical fiction (McManus 2008). Stories often evoke a more emotional reader
response than school texts (Schwab 2005). By fictionalizing historical events, authors
enable readers to immerse themselves in the story and vicariously experience another
time or place to better understand these events in the course of history (Berghoff 2000).
However, females are still underrepresented in historical fiction as they are in
most history textbooks and social studies curriculum. According to O’Quinn (2007) the
history classes taught in our nation’s public schools include materials primarily written

2

from the male point of view. The National Women’s History Project was founded in
1980 to address the conspicuous absence of females from our country’s texts (Cart 2006).
Purpose
Recent booklists like the Amelia Bloomer Project (Amelia Bloomer Project
committee 2016), Brave Girls and Strong Women (Sreenivasan 2016), Eighty Books for
the 21st Century Girls (Women’s National Book Association 2002), and Foregrounding
Women in History (Vandergrift 2016) and reference texts such as Brown and St. Clair’s
Declarations of Independence (2002) and Odean’s Great Books for Girls (2002) offer
bibliographies of historical fiction featuring empowered female characters; however, not
many sources discuss how to critique children’s and young adult fiction when searching
for female role models (Weisbard and Grapentine-Benton 2007).
Boreen (1999) searched for historical fiction novels with strong female role
models for her teenage students. In her article “Images of Women in Historical Young
Adult Fiction: Seeking Role Models” Boreen investigated a variety of female characters
and described three types of role models: “real girls”, renegades, and historical models. In
her first category “real girls” are internally strong characters. According to Boreen, they
are also the most historically accurate because their actions are tightly bound by their
time period and position in society. The second type of role model Boreen described is
the renegade. Renegades outwardly rebel against society to change the system. These
girls are the least authentic characters; however these role models are more entertaining
to modern readers. The final level Boreen discussed in depth is the historical role model,
3

a more realistic character that acts with courage while remaining true to her time period
and society. Historical role models demonstrate how a woman can be empowered, no
matter where or when she lives, through her responses to society. These characters
maintain authenticity, while still relating to and inspiring modern readers (Boreen 1999).
Brown and St. Clair’s work, Declarations of Independence (2002), defined three
levels of female empowerment: strong on a limited scale, defying conventions for
personal ambition, and openly rebellious. The first character is tightly bound by her
gender, societal position, and historical period. She is oppressed, but develops confidence
in her abilities and becomes strong on a limited scale. A character on the second level of
female empowerment holds a more secure position in society, but chooses to defy
expectations for personal gain. Following this dream often costs the character greatly.
Brown and St. Clair’s highest level of empowerment, openly rebellious, features
characters that change society’s rules or escape the system entirely. These bold girls
usually enjoy success without losing anything. A girl’s path to empowerment is “largely
determined by the historical moment in which they enact the journey,” according to
Brown and St. Clair (2002, 77).
The purpose of this research study is to investigate the relationship between
Boreen’s levels of authenticity (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s stages of empowerment
(2002) when examining female role models in historical fiction selected by the Amelia
Bloomer Project in its first decade from 2002 to 2011. The researcher analyzed each
female protagonist’s level of historical authenticity and the corresponding level of
4

empowerment throughout the development of the plot. This study seeks to answer the
research question:
What is the relationship between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity (1999)
and Brown and St. Clair’s three levels of female empowerment (2002) in the historical
middle school novels selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia Bloomer Project
list?
Authenticity and empowerment are the focus of the study because of their
importance in literary evaluation. According to Donelson and Nilsen (2005), authenticity
based on research is one of the primary criteria when evaluating historical fiction. A
study of feminist qualities in children’s and young adult literature depends on a definition
of empowerment, according to Brown and St. Clair (2002). This study investigates the
relationship between the two variables in order to offer new insights into the evaluation
of female characters in historical fiction. These findings will help librarians and other
educators select the best examples of historical heroines to share with children and young
adults.
Significance of this Study
When evaluating strong female characters in historical fiction, empowerment is
not the only consideration. Authenticity is also important because a growing debate
concerning who is qualified to tell a specific person’s or group’s story has influenced
historical fiction criticism during the last few decades, according to Margaronis (2008).
In order to provide evidence of their attention to historical facts and details, authors of
5

historical fiction often include research notes and bibliographies at the conclusion of their
novels. Writers must carefully balance powerful storytelling with historical accuracy,
according to Sprague and Keeling (2007). If readers are interested in learning about the
progression of women’s liberation, they need to select novels with the most authentic and
empowered characters (Clapp-Itnyre 2007; Boreen 1999; Brown and St. Clair 2002).
Critically reading and analyzing selections from the Amelia Bloomer Project
promotes the careful evaluation of feminist literature for children and young adults.
Librarians and teachers must consider a female character’s historical time period and
societal expectations when determining the level of authenticity and empowerment. This
study not only contributes to the literature of library science, education, and women’s
studies, but also furthers the work of ALA’s Feminist Task Force by advocating the
mission to address women’s issues in librarianship.
By examining historical fiction through a feminist lens, we can help young
readers learn to question traditional gender role portrayals and understand the slow, but
changeable progress of society (Hubler 2000). Selecting high quality historical fiction
novels can help offer realistic role models for modern readers (Boreen 1999).
Methodology
Since 2002, ALA’s Feminist Task Force has compiled an annual recommended
reading list of books to “encourage and inspire girls to be smart, brave, and proud” called
the Amelia Bloomer Project booklist (Amelia Bloomer Project committee 2016). To
6

qualify for selection, the recommended books should strongly feature female role models
challenging traditional stereotypes. The chosen books must also have been published in
the United States within the eighteen-month time period before the annual January
selection date. As of January 2016, the committee has selected 718 books. Each year’s
Amelia Bloomer Project list is divided into three categories: beginning readers, middle
school or intermediate readers, and young adult. Within each division, the books are
grouped according to fiction and nonfiction titles.
For the purposes of this study of female characters’ levels of authenticity and
empowerment as depicted in the past, the sample size was limited to historical fiction
titles included in the Amelia Bloomer Project booklist, for years 2002 to 2011. The first
decade offered a good look at the beginning selections from this award list. The sample
of children’s and young adult titles was narrowed to books listed in the middle school
category to correspond with the researcher’s area of specialty as a middle school
librarian. Historical fiction titles that blend historical events with other genres like fantasy
or poetry have been eliminated from the final booklist to standardize content analysis.
Male protagonists were not analyzed, since this study investigates female authenticity and
empowerment levels. According to Tomlinson and Lynch-Brown (2007), to qualify as
historical fiction, the setting must be placed at least twenty years before the present.
Therefore, only novels set in the mid 1990s or previous years were selected as part of this
study. Twenty-seven books, 6.28% of the total list during the first decade, met all the

7

criteria to be included in this analysis of female role models in historical children’s and
young adult literature.

This study posed the following primary research question:
What is the relationship between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity
(1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s three levels of female empowerment (2002) in
the historical middle school novels selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia
Bloomer Project list?
The following sub-questions were also examined:
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of the historically
accurate protagonist and Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited
scale (H1)?
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of an historical role
model acting courageously within society’s bounds and Brown and St. Clair’s
female character that defies society for personal ambition (H2)?
What is the relationship between Boreen’s social renegade and Brown and St.
Clair’s role model that acts as a catalyst for change (H3)?
This study’s framework correlated Boreen’s (1999) three types of historical
female role models: the historically accurate “real girl” strongly bound by her time and
8

society, the historical role model acting courageously within the bounds of society, and
the social renegade acting beyond her time with Brown and St. Clair’s (2002) three stages
of empowerment: characters that are strong on a limited scale, girls that defy society for
personal ambition, and heroines that act as a catalyst for societal change as variables for
comparing female protagonists’ levels of authenticity and empowerment in historical
fiction books included on the Amelia Bloomer Project booklist from 2002 to 2011.
The qualitative content analysis involved a critical reading of the selected books.
As each title on the booklist was thoroughly read and analyzed, detailed note-taking
recorded data concerning the female protagonists and cited examples of their actions
against sources of conflict. Each action was assigned a specific authenticity and
empowerment level based on Boreen’s three types of role models (1999) and Brown and
St. Clair’s progressive levels of empowerment (2002). These two approaches organized
their successive stages by the female character’s actions. The first levels focused on
internal struggles, and then progressed to conflicts with other characters, before they
reached the final stage of rebelling against society in general. Note-taking was recorded
and coded on a standard form to maintain consistency throughout the reading process.
The researcher analyzed the data counts of each variable to determine if there was a
correlation between levels of historical authenticity and female empowerment.
Since there was not necessarily a causal relationship between these two
approaches, correlation was measured. “Correlation coefficients are used to quantitatively
describe the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables,” according to
9

Portney and Watkins (2000, 491). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, or
Spearman’s rho, was used to measure the strength of the relationship between female
characters’ levels of authenticity and empowerment. Spearman’s rho was the most
appropriate statistical test for measuring correlation in ordinal scale data, such as these
approaches’ three ranked levels. Due to the small sample size of this study, whether or
not the correlations were significant was not as important as the strength of the
correlations.
This study included a qualitative component to support the statistical results of the
content analysis. Cited examples of the protagonists’ actions were systematically sorted
to uncover broad themes, trends, and connections describing historical female characters
in regards to their levels of authenticity and empowerment (Portney and Watkins 2000).
Both Boreen’s study of historical role models (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s
(2002) study detailing successive levels of empowerment were analyzed from the
feminist literary criticism perspective which focuses on how female characters are
portrayed in literature, according to Kolodny (1989). Viewing female characters’ levels
of authenticity and empowerment through the lens of a feminist perspective was
beneficial for this study of books featuring significant feminist content in the Amelia
Bloomer Project.
By critiquing female protagonists’ levels of authenticity and empowerment
according to Boreen’s (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s (2002) approaches based on
feminist theories, new understandings about girls and women’s roles in history emerged.
10

These results will hopefully inform librarians, teachers, and students to view historical
fiction reading in a more equitable light, while promoting a worthy new ALA booklist,
the Amelia Bloomer Project.

CHAPTER II
LITERATURE REVIEW
Gender issues have historically played a large role in education in the United
States. The pendulum has swung several times between offering more opportunities to
males or females. Most of the current research in the field of children’s and young adult
literature now focuses on how to entice boys to read. Studies reporting lower percentages
of male students choosing to enroll in college, and in turn, receiving bachelor degrees
have raised an alarm about their economic futures (Donelson and Nilsen 2005). Countless
booklists and websites cater to educators and parents searching for books that boys will
enjoy reading. When most children’s and young adult literature texts mention gender and
literacy, the authors discuss boys (Donelson and Nilsen 2005; Tomlinson and LynchBrown 2007; Weisbard and Grapentine-Benton 2007).
What about girls? Fewer current research studies and texts delve into the
importance of presenting females with strong role models. In 1970, the Feminist Task
Force of the Social Responsibilities Round Table of ALA was formed to address
women’s issues in librarianship. One of their committees, the Amelia Bloomer Project,
began selecting an annual list of high-quality feminist literature for children and young
adults in 2002 that “encourage and inspire girls to be smart, brave, and proud” (Amelia
Bloomer Project committee 2016).

12

Feminism in Children’s and Young Adult Literature
Since the 1970s researchers in several scholarly fields have joined ALA’s “girlpower” cause. In addition to library science, publications in education and women’s
studies discuss the need for strong female characters in children’s and young adult
literature as a role model for readers (Trites 1997; Taft 2007; Weisbard and GrapentineBenton 2007). Declarations of Independence: Empowered Girls in Young Adult
Literature, 1990-2001 (Brown and St. Clair 2002) compared recent feminist characters
with unconventional females from classic literature. The authors then analyzed
empowered female characters among historical fiction, contemporary fiction, fantasy, and
autobiographies. Brown and St. Clair defined “empowered girls” as characters gaining
confidence in themselves and their abilities, not overpowering others. Sprague and
Keeling (2007) authored a similar book, Discovering Their Voices: Engaging Adolescent
Girls with Young Adult Literature, in which they described a book club curriculum
addressing contemporary female adolescent issues.
Several reference books have also been published in the last two decades listing
recommended reading for girls across literary genres. Books like Odean’s Great Books
for Girls (2002) and Cooper-Mullin and Coye’s Once Upon a Heroine: 450 Books for
Girls to Love (1998) presented titles to inspire and empower girls through reading.
Professional articles offer numerous collection development resources for librarians and
teachers to select reading materials with feminist themes or role models for children and
young adults (Weisbard and Grapentine-Benton 2007; Lehman 2010; Stites 2010;
13

O’Quinn 2007; Iyer 2011). Weisbard and Grapentine-Benton’s article Resources on
Young Adult Literature (2007) critically reviewed several textbooks and reference guides
that included chapters detailing gender reading differences and discussing feminist
literature for young readers.
Educators publish articles detailing their experiences using feminist literature in
their classrooms, with boys and girls. The powerful student discussions these teachers
share encourage others to examine gender issues through the lens of children’s and young
adult literature (Ruggieri 2001; Hubler 2000; Boreen 1999). Karen Cushman, Newbery
award winner of The Midwife’s Apprentice, urged teachers to include books with female
protagonists in their classroom canon (Donelson and Nilsen 2005). Stories about strong,
courageous females should be introduced to boys, just as girls are frequently encouraged
to read novels featuring male characters, according to Cushman (Donelson and Nilsen
2005). Perhaps instead of reading one at the exclusion of the other, both perspectives can
be read to develop more accurate views of people in society (Donelson and Nilsen 2005;
Hayn and Spiegel 1999).
When asked about personal reading choices, teen girls want stories that reflect
their own lives, according to interviews conducted by Iyer (2011). Iyer (2011) states
readers enjoy heroines that look and think like them, addressing typical teen problems.
Authentic teenage emotions and behavior are necessary for readers to relate to the
protagonist, regardless of the character’s situation. Even though the protagonist may be
disadvantaged with few options in a patriarchal world, young adult readers still want a
14

hopeful ending proving that life can get better for the character and themselves (Iyer
2011).
For a class project, a 14-year-old girl surveyed female students about their reading
interests. Samantha reported that 66% of her female classmates listed book characters as
positive role models. While most of the role models in this study are fictional characters,
Samantha was initially surprised many classmates cited historical fiction novels (Melnick
2002).
Numerous studies examine feminist themes in various genres of children’s and
young adult literature. Vandergrift (1995) urged educators and parents to begin early by
sharing picture books containing strong female characters in non-traditional gender
portrayals with their young readers, in hopes of broadening society’s range of acceptable
expectations for women. Trites (1997) explained the use of feminist literary criticism to
understand feminist themes in children’s literature. Recent dissertations and scholarly
articles studied female empowerment, sexuality, identity, politics, and gender role
expectations in young adult sports fiction, fantasy, popular fiction, poetry, and dystopian
novels (Heinecken 2015; Waller 2004; Bowles-Reyer 1998; Varnes 1997; Parent 2015).
Not as many researchers investigate feminist themes found in historical fiction written for
young adults. A discussion of Boreen and Brown and St. Clair’s studies of female role
models in historical fiction will follow shortly.

Historical Fiction
An interesting, and perhaps unexpected, vehicle for exploring feminism with
children and young adults is historical fiction. According to Tomlinson and Lynch-Brown
(2007), to qualify as historical fiction, the setting must be placed at least twenty years
before the present. Within the last two decades, historical fiction has enjoyed an increase
in popularity among both children and young adult readers. What was once an
overlooked genre that Newbery winning author Katherine Paterson (1999) defended to
critics, has now experienced tremendous growth. Through immersing themselves in other
times and lands, readers can begin to identify with and understand the past in context,
both through tragic and inspiring stories. Perhaps these stories can guide readers to make
better choices for their present and future (Paterson 1999; Cart 2006; Engberg 2002).
Several recent publications offer educators sample lesson plans incorporating
historical fiction into traditional school curriculum. Rycik and Rosler (2009) explained
the importance of sharing quality historical fiction “to provide students with a vicarious
experience for places and people they could otherwise never know” that is more personal
than a textbook (163). Novels allow children and teens to become a part of history by
living through a character similar to them and empathize with their situation. These
emotional connections facilitate engaging instruction (Rycik and Rosler 2009). McGrail
and Powell call for librarians to support social studies teachers by curating digital
primary sources to authenticate historical novels (2014). They note that newspaper
articles, diary entries, personal letters, photographs, and video clips are tangible artifacts
16

linking modern readers to their predecessors. In addition to creating connections with
people from the past, “these kinds of primary source resources are perfect for enriching
and extending students’ understanding as they read historical fiction” as part of social
studies and language arts curriculum (Anderson 2014, 10).
While historical fiction offers a more personal connection to the past than
traditional textbooks or nonfiction, females are still underrepresented as they are in most
historical text. The National Women’s History Project was founded in 1980 to address
the conspicuous absence of females from our country’s texts (Cart 2006). Cart notes even
historical fiction, which has grown considerably during the last few years, focuses more
on men’s experiences than women’s stories (2006). Despite the shortage of material,
children and young adults need to gain an “awareness of female viewpoints of the past,
viewpoints that are often neglected in history books” (Hayn and Spiegel 1999, 92).
Several recent Newbery and Printz honors have been awarded to historical fiction
featuring female protagonists, such as Moon Over Manifest by Clare Vanderpool (2010),
Kira-Kira by Cynthia Kadohata (2004) and Jennifer Donnelly’s A Northern Light (2003).
Popular series like the American Girl stories and Scholastic’s fictional diary series have
also increased the number of girl’s stories being told through historical fiction (Cart
2006). Online booklists such as the Amelia Bloomer Project (Amelia Bloomer Project
committee 2016), Brave Girls and Strong Women (Sreenivasan 2016), Eighty Books for
the 21st Century Girls (Women’s National Book Association 2002), and Foregrounding
Women in History (Vandergrift 2016) offer bibliographies of historical fiction featuring
17

empowered female characters. With this surge in interest, more stories about strong
women throughout history are available to provide role models for today’s children and
young adults. Modern teens “will learn more than simple facts from these texts: they will
learn how to fill out historical meaning in a way that makes it present in their young lives
– a more penetrating and inclusive approach than they generally experience” (O’Quinn
2007, 40).
Historical fiction not only offers empowered characters to emulate, but also opens
the door to gender role discussions. Due to the historical setting, modern students can
comfortably debate the characters’ problems in a patriarchal society and abuses to women
without threatening their own status quo. In this manner, feminist social commentary can
be discussed in a less confrontational way. By examining past social mores, especially
gender roles, children and young adults may be better equipped to discover their own
identities (Brown and St. Clair 2002; Ruggieri 2001).
Role Models
Recent journal and online articles offer booklists focusing on strong female
characters; however, not as many sources discuss how to critique young adult fiction,
much less when searching for female role models (Weisbard and Grapentine-Benton
2007). To address this need, three groups of professionals shared their processes for
evaluating female characters in young adult literature. The processes range from selecting
literature with strong female characters to examining the types and levels of role models.
18

The first team composed of university professors, classroom teachers, and library
media specialists were searching for “spunky” girls in children’s literature for an article
to be published by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) (Heine and
Inkster 1999). After several meetings and identifying multiple books with strong female
characters, the authors decided to develop and publish their own rubric for evaluating
literature. After narrowing the choices down to only high-quality literature, six criteria
were discussed for each book: personal traits of the character, issues important to the
character, how character solves problems, character’s relationships with others, how
character departs from traditional stereotypes, and whether the character provides a voice
for those who are often unheard in children’s literature. While not every book chosen met
all the criteria, the titles recommended by this NCTE group represented the best literature
in the field. The team was surprised to discover that many of these characters were found
in historical fiction, a genre that brings life to history, but also provides a model for the
future (Heine and Inkster 1999).
Boreen’s (1999) article “Images of Women in Historical Young Adult Fiction:
Seeking Role Models” focused on her female students’ interest in historical books. As a
secondary language arts teacher, she searched for novels with strong female role models
for her teenage students to help them think about who they wanted to become as adults.
While there is a lack of empowered female role models in most traditional classroom
canon, Boreen’s female students’ free choice historical fiction reading offered strong
characters that modern readers could identify with and emulate. The author interviewed
19

her students concerning their reading choices and responses to the literature. Boreen
investigated a variety of characters and described three types of role models: “real girls”,
renegades, and historical models. “Real girls” are the most historically accurate. Even
though they are internally strong, these characters are tightly bound by their time period
and societal position, and therefore act accordingly. Not surprising, these characters are
teenagers’ least favorite. The second type of role model identified is the renegade.
Renegades take a stand against society’s expectations by rebelling to change the system.
While these girls are the least authentic characters, they enjoy the admiration of their 21st
century readers. Finally, Boreen discussed historical role models as “realistic characters
acting as courageous humans within the societal boundaries of their historical time period
(Boreen 1999, 18). Historical role models demonstrate how a woman can be empowered,
no matter where or when she lives, through her responses to society. These characters
maintain authenticity, while still relating to and inspiring modern readers. In essence,
historical role models are empowered because they gain confidence in themselves
(Boreen 1999; Brown and St. Clair 2002).
Brown and St. Clair’s work, Declarations of Independence (2002), provided an
even more focused analysis of strong female role models. All the characters in this
literary critique are historically authentic, similar to Boreen’s third type of role model.
Brown and St. Clair subdivided this group into three levels of empowerment: strong on a
limited scale, defies conventions for personal ambition, and openly rebellious. The first
character is bound by her gender, societal position, and time period. She is extremely
20

disadvantaged but makes a place for herself through developing confidence in her
abilities. Brown and St. Clair’s second level of empowered female enjoys a more secure
position, but chooses to defy society’s conventions for personal ambition. Realizing this
ambition often comes at a high price to the character. Finally, the highest level of
empowerment involves either escaping or changing society’s oppressive expectations.
These characters usually claim a victory without losing anything. Strong female
characters in historical fiction can inspire 21st century readers and provide worthy role
models. Every girl’s journey to empowerment is similar, regardless of the time period or
society in which she lives, however that path is “largely determined by the historical
moment in which they enact the journey” (Brown and St. Clair 2002, 77).
Female Empowerment
Some of the most endearing characters in classic American children’s literature
are the tomboys (Proehl 2011). Girls like Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)
challenge society’s restrictions on appropriate feminine dress, behavior, and aspirations,
according to Proehl. Generations of readers have admired these youthful “symbols of
female empowerment” (Proehl 2011). Tomboys may face adversity, but they emerge
stronger by standing up for their beliefs. Readers identify with this struggle to be true to
oneself, even when society’s acceptable roles are too constraining (Stites 2010).
More recently, studies have been investigating the influence of teen “chick lit” or
contemporary realistic fiction on readers’ identity formation and femininity (Brown 2013;
21

Bullen, Toffoletti, and Parsons 2011, Mariani-Petroze 2006). Researchers examined how
“sexual and gender identities are modeled around discourses of choice, freedom, and
empowerment” in children’s and young adult literature (Bullen, Toffoletti, and Parsons
2011, 509). Scholarship in the area of female empowerment “has challenged perceptions
of girls primarily as passive victims without the capacity to influence the world around
them” (Taft 2007, 10).
Authentic Views of the Past
When evaluating strong female characters in historical fiction, empowerment is
not the only consideration. Authenticity is also important. The best historical fiction is
realistic; the characters should think and act as people from that time period and society
would, even while being relatable to modern readers (Boreen 1999). Vivid descriptions of
past settings, social customs, and political realities create a new world for children and
teens to vicariously visit. However, authors must carefully balance storytelling with
historical accuracy (Clapp-Itnyre 2007). When critiquing historical fiction, readers should
look for a truthful representation of the past, while also taking into account how that
literature connects with present day life experiences. If readers are interested in learning
about the progression of women’s history in the United States, they need to select novels
with the most authentic, and empowered, characters (Clapp-Itnyre 2007; Boreen 1999;
Brown and St. Clair 2002; Glisson 2013; Saricks 2008).

22

Feminism in Historical Fiction
To achieve a balance between historical authenticity and female empowerment,
readers should look beyond gender roles to a society’s whole structure. When evaluating
a female character, one must place her within the boundaries of her society and time
period, according to Hubler (2000). Strong role models should actively resist the
limitations society places upon them, even though they acknowledge the system of
oppression. Simply discussing gender roles does not account for the larger, external
forces that dictate thought and behavior. Gaining self-confidence and educating sexist
people will not dramatically change society. To present social reality, educators and
librarians must also utilize non-fiction to inform students about the history of women’s
liberation so they can appreciate the slow, but changeable, progress of society (Hubler
2000).
History of Feminism in the United States
To better understand the feminist movement in the United States, broad time
periods or “waves” have been loosely identified (Laughlin, et al. 2010). The wave
metaphor may not be the most precise way to look at the history of feminism and its
achievements, but it has been generally accepted across academic, political, and social
groups. The Library of Congress has even established these waves as topic categories
(Hewitt 2012). For the purposes of this study, these waves will be referenced as markers
on the path towards equality.
23

According to Hewitt (2012), the first wave of feminism encompasses the time
period between the Seneca Falls Woman’s Rights Convention in July 1848 and the
passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women the right to vote.
Suffrage and property ownership rights were the primary political goals of this time
period. However dress reform, abolition of slavery, education opportunities, employment
protections, marriage rights, and temperance were also advocated by various feminist
groups. With the enormous push to gain voting rights, the other issues became less
immediate political concerns (Munro 2013; Hewitt 2012; Laughlin, et al. 2010).
Activists declared a second wave of feminism during the turbulent 1960s. Built
upon the previous generations’ successes, this wave sought equality in gender roles and
elimination of stereotypes, advocacy for reproductive rights, and the ending of workplace
discrimination (Hewitt 2013). “Second-wave feminists coined the phrase ‘the personal is
political’ as a means of highlighting the impact of sexism and patriarchy on every aspect
of women’s private lives” (Munro 2013, 22).
Some advocates of women’s empowerment claimed the second wave of feminism
grouped all women together without acknowledging multiple feminisms. The movement
was still largely identified with white, middle class women (Munro 2013). In response, a
third wave arose in the early 1990s “to take feminism from what they perceived as an
exclusive concern with dichotomous notions of gender toward consideration of the
multiple identities of age, class, race, and sexual preference” (Laughlin, et al. 2010, 77).
In this wave, feminists focus on individual empowerment and free choice. This is the era
24

of power feminists, hip crafting clubs, and global protest of violence against women and
girls via social media (Munro 2013; Groeneveld 2010; Coleman 2009).
The Internet’s power to enable global conversations leads some researchers to
believe we are entering the fourth wave of feminism (Munro 2013; Schuster 2013; Hewitt
2012). Advocates can challenge sexism and quickly spread their message through this
online forum. Munro acknowledged the emergence of a new era is uncertain; perhaps
social media is simply allowing third wave feminists to reflect on issues beyond their
own personal experiences. Whether or not feminism is entering the next wave, “it is
increasingly clear that the Internet has facilitated the creation of a global community of
feminists who use the Internet both for discussion and activism” (Munro 2013, 23).
Amelia Bloomer Project
In the search for quality literature to read with children and teens, some educators
seek novels that challenge traditional gender roles and offer opportunities for engaging
discussion. During the years before the Amelia Bloomer Project, one teacher educator
reviewed three feminist novels (Harper 1998). Harper (1998) objected to the “suffering
femininity” of the protagonists. The girls passively endure hardships not of their making.
Harper would rather share novels featuring “active resistance, rather than mere
perseverance…with pockets of hope even in the most limited of circumstances” (1998,
145). She continued with a plea for stories that show girls that female life is not just
suffering (Harper 1998).
25

Four years later, the Amelia Bloomer Project published the first annual list of
books with significant feminist content for children and young adults in 2002. Named in
honor of Amelia Bloomer, this book selection committee promotes books that “encourage
and inspire girls to be smart, brave, and proud” (Amelia Bloomer Project committee
2016).
Who was Amelia Bloomer? Amelia Bloomer achieved notoriety during the 1850s
by promoting a reform dress consisting of loose pants gathered at the ankle worn under a
shortened dress approximately four inches below the knee (Nelson 2000; Mason 1992).
Even though Elizabeth Smith Miller is credited with designing the dress and wearing it to
Seneca Falls, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Amelia Bloomer immediately appreciated the
health benefits and freedom of movement allowed by the shorter hem and Turkish style
pants. Both women began wearing the reform dress in public and actively encouraging
other ladies to shed their cumbersome long skirts for the less restrictive garment
(Appleton 2000; Nelson 2000; Mason 1992; Torrens 1997; Fischer 1997).
Although Bloomer was not the first woman to wear the radical new costume, she
published articles praising the garment’s benefits in her women’s newspaper, The Lily.
Subscriptions greatly increased after Bloomer printed patterns for sewing the new reform
dress. Due to this wide audience, the new costume became associated with her name and
popularly known as “Bloomers” (Nelson 2000; Appleton 2000; Mason 1992; Torrens
1997; Egan-Mitchell 2004)

26

Initially the leading feminists wore the radical reform dress in their private lives
and to their public speaking engagements. These brave ladies endured cruel heckling and
rude stares on the streets. People attended their speeches to gawk at their new clothing
(Nelson 2000; Mason 1992). Eventually it was decided the negative attention concerning
the reform dress hindered progress towards other aspects of women’s rights such as
suffrage and creating more opportunities for education and employment. Stanton and
Bloomer agreed more men and women would listen to their platform if they were not
offended by their choice in dress. Many of the activists returned to the traditional long
skirts to further their political causes (Egan-Mitchell 2004; Appleton 2000; Nelson 2000;
Fischer 1997; Torrens 1997; Mason 1992; Morren 1995).
Several decades later, the Bloomer costume returned as bicycling became popular.
Ladies could not enjoy the new sport of bicycling in long dresses, so Bloomers came into
vogue (Morren 1995; Appleton 2000). Thirty years after their invention, Bloomers were
more acceptable to the general public’s idea of femininity. “The struggle for women’s
emancipation would continue into the twentieth century, but the early feminists’
advocacy of the Bloomer and dress reform courageously set the stage for its
achievement” (Nelson 2000, 25).
In honor of Amelia Bloomer and her compatriots in the struggle for women’s
rights, ALA created a new booklist to promote feminist literature for children and young
adults named after her. The Amelia Bloomer Project is associated with the Feminist Task
Force of the Social Responsibilities Round Table. Committee members search
27

extensively and read widely to identity “quality fiction and nonfiction titles that affirm
positive roles for girls and women” (Amelia Bloomer Project committee 2016). Books
must successfully meet four criteria to be considered: significant feminist content,
excellence in writing, appealing format, and age appropriateness for young readers. It is
not enough for a female character to be portrayed as independent or spunky. A feminist
character should struggle to improve not only her situation, but also fight to change
inequalities for others. Only books published in the United States within the eighteen
months prior to the voting meeting at ALA Midwinter are eligible. If a book has been
discussed at the previous year’s Midwinter meeting, that title cannot be nominated again
the following year.
To create each year’s final Amelia Bloomer Project list, committee members must
read all the nominated books that meet the selection criteria. The entire committee meets
during Midwinter to discuss all the eligible books and the final selections are based upon
consensus. Once the committee agrees to the official list, the books are divided into three
categories: beginning readers, middle school, and young adult. Within each division, the
books are then grouped according to fiction and nonfiction titles. Committee members
annotate each selected book and announce the list in January on the ALA website. The
annual list of recommended books is then printed in Booklist as part of the Women’s
History Month issue, on the Amelia Bloomer Project blog, and in other professional
journals (Amelia Bloomer Project committee 2016).

28

Educators like Harper can search each year’s list for quality literature for children
and young adults containing significant feminist content portraying “girls and women as
capable of overcoming the obstacles they face” (O’Quinn 2007, 41). The annual list has
grown in popularity and has been featured in scholarly articles (Law, McCoy,
Olshewsky, and Semifero 2012), professional book reviews of feminist literature for
children (O’Quinn 2007), blogs (Lehman 2010), student magazines written by girls
(“What we’re reading” 2013), and research papers (Justilien 2013).
Conclusion
Quality literature can help readers identify who they are and who they want to
become (Boreen 1999). When searching for strong female characters, historical fiction
offers portraits of realistic role models for today’s readers. These characters overcome all
manners of adversity and discrimination that may not be addressed in contemporary
fiction to “emerge as heroines, protagonists who conquer typical and unusual conflicts to
emerge triumphant” (Hayn and Spiegel 1999, 96). This message is as important for
young women and men of the present, as it is for the future of an equitable society.

29

CHAPTER III
METHODOLOGY
When evaluating strong female characters in historical fiction, historical
authenticity and female empowerment are both primary literary considerations. This
study investigated the relationship between the variables of authenticity and
empowerment in order to offer new insights into the evaluation of female protagonists in
historical fiction novels on the Amelia Bloomer Project from the years 2002 to 2011.
These findings will help librarians and other educators select the best examples of
historical heroines to share with children and young adults.
This study posed the following research questions:
Primary Research Question
What is the relationship between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity (1999)
and Brown and St. Clair’s three levels of female empowerment (2002) in the historical
middle school novels selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia Bloomer Project
list?

Sub-questions
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of the historically accurate

30

protagonist and Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited scale (H1)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of an historical role model
acting courageously within society’s bounds and Brown and St. Clair’s female character
that defies society for personal ambition (H2)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s social renegade and Brown and St. Clair’s role
model that acts as a catalyst for change (H3)?

This study’s framework examined Boreen’s (1999) three types of historical
female role models: the historically accurate “real girl” strongly bound by her time and
society, the historical role model acting courageously within the bounds of society, and
the social renegade acting beyond her time, along with Brown and St. Clair’s (2002) three
stages of empowerment: characters that are strong on a limited scale, girls that defy
society for personal ambition, and heroines that act as a catalyst for societal change as
variables for comparing female protagonists’ levels of authenticity and empowerment in
historical fiction books included on the Amelia Bloomer Project booklist from 2002 to
2011.
To analyze feminist literature for children and young adults, this study examined
books selected for the Amelia Bloomer Project during its first decade with a particular
31

focus on middle school historical novels. This study’s qualitative procedure involved the
researcher recording every instance of female protagonists’ actions that were in conflict
with expected behavior. The researcher then assigned each action the appropriate
authenticity level from Boreen’s study of historical role models (1999) and the
corresponding empowerment level based on Brown and St. Clair’s approach (2002). As
each selected title on the booklist was analyzed, detailed note-taking described
nontraditional female protagonists and recorded examples of their sources of conflict and
actions on a standard form to maintain consistency throughout the reading process.
The key variables for this study include Boreen’s three levels of authenticity of
historical female role models (1999): the historically accurate “real girl” strongly bound
by her time and society, the historical role model acting courageously within the bounds
of society, and the social renegade acting beyond her time, and Brown and St. Clair’s
three stages of female empowerment (2002): characters that are strong on a limited scale,
girls that defy society for personal ambition, and heroines that act as a catalyst for
societal change. This provided a framework for examining these novels on the Amelia
Bloomer Project list. The researcher then analyzed the data counts of each protagonist’s
actions using SPSS to determine the significance of the relationship between a female
character’s historical authenticity and empowerment levels.
Since there was not a causal relationship between these two approaches,
correlation was measured. “Correlation coefficients are used to quantitatively describe
the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables” (Portney and Watkins
32

2000). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, or Spearman’s rho, measured the
strength of the relationship between historical female characters’ levels of authenticity
and empowerment. Spearman’s rho was determined to be the most appropriate statistical
test for measuring correlation in ordinal scale data, such as these approaches’ three
ranked levels. Due to the small sample size of this study, whether or not the correlations
were significant was not as important as the strength of the correlation. A public librarian
with a background in children’s services acted as the secondary researcher. She read and
analyzed 10% of the selected novels with a 90.4% rate of inter-rater reliability. The
primary researcher also consulted a statistician offered through the Texas Woman’s
University Center for Research and Design Analysis to discuss the most appropriate tests
for this data set and verify the validity of the SPSS results.
Qualitative analysis of each protagonist’s actions allowed the researcher to
include specific pieces of the narratives describing historical female characters in
nontraditional roles in regards to their levels of authenticity and empowerment to expand
the statistical results. This secondary research involved “sorting through narrative data
using a coding process to develop categories in a systematic way, to uncover patterns or
themes in the mass of information that is available” (Portney and Watkins 2000). The
selected novels were then grouped into broad categories based on the detailed notetaking.

33

Theoretical Perspective
For the purpose of this study, the researcher carefully read, analyzed, and coded
protagonists’ actions in twenty-seven middle school historical novels on the Amelia
Bloomer Project list through the lens of feminism. This study’s content analysis was
approached from a feminist literary criticism perspective. Both Boreen’s discussion of
female role models (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s description of female empowerment
(2002) were analyzed from a feminist viewpoint, particularly the feminist literary
criticism perspective which focuses on how female characters are portrayed in literature
(Kolodny 1989).
Feminist literary criticism research analyzes gender role portrayals, specifically
female characters in nontraditional roles (Trites 1997). However females do not have to
choose typically male professions to become empowered. Women and girls who
overcome disadvantages to gain confidence in themselves or decide their own paths also
qualify as feminist characters (Varga-Dobai 2013). Young readers benefit from viewing
literature through a feminist lens because this reflects “the way we read texts, how we
respond to others, and how we live our lives” (Appleman 2000, 75).
Books featured for the Amelia Bloomer Project have been selected based on
significant feminist content (Amelia Bloomer Project committee 2016), therefore feminist
literary criticism was appropriate for analyzing female characters’ levels of authenticity
and empowerment. Varga-Dobai encouraged readers to use feminist lenses when
34

evaluating historical fiction “to question the objectivity and truthfulness of literary
representation” (2013, 145).
Research Problem
Reference guides, journal booklists, and blogs offer readers reviews of current
historical fiction novels featuring female protagonists such as articles in Feminist
Collections or Booklist. Librarians and educators seeking to provide high quality
literature with historically authentic, but empowered, girls need to consider more than
simply the gender of the main character. However, there are not many sources discussing
how to critique children’s and young adult fiction when searching for female role models
(Weisbard and Grapentine-Benton 2007).
After reviewing the literature to discover feminist role models in historical fiction
for children and young adults, this study posed the following research questions:
Primary Research Question
What is the relationship between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity (1999)
and Brown and St. Clair’s three levels of female empowerment (2002) in the historical
middle school novels selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia Bloomer Project
list?

35

Sub-questions
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of the historically accurate
protagonist and Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited scale (H1)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of an historical role model
acting courageously within society’s bounds and Brown and St. Clair’s female character
that defies society for personal ambition (H2)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s social renegade and Brown and St. Clair’s role
model that acts as a catalyst for change (H3)?

Hypotheses
These research hypotheses were investigated, each using Boreen’s three levels of
historical authenticity (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s three stages of female
empowerment (2002) as variables. Boreen’s historically accurate “real girls” category
aligns with Brown and St. Clair’s role models that develop self-confidence (H1).
Boreen’s second group, historical role models, aligns with Brown and St. Clair’s
identification of characters that defy social conventions to pursue individual dreams (H2).
Boreen’s final level, characters as social renegades, aligns with Brown and St. Clair’s last
category, how girl characters become a catalyst for societal change (H3). These two
36

approaches organize their successive stages by the female character’s actions. The first
levels focus on internal struggles and then progress to conflicts with other characters,
before they reach the final stage of rebelling against society in general.
Data Selection
As of January 2016, the Amelia Bloomer Project committee has selected 718
books to feature on their list as examples of quality feminist literature for children and
young adults. To narrow down the large field of feminist titles, the researcher decided to
analyze the first decade of the Amelia Bloomer Project and investigate the beginning of
this award list, reducing the number of potential books to 430 novels. Of the three age
groups represented on the booklist, the researcher then chose the middle school section of
the Amelia Bloomer Project to narrow the sample of books to the researcher’s area of
specialty as a middle school librarian. One hundred thirty-six books were initially
identified in the middle school readers group. Of that number, sixty-five titles were
classified as fiction. Each book was then examined to determine the historical time period
of the story. According to Tomlinson and Lynch-Brown (2007), to qualify as historical
fiction, the setting must be placed at least twenty years before the present. Only books set
in the mid 1990s or earlier were selected as part of this project, giving the researcher
thirty-three books for analysis.
As the books were read and analyzed, the researcher identified several titles that
did not meet the study’s criteria. Books that blend historical fiction with other genres, a
37

popular trend in recent years, were not included in this study (Saricks 2008). One graphic
novel and one book of poetry were not included in the data set in an effort to maintain
consistency in the qualitative content analysis of protagonists’ actions. These two genres
are formatted differently than historical novels, so the variance in coding may have
altered the final results of this project. Two historical fiction titles that include fantasy
elements were removed from the final booklist because the protagonists could see or hear
mythical characters that had an impact on their decisions and actions. Since this study
evaluated historical authenticity as it related to female empowerment, characters
possessing supernatural abilities or assistance would skew comparison results. Two other
historical fiction novels were not evaluated because they feature young male protagonists
observing their mothers’ journeys toward empowerment. This study focused on the
actions of young female role models, not newly enlightened boys or adult women’s
struggles to overcome obstacles. Ultimately, twenty-seven books, 6.28% of the total
books identified by the Amelia Bloomer Project from the years 2002 to 2011, met all the
criteria to be included in this analysis of female role models in historical fiction for
middle school readers. See appendix A and Table 1 for a complete listing of the twentyseven historical fiction novels included in this study.

Conflict Coding
To determine which text examples to include in this content analysis, the
researcher decided to code only character actions. A protagonist’s thoughts about
dissatisfaction with society’s expectations or her dreams for a better position in life were
not coded as variables in a character’s journey towards empowerment. To qualify as a
variable, the protagonist must act in conflict. The four types of literary conflict identified
in this study include characters’ conflicts with themselves, another person, society in
general, or nature (Stoodt, Amspaugh, and Hunt 1996). These four types of literary
conflict were recorded on the standard data coding form for each novel. Internal conflict
was assigned a 1, interpersonal conflict a 2, societal conflict a 3, and conflict with natural
elements a 4 for the purpose of SPSS analysis. In some instances, a character’s single
action could be in conflict with multiple sources at once. Since conflict types are not
mutually exclusive, all relevant sources of conflict were recorded on the data coding
form. After coding each incident in which the protagonist acted in conflict, then the
individual action was evaluated for both authenticity and empowerment levels based on
Boreen (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s (2002) work. See appendix B for the data
coding form created for this research. The variable categories will be considered in detail
next.

41

Authenticity and Empowerment Variables
Since all the books on the Amelia Bloomer Project list already feature strong
female role models as part of the selection process for the list, Heine and Inkster’s
feminist rubric for evaluating literature (1999) was not necessary for this study. Instead,
emphasis was placed on Boreen’s research concerning different types of historical female
role models (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s 2002 study describing various stages of
empowerment as added layers for studying the feminist content of these selected novels.
Based on Boreen’s 1999 study of female historical fiction role models, characters
can be portrayed as historically accurate “real girls” bound by their position and time,
historical role models that act within the boundaries of their society while becoming
empowered, or social renegades acting ahead of their times. All three categories were
identified as historical role models, with the female character’s actions in response to
conflict increasing with each successive level. For this study, each protagonist was
analyzed for historical authenticity. Every action was assigned an authenticity level from
A1 to A3 according to Boreen’s historical role model categories. Characters that are
internally strong, but whose actions are tightly bound by their time period or societal
position were rated most historically accurate (A1). Protagonists who behave realistically
within society’s boundaries for their historical time period, while also acting
courageously, were designated historical role models (A2). Characters who behave ahead
of their times by taking a stand against society’s expectations or rebelling to change the

42

status quo were ranked as least authentic (A3). Each individual action was assigned only
one level for the purpose of this content analysis (Boreen 1999).
Brown and St. Clair’s 2002 work also featured three levels of understanding
feminist characterization. Female role models can simply develop confidence in
themselves, defy society’s conventions to pursue their dreams, or become a catalyst for
societal change. All three categories related to female characters in historical fiction
novels, with the protagonist’s actions in response to conflict increasing with each
progressive stage. For this study, each action was assigned an empowerment rating from
E1 to E3 to correspond with Brown and St. Clair’s empowerment levels (2002).
Protagonists who are tightly bound by their gender, position in society, and time period
can only demonstrate strength on a limited scale. These characters are extremely
disadvantaged, but create a place for themselves in society by developing confidence in
their abilities. This first level of empowerment was rated the lowest (E1). Characters that
enjoy a more secure position, but choose to defy society’s conventions for personal
ambition often suffer for that desire. Protagonists that pay a high price for their defiance
earned the second empowerment level (E2). Some characters escape society or become a
catalyst for changing the status quo. These protagonists usually succeed without
experiencing personal loss and their actions were assigned the highest empowerment
rating (E3). To correspond with the authenticity levels, actions only received one
empowerment rank as well (Brown and St. Clair 2002).

43

Measurement Tools
During the critical reading stage, all data pertaining to the novels and
protagonists’ actions were recorded on the standard form to maintain consistency
throughout the research. After all the variables were coded, the data were then copied into
an Excel spreadsheet and run through SPSS for analysis. Tables representing the results
were reformatted to be included as part of the fourth chapter of this study. This research
investigated the relationship between authenticity and empowerment variables in order to
offer new insights into the evaluation of female characters in historical fiction. These
findings will help librarians and educators select the best examples of historical heroines
to share with children and young adults.

44

CHAPTER IV
RESULTS
This study used content analysis to identify the relationship between historical
authenticity and female empowerment levels in middle school historical fiction novels
selected from the first decade of the Amelia Bloomer Project. Books included on this
ALA booklist are chosen for significant feminist content, excellence in writing, appealing
format, and age appropriateness for children and young adults (Amelia Bloomer Project
committee 2016). Boreen’s study of three distinct female historical role models (1999)
and Brown and St. Clair’s study detailing progressive stages of female empowerment
levels provided the ordinal categories for the authenticity and empowerment variables in
this research. The researcher sought to investigate the relationship between Boreen’s
three stages of authenticity for role models in historical fiction (1999) and Brown and St.
Clair’s three empowerment levels for female characters in historical fiction (2002).
Multiple frequencies and percentages demonstrate the diversity of characters,
locations, and time periods included in these twenty-seven historical fiction novels.
Spearman’s rho was used to measure the correlation between Boreen’s three stages of
authenticity for role models in historical fiction (1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s three
empowerment levels for female characters in historical fiction (2002). The overall results
show a significant, positive correlation between authenticity and empowerment variables.
Individual novels will be discussed to illustrate differences in the strength of the
45

correlations and to identify trends in the depiction of female protagonists in middle
school historical fiction featured on the Amelia Bloomer Project booklist.
The Sample Set
Before addressing the primary research question, it will be helpful to understand
the specifics of each of the twenty-seven novels. The sample size was limited to historical
fiction novels listed in the middle school category of the Amelia Bloomer Project
published from 2002 to 2011. Every year in that range included at least one historical
fiction novel except 2006. The lone middle level historical fiction novel that year featured
a male protagonist, so it was excluded from this study. The year with the largest amount
of historical fiction novels nominated was 2003 with six titles on the booklist. The
average number of middle school books classified as historical fiction each year was 2.7.
The frequency table for the twenty-seven selected historical fiction novels is presented on
the following page (Table 2).

Protagonists’ ages in these novels range from 9 to 14 for the majority of their
stories. Some of the characters age during the course of their novels, but the researcher
chose to use the age associated with each character for the majority of the book. Two
protagonists are orphans and do not know their exact ages; however another character
guesses she is perhaps 11. For the purpose of analysis, these characters were identified as
pre-teen and listed between ages 9 and 11. Only eight of the twenty-seven protagonists,
29.6%, were age 11 and younger. The majority of protagonists, 70.4%, were 12 to 14
years old. The age distribution of the novels’ protagonists by age is included on the
following page (Table 3).

Historical time periods for the selected novels in this study were distributed
among five centuries. The earliest time period portrayed in one novel was the 11th
century. Three novels were set in the 14th and 17th centuries, while the majority of the
stories were placed in the previous two centuries. The 19th century was the historical
period for thirteen novels, 48.1%, and ten books, 37.0%, were set in the 20th century. The
table below shows the time period distribution among the twenty-seven novels (Table 4).

It can also be helpful to examine the geographic setting for each of the historical
novels that were part of the data set. Twelve of the novels, 44.4%, were set in the United
States. England was the setting for the next highest group with eight books, 29.6% of the
total. Pre-statehood Alaska, Canada, France, the Kingdom of Hawaii, India, Italy, and
Libya were the locations for the remaining seven books, each of these countries or
territories were listed at 3.7%. Some protagonists travel to other countries or international
waters during the course of their stories; however the researcher chose to list the
character’s country of origin or place of citizenship to record as those novels’ settings.
The percentage for each country setting in each historical novel is included below (Table
5).

An interesting observation about the data found in Tables 3 and 4 involves novels
set in England and the United States, the two most common locations for this sample.
Historical fiction novels located in England were spread across the 14th, 17th, 19th, and
20th centuries of this content analysis. The United States was the setting for the largest
percentage of books at 44.4%; however these twelve novels were only placed in the 19th
and 20th centuries, accounting for 52.2% or roughly half of all the books describing those
time periods. Since England is an older country than the United States, this occurrence is
expected, but worth noting.
Primary Analysis
To critique female role models in historical fiction novels for children and young
adults, both authenticity and empowerment were considered in this analysis. This study
posed the following research questions:
Primary Research Question
What is the relationship between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity (1999)
and Brown and St. Clair’s three levels of female empowerment (2002) in the historical
middle school novels selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia Bloomer Project
list?

50

Sub-questions
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of the historically accurate
protagonist and Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited scale (H1)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of an historical role model
acting courageously within society’s bounds and Brown and St. Clair’s female character
that defies society for personal ambition (H2)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s social renegade and Brown and St. Clair’s role
model that acts as a catalyst for change (H3)?

These research hypotheses used Boreen’s historical authenticity levels (1999) and
Brown and St. Clair’s female empowerment levels (2002) as variables. What was the
relationship between Boreen’s “real girls” category and Brown and St. Clair’s assessment
of characters that develop self-confidence (H1)? What was the relationship between
Boreen’s second group, historical role models, and Brown and St. Clair’s middle
category of a character that defies social conventions to pursue individual dreams (H2)?
What was the relationship between Boreen’s final level, characters as social renegades,
and Brown and St. Clair’s last category, girl characters that become a catalyst for societal
change (H3)?

51

Categorizing Character Actions
To answer these research questions, the qualitative content analysis focused on
female protagonists’ actions within each historical novel. Each novel was read with the
story’s conflict in mind. Every instance when the female protagonist acted outside her
society’s expectations was cited on the data coding form. The twenty-seven historical
fiction novels ranged in length from 118 pages with eleven instances of protagonist
action to 338 pages with forty-seven occurrences of action-based conflicts. The overall
total for identified protagonist actions against society’s expectations for female characters
across the twenty-seven novels was 671 conflicts. The following table shows the
frequency of coded actions per novel and each novel’s percentage of the total conflicts
(Table 6).

Categorizing Story Conflicts
On the data coding form, each conflict was identified as internal against oneself or
external versus another person, society in general, or against nature. Of the 671 conflicts,
seventy-four, or 11.0%, involved the protagonist in debate with herself. Characters in
conflict with another person numbered 541, 80.6%, and accounted for the majority of
coded actions. Conflicts with the larger society or system in general were 167, 24.9% of
the recorded actions. The fewest conflicts were waged against nature and involved
twenty-nine, 4.3% of the cited actions. During analysis the researcher found protagonists
were sometimes involved in conflicts with multiple sources in a single incident.
Therefore, some actions were assigned more than one conflict type. The following table
shows the frequencies of protagonist conflict against these four categories (Table 7).

Categorizing Historical Authenticity
After every instance of protagonist conflict was recorded on the data coding form,
then authenticity and empowerment variables were assigned based on Boreen’s (1999)
54

three levels of historical role models and Brown and St. Clair’s (2002) three levels of
female empowerment. Unlike sources of conflict, the authenticity and empowerment
levels were mutually exclusive. Each conflict was only assigned one authenticity level
and one corresponding empowerment level.
For the authenticity variable, protagonists that acted as historically accurate “real
girls” tightly bound by their societal position and historical time period were labeled A1.
Two hundred seven conflicts, 30.8%, were in the A1 category. Female main characters
who acted courageously within their historical and societal boundaries were assigned A2.
The most actions fell in this authenticity level with 381, 56.8% of the coded conflicts.
Protagonists who became social renegades pushing the boundaries of their time period
were designated A3. The fewest conflict incidents, eighty-three or 12.4%, qualified for
this variable level. The following table demonstrates the frequencies for each level of the
authenticity variable (Table 8).

Categorizing Female Empowerment
To determine the empowerment variable, female characters that developed
confidence in their abilities and found a place in society were assigned E1. Two hundred
thirty-two conflicts, 34.6%, were in the E1 category. Protagonists that chose to defy
society’s conventions for personal ambition were designated E2. The most actions fell in
this empowerment level with 375, 55.9%, of the coded conflicts. Girls who became a
catalyst for societal change or escaped their societies altogether were labeled E3. The
fewest conflict incidents, sixty-four or 9.5%, qualified for this variable level. The
frequencies for each level of the empowerment variable are presented on the following
page (Table 9).

Relationships Between Historical Authenticity and Female Empowerment
This study posed the following research questions:
Primary Research Question
What is the relationship between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity (1999)
and Brown and St. Clair’s three levels of female empowerment (2002) in the historical
middle school novels selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia Bloomer Project
list?

Sub-questions
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of the historically accurate
protagonist and Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited scale (H1)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of an historical role model
acting courageously within society’s bounds and Brown and St. Clair’s female character
that defies society for personal ambition (H2)?

What is the relationship between Boreen’s social renegade and Brown and St. Clair’s role
model that acts as a catalyst for change (H3)?

57

Using SPSS, Spearman’s rho was run to look for a significant, positive correlation
between Boreen’s three stages of historically authentic role models (1999) and Brown
and St. Clair’s three progressive levels of female empowerment (2002). Correlation is
significant at the 0.01 level and the overall correlation between authenticity and
empowerment was .863 for the combined coded actions in the twenty-seven historical
fiction novels. The following table displays the correlation between authenticity and
empowerment (Table 10).

The twenty-seven historical fiction novels all showed significant correlations
between authenticity and empowerment variables; however some novels’ results were
stronger than others. A Golden Web, Journey to the River Sea, Keeping Corner, Sources
of Light, and The Case of the Cryptic Crinoline had a correlation coefficient of 1.000, the
strongest correlation between authenticity and empowerment levels. Numbering All the
58

Bones at .978 and The Hope Chest at .954 also displayed strong results. Most of the
novels’ correlations were between .740 and .887. The Shadows of Ghadames, Love, Ruby
Lavender, At the Sign of the Star, Mable Riley, and Hannah, Divided fell in the .810 to
.887 range. The Wild Girls, The Case of the Missing Marquess, The Voyage of Patience
Goodspeed, One Crazy Summer, The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate, Rodzina, The Case of
the Gypsy Good-bye, The Education of Patience Goodspeed, The Case of the Peculiar
Pink Fan, and My Guardian Angel fell between .740 and .795 on the correlation
coefficient scale. The Case of the Left-Handed Lady at .535, The Puppeteer’s Apprentice
at .549, and Together Apart at .577 showed the lowest numbers, however they were still
medium strength correlations. Two novels were not able to be measured for the
correlation between authenticity and empowerment because the variable levels did not
change for the different conflict incidents during The Great Death and The Shrouding
Woman. The authenticity level for every conflict in The Great Death was Boreen’s
characterization of an historical role model acting courageously within society’s bounds.
The empowerment stage for every conflict in The Shrouding Woman was Brown and St.
Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited scale. The lack of different levels of
authenticity and empowerment variables assigned to conflicts over the course of the
novels prevented correlation from being measured for The Great Death and The
Shrouding Woman. The following table displays the novels categorized by the strength of
their correlation between authenticity and empowerment (Table 11).

Based on these percentages in Tables 7 and 8, Boreen’s (1999) “real girls” bound
by their position and time period at 30.8% (A1) correlated most often with Brown and St.
Clair’s (2002) girls that developed confidence in their abilities at 34.6% (E1) examined in
the first research sub-question. Historical role models who acted courageously within
society’s boundaries at 56.8% (A2) correlated most often with protagonists that defied
society’s conventions for personal ambition at 55.9% (E2) as examined in the second
research sub-question. The third level of authenticity that featured social renegades who
acted ahead of their time at 12.4% (A3) correlated most often with the final stage of
empowerment when characters became a catalyst for societal change or decided to escape
from their society at 9.5% (E3) stated in the third research sub-question. The following
table displays the results of these three research sub-questions (Table 13).

Secondary Analysis
Secondary variables were analyzed to enhance this study. The ages of the
protagonists, setting of the historical eras, geographic settings, and sources of conflict
were examined for correlations with the primary variables of historical authenticity and
female empowerment levels.
Age of Protagonists
The strength of the correlations gradually increased with the protagonists’ ages
from 9 to 12 years. The 9-year-old protagonist had a .811 correlation, the two pre-teen
characters had a .871 correlation, the five 11-year-old girls had a .83 correlation, and the
seven 12-year-old characters had a .917 correlation between authenticity and
empowerment. These numbers began to fluctuate after 12-years of age. The four 13-yearolds had .776 correlation and then eight 14-year-olds increased with a .849 correlation.
Even though there was a slight decrease in strength for 13-year-olds, the remaining years
still showed strong correlations between authenticity and empowerment levels for
females in this sample of historical fiction novels. Correlation coefficients for
authenticity and empowerment based by the protagonists’ ages are presented on the
following pages (Table 14).

Setting of Historical Era
Fluctuations were also found among the five centuries of settings included in this
sample of historical fiction novels. The strength of the correlations increased from the
11th century (.795) to the 14th century (.931). The correlation coefficients slightly
decreased during the 17th century (.843) and continued into the 19th century (.821).
During the 20th century the strength of the correlation between these variables increased
to .898, the second highest level in this sample. All the centuries showed strong,
significant correlations between authenticity and empowerment levels. The following
table displays the correlation coefficients for authenticity and empowerment across the
five centuries in this study (Table 15).

Geographic Setting
The United States was the geographic setting for the largest amount of historical

fiction novels selected for this study with twelve books set in the U.S. The average
strength of the correlation between authenticity and empowerment was .818 for these
novels. The second most featured location was England, with eight novels set in England.
This country averaged .782 for the strength of the correlation between the two variables.
The remaining seven countries or territories were each included in one book. Settings in
Italy and India both received a strong 1.000 correlation coefficient. Settings in Canada
(.853), Libya (.810), France (.795), and the Kingdom of Hawaii (.791) were a little less
strong, but still significant. The setting in the Territory of Alaska could not be measured,
because there was no variation in authenticity levels for this novel. All of the conflict
actions in the novel set in the Territory of Alaska were coded as Boreen’s
76

characterization of an historical role model acting courageously within society’s bounds.
The strength of the correlation between authenticity and empowerment grouped by
location is shown on the following pages (Table 16).

. Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).
Sources of Conflict
Sources of conflict were also analyzed as part of this study. Strong correlations

between authenticity and empowerment variables were apparent when the female
protagonist was in conflict with herself (.791), in opposition with another person (.875),
or fighting against society at large (.887). These correlation coefficients gradually
increased following the escalation of the protagonists’ actions from internal conflict, to
interpersonal disputes, to eventually confronting society. These results mirrored the
progressive stages of Boreen’s (1999) historical role models and Brown and St. Clair’s
(2002) female empowerment levels. A curious outlier was discovered in instances when
the protagonist was in conflict with nature. The p-value was greater than .05, so the
correlation between authenticity and empowerment variables when nature was a source
of conflict was not significant. Since conflicts against nature were the smallest
80

percentages of actions (4.3%), perhaps a larger sample size would help examine this
finding. The following table presents the correlation coefficients for the four sources of
conflict (Table 17).

Emerging Themes
After thoroughly reading and analyzing twenty-seven historical fiction novels for
middle school using the primary variables of historical authenticity and female
empowerment, as well as the secondary variables age of protagonists, setting of the
historical eras, geographic location of setting, and sources of conflict, several themes
emerged in identifying and categorizing the character actions. All the books featured
feminist protagonists on historical journeys of empowerment; however their individual
82

paths varied. Some of the girls repaired their broken families, overcame personal guilt,
and found new possibilities for happiness and security. Other characters fought social
injustice, helped strangers at their own risk, or left their homes to pursue unconventional
occupations. No matter their social situation or historical time period, each girl became
stronger by developing confidence in her abilities and finding her place in the world. The
following table presents information about the protagonists and their struggles (Table 18).

Overcoming Guilt
Love, Ruby Lavender chronicles a young girl’s process of forgiving herself for her
grandfather’s death. Ruby privately feels responsible for the car accident that claims his
life, even though she had no part in the incident and her family does not blame her.
During the story, Ruby stands up to a local bully in their small Mississippi town who
secretly threatens to expose her fears about the car accident. Ruby finds the courage to
talk about her perceived role in her beloved grandfather’s death, finally allowing herself
to grieve and begin healing. As the youngest protagonist in this collection of books,
Ruby’s conflicts are centered more on overcoming her personal feelings of guilt and

87

repairing friendships than most of the other characters in the other novels in the data set
(Wiles 2001).
Sheltering Strangers
Two books feature girls willing to hide foreigners at great personal risk. In My
Guardian Angel, Elvina possesses an unusual skill for a girl in 1096 France. Her
grandfather, a famous Jewish scholar, has taught Elvina how to read and write. She is a
curious learner that frequently eavesdrops on the boys’ school lessons. When a runaway
Crusader named Gauthier asks for Elvina’s help in hiding from his superiors so that he
can enter the monastery to study, she bravely brings him food and medicine. Elvina’s
courage is rewarded when Gauthier’s brother helps her father protect the Jewish
community in return (Weil 2004).
The Shadows of Ghadames features a 19th century Muslim girl, Malika, who longs
for the education and freedoms enjoyed by her brother. Malika reluctantly follows the
rules of her tight-knit Libyan city until the night one of her father’s wives brings a
wounded stranger into their home. The women decide to hide the man from the people
seeking to throw him out of the city until he recovers. During his secret stay in their
storage room, Abdelkarim convinces Malika’s mother to allow her to learn how to read.
In exchange, Malika helps Abdelkarim evade capture and sneak out of town. When her
father returns from his caravan, he tells Malika change is coming to their city (Stolz
2004).
88

Fighting Social Injustice
Two novels involve girls fighting against larger inequities in society. In The Hope
Chest, Violet runs away from home in 1920 to find her older sister Chloe. Once Violet
arrives in New York, she discovers Chloe has left her public health position to lobby
congressmen in Tennessee to pass the Nineteenth Amendment giving women the right to
vote. Violet joins some other suffragettes and travels to Tennessee to find Chloe. Once
she witnesses the debates in Nashville, Violet realizes the importance of suffrage and
helps the campaign. After the memorable experience, Violet plans to attend college
eventually and help pass other laws to end racial injustice (Schwabach 2008).
Sources of Light is a coming of age story set among the civil rights unrest of
1962. Sam and her mother move to her father’s hometown of Jackson, Mississippi after
his death to be close to his relatives. Sam’s progressive mother has a difficult time
adjusting to Jackson’s conservative white society, while her daughter tries to fit in with
the popular teens. When Sam’s mother lectures at the local black college, their family
begins receiving threats. Later Sam witnesses a peaceful lunch counter sit-in become
violent and she takes pictures of the resulting brutality. Eventually Sam must choose
between following the status quo or publishing her pictures to show the truth and fight
injustice (McMullan 2010).

89

Repairing Family Relationships
Three books discuss girls living with difficult family situations. These young
protagonists work to resolve their differences and mend relationships. In The Shrouding
Woman, Evie’s family is trying to recover from the death of her mother when Aunt Flo
moves in to help manage their Minnesota pioneer farm. Evie is slow to accept her aunt
and does not want another woman to replace her mother. Gradually Evie allows Aunt Flo
into her life and begins assisting her aunt with her shrouding duties for local prairie
families. Not only does the family begin to heal, but Evie also discovers a calling to
follow her aunt’s profession preparing the dead for burial and comforting their loved ones
(Ellsworth 2002).
One Crazy Summer describes 11-year-old Delphine’s trip to Oakland, California
to reconnect with her estranged mother. By reading her mother’s poetry and participating
in the classes at the People’s Center, Delphine finds her own voice. During the course of
the summer of 1968, Delphine and her two younger sisters slowly come to understand
their mother’s story and rebuild their relationship. Even though the girls are returning to
live with their father in Brooklyn, there is hope for another visit with their mother in the
future (Williams-Garcia 2010).
In The Wild Girls, Newt’s parents are contemplating divorce and their home
environment is tense. To escape, Newt begins spending time in the woods with her new
friend Fox. The two girls win a spot in a summer writing class that teaches Newt to seek
90

the truth, better understand her family members’ perspectives, and express her true
feelings. The creative environment of 1972 Berkeley helps Newt gain confidence and
become comfortable with herself. Even though her parents may not stay together, Newt
builds a stronger relationship with both of them through honest conversations (Murphy
2007).
Learning Unconventional Skills
Several books describe girls learning skills or trades normally reserved for males
during their time periods. At the Sign of the Star tells the story of Meg, the only child of a
bookseller in 17th century London. At the beginning of the book, she is secure in her
place as her father’s heiress and eventual owner of his shop where she is learning the
book trade. However when her father remarries, Meg’s confidence is shaken when her
stepmother becomes pregnant and tries to teach her housekeeping skills instead. After her
little brother is born and becomes the new heir, Meg must decide which path to pursue
for her own future (Sturtevant 2000).
Two books about Patience Goodspeed are included in this study. During the first
novel, The Voyage of Patience Goodspeed, Patience reluctantly joins her father on a
three-year whaling trip in 1835. Even though she has a natural talent for mathematics,
Patience is relegated to cooking in the galley. After the first mate praises her abilities to
her father, Captain Goodspeed begins teaching Patience how to navigate. Some crew
members disapprove of her learning a traditionally male trade, but Patience later uses her
91

navigation skills to save the marooned men when mutineers take over the ship (Frederick
2002).
The second novel in this series, The Education of Patience Goodspeed, finds
Patience sent to a girls’ boarding school in Hawaii while her father and the crew
complete the next part of their dangerous whaling trip. Patience continues to study
advanced mathematics, earning the disapproval of the strict reverend in charge of the
young ladies’ curriculum. Patience defies his orders by secretly teaching her classmates
mathematics and how to use a sextant. When her father returns, Patience resumes her
navigation duties on board the Morning Star (Frederick 2004).
In The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate, 11-year-old Calpurnia eagerly learns how to
explore and catalogue the natural world while spending time with her grandfather on their
cotton farm in Fentress, Texas. The two share a special bond, but Calpurnia’s mother is
determined to teach her only daughter how to become a genteel debutante and successful
housewife. Calpurnia longs to attend the university in Austin to study science, but that
prospect seems unlikely in 1899. As her parents try to push her to become more
domestic, Calpurnia dares to dream of a different future (Kelly 2009).
Journeying to New Homes
Some of the books in this study feature orphans trying to find new homes and
make a place for themselves in the world. The Puppeteer’s Apprentice is the story of
Mouse, a young medieval scullery maid in England, who bravely runs away from the
92

abuses of her manor house. Mouse wanders the village until she is enchanted by the
puppet show at the fair. She boldly asks the puppeteer if she could work as his assistant,
but he refuses. Undeterred, Mouse stows away on top of the wagon and pleads her case
when she is discovered. Through hard work and determination, Mouse becomes an
accomplished puppeteer and forges a new life for herself (Love 2003).
Rodzina follows the journey of a Polish girl riding on an orphan train heading
west in 1881. Since she is one of the oldest orphans on the train, Rodzina is recruited to
take care of the younger children during the journey. Refusing to become a servant or
stepmother to a large pioneer family, Rodzina craftily evades adoption at each stop.
During the long trip west, Rodzina eventually befriends Miss Doctor and realizes the
woman has been trying to find good homes for all the orphans. As the last orphan on the
train when it arrives in California, Rodzina asks Miss Doctor if she can live with her
instead of going to the domestic servant training school. Together they form a new family
and Rodzina continues her high school education (Cushman 2003).
A more hazardous struggle for survival is portrayed in The Great Death. At the
beginning of the 20th century, white settlers bring diseases to the isolated villages in
Alaska. Two sisters are the lone survivors of their village’s epidemic and must travel far
downriver if they are going to find civilization and live through the harsh winter. Along
the way, the girls must find food and shelter from the brutal elements during the long
journey. The older sister, Millie, successfully leads Maura through the Alaskan

93

wilderness amid wolves, blizzards, and dangerous strangers to find safety (Smelcer
2009).
Journey to the River Sea chronicles Maia’s voyage as she leaves her English
boarding school in 1910 to live with her new found relatives in the Amazon rainforest.
Even though Maia is disappointed with the cruel Carter family and their rigid lifestyle,
she comes to love Brazil and makes new friends in her adopted country. When the Carter
family must return to England, Maia and her beloved governess convince her lawyer to
allow Miss Minton to become her legal guardian so they may return to Brazil
permanently (Ibbotson 2001).
Leaving Home to Pursue Dreams
Five books involve protagonists that decide they must leave their families to
further their education or take advantage of exciting new opportunities. During the final
months of the U.S. Civil War, 13-year-old Eulinda is trapped by her situation in
Numbering All the Bones. Her father is the master of the plantation, but she is a slave
woman’s daughter. Eulinda uncomfortably alternates between house slave and family
member at her mistress’ discretion. When Clara Barton arrives to help clean out
Andersonville Prison, Eulinda decides to leave her home to help identify and respectfully
re-bury the dead prisoners. After she finds her brother’s remains, Eulinda embraces her
new path and accompanies Miss Barton to Washington to work as her secretary (Rinaldi
2002).
94

In Together Apart, Hannah is trying to recover from the devastating 1888
Blizzard, but her father won’t forgive her for surviving while her younger brothers died.
Isaac needs a place to hide from his abusive step-father and plan his escape. Both teens
find refuge in Eliza Moore’s home as they help her print a feminist newspaper and run a
Women’s Resting Room for the ladies in their Nebraska town. As Hannah and Isaac
grow closer through their shared experiences, they make plans for a different life in New
Orleans (Gray 2002).
Mable is looking for adventure in 1901 Ontario when she leaves her home to
accompany her older sister Viola on her first teaching assignment in Mable Riley: A
Reliable Record of Humdrum, Peril, and Romance. Mable’s enthusiasm and opinionated
personality occasionally lands her in trouble with her sister and the locals, but she finds
inspiration when she meets Mrs. Rattle. When Mable accepts an invitation to the Ladies
Reading Circle meeting at Mrs. Rattle’s cottage, she discovers the women are really
suffragists planning to protest working conditions at the local cheese factory. By helping
Mrs. Rattle, Mable learns about additional career paths for women and plans to pursue
her dreams of becoming a writer (Jocelyn 2004).
In Keeping Corner, 12-year-old Leela becomes a widow before she even moves
into her husband’s house. In accordance with India’s traditions in 1918, Leela must
remove all jewelry and bright clothing, shave her head, and stay inside her home for a
year of mourning. Tutoring sessions with her principal offer the only respite from Leela’s
solitude. After her year of keeping corner is finished, Leela is still shunned by society and
95

nothing remains for her in their village but widowhood. Encouraged by her older brother
and principal, Leela convinces her family to let her attend boarding school in Ahmedabad
to create a new life as a teacher or doctor (Sheth 2007).
In Hannah, Divided, Hannah’s gift for mathematics earns her a chance to leave
her small Pennsylvania town in 1934 to study advanced mathematics in Philadelphia.
Even though her parents are reluctant to let her leave and her friends are not supportive,
Hannah will receive much needed reading tutoring while having the opportunity to learn
higher mathematics than is available in her hometown. Hannah suffers homesickness and
the taunts of her sophisticated city classmates, but befriends her fellow scholarship
housemates and perseveres. At the end of the semester Hannah is not sure she will be
selected for the Wexler scholarship, but resolves to continue studying and apply for
another scholarship next year (Griffin 2002).
Disguising Identities
Some of these bold protagonists disguise themselves as boys or various female
characters to successfully hide in plain sight. A Golden Web, based on the life of
Alessandra Giliani, imagines the early life of the first recorded female anatomist.
Alessandra longs to leave her cloistered world behind to pursue a medical degree.
However, in 14th century Italy females are not allowed to study at the university. To
realize her ambition, Alessandra escapes from the convent and dresses as a young male
student. As Sandro, she quickly advances through the coursework and earns a position as
96

Dr. Mondino’s assistant. Alessandra discovers how the circulatory system works by
dissecting pigs and presents a lecture using a human body before her untimely death
(Quick 2010).
Enola, the younger sister of Sherlock Holmes, is the main character in the last five
books in this study. She successfully manages to evade her older brothers through a series
of clever disguises. In the first novel, The Case of the Missing Marquess, Enola leaves
her childhood home after her mother’s disappearance before Mycroft can send her to
boarding school. Dressing as a widow, complete with a black veil covering her face,
Enola is able to travel to London to search for her mother undetected. Along the way,
Enola hears about the kidnapped marquess and decides to use her talent for finding things
to search for the boy. After the boy is safely delivered to Scotland Yard, Enola uses the
money her mother left to open an office for the fictitious Dr. Leslie T. Ragostin,
Scientific Perditorian. Wearing her new disguise as Dr. Ragostin’s secretary, Miss Ivy
Meshle, Enola is able to live independently and anonymously in 1888 London (Springer
2006).
In the second novel of the series, The Case of the Left-Handed Lady, Enola is
building a successful business as Dr. Ragostin’s secretary. She continues to submit
encrypted messages to her mother’s favorite newspapers, hoping to set up a meeting to
discuss her brothers. In the evenings, Enola dresses as a nun to distribute blankets and
food to the poor living in London’s East End. During the course of her investigation into
Lady Cecily’s disappearance, Enola disguises herself as a well-bred woman, Ivy Meshle,
97

a street woman selling goods from a basket, and a nun. She succeeds in finding the
missing lady and manages to avoid being captured by Sherlock (Springer 2007).
In The Case of the Peculiar Pink Fan, Enola once again comes to Lady Cecily’s
rescue. This time, Cecily is being hidden by her overbearing aunts until she agrees to
marry her cousin. While Enola is investigating the case, she surprisingly comes to
Sherlock’s aid. The two agree to a wary truce for the evening, but Enola is still fearful
that Sherlock will try to send her to boarding school against her will. Enola utilizes a
variety of disguises while searching for Cecily and trying to outmaneuver Sherlock. She
dresses as her usual Ivy Meshle persona, Dr. Ragostin’s proper wife, a midden-picker to
sneak around the wealthy side of London at night without drawing attention, a society
reporter to gain information about Cecily’s aunts, a beautiful lady, and a waif to sneak
into the orphanage where Cecily is being held before her wedding. After Enola succeeds
in freeing the young lady, she evades Mycroft and returns to her office (Springer 2008).
Enola continues to stay out of Sherlock’s grasp in The Case of the Cryptic
Crinoline. When Enola’s beloved landlady is kidnapped, her investigation leads to
Florence Nightingale’s house and a thirty-year-old message. As Enola attempts to locate
Mrs. Tupper before Sherlock can find her, Enola decides to flee her former lodgings and
relocates to the Professional Women’s Club where her brothers may not enter. Enola
dresses as Ivy Meshle and a female scholar as she deciphers the embroidered message
and pieces together the mystery surrounding her landlady. Once Mrs. Tupper is
recovered, Enola takes her to live at Miss Nightingale’s house and then quickly retreats to
98

the Professional Women’s Club where she is safely beyond the reach of her brothers
(Springer 2009).
The Case of the Gypsy Good-bye is the final novel in the Enola Holmes series.
Sherlock finally succeeds in locating his beautifully disguised sister with the help of the
family dog when she visits Mrs. Tupper at Florence Nightingale’s house. Enola agrees to
meet with him inside the house to decode a message from their mother and discuss the
case of an abducted duquessa. However, Sherlock is unable to stop her before she catches
a cab to a secondhand clothing store. Enola finds proof of the duquessa’s abductor and
heads back towards the stables when she impulsively picks up Sherlock, Dr. Watson, and
Mycroft. Since she is wearing the cab driver’s clothes, they are unaware of her identity as
she drives them to the duque’s home and eavesdrops of their conversation about her.
Enola changes into her lovely Miss Viola Everseau costume to tell Sherlock who
abducted the duquessa and invite him to help her find the missing woman with the
assistance of a bloodhound and the lady’s handkerchief. The beautiful disguise fools
Mycroft, to Sherlock and Enola’s amusement. The three siblings then work together to
rescue the duquessa and her brothers ask when they can see Enola again. Enola agrees to
have tea with her brothers for her birthday and dresses as herself. Mycroft and Sherlock
are impressed with her safe living arrangements and her successful missing persons
business. They promise not to send Enola to boarding school and she plans to attend
university and continue her career instead (Springer 2010).

Conclusion
After completing the content analysis of the twenty-seven middle school historical
fiction novels from the first decade of the Amelia Bloomer Project, this study investigated
the primary research question:
What is the relationship between Boreen’s three stages of historical authenticity
(1999) and Brown and St. Clair’s three levels of female empowerment (2002) in
the historical middle school novels selected in the first decade of the ALA Amelia
Bloomer Project list?
The following sub-questions were also examined:
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of the historically
accurate protagonist and Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited
scale (H1)?
What is the relationship between Boreen’s characterization of an historical role
model acting courageously within society’s bounds and Brown and St. Clair’s
female character that defies society for personal ambition (H2)?
What is the relationship between Boreen’s social renegade and Brown and St.
Clair’s role model that acts as a catalyst for change (H3)?
Boreen’s 1999 study of three successive levels of female role models in historical
fiction strongly correlated with Brown and St. Clair’s 2002 study describing three
100

progressive stages of female empowerment in historical fiction novels with a strength of
.863. This study reported Boreen’s most historically accurate protagonist (30.8%)
correlated most often with Brown and St. Clair’s heroine that is strong on a limited scale
(34.6%). Boreen’s historical role model acting courageously within society’s bounds
(56.8%) correlated most often with Brown and St. Clair’s female character that defies
society for personal ambition (55.9%). Boreen’s social renegade (12.4%) correlated most
often with Brown and St. Clair’s role model that acts as a catalyst for change (9.5%).
These two approaches organized their categories based on the character’s actions. As a
female protagonist advances from internal signs of strength, to conflicts with other
people, and eventually struggling against society, the character proceeds through the
authenticity and empowerment categories towards a future she creates for herself.
The secondary variables were also examined for correlations between historical
authenticity and female empowerment. The United States was the setting for the largest
percentage of books at 44.4%, however these twelve novels were only placed in the 19th
and 20th centuries, accounting for 52.2% or roughly half of all the books describing those
time periods. The two historical novels set in Italy and India showed the strongest
correlations of 1.000 between authenticity and empowerment levels. Novels set in the
14th century were stronger than the other historical eras with a .931 correlation. The novel
geographically set in Italy depicted the 14th century, so these two secondary variables
were closely related. Among the protagonists’ ages, 12-year-old heroines showed the
highest correlation of .917 distributed across five countries. Four of the seven 12-year-old
101

protagonists were located in the United States and two of the other geographic locations
included the novels set in Italy and India. The sources of conflict correlations gradually
increased following the escalation of the protagonists’ actions from internal conflict, to
interpersonal disputes, to eventually confronting society. These results mirrored the
progressive stages of Boreen’s (1999) historical role models and Brown and St. Clair’s
(2002) female empowerment levels.

102

CHAPTER V
IMPLICATIONS
When evaluating strong female characters in historical fiction, historical
authenticity and female empowerment are important considerations. According to
Donelson and Nilsen (2005), authenticity based on research is one of the primary criteria
when evaluating historical fiction. Vandergrift urged educators and parents to begin early
by sharing picture books containing strong female characters in non-traditional gender
portrayals with their young readers, in hopes of broadening society’s range of acceptable
expectations for women (1995).
Critically reading and analyzing historical fiction selections from the Amelia
Bloomer Project promotes the careful evaluation of feminist literature for children and
young adults, taking historical authenticity and female empowerment variables into
account. This study not only contributes to the literature of library science, education, and
women’s studies, but also furthers the work of ALA’s Feminist Task Force by advocating
the mission to address women’s issues in librarianship.
By examining historical fiction through a feminist lens, young readers learn to
question traditional gender roles portrayals and understand the slow, but changeable
progress of society (Hubler 2000). The selected historical fiction novels offer realistic
role models for modern readers (Boreen 1999).

103

This study involved a qualitative content analysis of twenty-seven middle school
historical fiction novels featured during the first decade of the Amelia Bloomer Project.
Reading through a feminist literary criticism lens, every incident of each protagonist’s
internal and external conflicts in regards to society’s expectations for females were
recorded. The individual conflicts were then assigned a historical authenticity level based
on Boreen’s historical female role model approach (1999) and an empowerment level
based on Brown and St. Clair’s stages of female empowerment in historical fiction novels
(2002). Qualitative citations described every conflict incident. These notes revealed
general trends in feminist characters’ actions in historical fiction novels to support the
statistical results.
The results presented in Chapter IV will be discussed in this section along with
the significance of this research and suggestions for future studies addressing the
evaluation of feminist characters in the historical fiction genre.
Interpreting Results
This content analysis demonstrated a significant, positive correlation between
Boreen’s three stages of historically authentic role models (1999) and Brown and St.
Clair’s three progressive levels of female empowerment in historical fiction (2002). Both
approaches’ categories coincide at each level. The strength of the overall correlation
between authenticity and empowerment variables was .863 for the combined coded
actions of the 671 conflicts cited in the twenty-seven historical fiction novels chosen for
104

this study. Historical authenticity and female empowerment were strongly related for
female protagonists featured in the historical novels selected during the first decade of the
Amelia Bloomer Project.
In addition, the research sub-questions were also correlated through the
percentages of each authenticity and empowerment level. Of all the protagonists’ actions,
30.8% were rated (A1) according to Boreen’s (1999) “real girls” who were internally
strong, but bound by their social position and time period. The first authenticity level
correlated most often with Brown and St. Clair’s (2002) disadvantaged girls that were
strong on a limited scale, but developed confidence in their abilities (E1) that received
34.6% of the empowerment variables. Conflicts involving historical role models who
acted courageously within societies boundaries for their time period (A2) represented the
highest frequency at 56.8%. The second authenticity level correlated most often with
protagonists that defied society’s conventions for personal ambition regardless of the
price (E2) at 55.9%. The third level of authenticity that featured social renegades who
acted ahead of their time to change the system (A3) occurred the least often among the
671 conflicts at 12.4%. The last authenticity level correlated most often with the final
stage of empowerment when characters became a catalyst for societal change or decided
to escape from their society (E3) at 9.5%.
Through careful reading and examination, several themes emerged. Courageous
females, regardless of their time or place in history, find ways to break free from
expected roles. Some girls leave society’s expectations behind or even disguise
105

themselves to gain more freedom. Others work within the bounds of their culture, but
realize their own power to control their lives. While some of the characters in the selected
books achieve success through developing confidence in their abilities, more defy
society’s conventions for personal ambition. A few of these inspirational females move
beyond defiance and attempt to change society’s expectations. Regardless of the
characters’ levels of empowerment, authentic females in nontraditional roles are present
in all twenty-seven historical fiction titles selected for this study of the Amelia Bloomer
Project.
Significance of this Study
Previous studies examined the authenticity of female characters in historical
fiction novels, especially focusing on the author’s research into society’s gender
expectations for the time period or personal qualifications for telling the story (Donelson
and Nilsen 2005; Margaronis 2008). Other researchers investigated feminist characters
based on their demonstrated levels of empowerment or agency in children’s and young
adult novels across different genres (Brown and St. Clair 2002; Vandergrift 1995). This
study sought to combine these two literary evaluation criteria in order to more fully
examine female role models in middle school historical fiction novels in regards to both
historical authenticity and female empowerment. By analyzing the female protagonists’
conflicts with themselves, other characters, and society in general against gender
expectations, the variables of authenticity and empowerment were compared to reveal a
more comprehensive critique of historical feminist characters.
106

The results of this content analysis were intended to benefit a wide audience. This
study attempts to add another layer for literary criticism to the fields of library science,
education, history, reading, and women’s studies when evaluating female characters in
historical fiction novels. The Feminist Task Force of the Social Responsibilities Round
Table was created in 1970 in response to ALA’s call to address sexism in the profession.
The Amelia Bloomer Project is one of several committees exploring feminist issues
related to libraries. This particular book award list focuses on recognizing significant
feminist content in children’s and young adult books. Research combining historical
authenticity and female empowerment criteria when evaluating female role models in
historical fiction books would not only benefit the selection process of this committee,
but could inform authors and publishers’ decision making processes. This study also
seeks to aid collection development for public and school librarians serving middle
school readers.
When searching for engaging historical fiction to support and enhance classroom
history texts, social studies educators should also consider both historical authenticity and
female empowerment to demonstrate the viewpoints and experiences often neglected in
traditional history canon. English teachers looking for inspirational feminist literature to
share with their students might examine the historical fiction genre to discuss the journey
towards female liberation from oppressive gender expectations. Historical female
characters displaying higher levels of authenticity and empowerment can engage students

107

in discussions about the progress of gender equality. An abridged article of this study’s
primary findings might assist educators with book selection.
Middle school readers seeking strong female characters willing to explore
nontraditional roles could reference the historical fiction reading list selected from the
larger Amelia Bloomer Project. Today’s children and young adults should be exposed to
past struggles and successes on the continuing path to gender equality. Understanding the
past, and how we have arrived at our present, better prepares girls and boys to create a
more just future.
Further Research
Since this study focused the sample size on middle school historical fiction
novels, additional research could examine the correlation between historical authenticity
and female empowerment variables in the beginning readers or young adult categories of
the Amelia Bloomer Project. This content analysis was limited to historical fiction novels
featured during the first ten years of this booklist. Perhaps future studies could examine
the correlation of historical authenticity and female empowerment in historical fiction
titles included in the second decade of the Amelia Bloomer Project to reflect evolving
trends in publishing.
This research investigated authenticity and empowerment levels included in
historical fiction; however the same variables could be applied to a study of historical
nonfiction texts, as well. Additional studies could examine the Amelia Bloomer Project
108

middle school nonfiction titles for demonstrated levels of historical authenticity and
female empowerment for the purpose of comparison with this historical fiction research.
While the Amelia Bloomer Project only selects books containing significant
feminist content, other historical fiction book award winners could be studied for the
inclusion of feminist characters. For example, researchers could evaluate a sample of the
winning books from the Scott O’Dell Award for Historical Fiction. To date, thirty-three
historical fiction novels for children and young adults have received this award. Further
research could examine female character’s levels of historical authenticity and
empowerment displayed in these award winning titles.
The researcher would like to continue investigating female role models in
historical fiction through a qualitative based literature discussion group modeled after a
previous study conducted by Patricia Dashiell involving modern high fantasy novels in
1995. As a middle school librarian, the researcher hosts book clubs twice a month during
a designated activity time. By creating a book club for girls to read novels with feminist
protagonists, the researcher plans to provide a forum for readers to discuss their reactions
to the characters’ actions and how they relate to their own choices. Through this study,
the researcher hopes to gain a better understanding of the influence of fictional role
models facing oppressive societies or obstacles on readers’ lives.

109

Conclusion
It is important to remember great literature inspires readers. Children return to
their favorite books because of a shared, personal connection with the characters. While
promoting high quality literature is a worthy goal for parents, educators, and librarians,
reader choice is crucial. In the case of children’s and young adult literature, the depiction
of brave girls struggling to make their own choices in life may be particularly
motivational for today’s readers. Violet ponders her future in the final scene of The Hope
Chest, “But now she knew what it was like to stand your ground. She knew what is was
like to keep on when things seemed hopeless. And she knew that with patience and hard
work, a radical, ridiculed idea - like women voting - could become as acceptable and
ordinary as oatmeal” (Schwabach 2008, 259).
