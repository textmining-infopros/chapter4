Abstract
This thesis examines the social and educational opportunities public libraries offer to
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and how the programs they offer can create
educational relationships between the library and their visitors. Along with that, the challenges of
conducting sensory-friendly programs will be identified.
In this study, twenty-eight public librarians from twenty-eight different libraries from
greater Philadelphia are and southern New Jersey were asked to take part in an in-person or
telephone interview. During these interviews, librarians were asked if they conducted sensoryfriendly programming for children with ASD, and why or why not. The data collected from the
librarians‟ responses during the interviews were analyzed to see if any trends stood out. The
analysis showed many public libraries want to conduct programming for children with autism,
but there are many challenges that prevent them from pursuing the idea including time, staff,
proper funds, and practical knowledge on the subject. Most of the librarians found these
programs to be important for the library to show they are inclusive places, and for the children to
grow socially and educationally.

This thesis would not have been possible without the constant help and guidance of my
graduate advisor, Helen Shannon, PhD. I also want to thank my committee members Patricia
Maunder and Paul Adorno for their assistance and presence through the process. Recognition is
additionally extended to Minda Borun and Rande Blank who provided essential ideas and advice
on who to select to be on my committee.
Thank you to the twenty-eight librarians who allowed me to interview them in order to
learn about their job, and what their library is doing when it comes to conducting programs for
children with autism. It was a great experience visiting most of the libraries to see who visits, the
programs they offer, and the size of the library in general. I would also like to extend a thank you
to Rebecca Smith at The Franklin Institute for allowing me to observe their Sensory-Friendly
Sunday program they host each month.
Finally, I would like to thank my family, girlfriend, and friends for their constant support

Nomenclature
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): This term represents the autism spectrum from low
functioning to high functioning under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-V. It follows the
DSM-IV diagnoses of children with specific autism type disorders including Autistic Disorder,
Asperger‟s Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Pervasive
Developmental Disorder.1
Educational Relationships: This term describes the library becoming a “safe” and fun place for
parents to bring their children with autism spectrum disorder to learn socially with strangers,
grow educationally through increased literacy, and to learn how to use the library as a source of
knowledge and information.
Sensory-Friendly Story Time: This library program engages participants through the use of story,
music and movement. Programs offer educational, literacy and social opportunities for children
of all ages with differing abilities, their siblings, parents/caregivers and their typicallydeveloping peers. Programs often include:
 a safe and non-judgmental environment
 a schedule board for following along
 flannel board stories
 interactive book-based experiences
 gentle music
2
 a half-hour of playtime and socialization for the entire family
Sensory-Friendly Movie Night: A special opportunity for individuals living with autism and
others to enjoy their favorite films in a safe and accepting environment. In order to provide a
more accepting and comfortable setting for individuals on the autism spectrum, the movie
auditorium lights are turned slightly up (dim lights will remain on) and the sound turned slightly
down. Because some have strict, special dietary needs, families are permitted to bring their own
gluten-free, casein-free snacks from home. Additionally, audience members are welcome to get
up and dance, walk, shout or sing.3
Universal Design: It is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed,
understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size,
ability or disability.4

Chapter 1:
Introduction
Many times, the direction of a thesis will shift until the niche is found. Autism is one of
those topics that can lead an individual in many unique directions. This thesis started with a
focus on programming conducted by museums, and what effect they have on children with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). From the beginning to now, the focus has shifted from the
effectiveness of these programs in museums to their effectiveness in public libraries and how
they can form educational relationships with their visitors through programming for children
with ASD.
Autism spectrum disorder is something that has personally affected my life for the better.
My uncle, who is only five years older than I am, has Asperger‟s Syndrome which has now been
removed from the lexicon and referred to as high-functioning on the autism spectrum. There has
always been a special connection between us, and there is never a silent moment when we are
together. Watching my uncle graduate from high school, obtain his culinary degree, and work
with him at an actual job has shown me his intelligence, passion, and determination. Even though
he has accomplished those milestones, he did not have a community or somewhere to go that
would allow him to feel comfortable and to learn besides school or his home. An internship at
the American Swedish Historical Museum provided me the backbone, but my uncle provided me
with the drive and reason to explore this topic further. Since he did not have the outside
community or activities to participate in when he was growing up, I wanted to see what
programs are starting to be formed for children on the autism spectrum in public libraries, which
can be the centers of many communities.

1

Formerly, autism spectrum disorder represented five unique developmental disorders:
Autistic Disorder, Asperger‟s Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder,
and Pervasive Developmental Disorder.5 However, autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is now
characterized by low-end to high-end or low functioning to high functioning forms of autism.
Since ASD manifests in so many different ways, it is difficult to ascribe blanket characteristics to
these children.6 Author Lesley J. Farmer believes, “If you know one child with autism, you know
one child with autism.”7 This is a popular quote amongst most individuals who work with
children who have ASD, along with individuals with other disabilities.8 There are some things
that children on the spectrum may struggle with such as social interaction, processing certain
information, learning how to speak, and dealing with loud noises or bright lights. Even with
these similarities, it is a disorder that cannot be easily approached through programming because
each individual child may require different services.
Public libraries can become an outlet for children with autism through specialized
programming. The primary reason why the switch was made in this thesis from a focus on
museums to public libraries was a summer internship at the American Swedish Historical
Museum in 2017.This internship provided an opportunity to enter libraries who are offering
programs and to interview them and see if they did have any types of sensory-friendly activities.
Since libraries are members of the same non-profit community as museums, it seemed
like it could be a smooth transition. Being able to focus on public libraries allows an insight into
how museums can possibly form partnerships and be more inviting to visitors who may not be
comfortable enough to enter museums compared to libraries. One group of individuals may be

parents who have a child with autism. As members of the non-profit sector, libraries and
museums should look towards the future, come together, and attempt to build stronger
connections between themselves and their surrounding communities. Forming partnerships in
communities could benefit museums because they can attempt to reach audiences that are
common library visitors because of the free nature of libraries, as opposed to museums where
typically visitors pay for admission tickets.
All of the data in this thesis was collected during a summer internship at the American
Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from June 2017 to August 2017. This
summer internship consisted of implementing an outreach program for elementary-aged children
at public libraries in the greater Philadelphia area and southern New Jersey. Either before or
after the program at each respective library, a specific librarian was asked if they would be
willing to complete a short interview to see if their library conducts programming for children
with autism, and if not, whether they think offering those types of programs could create
educational relationships for all visitors.

Research Problem
There was one primary issue that presented itself during this thesis research. By
definition, public libraries should reach out to all members of the community. However, are they
engaging those on the autism spectrum? Many libraries may not be thinking about approaching
the subject or taking the necessary steps to do so. Nevertheless, some may be considering
implementing programming, but do not have necessary funds, space, or training available.

3

Research Question
The combined paths of autism and public libraries led to the research question: “Can
public librarians expand and improve their educational relationships with visitors by developing
and implementing programs for children with ASD?” This research question will be explored
through a variety of sources including scholarly articles, books, observations, and primarily, oneon-one interviews with library staff persons. Educational relationships are defined as the public
library becoming a “safe space” or comfortable environment for children with autism to learn,
for other visitors to learn from children with autism and their families, but also for the library to
become a community space for parents.
The focus of this thesis attempts to look through the lens of public librarians to see if they
conduct programming for children with ASD, and if so whether this can in turn help them
improve educational relationships with visitors to the library. Approaching this subject from the
librarians‟ point of view is a unique one. Typically, when producing academic material related to
autism, research is gathered from the autism community and it studies how effective the
programming is from their point of view. Looking at this topic from a different perspective opens
the door to seeing what programming has been tried and succeeded, and whether creating
programming for children with autism is a possibility for other public libraries. Research has
shown that the largest reasons why public libraries do not offer sensory-friendly experiences are
funding, time, staff, practical knowledge, and their size, which coincides with what museums
struggle with when they are attempting to implement these types of activities. This is why the
research is helpful for museums and libraries because it introduces both to what can be done, and
the challenges they would have to overcome in order to bring in a more diverse audience.

4

Research Hypothesis
With any research question and thesis there is always a hypothesis that the researcher
attempts to study through data collection. The hypothesis for this research is: Whether public
libraries are creating and implementing programming for children with autism spectrum disorder
or not, librarians think conducting these programs will create educational relationships between
the library and their visitors.

Chapter 2:
Literature Review
Public libraries are focal points in communities across the country. They recognize there
is a need, and they want to express to their communities that they are comfortable educational
centers that can also be fun. One group of individuals that would benefit from increased access to
public libraries is children with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD. Libraries and museums are
members of the same community, and my experience obtaining a master‟s degree in museum
education and conducting programs in libraries inspired me to see how they compare. Museums
offer programs for children with ASD, however, they can be overwhelming places and are not
always affordable. Public libraries are typically free and offer calmer environments where
parents might feel comfortable bringing their children. Finding out if public libraries cater to
children with ASD became the focus of this research because this author noted libraries
recognized the need and have attempted to offer sensory-friendly activities for these children.
However according to the research gathered, many public libraries are nervous to do so because
of a lack of available resources, space, time, staff and/or practical knowledge they feel they need
to conduct successful programs.
This thesis approaches the problem from the perspective of libraries and the librarians
who work in them. Creating effective programs and activities within a comfortable environment
for children with autism spectrum disorder can create stronger bonds between the community
and library staff. Many individuals are attempting to create these unique outlets for children with
ASD, but it depends on the library‟s willingness or ability to spend the money and take the time
to create a suitable space.

Public Libraries
Public libraries in the United States have many functions. They serve researchers, avid
readers, the elderly, families, and many other community members. Most individuals are not
aware of the amount of programming public libraries conduct on a weekly basis. There are a
growing number of public libraries that are instituting successful educational programs, but
many still struggle with consistent attendance. This may be due to the fact that many individuals
do not think public libraries provide the same interactive learning and fun experiences compared
to museums, or other cultural institutions. Also, there may be a belief that an individual has to act
a certain way when they enter the door of a public library. It may be that potential visitors stay
away because they are concerned that their children may act up. Public libraries are for everyone,
and librarians do not want parents to feel embarrassed or anxious about bringing their children
with autism to the library.
The initial source to be utilized in addressing those questions is titled Public Libraries in
the United States: Data, Trends, and State Profiles, by Torrell Danielson. This book was
published in 2013, and focuses on public libraries during the 2010 fiscal year.9 Since it is based
on fiscal data, the book provides quantitative data on services, programs, workforce, and other
services provided by public libraries.10
According to research data of the United States, public libraries are a constant in our lives
because nearly every town has one, but many people do not utilize them as the important
resource they are. Public libraries are not only located within cities where there are larger
populations. Just as there are museums practically any place one goes, there is a public library
waiting to be visited. Danielson states, “In the fiscal year of 2010, there were 8,951 public

libraries in the 50 states and the District of Columbia with 17,078 public library branches and
bookmobiles. This total translates to approximately 3.0 public libraries and 5.8 outlets for every
100,000 people.”11 She continues, “In the fiscal year of 2010, there were 487 public libraries in
cities, 2,055 in suburban areas, 2,222 in towns, and 4,187 in rural areas.”12 Although there are a
larger number of public libraries in rural areas, the public libraries “in cities serve almost threequarters (72.5 percent) of the population.”13 This trend is relevant especially for inner cities
where parents are looking for potential educational outlets for their children. The libraries are
offering an abundance of unique programming in order to educate and entertain a variety of
children. In 2010 alone public libraries offered 3.75 million programs to the public, which
amounts to an average of at least one program a day for every library system in the country.14
The majority of these programs (61.5%) are designed for children because public libraries are
trying to be the ones who provide free programming.15
These selections of data from Danielson‟s book highlight some of the data that stretches
through the entire read. The data within this book was collected from all fifty states and the
District of Columbia in order to provide current national estimates and to examine trends from
prior years.16 This book provides a great balance point when it talks about programming and
accessibility in public libraries because it is based on quantitative survey data, which is an
excellent alternative to qualitative data on the subject. It is split into two chapters, with the first
speaking about public library systems throughout the entire nation, and then the second chapter
highlights individual state profiles and how public libraries are affecting their communities. The

most important aspect of this book is showing how crucial and prevalent public libraries are in
communities whether it is realized by the public, or not.
The data presented above approached the subject of how beneficial library programming
is for children. Most of those experiences are performed within cities or suburbs, which are
where larger subgroups of children live, especially compared to rural areas. Let us explore how
public libraries are actually affecting large “Resilient” cities, which is a descriptive term used by
Michael Dudley in his book, Public Libraries and Resilient Cities, through qualitative data
compared to the quantitative data used by Danielson.17 Many cities in the United States are
considered resilient because they are trying to address problems such as economic issues,
businesses leaving or shutting down, and the increasing number of low-income citizens. At the
heart of this study, Philadelphia is viewed by this author as a resilient city who is trying to
increase access and make strides culturally and economically.
Dudley‟s book is another important resource. It was published in 2013, and each chapter
is written by a different author who has knowledge on a particular aspect of libraries.18 The
topics include accessibility for everyone, outreach and community development, and making
libraries a place for the people.19 The purpose of the book is identified early with a quote by an
American writer Jay Walljasper, “Libraries stand as a prime example of social capital, which
more and more observers see as the secret sauce that makes the difference between a community
that thrives and one that struggles.”20 This is an interesting quote that identifies the integral role
public libraries can play in the advancement of the cities where they reside. As the book
continues, it starts to align with the research question for this thesis. Dudley highlights, “In a

2009 paper, geographers Ruth Fincher and Kurt Iveson found that public libraries are a form of
urban infrastructure that does not merely embrace diversity, but helps to distinguish different
kinds of diversity.”21
Dudley states, “Resiliency pertains to a system‟s inherent organic quality, allowing it,
like a successful species or an enduring habitat in the natural world, to continue to maintain its
primary functions even as its circumstances change.”22 Cities are changing every single day and
public libraries are constantly fighting to stay relevant in the eyes of their visitors and potential
visitors. Public libraries, if used, are an outlet for the entire city. Most are free compared to
museums, and they are welcoming places for everyone, from homeless people to the wealthy.
Public libraries are a place of learning, relaxation, and a place to have fun based on the activities
offered within them. Dudley explains, “The public library stands as a public institution, indeed
one of the remaining public institutions that may be credibly seen as a force for reason, insight,
wisdom, and inspiration.”23 Dudley also adds that with the ability to inspire, public libraries have
the ability to forge new communities amongst people, and are an extension of schooling that
many children enjoy more because they are not just sitting around being spoken to.24
Even with this ability to inspire future generations, and the number of individuals who
visit every day, libraries are in the midst of a great struggle. This struggle solely comes down to
the financial burden which states and this nation as a whole have endured. Dudley makes it clear
that libraries are closing, having hours shortened, funds slashed, staff reduced, programs
eliminated, and collections purged because of the financial issues in the country and states.25
However, even with this struggle of low funding, public libraries are doing everything they can

to provide an inclusive environment for all visitors, not only attempting to provide an inclusive
environment, but showing the library is a free and fun place to learn. Children with autism are
included in those groups of diverse visitors that are brought to public libraries as part of a fuller
community in order to learn.
Dudley‟s book differs from Danielson‟s because it is more focused on qualitative data. It
is extremely important to have a balance between the two types of data in order to construct an
effective argument. Since each chapter is written by a different author, it provides a chance to
gain insight into the inner workings of public libraries through multiple lenses.
In order to have a well-rounded argument, there needs to be alternative arguments to
provide a complete context involving the topic. An article within Evidence Based Library &
Information Practice written by Ann Glusker titled, “Urban Public Libraries Do Not Meet
Benchmarks for Web Accessibility by Individuals with Disabilities” provides such an opposite
view. The study focused on the 127 library systems within the Urban Libraries Council; all of the
libraries are located in the United States.26 To test the libraries‟ online accessibility Glusker used
an accessibility evaluation tool.27 It found that no website was free from errors that might affect
people with disabilities.28 The errors included contrast errors, missing alternative text, missing
form labels, and missing specific links or resources for persons with disabilities.29 This article
provides insight on the challenges libraries can have especially when it comes to accessibility
through technology for children with autism.
Every public library upholds its promise to its community of being open to any visitor.
The educational capabilities at each library may be different because of funding and staffing, but

the message and mission remain the same. Although many libraries are struggling with funding,
staff, and other organizational issues, they want to be a constant source of knowledge and
informal education within the communities they serve.

Autism Spectrum Disorder
The second topic to be highlighted in this thesis is how to create effective programming
for children who have ASD. Now that the reader has a better understanding of public libraries, it
is time to speak about the audience that will be the focus of this thesis.
Just as with any other cultural institution, there are some people who may feel anxious
about entering them. Many kinds of individuals may feel nervous about entering public libraries,
and parents with children who have autism are amongst them. A variety of factors contribute to
these feelings that range from judgments passed on them by others because of their child, or not
having a community that can relate to them and help them with their child.
The immediate focus of this section is to explain what autism spectrum disorder is, and
give some characteristics of a child who may have ASD. Social-interaction difficulties,
communication challenges and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviors are the most
common characteristics amongst children who have autism spectrum disorder.30 However, each
symptom and their severity vary widely across these three core areas.31 Symptoms that may be
mild challenges for someone on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum can be more
severe for others.32 These symptoms can also lead into other types of medical conditions and
challenges including Sleep Disorders, Mood Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, OCD, ADHD, and

even Seizures.33 All of these unique characteristics, symptoms, and accompanying conditions
and challenges have to be taken into account when libraries make the decision to offer sensoryfriendly activities in the library.
The book, Library Services for Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders, published in 2014
and written by Lesley S. J. Farmer, begins to highlight what types of activities libraries have
attempted to implement for children with ASD.34 The information Farmer‟s book provides on
ASD has everything a library would need to create high-quality experiences, along with
additional information on public libraries that are currently running successful programs. Farmer
starts by looking at how children with ASD interact in learning environments, whether they are
schools or libraries.35 Then she highlights team management approaches to conducting sensoryfriendly programming as it follows with universal design.36 Next, Farmer begins to discuss
successful methods of teaching children with ASD, and highlights some methods including
maintaining a focus on reading.37 One of the primary ways public libraries maintain a focus on
reading for children with ASD is by conducting literacy programs.38
However, there are always challenges when it comes to creating programs for children
with ASD. An article written by Lynn Akin and Donna MacKinney titled Autism, Literacy, and
Libraries highlights what needs to be understood about ASD. The article focuses on three R‟s,
which are Routine, Repetition, and Redundancy.39 Akin and MacKinney focus on various types
of programming, how they work, and how to properly implement them.40 They do this by

identifying successful program structures which include reading aloud, related readings, directive
scaffolding, social stories, technology, peer tutoring, and music therapy.41 The positive aspect of
Akin and MacKinney‟s research is the listing of programs, while supplying important details on
how to conduct them. One significant topic this article highlights is autism identification. Akin
and MacKinney explain autism is a spectrum, and all children on the spectrum are different in
speech abilities, developmental stages, and interests, which mean children on the spectrum,
cannot be placed under a strict set of characteristics.42
The next book in this section entitled “Planning for Accessibility” was published in 1991
and written by Marianne Kotch Cassell. Cassell focuses on laws passed for individuals with
disabilities, including The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.43 The Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 was the nation‟s first comprehensive civil rights law addressing the
needs of people with disabilities by prohibiting discrimination in employment, public services,
public accommodations, and telecommunications.44 It is important to include The Americans
with Disabilities Act because it has shaped how businesses needed to become more accessible in
order to accommodate a diverse audience, visitor, or customer.
Public accommodations stand out in the definition of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) of 1990. This occurs because when originally written it is not clear what exactly public
accommodations were. According to the Association of Specialized and Cooperative Library
Agencies (ASCLA), there are eight different ways in which public accommodations for

individuals with disabilities of any kind, apply to public libraries.45 Before highlighting each one,
these may be specific to libraries, but they coincide with what museums have to accommodate as
well.
The ASCLA narrow the accommodations into their own subsections: Library Services,
Facilities, Collections, Assistive Technology, Employment, Library Education that includes
Training and Professional Development, American Library Association Conferences, and finally
American Kinesiology Association Publications and Communications.46 These sub-sections
highlight how individuals with disabilities should have equal accessibility to the library and its
materials with assistive technology or individuals to aid them while visiting the library, but also
fair and equal employment opportunities, training opportunities for library staff to sensitize them
to issues affecting people with disabilities, and allowing individuals with disabilities to partake in
special events including American Library Association (ALA) conferences.47

What are Museums Doing?
One institution public libraries can look at for inspiration when it comes to implementing
programs for children with ASD are museums. Museums have been integral in the creation and
implementation of programs for youths with disabilities. As members of the non-profit sector,
museums and public libraries can come together to build stronger connections between
themselves, and their surrounding communities.
An important book for this section is by Katie Stringer entitled Programming for People
with Special Needs: A Guide for Museums and Historic Sites. This book covers education and

inclusion for individuals with intellectual and learning disabilities. Stringer highlights museums
that have conducted successful programs for youths with intellectual disabilities. These programs
include “Meet Me” from the Museum of Modern Art, (MoMA), and programs at the Transit
Museum in Brooklyn for children with ASD.48 Stringer makes it clear, “The purpose of this
manual is to assist museums and historic sites in the process of creating inclusive sites of
education and well-being for all visitors, especially those with disabilities or special needs.”49
Stringer attempts to achieve this goal in each chapter. The first two chapters highlight the history
of museums and a brief history of disabilities in the United States, along with laws and advocacy
related to accessibility.50 The third chapter focuses on how universal design can be utilized to
create and implement sensory-friendly programming for certain exhibits.51 Universal Design is a
way of interacting with all types of visitors whether they are blind, have a physical or mental
disability, or anything else that may affect their ability to effectively interact with the
information displayed. Finally, chapter five includes a case study on best practices for creating
museum programs for all visitors, especially those with special needs.52 Stringer allows readers
to gain an academic insight into the museum field by highlighting their attempts to being
inclusive for people with disabilities.
The other primary source in this section is from a museum in Philadelphia that offers
programs for children with ASD. The museum that was observed is the Franklin Institute. The
program was “Sensory-Friendly Sunday” where parents register their children for their own time
in the galleries. The Franklin Institute has taken many steps in creating a comfortable

environment for participants in the program. The first thing they do is turn off any multi-colored
flashing lights, loud sudden noises, and cover certain computer interactives. In each gallery space
there are volunteers from occupational therapy programs in Philadelphia. They interact with the
participants, creating a dynamic learning environment. The Franklin Institute effectively
structured Sensory-Friendly Sunday, which created a comfortable learning environment for the
children and their parents. By implementing successful programs of this magnitude, parents may
tell their friends and family about their positive experiences at The Franklin Institute, which can
improve educational relationships between the museum and their visitors.
It is important to take advantage of the programs that are offered in Philadelphia, and to
find out the benefits the staff has seen from conducting these programs. This was a valuable
research observation while attending Sensory-Friendly Sunday at the Franklin Institute because it
highlighted a successful program within a child-centered museum, and how some of those
aspects of learning can be carried into public libraries.

Are programs conducted for children with autism creating educational relationships
between the library, children, and visitors?
Finally, this research will look at programs that libraries are currently implementing,
some of the more effective types, and whether they are creating educational relationships. The
first source used in this section is by Betsy Diamant-Cohen entitled Children’s Services:
Partnerships for Success. Cohen brings together eighteen different examples of successful
outreach partnerships that can be adapted for the public library sector. The examples range from
the United States and Canada, and they primarily focus on youth from elementary to middle

17

school.53 The sole purpose of this book is to highlight successful program partnerships between
libraries and their surrounding communities.54 By interacting with their communities in new and
exciting ways, a solid foundational relationship between libraries and their communities may be
created.55
The primary chapter that is pertinent to this read is Chapter Four, “Children‟s and Play
Museums and Public Libraries.”56 This book is unique because there are multiple case studies in
each chapter, and they are all written in first-person. The topics covered in Chapter Four look at
collaborations between multiple institutions, and early literacy programs which are popular
programs that public libraries attempt to conduct.57 The outline for the literacy program is as
follows, “the workshop was based on a simple and easy-to-use book for community educators
offering resources, ideas, and helpful hints about ways to use low-cost and recycled items to
develop and present effective literacy programs and related activities based on broad themes”.58
Cohen‟s primary focus is how public libraries attempt to create relationships with their
community members, whether they are educational or social. Cohen‟s book also supports the
thesis research in that public libraries strive to form relationships with visitors to create a
comfortable place to learn and have fun.
A wide variety of articles that include studies or websites of public library programs for
children with ASD are highlighted in this section of the literature review. They include “A
Special Needs Approach” by Denice Adkins, Associate Professor from the School of Science &

challenges.

Chapter 3:
Methodology
The primary research for this thesis came from a summer internship at the American
Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during which twenty-five out of the
twenty-eight interviews were collected. The internship consisted of creating and implementing
an educational program in public libraries for elementary and middle school-aged children in the
greater Philadelphia area and southern New Jersey. The topics discussed in the program were
renewable resources, and how people can use them to create a clean environment and how they
can be used when it comes to sustainable architecture. The children were able to have a
discussion on the topics where they answered questions; they could also draw pictures, and build
their own environmentally conscious homes or structures. As previously stated, this provided an
opportunity to visit libraries and conduct interviews, but an important aspect to know is that this
program was not geared for children on the autism spectrum. If children on the spectrum came
they were welcome to join, but this program was not designed as a sensory-friendly experience.
During these visits, a single children‟s librarian was asked to participate in a short
interview. The interviews were constructed to find out if public libraries currently have or plan to
create programming for children with ASD, and why or why not. Also, it asked them whether the
programs they created or want to create can form educational relationships between the libraries
and their visitors. If they have not or do not plan to run programs for children with ASD, they
were asked what they think are the potential positives and difficulties of attempting to create and
implement programming for these children. It is important to remember most of these libraries
were pre-selected because they had chosen to participate in a children‟s outreach program from

20

the American Swedish Historical Museum. This program was designed for all children, not just
those with ASD. As a result, the librarians may have been more pro-active than typical.

The idea was to interview employees from libraries no matter if they conduct sensoryfriendly programs or not, and the interview template had to reflect that mission. In order to
effectively gather significant responses, the interview had three parts (See Appendix 1). The first
question asked is, who the primary visitors to the library are. These answers were slightly
skewed because many of the interviews were performed with the children‟s librarian, which
typically facilitate programs for parents and their children. The second question of the first
section asked if the libraries do conduct programs for children with autism. If they responded
yes, they would have an additional seven questions to answer, and if they responded no, then the
participant would have six additional questions to answer.

Expectations of Findings
The expectation of findings for this thesis is that most public libraries are not conducting
programming for children with autism; nevertheless the librarians believe educational
relationships can be made through these sensory-friendly experiences.

Limitations to the Research
As previously stated the public libraries where the interviews were gathered were
primarily from the greater Philadelphia area. However, there are some outliers including
Lancaster County, Burlington County (NJ), Ocean County (NJ), Somerset County (NJ), and
Atlantic County (NJ). Overall, this thesis and the research it is based on focuses on a small
pocket of two Mid-Atlantic States, and primarily Philadelphia. With the focus being centered on
22

this area, a limitation is presented in the research. This data collected is not a representative
sample of the United States as whole because the numbers could come out differently, and
maybe more public libraries country-wide conduct sensory-friendly programs for children with
autism than are implemented in this area. Along with the sample size not representing the entire
United States, the sample size is also relatively small with only twenty-eight librarians each
representing their own institution. Compared to the large number of public libraries just in the
United States, twenty-eight do not provide an entire picture, but a small look into the field. The
final limitation to the research is that most of the libraries selected for interviews took part in the
American Swedish Historical Museum‟s summer outreach program. These libraries have taken
necessary steps when it comes to offering programs for a variety of individuals.

23

Chapter 4:
Data Analysis
Before analyzing the data, it would be helpful to revisit the research question and
hypothesis. The research question is: “Can public librarians expand and improve their
educational relationships with visitors by developing and implementing programs for children
with ASD?” To clarify, educational relationships are defined as the public library becoming a
“safe space” or comfortable environment to learn for children with autism, but also for other
visitors to learn from children with autism and their families. The research hypothesis is:
Whether public libraries are creating and implementing programming for children with autism
spectrum disorder or not, librarians think conducting these programs will create educational
relationships between the library and their visitors. Creating educational relationships between
the library and their visitors explores if the library conducting programs for children with ASD
provides a platform for visitors to learn from strangers who are similar or different.
As seen in Figure 1 below, out of the twenty-eight libraries represented in the research,
sixteen (57.14%) stated they do not conduct programming for children with autism, and twelve
(42.86%) do (See Appendix 3, Question 2). The percentages show sensory-friendly programs have
started to become prominent in public libraries, and the research highlighted that it is a noticed
need, which coincides with public libraries‟ missions to be inclusive institutions.

The two counties most represented in the data were Delaware County (five libraries) and
Montgomery County (nine libraries). Through the course of interviews, three librarians cited
their county library system as the starting block to creating programs for children on the
spectrum. One of these librarians specifically indicated that Montgomery County introduced
sensory-friendly activities to them. However, out of the nine libraries that were interviewed from
Montgomery County, only three conduct sensory-friendly programs.
Then, out of the five librarians interviewed from Delaware County not one offers
educational experiences for children with ASD. Even though these are two prominent counties in
the suburbs of Philadelphia, there are few opportunities for children with autism to participate in
sensory-friendly programs at their local libraries. This researcher believes that may have
occurred because the libraries may not have enough funding, staff, practical knowledge, or time
in order to conduct programs for these children, but this situation can also highlight that some
educational decisions are made on the county, not library, level.
The rest of the counties only had one to two libraries represented in the research. For
example, Chester County had two libraries represented in the research, Coatesville and
Tredyffrin, and they both conduct programming for children with autism. Bucks County also had
two representatives with Warminster being the library that does offer specialty educational
25

programs. Lancaster County, Pennsylvania mirrored Chester County with two libraries that
conduct programs for children on the spectrum as well.
Another county that had two libraries implement programming for children on the
spectrum is Burlington County, New Jersey. Both libraries from this county offer ASD
programs, and the county has even gone so far as to create a full calendar outlining all of the
sensory-friendly activities they will have over a course of a couple months. This was extremely
impressive to see a county system so dedicated to offering programming for visitors not on the
spectrum, but also for parents and their children who are on the spectrum.

Socio-Economic Status & Median Household Income
There are many challenges that affect a library‟s ability to offer special experiences for
children with autism. One way these challenges can be seen is by looking through the lens of
socioeconomic status (SES), Median Household Income, and a library‟s budget.

The socioeconomic status (SES) of a community is a major variable that can affect how
the community decides to allocate its financial resources. For instance, a community‟s SES may
impact how its libraries choose to spend their funds when it comes to events or programming.
SES can be measured by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, income, education, and
unemployment rate.64 For the purposes of the current research, the SES of a library will be
defined as the median household income for the zip code in which the library is located, and that
can be seen in Table 1 above. It is important to note that the zip code does not embody the
entirety of a library‟s visitors, but it does provide a general idea of the community‟s financial
state.
Among the 28 libraries sampled, the lowest median household incomes were within the
$40,000 to $50,000 range, while the highest were within the $111,000 and higher range (See
Appendix 2). According to the most recent census information, the median household income

within the United States is $59,039.65 Thus, when comparing the current sample to this statistic,
the majority of libraries (75%) had household incomes above the national median.
Although one might predict that libraries from communities with higher incomes would
have a wider range of programming (i.e., programs for children with disabilities, such as ASD)
due to greater financial flexibility, this was not necessarily the case among the libraries sampled.
The income range with the highest percentage of libraries conducting ASD programming was the
$61,000 to $70,000 range (86%) followed by the $111,000 and higher range (67%). These two
percentages in isolation may suggest that ASD programming is more common among libraries
from zip codes with middle-class or wealthy household incomes. However, the rest of the data

27

indicates that this may not be true. For instance, the third highest percentage of libraries
conducting ASD programming has the lowest median income range, $40,000 to 50,000.
Therefore, it is likely that other factors besides SES alone affect a library‟s ability or decision to
have programs for children with disabilities such as ASD.

Library Budgets and Their Effects on Programming
As seen previously in the data analysis section, the libraries that do conduct sensoryfriendly programs for children with ASD not only have the funding to do so, but also have the
staff, time and practical knowledge needed in order to create these educational experiences. The
libraries that do not offer sensory-friendly activities, in contrast, often struggle in the areas of
funding, staff, and practical knowledge. With that being said, the SES of a community and the
amount of funding a library has are important in determining whether libraries are able to
broaden their activities and offer a wider variety of experiences for visitors, such as ASD or
sensory-friendly programs.

*Representing the library system some libraries that were interviewed belong to and no
asterisk signifies individual libraries, and libraries in bold had a budget deficit.66

As can be seen in Table 2 above there are ten libraries, or systems that are operating on
deficits, according to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). Half of these are
currently conducting programs for children with ASD. This could be so because the offerings
fulfill the library‟s mission of being inclusive. Through the interview process of the librarians,
only two, Warminster Public Library and Coatesville Public Library, made it known that they
either received county aid or a grant to conduct ASD programs. This is surprising to see that
only two out of the five libraries functioning on a deficit decided to apply for extra aid so they
could fulfill their mission, and educate individuals with ASD.
Two of the other five libraries open to the public while working under a deficit stated that
they attempted to conduct programs, but were unsuccessful because of a lack of attendance, lack
of confidence, or a lack of practical knowledge. Out of the five libraries that operate on a deficit
and do not conduct sensory-friendly programs, only one highlighted their budget as the reason
why they do not offer those specific types of experiences. Overall, one librarian emphasized

Entities Data),” Institute of Museum and Library Services, accessed November 28, 2017.

29

budget concerns as a reason why programs were not being offered, compared to having
confidence and overall practical knowledge.
It would make sense if libraries operating on positive budgets stated their primary reasons
for not conducting sensory-friendly programs was a lack of confidence and practical knowledge.
However, this was not the case. During the interview process of librarians, five stated they
require adequate staff and funding to offer experiences for children with ASD. According to the
interview data acquired, libraries who are operating on positive budgets are acknowledging
funding and staff as challenges for them in offering services, but only one library that is working
on a deficit highlights funding as a challenge.
Warminster and Coatesville, referred to previously, are part of the sub-group above
which highlights their communities as being middle-class ($61,000- $70,000) in terms of median
household income. Even though they are operating on a deficit, they are members of certain
communities that may be pushing for inclusive programming and are willing to help with
funding needs. This is also present in the median household sub-group of $111,000 and higher.
There are two libraries that offer sensory-friendly experiences, however one of those libraries,
William Jeanes Public Library is currently operating under a deficit. Those were the sub-groups
that had the highest percentages when it came to conducting programs for children with autism
according to their median household range. Within the $40,000- $50,000 and $81,000- $90,000
median household income sub-groups, they each have one library that conducts ASD based
programs. The other similarity between these two is both the libraries currently operate under a
deficit.
These connections being made between the libraries, the median household income, and
their budgets show that money does not always control what a library decides to do. Even if they

30

are functioning under a deficit, libraries are willing to follow their mission and provide as many
visitors as they can with an enriching educational experience. When it comes to providing
services or experiences for children with ASD, libraries are more concerned with having
confidence and practical knowledge on the subject of autism and the activities that are associated
with the spectrum disorder, compared to worrying about funds available at the time. These data
also highlight that even if a library is located in low-income or wealthy communities, they can
struggle with having positive budgets and keeping themselves from operating on a deficit.

Data from One on One Interviews
One constant theme from visiting these libraries was their sizes. Some were large and
could serve broader communities, and others were small and limited in what they could offer in
terms of educational activities for their visitors. During the course of the interviews, librarians
highlighted that they were unable to offer sensory-friendly programs because they lacked funds,
practical knowledge, staff, or time. Some had attempted to implement programs, but they failed
mainly from a lack of consistent attendance.
As a place of community and acceptance, public libraries are beginning to make strides in
recognizing the present needs of children with ASD, and turning the library into a comfortable
place for parents and their children to come, have fun, and learn. The goal of every library is to
be inclusive and inviting to everyone. From reviewing the data, only a certain percentage of
public libraries are placing programming for children with autism near the top of their list, and
that can be attributed by the challenges presented when having to implement those types of
specialty activities.

31

As previously stated, twelve of the librarians indicated that they do in fact conduct
programming for children with autism. Each library had goals they wanted to achieve during the
specific educational experiences. In the data, represented by Figure 2 below, 66.67% or eight out
of the twelve librarians stated they want children on the spectrum to have an “Introduction to the
Library” and realize the library is a safe and comfortable place to visit (See Appendix 3, Question
2a).

Introduction to Library

Developing Literacy

By creating a comfortable space, children with autism can have a typical library
experience with their parents or caretakers. Typical library experiences include using the library
to find a book, participating in activities, and interacting with strangers. A library, similar to a
museum, can create impactful sensory-friendly programs, but if their visitors do not feel
comfortable visiting the institution, libraries will have a difficult time bringing in that sub-group
of parents and children. Typically, when it comes to programming for children on the spectrum,
some libraries have built a relationship with the autism community and have proven it can be a
safe and comfortable environment for their children to learn, play, and interact. According to

32

some of the interviews, those relationships were built through schools the children attended, and
partnering with unique organizations dedicated to aiding individuals with autism.
For the children, this comfortable environment allows them to learn educationally and
socially. Increasing their literacy is a goal for many librarians conducting sensory-friendly
programming. One librarian stated three unique goals, “increase literacy, provide an educational
space, and make parents feel welcomed.” Figure 2 also highlights, four or 33.33% of the
librarians indicated “Developing Literacy” was the primary goal of their program (See Appendix
3, Question 2a). Many children on the spectrum have a difficult time learning how to speak and

write. By having programs like Sensory-Friendly Story Time, these children can strengthen their
abilities to use all of their senses to improve their literacy. If public libraries are able to
accomplish this while school is out for the summer, it will only help the children when they go
back or enter school because they have already started learning some steps in how to write and
speak.
Another struggle many children on the spectrum have is the ability to interact socially
with strangers. Programs like Sensory-Friendly Story Time and Sensory-Friendly Movie Nights,
allow children on the spectrum to communicate with others who are similar to them. This is
important because once they feel comfortable interacting with individuals similar to them, they
may feel comfortable enough to socialize with a variety of strangers. Social interaction is a
significant goal librarians set when they create sensory-friendly programs. The largest impact
these programs can have is providing these children with the confidence and ability to speak in
general, but also communicate with their peers in a productive and positive manner. By
introducing the children and their parents to the library, it allows the children to grow in

33

educational and social ways that may have not been accomplished by just only attending school
or staying home.
These programs benefit the parents just as much as the children. Many parents who have
children with autism struggle with finding places where they can bring their child and finding a
community of parents who have children on the spectrum that can be a support system. A public
library can become that central location where parents have a place, besides their home, where
they feel comfortable bringing their children with autism.

Four or 33.33% of the librarians who responded “Yes” to conducting programing cited
one of the largest benefits the library has gained is the “Comfortable Environment” they have
created for the families (See Appendix 3, Question 6a). In many ways, parents feel embarrassed,
but it is not because their child has autism. It is embarrassment of how others might view them
and their child, especially if their child starts acting up. To avoid any of that embarrassment,
parents will keep their children at home.

34

Nowadays, public libraries are becoming community centers where diverse groups of
individuals walk through their doors every day for a variety of reasons. Their point of existence
is to serve the entire community, not just a segment of it. By the library developing a relationship
with parents through programming, they are able to convince parents that the library is an allinclusive space where anyone can come, learn, and have fun. This push to make the library an
all-inclusive environment was also highlighted in the data for librarians who did conduct
sensory-friendly programs. When asked what they see as benefits to implementing programming
for children with autism, five out of twelve or 41.67% highlighted being an inclusive
environment as the primary benefit (See Appendix 3, Question 6a). No matter if a library does or
does not conduct a certain type of programming, their end goal is to be an inclusive, learning
environment. Not only are the children gaining confidence in themselves to socially interact
with others, but also their parents gain confidence in bringing their children out into the public
and not caring how others feel about their child.
Nevertheless, there are challenges that present themselves to public libraries who
attempt to provide sensory-friendly experiences. The comparison has been made between public
libraries and museums because they operate in similar ways. Most public libraries and museums
are members of the non-profit sector. Based on their size they may struggle with many issues
that coincide with one another. Those common issues are lack of visitation or attendance,
funding, staffing, and time. These are all important variables in any job, but more so for
members of the non-profit sector. Visitation or attendance, funding, staffing, and time need to be
aligned almost perfectly in order for a museum or public library to create and implement
impactful programs for the general public.

35

Just as there are small and large museums, there are small and large public libraries.
Typically, the larger the institution means the larger the population entering its doors on a daily
basis. For many libraries, there are an abundance of reasons why they do not conduct
programming for children with ASD (See Figure 4).

Lack of attendance was highlighted as a reason why public libraries do not offer specialty
educational experiences. As mentioned previously, sixteen librarians answered “No” when asked
if they conduct programs for children on the spectrum. When asked why they do not conduct
programs, two librarians (12.50%) cited “Low Attendance” as a reason why they scrapped their
offerings. Six librarians (37.50%) cited “Multiple Reasons” why they do not conduct sensoryfriendly programs, and a common answer that appeared was lack of attendance (See Appendix 3,
Question 1b). This data shows even though more public libraries in the survey do not conduct

programming for children with autism, many have attempted to implement it. A lack of
consistent attendance made the program less desirable to continue providing.

36

Low attendance is a huge struggle many small public libraries deal with, but there are
other variables that prevent libraries from conducting sensory-friendly programs, and one of
those is funding. Most times when public libraries want to offer unique activities or events, they
attempt to receive a grant from a multitude of organizations. Those grants provide necessary
funds to buy materials and pay staff. Along with grants, county aid may be sought, which is
money the county will allocate to libraries that need it the most. Without necessary funding,
many libraries are unable to conduct programs for children with autism because they cannot
afford the correct materials.
Lack of funds also shines a light on staffing. Larger museums and libraries that have solid
endowments or revenue coming in are able to conduct programming and support more
employees. The more employees an institution has allows a higher quantity of programming the
library can create and conduct. Many libraries have one staff person per department, so that
individual can only do so much. Two of the sixteen librarians (12.50%) cited that a “Limited
Staff” kept them from conducting programming for children with autism. Staffing also appeared
in answers with “Multiple Reasons” as to why those specific libraries did not offer sensoryfriendly experiences. Not only is it difficult to have a staff of one creating all of the programs, it
is more difficult when that individual does not have the proper practical knowledge on ASD.
Three of the sixteen librarians (18.75%) listed a “Lack of Knowledge “on the subject as the
primary reason why they do not conduct sensory-friendly programs (See Appendix 3, Question 1b).
As Figure 4 highlighted the reasons why libraries do not create programming for children
with autism, Figure 5 is focused on the challenges libraries can face when doing so.

Proper TrainingUnknown Need

Two librarians (12.50%) cited “Proper Training” as the primary challenge to creating
these types of programs, and ten (62.50%) listed “Multiple Reasons” why it would be
challenging. One of the primary reasons was a lack of practical knowledge on the subject. The
need for practical knowledge can be identified through one librarian‟s quote which states
libraries, “have to be prepared because each person with autism is different.” An institution can
have a small staff or large staff, but the most important tool they need is practical knowledge on
how to perform the programs and work with children who are on the spectrum. Three of the
librarians, or 18.75%, cited “Child Differences” as a negative or challenge to conducting
programming for children with autism (See Appendix 3, Question 4b). “Child Differences” refers
to the librarians highlighting that every child with autism is different, and that needs to be known
and recognized before any program could be implemented.
With any program there is a certain amount of time that goes into its creation. Depending
on the size and number of activities involved, there may be a larger or smaller amount of time
that was solely dedicated to the creation of the event or program. One person does not have
enough time to take the necessary steps towards creating a new type of program, especially if
they do not have the necessary practical knowledge. Every small detail needs to be thought out

38

because every child on the spectrum is unique, just like every other person. There are common
traits amongst children with autism that cause higher stimulation, including loud noises or bright
lights. However, there are a number of other things that can cause stimulation and knowing to
handle the situation, but also being able to provide a sensory-friendly environment is a difficult
task to take on especially if the librarians are working mostly by themselves.
Even with these challenges as the reasons why certain libraries cannot conduct
programming for children with autism, most librarians that answered that they do not offer them
would eventually want to.

Figure 6 shows fifteen out of sixteen librarians (93.75%) answered “Yes” to a question
on whether or not they would create programming for children with autism if they could (See
Appendix 3, Question 3b). The response rate shows that even if a library cannot do it because of a

lack of attendance from previous attempts, lack of funding, lack of staff, or a shortage of time,
they would still create and implement sensory-friendly programs because they believe the library
is a place that should be enjoyed by everyone. As one librarian stated to conducting
programming, “Yes, because it is a need, and to show them the library is a comfortable place for
parents to connect.” One constant thread that runs through this data is the insistence of public
39

libraries to show they are all-inclusive environments that are comfortable places for parents to
bring their children whether they are on the spectrum, or not.
This is highlighted by the responses from eleven of the twelve librarians who do conduct
sensory-friendly programs when they were asked if they recommend other public libraries do the
same. Figure 7 below shows seven (58.33%) of them highlighted the importance of it making the
library an all-inclusive environment, and four (33.33%) acknowledged “Other” reasons including
“something simple can make a difference” and before offering these specific programs the
library‟s “need practical knowledge.” It is important for parents and children to learn and gain a
supporting community they may have never realized was there (See Appendix 3, Question 5a).

There are positives to conducting sensory-friendly programming, but there are also many
challenges. As stated above, those challenges prevent many libraries from implementing the
programs even if they would want to create them. However, how does this data support or go
against the main focus of this thesis which questions whether public libraries are creating and
implementing programming for children with autism spectrum disorder or not? Librarians
responses confirmed that conducting these programs would create educational relationships

40

between the library and their visitors. This question was asked of every librarian interviewed,
and it did not matter if they answered “Yes” or “No” to Question #1 (See Appendix 3).
Data is presented here to establish whether the hypothesis and research question can be
answered: „Can public librarians expand and improve their educational relationships with visitors
by developing and implementing programs for children with ASD?‟ has been answered
Figure 8 focuses on librarians who answered “Yes” to conducting programs for children
with autism.

Six of out twelve librarians (50.00%) stated “Offering New Experiences” as a reason why
educational relationships are formed. Once the family is introduced to the library, they are able
to use the abundance of resources within to learn about new things, and it allows the families to
interact with new people. Two of the eleven librarians (16.67%) cite “Social Growth” as a
notable educational relationship being formed. Those librarians noticed children were very quiet
and nervous the first time they participated in a sensory-friendly program at the library, but as
time went on those children would become leaders to help new children coming to the library.
Three of the eleven librarians (25.00%) stated that “Educational Growth” of some type was
noticed as the child or children progressed through the series of programs. Whether it was

41

developing their literacy skills or counting at a faster rate, these librarians noticed an increase in
educational achievement. Only one of the twelve librarians or 8.33% stated that they did not see
any type of educational relationship being formed (See Appendix 3, Question 4a). One quote that
stood out from the interviews was, “Yes, some children could not sit still, would not talk or
listen, but as they continued through the programs they now see improvement in many of those
areas of learning.”
This same question was asked of the librarians who answered “No” to conducting
programs for children with autism and the results might be a little surprising.

but also from other children visiting the library.

Figure 10 shows, four out of fifteen (25.00%) identified “Social” reasons why
educational relationships within the library setting would improve. Librarians noted that it would
allow visitors who are not on the spectrum, whether they be children or adults, to learn from the
parents and children who deal with autism on a daily basis. Creating an environment where
people can learn from one another can reduce the instinct of intolerance, and increase the amount
of understanding between individuals who are different. This creates an inclusive environment,
which three out of the fifteen (18.75%) librarians noted as a way these programs can improve
educational relationships (See Appendix 3, Question 5b).
95% of the librarians interviewed thought conducting autism-based programming in their
libraries would improve educational relationships with all of their visitors, whether they
conducted the specific programming or not. Implementing sensory-friendly programming can
create an inclusive environment that supports children with or without autism. This inclusive
environment also allows adults to learn and fully understand what autism is, and create social
relationships with parents who have children with autism. Learning does not have to be through a
textbook, computer, or an informational packet. Learning can be done by observing,
experiencing, and speaking to individuals who are different from one‟s own self, taking those
43

new things they have learned and applying it to the rest of one‟s life. Not only do public libraries,
and especially the librarians, want to create an inclusive comfortable environment for children on
the spectrum and their parents, but they also want their other visitors to learn how to accept and
understand other people for who they are, and realize just because they are different does not
mean they cannot enjoy a full life.

44

Chapter 5:
Conclusions
The data show that the research question and hypothesis were confirmed: that through
conducting programming for children with autism, educational relationships can be formed
between the librarians and their visitors. This does not take away from the fact that it is
extremely difficult for many public libraries to conduct this type of programming. As was
shown, many variables enter the playing field when thinking about the creation and
implementation of sensory-friendly activities. Libraries are concerned about program attendance;
whether they have the funding to purchase necessary supplies and hire staff with the knowledge
to conduct the programs, and finally the time to implement it.
Although offering sensory-friendly experiences are difficult for many libraries, they
acknowledge the benefits that come from them, primarily, providing a place where families that
have children with autism can feel comfortable and safe. Once a comfortable environment is
formed, these children may take advantage of the library in ways they may have never done
previously. Increasing their literacy and growing socially are just two of the benefits the children
can gain from the experiences. Parents can also become part of a supportive community that may
help them with any issues they encounter. As more individuals start to use the library as a source
of knowledge, the library will most likely gain recognition as an inclusive space where anyone
can come in and learn something new, or form unique relationships.
When it comes to funding for the libraries highlighted in this study, operating under a
deficit was not always a deterrent from conducting programs for children with autism. For some
libraries funding was not the primary issue instead it was having confidence and practical
knowledge about autism. However, libraries that do not offer those types of experiences and

45

operate on a positive budget, highlight funding as one of the main reasons they do not have
sensory-friendly activities. This may happen for a variety of reasons, but they may not have
enough money allocated to their educational funds and that can prevent them from conducting
programs. For the most part, middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods based on their median
household income had libraries that were more inclined to conduct programs for children with
ASD. This study also highlighted that a library can exist within a community with a high median
household income, but it does not prevent the library from operating under a deficit. What those
numbers showed is that it all depends on the library, and what they can financially achieve while
following their mission. Some libraries that were interviewed may view the extra expenses as
essential to the mission of their institution, while others most likely realize it supports their
mission but they do not want to risk functioning under a deficit. Practical knowledge, staff, time,
space, and attendance numbers are extremely important, if not more important, than funding for
libraries when it comes to offering sensory-friendly programs.
Overall, most of the librarians thought sensory-friendly programming should exist
because the library is for everyone and they want every person, no matter who they are, to feel
comfortable walking into the library, learning something new, and interacting with others. Most
importantly, libraries want their communities to realize that they are there for anyone as a source
of positive activities. This study finally highlights how it is possible that museums and libraries
can learn from one another, and eventually, in the future, form more partnerships to affect larger
populations of people.

46

Chapter 6:
Applications to the Field & Implications for Further Research
When it comes to public libraries and their programming for children with autism there
are multiple applications that would help everyone. Museums and public libraries are both
members of the non-profit sector, and are attempting to provide similar educational and social
experiences. Typically, museums tend to have more available funds from private sources, than
public libraries. One way museums could help public libraries who are struggling to implement
programs for children with autism is to form a partnership. These partnerships can help both the
museum and library with visitation from new people, and it shows that an entire community is
committed to becoming all-inclusive rather than staying as individual institutions. When nonprofits work together it helps everyone, especially the libraries which may struggle with
affording materials. The museum may be able to help supply the library with materials to
conduct the programming, or with experienced staff members. Then they can trade on and off
performing different programs at each other‟s institutions. Even rewarding individuals who visit
both places with a prize of a discount coupon, or another prize would give them more incentive
to visit both institutions and use all of the resources available. For parents who have children
with autism, it would allow them to have two locations they feel comfortable bringing their
children for programs or for a regular visit.
Public libraries who do conduct programs for children with autism tend to persist with
certain types including Sensory-Friendly Story Time and Sensory Movie Nights. Those are great
programs where educational and social knowledge can be acquired, but diversifying their
selections might be helpful in the future. Now most public libraries do not have the same amount
of space as many museums do. With that added space, more activities are able to occur. One

47

thing public libraries can learn from museum programming is diversification. Within museum
programs there are multiple activities occurring. When it comes to Sensory-Friendly Sundays at
the Franklin Institute, they have small scientific experiments at a station. This helps the children
engage with the museum, and learn something new. By trying new activities, public libraries
might be able to bring in more consistent attendance numbers. When things are the same, all of
the time people become bored, and if parents does not see the purpose in the program for their
children they will not bring them anymore. It is this researcher‟s recommendation that libraries
that are currently conducting programs for children with autism, and even ones who are not,
should look at museums and the unique activities and experiences they try to provide and attempt
to incorporate them into their own library setting. Offering a wider variety of activities and
programs can gain more attention, and regular attendance at more public libraries.
Especially in larger cities like Philadelphia museums that offer sensory-friendly programs
and have more resources available can bring their skills and knowledge to libraries and train their
staff. By doing this act of sharing knowledge, more libraries might feel confident offering these
specific types of experiences for children with ASD. Another possibility through partnerships
between libraries and museums could be discounted tickets. Libraries can have a reading
program where children have to read a certain amount of books and in return their family would
receive discounted tickets to a specific museum. This is beneficial because many individuals,
who may use libraries because of their free nature, would have a chance to visit museums.

Implications for Future Research
During any major research project there are often different or more unique avenues that the
researcher may have wanted to explore. However, there is not always the time and ability to

48

conduct this research as it relates to the research hypothesis and question. For this thesis, there
are multiple possibilities that could help take this research further.
The first implication for future research would be able to conduct empirical research: an
actual program for children with autism within public libraries to clearly observe and document
how much work is required to create and implement a successful program for children on the
autistic spectrum. It would allow for immediate engagement with the participants, to see if these
programs actually do create some type of educational relationship.
Creating and implementing a program for children on the spectrum, interviews of parents and
possibly the children themselves would be beneficial to the study. Conducting a program is one
thing, but that does not allow the individual conducting the program to hear everyone‟s opinions,
and to ask if they thought it was a success. Interviewing the parents would be extremely
beneficial because they know their child better than anyone, and would be able to comment on
whether it is something they would do again. Hearing the voice of individuals directly within the
autism community would bolster evidence for this thesis if they agreed with librarians who
thought these programs created educational relationships. Parents could also provide insight on
how these programs have affected their children educationally and socially.
Another way to add to the thesis would be to observe a sensory-friendly program being
conducted within a public library. This thesis does provide information on an observation from
the Franklin Institute‟s Sensory-Friendly Sunday program; it does not have an observation from
one in a library because of time and permission barriers. By watching the children and how they
are interacting with the program, one can gather excellent data because it is easy to see
something happening and documenting it. Observing parents would be important to see how
comfortable they are with the program, and if they are building a community with other parents.

49

The observation of a program and interviewing of participants would be an excellent
combination to confirm the hypothesis made in this study and provide concrete data as evidence.
The next implication maintains a focus on individuals with autism. The current thesis is
focused on children with autism, the programming public libraries conduct for them, and if those
programs create educational relationships. Research and interviews could be extended
longitudinally to teens and adults who have autism to find out whether they had participated in
sensory-friendly programming at a public library, and if so, how it impacted their lives in
educational ways. Also, if they continue to visit that library or other libraries now because of the
programs they used to attend? Conversely, for teens or adults who have not participated in
sensory-friendly programs at a public library, do they ever visit public libraries and if so, how
often? Conducting this type of research could lead to learning whether lifelong relationships with
particular public libraries are formed and whether individuals with autism feel more comfortable
going to different places because of the relationships they made while visiting public libraries.
The most important thing to realize about the applications and implications of this study is
how they suggest partnerships between organizations. Museum and libraries have an excellent
opportunity to come together and affect communities in positive ways. Highlighting some of the
struggles and benefits libraries have gained while attempting to offer sensory-friendly
experiences for children with ASD, this research can spark conversations about cross-training
between museums and libraries as to what they can do to help each other when it comes to
specialty programming, and different activities all together.
The primary claim to take away from this study is that money is not everything. If a library
wants to conduct a certain type of program they will allocate resources to achieve their goals and
follow their mission. The more pressing challenges that impact libraries when it comes to

50

offering sensory-friendly experiences are practical knowledge and their amount of staff. Overall,
it depends on the library. Whether they are operating on appositive budget or under a deficit,
each library makes decisions that are right for their institution. If this means conducting sensoryfriendly programs, then they will offer these experiences no matter what their financial situation
may be because if they have the practical knowledge on ASD and the available staff it makes it
easier to offer a variety of enriching programs.
