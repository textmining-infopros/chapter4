DISTORTED VIEWS: READING, LANGUAGE, AND CULTURE
Amanda A. Hernández, M.A.
The University of Texas at San Antonio, 2016

Supervising Professor: Josephine Mendez-Negrete, Ph.D.

With this thesis, I analyze language use and its linguistic devices, cultural distortions or
hidden worldviews of a closet world that displays a mocked group who live in the closet inside
the mind of a white cat’s imagination. Produced and illustrated by Judy Schachner, in the
Skippyjon Jones children’s series, she draws on Mexican stereotypes, using images and language
via Mock Spanish as a means of acceptable public racist discourse, within the framework of
social and language competency. In these essays, I problematize the ways in which the Spanish
language is used. Most importantly, I unpack the metanarrative, the story behind the story, of
Skippyjon Jones. And, after an analysis of its discourse, images, and cultural representations, I
posit that the set of stories are a masquerade. A shallow multicultural view of Mexican culture
based on a Siamese cat’s imagination and its narrative of linguicism and racism. Inside an ersatz
Mexican culture that focuses stories in the closet, the inhabitants of this imagined world are
Chihuahuas whose origin are in Mexico’s Aztec past, further complicating superficial view or
simulacrums that image an ancestrally proud people who are reduced to dogs, whose interactions
are limited to hiding in a strange land that is only accessible to a White cat that returns time and
again to save them.

ESSAY 1: AM I WHAT I READ OR WHAT I LIVE?

1

This is my testimonio. I was born to read.
The written word reserves an important role in my life. The written word has played,
informed, enlightened, and nurtured me. Literature was my other parent, which is why I have
chosen children’s literature as my life’s purpose. This is the pennon I carry because the words
we read influence minds, ideals, morals, ethics, and worldviews. The word is culture.
I grew up in a rural south Texas town where I experienced racism. This town was
comprised of mostly Mexicans—third plus generation United States citizens, documented and
undocumented immigrants, as well as Anglos of German Alsace heritage. It is still a segregated
town. Racism is subtle but it exists. Being Mexican in Texas has not and is not always viewed
as a good and positive thing. Search the term Mexican, today; it will yield more negative stories
than positive on any given news web site including National Public Radio (NPR). I have
experienced subtle and overt racism. Some of it was deeply painful and life altering. Some I
chose to ignore because the weight of another’s ignorance and fear is not mine to carry. I have
tried to be careful about being “hyper-sensitive” to racial remarks. I am vigilant and sensitive
about my reaction to negative and stereotypic representations about all things Mexican. As I
lived through racist periods which affected me so deeply that I could no longer recognize the
good in my culture or myself. That experience clouded my feelings of worth, but then I had a
God-as-my-witness moment that my children would value their Mexicanness.
My children would be raised valuing the culture and knowing its history (the one not
taught in schools, one not appreciated or understood in the United States). Raising children to
positively value being Mexican is not an easy task. It is as elusive as a black haired angel in
South Texas. Our Christmas tree went without an angel or topper for three years before I could

2

find a black-haired angel. It was important to me that my children see themselves reflected as
good, worthy, and precious.
The fondest memories I have from my childhood took place in the living room of my
abuelita Chenta. My grandmother and Great Aunt Nacha would quilt. There was no formal
name or exact time for these gatherings, but it was usually cold and it felt like November to me.
It was not an elaborate set up but the work was serious. Only the real seamstresses in the family
could work on the quilts. But everyone could join in the conversations and stories. I remember
warmth and laughter from the conversation from beneath the quilting frame. Information was
shared, stories were told, news was distributed, and the stories and conversations were answered
in a mixture of English and Spanish. This was my familial oral history.
One of my first memories is of wanting to learn to read. I had a need to know what “all
those lines and circles, to me a mystery” (10,000 Maniacs, 1987) were conveying. I knew books
had meaning. I wanted in on the secret. I am not sure where this need came from I just
remember it always being there, and the excitement of first grade where I learned how to unfold
the mysteries of reading. It was visceral. Reading is what I was destined to do.
However, I did not to expect to see a brown girl in books. I created ways to connect to
the stories I read. Counter stories did not exist to balance out the books I read. Only the oral
history shared by family at gatherings from weddings to funerals, or on summer nights cooling
off from the day’s heat provided a balance and a place in a story that had depth, meaning, and
love. Likewise, the various Mexican American writers I have heard speak have stated how they
had never seen themselves in stories. They yearned for books where their lives were reflected. I
never noticed I was not part of the story. In contrast, I never looked for myself in the stories I
read. I would love to blame my brother for being the protagonist in all the stories at home or for

3

being the youngest and a girl and not playing a central part in most stories. I did not read stories
about a Mexican girl growing up in rural South Texas because they did not exist. I looked for
the intellectual, ethical and transcendental self. Stories with girls who were smart, thoughtful,
and empathetic, and whose life was different from mine in thought and action. When there was
no female protagonist, who reflected my ideals, my spunk, my tomboy toughness, a comparable
a boy would do. I read The Hardy Boys and not Nancy Drew.
I identified with Katherine “Kit” Tyler from Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth
George Speare. Kit was brave and acted kindly. “The answer is in thy heart, thee can always
hear it if thee listens for it” (Speare, 1971, p. 100). She was intelligent and “[i]f you ask me, it’s
all that schooling. It takes the fun out of life, being cooped up like that day after day … Books,
now that’s different. There’s nothing like a book to keep you company of a long voyage”
(Speare, 1971, p. 128). To have a kindred spirit who did right by the people she encountered and
loved teaching, learning, and reading. For a brief time, I was Kit Tyler leaving Barbados for
New England.
World Book Encyclopedias was the internet in my home. If I had a question or a
curiosity. I looked it up. I learned about the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Malcom X, and Brown vs the Board of Toepeka, Kansas. I comprehended human anatomy but
human worth and dignity were taught by family. I explored religions. Looked up constellations
and traveled to distant planets. I explored Earth’s innerscapes via volcanos, fossils and
dinosaurs. I came to understand the life cycles of plants and animals but human mortality was
experienced in the warm embrace of my family
Atticus Finch and Scout became my role models when I tried to understand the people
around me. “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of

4

view…until you climb into his skin and walk around in it” (Lee, 1960, p 39). With those words,
Lee planted the seeds for my strong sense of empathy. This quote plays in my head every time I
encounter a person who is difficult. Or when trying to understand others perspectives.
It was a book called Chiquita’s Cocoon by Bettina R. Flores that opened my eyes, as a
young twenty-something woman. She wrote about the Latina Cinderella complex which
connected with sociocultural conflicts I had growing up. It elaborated on the dichotomy of
Catholic Latina women who are complicit in perpetuating their own subservience. As did Gloria
Anzaldua when she said
[t]he culture and the Church insist that women are subservient to males. If a woman
rebels she is a mujer mala. If a woman doesn’t renounce herself in favor of the male, she
is selfish. If a woman remains a virgen until she marries, she is a good woman. (p. 2)
I lived this existence an unmarried woman with two children not married but living with their
father. I rebelled against church and culture. I was a marked woman.
I did not need to see myself in other stories, but if I could connect intellectually to a
character it was how I continued to learn and grow. This is how I unconsciously learned not to
be reflected in books. Thus, if I could not see myself as a writer either. However, I adapted to
keep my reading habit. As a reader of books, these are the questions I ask myself. Why did I not
ask where the stories with girls like me? Was it because I grew up in Luz, Texas? Was it the
expectation that as a Mexican female I did not have a central role in any story? Or was it that the
only stories where I was important were heard at home with my quilt makers? So, after learning
that my story has no agency in my town and having learned some harsh truths about being a
Mexican girl in Texas; they are not valued (Foley, 1998). I learned at the University of Texas at
Austin that I had a place, as did my stories. I have place in history.

5

Then, I read stories written not just by American writers or Europeans. But read instead
Paz, Darío, Poniatowska, Sor Juana Inez, Borges Azuela and Neruda who were Spaniards,
Colombians, and Mexican men and women writers; stories older than Shakespeare and more
futuristic. This new knowledge solidified the sine qua non to teach my children to see
themselves positively in the books, movies, and society. They needed to know they had a place
in America. I am not sure whether I failed or succeeded. My children were read positive stories
about their culture, of other cultures as well, to the best of my ability for the books available at
the time. They heard good stories about themselves and being Mexicans. Why and what is the
problem? There is a need for counter stories to give the marginalized a place to imagine
themselves.
For the reasons, the first form of literacy children encounter is important. These stories
teach children about themselves and the world around them. These stories become part of their
culture. Parents, teachers, and care givers have the burden to help children differentiate what is
true to self and what is not. “So while counterstories challenge mainstream society’s denial of
the ongoing significance of race and racism, they do so by offering a critical reflection on the
lived experiences and histories of People of Color” (Yasso, 2006, p. 10). That is why it is vitally
important for them to choose appropriate stories to understand the meanings they may hold for a
child. Stories have values and lessons. Just as parents have responsibilities to their children, so
do the people choosing to share stories with children of color.
Librarians have a grave responsibility in their choice of books, which will mold how a
child will think of themselves and their culture. It is librarians who put books in the hands of our
children. For this reason, it is important that they know their children’s community to serve it
well. “Books for children are often used to teach prevailing values and accepted behaviors of a

6

particular time” (Reynolds, 2011, p. 1). Just as parents have responsibilities to their children, so
do the people choosing stories to with their community members, as Reynolds states:
Children’s literatures link to the past works at multiple levels, too. Just as the children
we once were continue to exist inside and to affect us, so writing produced for children
continues to resonate over time and to be implicated in the way we conceive, organize,
and manage societies. (p. 1)
Thus, it is urgent that librarians serve that community in good and positive way and in the ways
books are chosen that most affects marginalized groups. Librarians have power in the books
they place in the hands of children. Latino librarians who are members of American Library
Association (ALA) comprise only 3.9 % of professional for that reason, I urge them to attend to
the process of choosing quality books for Mexican or Mexican-American children (ALA, 2014).
With that in mind, I rely on the Skippyjon Jones books as the medium by which librarians
become complicit in the racialized practices displayed in these texts, when they give Skippy the
thumbs up as a good purchase as indicated by this School Library Journal (SLJ)
recommendation:
SCHACHNER, Judy. Skippyjon Jones, illus. by author, unpaged. Dutton. 2003. RTE
$15.99. ISRN 0-525-47134-0. LC number unavailable.
K-Gr 3-This is a wildly wonderful book about a hyperactive kitten, Skippyjon Jones,
whose head and ears are too big for his body, and whose imagination is too intense for his
mama. According to her, he needs to do some serious thinking about what it means to be
a Siamese cat instead of a bird (Skippyjon always wakes up and catches worms with his
feathered friends). She sends him to his room, where he imagines he is a Chihuahua
("My name is Skippito Kriskito./I fear not a single bandito"). Chock-full of rhyming

7

chants and Spanish expressions, the feline's adventure as a doggy Zorro ends in chaos.
His frazzled mother gives him a hug anyway and says, "Say good night, Skippyjon
Jones." "Buenas noches, mis amigos," says the kitten, as he bounces on his bed all ready
for another adventure. The buoyant and colorful cartoon illustrations match the
exuberant text perfectly. Spanish-speaking children will be especially delighted by the
words and humor; others may be a little bewildered by all of the foreign phrases and will
need some explanation, but the story definitely has the potential of a fun read-aloud. A
good multicultural offering. Judith Constantinides, formerly at East Baton Rouge Parish
Main Library, LA (p. 106)
As a teacher/librarian, I take an insiders perspective in terms of being a mother of Mexican
children, school resource specialist, and former bilingual teacher at a school that serves primarily
Mexican children in low socioeconomic households, and a reader.
While working at the public library, Sue Problema, the pseudonym I use for my branch
manager, and I would discuss children’s literature and the state of Mexicanos in San Antonio. It
was she who originally alerted me to Skippy, however, I did not return to read him until one year
later, as a graduate student, when I voraciously consumed the texts with a more critical eye, in a
multicultural children’s literature course.
After having read the texts, I was alarmed with the notion that I was overly sensitive to
the images and themes I was reading. Soon, however, I engaged the text as instances of
microaggression. The sense of doubting is the litmus for when an event, writing or person is
being microaggressive “by which they mean one of those many sudden, or dispiriting
transactions that mar the day of women and people of color” (Delgado and Stefanic, p. 1, 2010).
The images and words used by Schachner have the potential of inputting views about Mexican

8

children. With negative stereotypes the propagation of continued neocapitalist ideals, Schachner
perpetuates of the internalized oppression of Mexican children, rather than creating in children’s
literature their ability to see themselves beyond the here and now. Skippyjon Jones, a popular
children’s book character, is an example of the use of microaggression through Mexican
stereotypes and Mock Spanish that subvert the Mexican imaginary.
Individuals are shaped by their culture. In the United States, we are a book literate
society. Therefore, some of our earliest ways of socializing our young citizens is through
literature, which is read to them and conveys a meaning that is unique to the individual and their
experiences or their lived experiences and the experiences for their particular cultural group.
The stories we tell or do not tell shape their initial worldviews. The stories they hear begin to tell
them their potential and where the ceiling is—stories of whether they are valued or not. Picture
books can be subversive, not only in what they say, but also in what they show. Books have the
capability of telling children - this is who you need to be, if you are not blond-haired and blueeyed, please try to be as close to this as you can be. The culture of success can be imparted
through books. They can say through the pictures if and if you do not meet an idealized version
of the American imaginary, then you cannot have the American dream, and you stand in the
margins of what is idealized.
Positive Affects and Effect of Multicultural Literature
Research shows that reading to children early and often has positive effects on their
future learning (Clark, Flores, Smith, & González, (2016), Kress, (2016). The greater their
vocabulary the more successful they are in school. There is no argument against reading to
children and its benefits. From that perspective, I address the importance of the stories we read
to our Mexican children and what is being conveyed to them about their language, race, gender,

9

class and culture. It is important to understand the ways in which the they hear and read impact
them both positively and negatively.
Macro and Microaggression Defined
Microaggression as defined by Delgado and Stefanic are “stunning small encounter with
racism, usually unnoticed by members of the majority race” (2010, p. 190). I have learned to
hear and identify such perpetrations in my daily life. Some of the expressions of
microaggression I have experienced have been:
“What kind of Mexican are you? You don’t eat beans,” have stated family members and
friends
“Can you talk to my maid for me?” asked a close friend.
“I’m not racist but I think everyone should speak American in America,” a different
friend said jokingly.
“Why don’t these children speak English? How long have they been in the US? I think
they should speak English,” grilled a substitute nurse.
“You don’t have an accent,” said a new friend.
“I know about Mexican culture. I grew up eating enchiladas,” said a well-respected
librarian.
“My mom wants me to date someone nice,” former boyfriend.
“I just add an –o at the end and it becomes a Spanish word, right?” coworker.
“I hate the Spanish kids,” first grade student.
Another circumstance was when I had been asked four times by the same store clerk in
one visit, if I needed help finding something, and each time telling the same clerk “no.” I
continue to experience delayed or lack of service at a restaurant. Not being acknowledged at the

10

scrapbook store in town. A stranger asking if I am my cousin’s latest conquest then defending
my outrage at being reduced to an object of sex to my friends. These are just a few instances of
microaggression in my lifetime. These acts of microaggression are important because over time
They can be thought of as small acts of racism, consciously or unconsciously
perpetuated, welling up from the assumptions about racial matters most of us absorb from
the cultural heritage in which we come of age in the United States. These assumptions, in
turn, continue to inform our public civic institutions–government, schools, churches–and
our private, personal and corporate lives. (Delgado & Stefancic, p. 2, 2012)
These acts of microaggression are present in our daily lives. These acts, images and speech are
present in the literature we read to our children. Mexicans portrayed as an outsider or alien to
this country, with accented and imperfect English, whom is a lazy scoundrel expecting a
handout—dirty, lazy, and ignorant.
Macroaggression are those acts of racism that are overt and held as societal truths,
reinforced by the dominant culture. Because I can inadvertently harm the children with whom I
come into contact, although I am a critical and aware person, my aim is to provide a critical
examination of the material we consume to teach children. With my thesis, I aspire to write a
piece, which fuses the knowledge I have obtained as a graduate student, as I create a narrative
based on my internal struggle with self, church, family and events, which have shape the woman
I am. The books I have read supplement my themes of external and internal oppression. My
narrative departs from autoethnographic principles that are accessible, and thought-provoking,
while at the same time relatable. My writing is based as a dialogue with my children to impart
maxims, guidance, or sentience.

11

I Am Becoming The Totality Of My Experiences
I was having dinner with some friends at Chinese restaurant. I remarked on how
chopsticks have always fascinated me. How I have never learned how to use them. Someone
said, “Geez, Amanda, where have you been? You need to step outside the box.” On my way
home that evening I replayed the conversation in my mind just I usually do when I go out with
my friends. I kept thinking of that phrase “outside the box.”
This statement struck a chord with me. However, at the time I could not say why. What
my friends do not realize that as an educated Chicana I live outside the box. As a Mexican
American woman from a rural town where traditionally Chicanas did not work or go to college;
my life outside the box began the moment I graduated high school without a baby or marriage
proposal, and with acceptance to the University of Texas at Austin. I was already a success. If I
did nothing else with my life, I was already more successful than 85 percent of my female family
contemporaries. But what I have come to learn is what makes me a success in dominant culture
is the very thing that keeps me from going back into the caja from which I tried to escape. What
I have learned was that once I busted out there was no going back, yet I had to construct my own
boxes to deal with the bicultural cajas of my youth.
The name of my hometown church is Holy Cross, a small humble stark church. It serves
a congregation of about 500 people. On its grounds are the priest’s house, church hall, former
elementary school, and former convent. It has about sixteen tall pecan trees growing between
the church and the hall. It is pretty and green and looks serene. Luz is a rural very Catholic and
German influenced little town.
There is only one church, only one place to go to school, only one brick factory for
employment and no place for a budding defiant feminist Chicana who questioned everyone and

12

everything around her. My small town was a Supreme Court case ready to happen. A few
weeks after the academic school year began so would, Confraternity of Catholic Doctrine
(CCD), or what I have come to describe as “Sunday school four-days a week with a bonus
Wednesday church service and special services during the Lenten season—thank you very
much.” This alone is no reason to bring in the Supreme Court but a it would have been no
trouble creating a case because the powers that be, administration, teachers and school board,
used the public school buses to transport children from their warm homes forty-five minutes
earlier than normal and drop them off at the church hall for CCD classes and pick them up from
the church grounds and transport them to school in time to eat breakfast and begin the academic
day.
Our school was known as the best private public school in our county. It is still
considered one of the best schools in the area. In these religious classes, which I was bound and
gagged to attend, I learned about the “real culture” (Naylor, 1998, p. 18) of Luz under the guise
of being taught the “ideal culture” (Naylor, 1998, p. 17) of how to be a “good” Catholic. I
learned about real small town cultural hypocrisy and race relations. These classes were taught by
the good Catholic white women of Luz whose husbands ran the brick factory and who were the
large landowners of the town and by maybe one or two Mexican American women in the early
elementary grades that traditionally cared for the white children of these very same employers
and large land-owning families. The classes were basic, tedious, and boring. We learned
prayers and the basic philosophy of the church: mortal sins are bad, God forgives if you are truly
sorry, that, while the Seventh Commandment exists (thou shall not commit adultery) we were not
going to talk to you about “it.” But, by God, you better not be doing “it” or using birth control
unless it is to regulate your period (wink wink).

13

This socialization quickly became antiquated by fourth grade, especially for a child that
was reading one to two grade levels higher than her classmates and had uncensored untethered
access to World Book Encyclopedia (my personal savior). “It” did not sound very interesting at
the time. I most certainly did not see what the big deal was. This system of conspired alliances
between church and school was a system that worked well for the landowners and business of the
town because of “a unique layering of generations has occurred in which ethnic/racial identities
take many form” (Ruiz, 1998, p. 25).
Mexican-Americans had accepted this socialization processes as norms and were
complicit in the practices that lead to our continued oppression. Each successive generation
follows suit without cognition, the practices fits within the “acceptable ranges of behavior”
(Naylor, 1998, 18). It was not until a white Anglo Protestant family, who objected to this
custom, that the school district did away with this practice. I look at the structure of the Catholic
Church and I see it driven by males. It is most certainly patriarchal. But in the “real culture”
(Naylor, 1998, p. 18) of Luz, it is the women who pass on those practices to the next generation.
My mom signed and paid for these classes, my grandmother and my mother’s friends checked to
make sure my brother and I were signed up, women taught these classes at least at younger grade
levels. Not attending would have “threatened the unity, harmony…of the larger group” (Naylor,
1998, 18). There were only two male teachers who taught classes. They, along with their wives,
taught ninth and tenth grade group and eleventh and twelfth grade groups.
These men teaching the classes were major landowners in town and felt it was their duty
to teach them. They extolled adherence to the Ten Commandments, chastity and dutiful Sunday
services attendance. During tenth grade, my crepuscular caja antagonisms began to affect me, I
began to test my individuality and did not attend classes, became belligerent, and indifferent to

14

the church, its people and its credo. In a small town, much like Foley’s (2010) this is a
dangerous behavior, I was risking my position given my class, gender and what little agency I
had:
Those youths who aspired to be socially prominent had to master this cultural
contradiction. In response, they learned to live a dual public and private lives and
skillfully manage their public image. They put on a different performance for a different
audience. On the one hand, the “cool players” were paragons of discipline and
conformity for the adults. In public, they acted like the community’s “straight” future
leaders. They were more sobered, work-oriented, and restrained. The socially prominent
youth, like their parents, had to be public guardians of the old virtues and values. (p. 62)
I believe these men and women from my hometown had a motive; they were not entirely aware
of themselves. It was part of their culture to perpetuate a cycle of religious servitude of Mexican
Americans for the majority white employers and landowners. This is a theory to which I have
never given voice before because to say it aloud would be treacherous. Foley’s Learning
Capitalist Culture: Deep in the Heart of Tejas speaks to these systems, the social structures put
in place at a micro-level at school, in this case church, to help Anglo students learn, mimic,
practice and reproduce the expectations of their culture. Those that go off to university, in Luz
chiefly attend Texas A&M and come back to take their place within this structure to perpetuate it
continuation with their children. Recently, I looked at a church bulletin from Holy Cross listed
were names of members of the congregation and their duties at the church; only the first names
had changed the last names remained same.
The teachings of the church served these people well, as they created a subclass based on
the underclasses own religion. They tied undereducated women and men to the religious

15

teachings of the church for their own salvation as they created a built-in workforce. When I step
back and look at it I want to applaud the genius of the system. It is the Reconquista of the
children of Atzlán by Anglos using the very same tactics the Spaniards used in their initial
conquest of the Americas to “‘conquer, occupy and possess,’ the land of the ‘the heathens and
infidels,’ but said nothing of the people,” and “embrace the Catholic Church and be trained in
good morals” (Gonzalez, 2011, 13). It relies on the constituents’ culture against them. When I
look at the mechanism of transferring culture from the majority to the constituent group in a
small town it seems benign. It is not until you take off the blinders and that you begin to see its
malignancy.
As a small child, I recall mom getting me dressed to go to church right about the time that
the Lawrence Welk Show and Hee Haw were on the air. We would dutifully attend Saturday
mass. Much like the most of the segregated South so was our church. There were designated
pews. I do not know when this started. I do not know where the imaginary line was drawn that
could not be crossed. I do not know who imposed this tradition. I do know that we fought like
hungry dogs for the only morsel of meat on a bone to sit the last pew of the church—why? Most
Mexican Americans in my hometown shoved themselves into the last two rows of the church,
every Saturday evening. When families got that last pews, they felt lucky to sit there. A few
Mexican families sat up amongst the gentry but they were unlike my family. My dad would call
them lambuscos or kiss asses, or somewhat like the “vendidos” (Foley, 2010). I suppose they
had more agency than my family. They most definitely broke a border. There was a sense of
otherness about them. When my parents talked to those border breakers I could sense the lack of
trust. I viewed them through a different lens.

16

I broke that border. At some point my parents lost that devoutness and so we did not
attend mass when I was a teenager. I did not start attending mass again until my senior year in
high school. It was more as an act of teenage of rebellion than a testament of my faith, which I
had lost before becoming a teenager. I remember when I decided to go to church. It was after a
summer filled with growing pains. It was a decision based in defiance of being stereotyped. I
was dating an Anglo whose parent’s kind of thought he could date someone “better”, “nicer”,
and not Mexican. They had made me believe I was not the best choice for him. But neither was
I the worst choice. I was a top student. I was involved in school and church activities. I was a
class officer. I was a school leader. Despite all of this, I was not “better.” This was the first
time I was not “better.” I could not logically make sense of this lack of worth. Sure, I had my
left leaning opinions. Sure, I could cuss like a sailor if the need or want arose but never around
adults and my curfew was at ten p.m. How could I not be “better”? I was not sure how much
more “better” I could get.
It turns out that the better box was of a different color box and not a caja, which was
stigmatized by “connotations of being a whore or concubine” (Foley, 1998, 94). Therefore, I, the
opinionated teenage fledgling Chicana, who was the bane of my mother’s existence, chose
church as the venue of opposition. On the holiest day of the week Sunday, I made my stand. I
chose to sit on the “better” side. Outside the traditional boundary so I could try to see how it was
on the “better” side of the boundary. It was done as an act of protest and not as a rejection of my
culture. As nervous, anxious and queasy as I felt, I now realize the “better” side was afraid of a
ninety-five pound four feet and ten inches tall, Mexican American teenage girl who looked no
older than fifteen years-old on a good day. It is still hard to own that realization.

17

As a committed Atheist, I started attending church that year and opened myself to some
very painful lessons. The words of wisdom came from my future husband about faith, God and
signs I sat in church and looked for those signs. Often, one of the readings would hit close to
home. The church was my mirror and I grew. I saw how small racists are. I questioned the
ideal teachings of the church and how they did not seem to mesh with the reality of the world
around me. While I was broken, I knew someday I would mend. I knew that “better” would not
define me but would inspire me to be the best me I could be. I knew when I crossed that
invisible boundary that I could not go back to the last pew in the church ever again.
The irony of all this is the very people who were teaching me about goodness, godliness,
and grace were the very people who had hardest time showing goodness, godliness, and grace
outside the shadow of the church they so adored. My CCD teachers worked at the local grocery
store, ran the laundry mat, were farmers and ranchers, teachers, bankers, journalist and tax
collectors. It was the most bizarre set of behaviors I have ever seen. I later realized this is one of
the guises of hypocrisy. During instruction time, they were smiling, friendly, and polite.
However, out in public it was a completely different set of behaviors and actions I still cannot
quite figure out. These grown adults would behave as if they had never even seen you. As if
they never called your name during roll call for the last nine months never mind I had lived there
among them my whole life.
I remember once in high school going in to pay the water bill for my parents. I went into
the office and I knew one of the CCD teachers worked there. I smiled when I saw the religious
instructor and waited for some sort of acknowledgement of acquaintance. I was not expecting a
grand show of emotion just a flicker of yo no se que. I was greeted with a blank stare of
dismissal. This reaction was incomprehensible to me. Dazed and confused would adequately

18

define my state of mind. The questioning rejection of Catholicism was solidified. This was not
an isolated instance or the only teacher to do that to me. It was a hypocritical prejudicial dance
of oppression that I had to learn. I also learned that the children of these people could not and
should not be acknowledged as friends or even acquaintances outside of the school grounds or
after regular school hours. Acknowledgement at school events hinged on many variables. Out
of town games were the best because we could sit with whomever we wanted.
This is but one corner of the box, which I have chosen to examine; one box, which I have
repeatedly moved around as I discard bits and pieces to find worthwhile experiences to
incorporate into my new way of being in the world—with or without a box. It was time to reflect
and streamline the storage container that it is my life and incorporate the important and worthy
“as I have no country, my homeland cast me out; yet all countries are mine because I am every
woman’s sister or potential lover” (Anzaldua, 2007, p. 102).
This place, third space, as I perceive it, is fluid and allows me to recognize that many
forces out of my control shaped the person I am today. I have my history and within me the
experiences of my ancestors, and while there are forces that knowingly and unknowingly act as
players in these events of my life, they can only control me to the extent that I allow them. My
eyes have been open and now I can see how the external and internal forces of oppression work
together to create a metanarrative. hooks explained it most succinctly this process of healing and
recognizing self when she stated
We can choose a love that will courageously seek out the wounded soul, find you,
and dare to bring you home again, doing what must be done to help put the bits and
pieces together again, to make us whole. This is real cool. This is real love (p.153).

19

As I gain a better understanding of world capitalist theory and its effects not just on lives
of people peripheral; nation-states, but on its consequences on parents and students who have
migrated into my life because of global migration, the greater depth my knowledge reaches, and
the better I am able to help my young students. I learn to see them, not as numbers in an Annual
Yearly Progress (AYP) goals, rather they simulate younger versions of my parents who were not
allowed to meet their potential in school. This reality makes evident an intense sorrow for
family members who still live in Luz, Texas. As such, I see and experience their pain and
consequences of internalized oppression. Often, as family members lash out at me, with biting
remarks, I deter from striking back because my path has been different than theirs. My path, my
imaginary was different, thus I have dared to enter the many worlds of Skippyjon Jones.

ESSAY II: MI HISTORIA: BOOKS AND MY LOVE FOR READINGS

23

One summer, my grandma Chenta taught me to crochet. Crocheting may look difficult.
However, it is not a difficult thing to learn. Once I knew the basic stitches everything else was a
modification. It is a process. You begin with a chain. Learn the slipstitches and variations of
the number of loops in chain. Everything is linked together, without the chain you cannot make
a circle. Hermeneutic is much like crocheting for me. All the pieces must be linked and one has
to experience and have the capacity to reflect on its meaning.
Studying children’ s literature is much like that for me. There is a process for taking
apart the components of a picture book. Separating the narrative from the pictures. Dissecting
the words form the narrative an analyzing them. Analyzing the phrases. All the while thinking.
What is the outcome? What story will be told if this word is to change? What if illustrations had
been painted this color and not the other? What would have happened? What story shall be told
and how would it be interpreted? How would Jane read it? How would Juana perceive it? What
changes? What part of the story is significant when all the parts have been inspected? What
meaning is derived when it is put back together? Is it one of continued oppression or one of
enlightenment, or one of race and gender stereotypes?
Perhaps, it is a narrative about equality when parts of a story are interwoven and patterns
emerge, such as an afghan. Did the colors go well? Did the yarn lay correctly? Were the
stitches too tight? Were the zigzags even? No one likes to see an ugly uneven unsightly crochet
piece. But ’buelita Chenta never said that. She guided she explained she made me take apart
circles or parts of circles. She guided, she explained that it cannot be too tight or too loose
because then it becomes uneven. Each part must have the same amount of tension for it to be
even. Either make them tight or make them loose. Just be consistent.

24

How is crocheting like children’s literature? I propose that when a writer tells a story that
is the process closest to creating an afghan. When they know their subject, patterns emerge.
Their story connects, no matter the specifics. A story about love and acceptance will resonate
whether that story is about a Latino or Russian family. Genuine love resonates. Genuine
resonates. So, when a story is not quite right, whether the illustrations are jarring and caricaturist
or the language is off and does not make a connection with readers. It crashes and burns. It is
lame and no one buys it. It could also cause students to disconnect from learning and engaging.
So here is the crux of my dilemma. I see the beauty in Schachner’s writing. I see that
she has fun with words. She is good at it but when she repeatedly uses the diminutive in
Spanish, she fails to make her point, while telling me I am less than. And, by me, I mean my
gente. This subconsciously says scholar Sor Juana Inez was not valid or writer Elena
Poniatowska is irrelevant that a language that is based on Latin and that has withstood the test of
time has no value. That the people who have read it are less than stories dating back to the time
of Cervantes as unworthy of gracing the halls of academia.
Her stories often stop me in my tracks and make me wonder what the children will think
when they hear this. We all see different patterns, such as in the crochet blanket that I was gifted
after my grandmother’s death. It is garish. But the pattern that catches me is her use of black
and red in the border. If you were to ask my daughter she might tell you it is the most beautiful
thing she has ever seen. She sees beauty where no one else does. So where others read
Skippyjon Jones they hear the play on words. They hear genuine Spanish. As for me, I hear
nails on a chalkboard. It is not play it is assassination. I experience the lack respect for a
language I hold dear.

25

As I stated, the difficulty in crocheting comes in making things even. Her books are
pleasing to the eye. Created so that it lays flat. Folds evenly. Aesthetically to please the eye.
When I learned to crochet. I picked colors I liked such as light mint green. The crucial part was
making the loops in the chain even. To this day, I struggle. Holding my hands just right, to this
day I do not hold my hands right. There is a way of hooking the yarn to integrate it. I use my
finger as the guide but that is not the proper way. Grandma tried. She came. She saw. She
shook her head and continued with the lesson. What is the point? It was not evident to me.
Language needs to flow and lay flat so it does not stick out. When reading it amongst the
English it does not sound like Schachner is trying too hard. With Schachner’s work, maybe
language should not be forced. “Para mi familia a la A Better Chance House en Swarthmore”
(Schachner, 2003) does not lay flat. I causes me to stop and adjust and reread and readjust.
Stare at the phrase, shake my head and continue reading vexed. Not like the racism implicit in
the question “if I comprendo” or when I’m told by an Anglo that she knows about the Hispanic
culture because she’s eaten enchiladas all her life. I have never eaten an enchilada—cheese is
abhorrent to me. I do know when I’m being spoken down to. I know when images of my people
are distorted in characature form. So, when I compared my stitches to grandma’s. She assured
me it would get better with practice. I hope God did not hold that against her. She genuinely
believed it.
When Taco Bell had Dinky, the taco-loving Chihuahua, advertisements on television, I
rejected the image because I am not a dog, and they are not talking about me. That dog was
meant to represent something greater than me—Mexicans. It was like placing a drumstick in a
simian’s hand to say “it is finger licking good.” It’s racist. It is dehumanizing. So, imagine my
response when that taco-loving Chihuahua exponentially appear in blue, pink, and purple. Then,

26

add polka dots, flowers, and give a couple of them crazy eyes. Then I become twitchy
speechless.

Figure 1. Los Chimichangos
Mexicans or Mexican-Americans do not see themselves as a metaphor for Chihuahuas.
They are not Chihuahuas. That is one of the problems. The other is that Skippito lives in an
imaginary world where these stories take place. I have heard such comments as, “These are
children’s story.” What is the big deal? You just must talk to them about race and racism. What
came to mind were the news stories I read about African American’s having to talks with their
young boys about how to react to police and in public. Because I realized I had been having
those talks with my children, reminding myself that I instructed them to keep the receipt from a
store when walking out. When my son was passing through Arizona. I instructed him to have a
birth certificate handy. Told him, if you get stopped by police be polite. Also, “if you have to
get something out, tell them that you are reaching out for it. But mostly, I wished he avoided
Arizona. “Drive at night, if you have to make a paranoid mother feel better.” Unlike

27

Euromericans, Mexican children still lack the privilege of being seen as natural citizens of the
United States.
¿Por qué Skippyjon Jones?
Skippyjon Jones (SJJ), the children’s book series, by Judith Schachner, utilizes
acceptable forms of public racist discourse in its narrative and imagery. Schachner uses various
methods for warping Mexicans and their culture. I explore stereotypic warped illustrations and
narrative about Mexicans and Mexico, under the guise of an imaginary world.
Language and Cultural (Mis)Representation
In this essay, I argue that the narrative and images created by Schachner perpetuate racist
and stereotypic signifiers, which are publicly acceptable in children’s literature. Correlated to
notions of hate speech, Schachner engages in the creation of a racialization narrative that
becomes normalized inside distorted tales of the other. Delgado and Stefanic (2010) writing
about the consumption of distorted images, offers that:
A more basic problem is that much of the hate speech is simply not perceived as such at
the time. The history of racial depiction shows that our society has blithely consumed a
shocking parade of Sambos, coons, sneaky Japanese, and indolent, napping Mexican—
images that society perceived at the time amusing, cute, or, worse yet, true. How can one
talk back to messages, scripts and stereotypes that are embedded in the minds of one’s
fellow citizens and, indeed, the national psyche? (p. 56)
Thus, my aim is to problematize the manner in which Mexicans are represented as a homogenous
group, particularly as depicted in Schachner’s books. I focus on Skippyjon Jones as a popular
and profitable children’s book series despite its racial overtones. Moreover, I make a case for the

28

ways in which illustrations and narrative further distort images of Mexicans represented as
Chihuahuas.
Images and Narratives of Otherness
Due to complexity of picture books, the argument I construct uses Critical Race Theory
(CRT), hermeneutic, and semiotics theories to present the framework of my analysis and
methodology. CRT is the overarching theory for this thesis. It explains the micro-aggressive
images, language and narrative based on race in all three essays. In addition to CRT, I rely on
hermeneutic practices as the foundational script for examining and conducting narrative and
language analysis. Semiotics frames the concept of the creation of meaning between narrative,
text and reader, and thus I engage a visual analysis of the stereotypes that homogenize the
Chimichangos as representative of a marginalized culture.
I am problematizing the narrative and images, and rely on language as another layer of
oppression created by Schachner in her Skippyjon Jones children’s book series. The use of
Mock Spanish in these series is an example of publicly racist discourse because of its overuse of
the diminutive –ita/o, misuse of -a/o and the hyper Anglicized caricatured speech. The narrative
places Skippy as the accidental savior of the Chimichango characters.
I have examined the illustrations to draw meaning that they create alone, and in
combination with the narrative. I support my conclusions. Schmidt (2013) offers that,
Sign systems are part of a discipline called semiotics. In semiotics, a sign can be
anything that stands for something to someone. Different signs have different meanings
for different people. In other words, the sign itself does not transmit the meaning. Signs
are the ways in which we send, receive and mediate meaning in one another (p. 27).

29

I rely on semiotics as a process of transmediation to peel back the layers of pictures in the book
so as make visible the racism in images. The combination of language, narrative, and
illustrations create a metanarrative that is stereotypic, racist, and classist.
Queries and Problematics
How does Schachner’s use of Mock Spanish, stereotypic images, and action or lack of
action to convey publicly acceptable narratives of racism? What is the one possible
metanarrative conveyed by the Skippyjon Jones series? What meanings emerge or are inferred
in the narrative? In what ways do the constructions of stereotypes reinforce or illustrate a racist
discourse. How do the characters’ action or inaction reinforce racist stereotypes conveyed in the
narrative?
Points of Departure
Semiotics is the study of the different signs from which meaning is made (Sipe, 1998). In
the case of picture books the two sign systems used are text and illustrations. Picture books are
layered. They convey meaning via the illustrations, text, and the interplay of illustration and
text. The use of color, images, and placement of the characters provides me a beginning for
analysis. My main concern when analyzing the illustrations was the influence the narrative was
going to have. This is important because the narrative will influence how I interpret the
illustrations.
While I am familiar with the narrative in the text, I examined the images apart from the
narrative of the story, covering both the illustrations and the text, to get at the meaning of each
separately and together as they convey the journey into the secret world of Skippito. Among the
illustrations, I selected were Skippy’s entrance into his imaginary world Schachner’s Skippyjon
Jones. As I studied the illustrations I looked at the foreground, the background, Skippy and the
Chimichangos and/or other prominent features on the page. Then I free wrote the words that

30

came to my mind as I surveyed the illustrations from general to specific from those I created a
narrative based on my observations.
Illustrative Lens: A Gaze into the Others
In this section I analyze and problematizing the illustrations created by Schachner. In
this way, it is my intent to isolate those images based on stereotypes, rather not on a deep
knowledge of the Mexican culture. Invariably, Skippyjon Jones ventures into the world of the
other—the home of the Chimichangos—where he finds all that is not what he experiences or
with what he lives. Sometimes he arrives with his superhero disguise, the black mask that
highlights his deep blue eyes, and other times he brings resources necessary for his travels to
these nether closet worlds—his ride-along-stick mouse and his goodies sack. Through these
images, we learn much more about the Chimichangos—they only appear to have a life and some
fun when Skippito is amongst them. When among the Chimichangos, Skippyjon Jones wears a
mask and some form of the Chimichangos cultural vestments. Always at the center of the action,
Skippito’s gaze is directed toward the reader. In one sketch the environment is festive, with
glittering lights, musical instruments, and party Mexican party hats. Domestic animals—
chickens and such—inhabit the densely-inhabited area that is further identified as Mexican with
a central fountain at the plaza of the Chimichango town. With a few exceptions in —one has its
eyes closes, another is looking down at the ground and six of the Chihuahua dogs look
suspiciously forward toward the reader Skippyjon Jones (2003). The dessert landscape depicts
and a dusky time where by all the Chimichangos are asleep and piled upon each other, as the
ever-trusting and caring Skippito looks toward the reader, as if he were tending to the safety of
about twelve Chimichangos who are alone or lost in the dessert. The fiesta evoking image is
shiny and bright, while the dusky illustration conveys notions of tiredness and fear.

31

Summary Reflection
In the first two scenes Skippy is in a desert landscape, twinkling lights hanging from the
adobe buildings and the last one there is an absence of color but it does have rainbow colored
scribbles. In Skippyjon Jones in the Doghouse, Skippy is moving from light into dark with a
shack for a doghouse. What the background tells me is that Skippy is moving from a place of
safety, the lit room, to an unsafe space, the dark room, and the desert with very little resources.
A place that at times may be chaotic, the rainbow scribbles.

Figure 2. Skippyjon Jones y Los Chimichangos

Skippy—Places and Spaces
As the main character, Skippy, when not occupying center of the page, is the focal point
of the Chimichangos. In Figure 1first set of scenes Skippy emulates a tourist in Mexico. He is
having a good time with a sombrero and some maracas a stereotypical American vacationing in
Mexico. In Skippyjon Jones in the Doghouse, Skippy is again just visiting. He is on his
skateboard with his toy riding mouse and cape. In Skippyjon Jones Snow What, he is the center
of the Chimichangos undivided attention and of their colored swirls.

32

Figure 3. Skippito y Los Chimichangos have a fiesta.

Chimichangos
The Chimichangos, Figure 2, are first dancing along with Skippy wearing sombreros and
then sleeping in a pile outside. Then they are living in a shack not resembling a proper home. In
Snow What they are dancing in a crazed circle around Skippy unable to control themselves.
As I survey the scenes and am going through the process of transmediation the story the
illustrations tell is that Skippy is the American ideal, with his white fur and blue eyes. He
represents the blond haired blue-eyed American. He travels from the safety and stability of his
home to Mexico, which is poor country, has very little resources, and at times is fun and chaotic.
Conversely, the Chimichangos do not live in a stable environment. They do not live in the same
place every time Skippy joins them. “Most people in their daily lives do not come into contact
with many persons of radically different race or social station. We converse with, and read
materials written by persons of our own cultures” (Delgado and Stefanic, 57, 2012). The
Chimichangos are poor they are homeless, sleeping outside; poor, living in a colonia; or some
place so unimaginable it cannot even be drawn.

33

Conclusion
Everybody loves a story especially a good story. People love a story where you learn
something not just about yourself but the world around you. Those are the best stories.
Generally, it does not matter who is in it or where it takes place or what language it was
originally written—a good story transcends.
The hope is that well-told stories describing the reality of black and brown lives can help
readers bridge the gap between their worlds and those of others. Engaging stories can
help us understand what life is like for others and invite the reader into a new and
unfamiliar world. (Delgado and Stefanic, p. 71, 2012)
A story that speaks to humanity, the human condition speaks to your soul.
In picture books readers get two things words and illustrations. If readers are lucky and
the publisher/editors are good, there is a seamless union of writer and illustrator. It is a cohesive
story the writer’s vision is complete. But when the artist and the writer as the same person then
you get to see the images the writer envisioned in her or his mind. Those are the most powerful
books out there because you have this semiotics and the images and words. They are cohesive
and meaningful they will touch somebodies heart and soul. However, the meaning readers make
can be problematic because the readers have uniquely different perspectives. Therefore, they
will interpret images and meanings. Such as in Figure 3, where Don Diego and Poquito Tito can
be interpreted as an immigrant parent with a child translator which happens but this is not the
only Mexican story. This was not my lived experience. My parents are literate in English and
are able to communicate effectively.

34

Figure 4. Don Diego, Poquito Tito and Skippyjon Jones

Sometimes the intended meaning is not what is received; this is the problem with Skippy.
Schachner and I have two very different perspectives. I see a story; I try to shield my children.
Sometimes there is a story being told without the writer or illustrator realizing what story they
are telling. The story created speaks to a deeper societal consciousness and sometimes that
deeper truth is not warm and fuzzy. It speaks to current societal fears. It speaks to the fears of a
changing world. When not written inside the hegemony of culture, a story can be powerful too.
It is a story to teach those that speak to the darkness of life those that speak negatively about a
cultural group. It could be to convey messages of Muslims terrorists or Mexicans without
authorization to be here. All Asians are geniuses. All whites are good. They create an untruth
about society because then those people live with ramifications of perpetuated stereotypes.

ESSAY III. LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: REAL AND IMAGINED

38

With this essay, I analyze the language used by Judy Schachner in the Skippyjon Jones
children’s series, to draw out Mexican stereotypes via Mock Spanish acceptable public racist
discourse within the framework of social and language competency. I examine how Spanish is
used with allusion of an insider’s competency? Most importantly what is the metanarrative, the
story behind the story, of Skippyjon Jones? I posit the story is a shallow multicultural view of
Mexican culture based on a Siamese cat’s imagination and the narrative is one of racism.
Mexicans culture is foregrounded into the story. For that reason, I use the term Mexican as a
group identity to describe anyone who originates or descends from Mexico—whether
immigrants today or generations hence. The inhabitants of this imagined world are Chihuahuas
and they come from Mexico, thus the lens of analysis will depart from that cultural vantage
point. Toward that end, I present a summary overview of the texts produced by Schachner.
About the Books
Eight stories or the entire collection of the series show the same pattern. Skippyjon Jones
is playing and gets into trouble or is chastised for his play. Then, he is sent to his room where he
begins his journey into his imaginary closet world or the world of the Chimichangos. He is the
lone adventurer who can stray without concern for he is perceived as competent and able to take
care of himself. Meanwhile Mama Junebug Jones and sisters, Jilly Boo, Jezebel, and Ju-Ju Bee
Jones engage in domestic activities of the home. In the closet, which implies a secret or hidden
world, Skippito goes about having adventures where he forever finds himself as the unwilling
hero who accidentally saves the day. In that climactic moment, he comes back to his real world,
his bedroom. Mama puts him to bed and he reflects his adventure.
In the first book, Skippyjon Jones, Schachner introduces us to Mama Junebug Jones,
Jezebel Jones, Jilly Boo Jones, Ju-Ju Bee Jones, who are supportive characters in Skippy’s real

39

life. Skippy is playing in a birds’ nest when mama sees him and sends him to his room. In the
meantime, Mama and sisters are in the kitchen making lunch. This is where Skippito meets Los
Chimichangos for the first time. We meet Don Diego, Poquito Tito, Rosalita, Pintolito, Tia Mia,
and the antagonist, Alfredo Buzzito. Skippy rescued the frijoles from Alfredo Buzzito and burst
into his real world. Mama hears the commotion. She goes to Skippy. Everything is made right
and he tucked in for the night.
In Skippyjon Jones and the Doghouse, the second book in the series, Skippy colors the
walls of his room. The girls and Mama are aware and comment on Skippy’s notion that he is a
Chihuahua. He is disciplined for his misdeeds and Skippy is again sent to his room and begins
another adventure with Los Chimichangos, whereby Skippy finds a houseful of Chihuahuas
waiting for him. Skippy takes on Bobble-ito for the Chimichangos. Skippito is successful and is
found by Mama and the girls, who have been watching a game show, wrapped in a blanket
playing with a bobble head.
Caught reading “National Leographic” in Skippyjon Jones in Mummy Troubles, Skippy is
and making a mess of his cat box (Schachner, 2006). Here, Skippy returns to a time reminiscent
of ancient Egypt. Skippy, again, becomes the unwitting hero of his adventure obtaining for the
Chimichangos the peas they need from the Under Mundo. Unbeknownst to Skippy, in this book
the sisters join, as goddess Ba, Da, and Bing. The sisters wrap Skippito up like a mummy.
Skippy wakes up frightened and returns home and is calmed by Mama Junebug Jones and goes
to sleep for the evening.
The fourth book in the series, Skippyjon Jones and the Big Bones, has Skippy digging up
Darwin’s bone to take home. This again launches him to embark on another adventure with the
Chimichangos, as Skippy returns to a prehistoric dinosaur inhabited world, while sisters, Ju-Ju

40

Bee, Jezebel, and Jilly Boo watch Darwin sleep. This time, the Chimichangos need Skippy to
get them prehistoric marshmallows. In the process of getting these prehistoric marshmallows he
goes up against T. Mexito. Successful in scaring away T. Mexito, real life comes knocking on
his door in the form of Darwin, showing that Skippito is unsuccessful against Darwin. He is
bumped and bruised in the end but is awakened to the care of Mama.
Skippyjon Jones Lost in Spice takes Skippito to Mars where the Chimichangos aim to
build a pipeline to import chile spice from Earth. The antagonist in this tale is a Martian
doppelganger named Uno Ojo, with whom a tug-o-war ensues between Skippito over his sock
monkey. The resulting banging sounds bring Mama and sisters from the kitchen, where they
have been making supper, to check on his wellbeing. He gets his supper and off he is sent for a
good night’s sleep.
A tiny terrifying teacup Chihuahua is the bully antagonist in Skippyjon Jones Class
Action. In this book, Skippito must stop the school bully for the Chimichangos. Skippy, in his
real world, wants to go to school with dogs. While Mama and the sisters were doing their
chores, Skippy goes off to school. Skippito saves the Chimichangos from the hungry school
bully. Skippito goes back home after a mostly successful day at dog school.
When Skippy’s high wire activities with the squirrels is quashed by Mama in Skippyjon
Jones Cirque de Olé, he runs straight to his imaginary world with the Chimichangos. While
Mama sews ballet costumes for Jezebel, Jilly Boo, and Ju-Ju Bee, Skippito becomes the main
strongman for the Chimichango dog pyramid. Puzti, this book’s antagonist, gets Skippito shot
out of cannon to end this adventure.
In Schachner’s latest book Skippyjon Jones Snow What, Skippito must save princess
Nieve Qué. However, to save the princess he must first get past the dragon. Skippito finds the

41

princess sleeping in the middle of a giant ice cube lake and he must kiss her awake. Mama is
found at the kitchen table completing a crossword puzzle, while the girls play in their room and
Skippy walks up to Mama with an ice cube stuck to his nose.
While these books lend themselves to a study on gender roles in children’s literature. I
chose not to investigate that avenue. However, gender roles in Skippy’s world do warrant a
study at some time in the future.
Covert Linguicism and Racism—Poquitito Españolito
My analysis of Schachner’s books has yielded some compelling results. In her writing,
there is a trend that indicates a resistance to changing identity as she relies on the manipulation
of identity to tell her stories. It is unclear if it is Schachner accounts for the shifts in the nationstate’s shifting demographics or if her aim is to tell a cautionary tale of the hegemonic group’s
unwillingness to yield to Mexican’s influence. The Spanish language use generates interesting
patterns in the use of Mock Spanish as well displays a reliance on diminutive codes by the
dominant culture as a means of talking down to the marginalized Chihuahuas qua Mexicans.
Mock Spanish are words used in English or Spanish to undermine a group of people, in this
instance Mexicans. Mock Spanish yields words with regional or local meaning where two
cultures merge and words such yarda or parquear are the result—neither officially Spanish, or
English. Mock Spanish, as the word implies, is used to mock a group via their language.
Anthropologist Jane Hill (1995a, 1995b, 2008) outlines four
strategies that occur in the borrowing of words from Spanish into Mock Spanish,
as follows:
i. Semantic derogation, in which a positive or neutral Spanish word or phrase
becomes a negative term in Mock Spanish;

42

ii. Euphemism, in which negatively charged words from Spanish are borrowed
into Mock Spanish as euphemisms for their English equivalents;
iii. Affixation of Spanish suffixes to result in non-Spanish forms;
iv. Unabashed mispronunciation and hyper-anglicization of Spanish borrowings.
1 Sometimes added to this is the mocking portrayal of an L1 Spanish
speaker’s pronunciation of English. (Callahan, 2014, p. 203)
The words used may be originating in English or Spanish with the intention of conveying, p.
negative meanings about a group whose language is derided and devalued. However, Mock
Spanish becomes an acceptable form of racist public discourse whereby speakers either ignore
the rules or knowingly use this form of language to communicate. “Speakers of Mock Spanish
may thus produce offensive racialized meanings while simultaneously interpreting
their utterances as a reflection of an open-minded (explicitly nonracist) point of view” (Barrett,
2006, p. 165). Mock Spanish is not the process of using racial epitaphs, it is someone using
micro-aggressive speech to convey a subtler invasive form of racialized language.
Insiders Language Positionality
To place in context my linguistic geography, I begin with my background. I grew up in a
rural Texas town near San Antonio to which I have given the pseudonym, Luz, Texas. This
small rural town is evenly split between Mexicans and Anglos.
In my upbringing, I grew up speaking both English and Spanish until English became my
primary language. Luz has had the capitalist amenities to keep a majority of Mexicans in a
subordinate position for generations. At Luz High School, students are socialized to mirror the
positions they will hold later in life, much like the south Texan rural town described in Learning
Capitalist Culture: Deep in the Heart of Tejas by Douglas Foley. During my growing up years, I

43

was very much aware of my Mexicanidad and how it devalued me. “The status-enhancing
female prizes were the rich, cute Anglos, not the Mexicanas” (Foley, p. 94, 2010). These would
become practices that I would learn and play out.
Religion played a major part as did town expectations as to what behaviors made a good
or bad Mexican girl. My experiences were both typical and atypical. Typical in that I was just
another poor Mexican girl growing up in the barrio. Atypical because I had the intellect to move
beyond predetermined roles in school. I understood the community’s expectations were not high
for me. I will never forget the summer of my high school graduation, when I was asked by the
local grocery market worker if I was planning to enter the work force after graduation. I did not
divulge that had matriculated at University of Texas at Austin and that I was visiting for the
weekend.
The Practice of Doing Culture through Language
This essay examines the Skippyjon Jones collection to date by Judith Schachner who is
from the Northeast. She has created an imaginary world inhabited by Siamese cats and
Chihuahuas. I rely on the texts she has produced to examine the ways in which race and
racialized ethnicity, along with class, become represented in this imaginary world. I argue that
she creates biased and racist environment relying on linguistic devices, as she stereotypes the
characteristics of the Chihuahuas whom she calls Chimichangos—a derisive concept that mocks
food and race with the notions of monkeys and Mexican food, particularly Chimichangas.
Schachner has a flair for use of language and relies on inventive language to illustrate her
views. Also, her continued use of the diminutive –ito and –o , such as Skippito, maskito,
mamalita, contribute to the de-valuation of the Chimichangos, Poquito Tito, Rosalita, Tia Mia,
placing Skippy in superior position

44

When I read the first Skippy book, I noted the ways in which the author plays with words.
With a hmmm, followed by a deep sigh and a puzzled face, I asked my husband: “Hey, let me
read this to you I want your reaction!” His response was, “What are you reading? Followed by
“That’s horrible!” Stooped-shouldered and with a more intense hmmmm, I uttered. “So, it’s not
just me.”
After this exchange, I went to the pile of books; I had some of the other Skippy books in
front of me, such as “Skippy through the ages.” So, thinking they all cannot be the same, I
sorted through the pile, with the hope that maybe they have evolved. They have. But they still
leave me with that uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. After I read and researched every
one of them, I was astounded that there was only one that stepped outside of the pattern. One,
book review in Library School Journal concluded that Skippy was racist, and two letters to the
editor about spoke as to its racial overtones. This affirmed my response to the books.
To illustrate one of the ways in which language is racialized, I examine Spanish and
English distortions used by Schachner, and I illustrate this point with the most egregious
examples, even when they are infrequently used throughout the body of her work. I use,
Callahan (2010) and Hill (2003, 2011) studies that focused on Mock Spanish and argues that the
language used in Skippyjon Jones series, while inherently racist in nature, is a form publicly
acceptable discourse for the dominant society. On the other hand, Hill (1993) argues that the use
of Mock Spanish is covert in nature. Somewhat in-between, I argue that Mock Spanish is overtly
racist to bilingual Spanish speakers and that it is recognized as micro-aggressive speech.
Spanish is a second language for me, although it was the first language I spoke. It is not
my intent to privilege one over the other, rather I am recognizing that English became my
dominant language when Spanish was taken from me upon entering the Texas public school

45

system. As to my Spanish ability, it was purged through my schooling experience. Bored and in
high school, I would reclaim the Spanish language by teaching myself to read based upon those
words I knew in spoken Spanish. I matched the words to the sound to make sense of the words
in front of me. Then I applied what I self-taught in reading to writing. It was nothing
groundbreaking but it was an act of self-determination as I sought to reclaim something I had
lost, as I reveled in my ability to gain these fledgling skills, albeit becoming proficient in the
Spanish language with academic preparation as an undergraduate. Now, although I may dream
in Spanish, English still has dominance but I hold my use of both languages to a high level of
self-scrutiny.
The Process of Studying Skippyjon Jones and His Worlds
As part of my study, I rely on guidelines set by The Council on Interracial Books for
Children [CIBC] (1980). Toward the end, I analyze the illustrations and narrative for commonly
known Mexican stereotypes, as I examine which character is portrayed as a hero and identify
loaded words. In the series, Skippy is the hero. He saves the Chimichangos from Alfred
Buzzito, T. Mexito, and gets them either frijoles or peas from villians as well as the mummy
king. Skippy, the white furred, blue-eyed cat becomes the “standard for success” as indicated in
the pamphlet created by the California Department of Educaiton “Ten Quick Ways to Analyze
Children’s Books for Sexism and Racism” (1998). Furthermore, Los Chimichangos consistently
play deferential roles to Skippy. In, Skippyjon Jones, Skippyjon Jones in Mummy Trouble,
Skippyjon Jones and the Big Bones, and Skippyjon Jones, Lost in Spice, the Chimichangos are
not an integral part of the action. They wait helplessly for Skippy to save them from the sting of
Alfred Buzzito, fear being trampled by dinosaurs, and terrorized await the Martians, or sit while
Skippy is busy retrieving the peas. The one instance where the Chimichangos are an active part

46

of the adventure is when Skippy stole a costume in Skippyjon Jones,Cirque de Olé, then Los
Chimichangos are portrayed as thieves.
Language as a Place of Domination
To examine the world of Skippyjon Jones, I created tables to track the use of Spanish and
English in terms of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. I anticipated finding the high use of the
Spanish diminutives –ito/a, as well as, the use of –o/a added to English words to create Mock
Spanish words. Written primarily in English, I anticipated finding a high use of code switching.
I analyze language trends and drew meaning about how language creates a racialized, classed,
and gendered place in the closet and actual worlds of Skippyjon Jones. I interrogate various
issues of concern: How is language used to subordinate one group over another? Is there a
historical context for this subordination? If so, what are those implications?
To draw conclusions, I read and analyzed each book in the series several times; language
was perhaps the most difficult. Decisions I had to make in my analysis included: Do I apply the
English rule of grammar or the Spanish? Am I privileging one language over another? I thought
about fairness and not being overly critical of a non-native speaker of Spanish. Do I consider
Spanish phrases or analyze them word by word?
Fourteen different categories were isolated and analyzed. Of those categories, ten are
subcategories of a specific form of Mock Spanish, yielding a language world whereby more than
90 percent of the code is a distorted or modified form of the Spanish code. The categories I
relied on to make sense of Skippito’s language are: Correct Use of Spanish, Incorrect Use of
Spanish, Incorrect Use of English, Hyper Anglicized Pronunciation, Diminutive suffix ito/ita
Added to Spanish, Diminutive ito/ita Suffix Added to English, -o/a suffix added to English,
“Holy” (Schachner, 2003) Plus Spanish Word, “very best Spanish accent” (Schachner, 2003),

47

and -ee Representing /i/ in Spanish, code switching, Diminutive Use of a Character’s Name,
Exaggerated Spanish Pronunciation of English Words, and the overall tracking of Mock Spanish.
Language analysis was achieved in four parts: 1) the front matter, 2) idealized
world (beginning), 3) closet world (middle) and 4) return to the idealized world (end). For ease
of discussion it is broken into these distinct part, and compared to the idealized world of the
closet. Because the front matter is unique and needs to be discussed on its own as it sets the tone
for the narrative, stories are discussed in terms of beginning, middle and end for beginning
readers whether it is during story time at a library or in a classroom. Therefore, I followed an
approach traditionally used by adult readers to children. Moreover, I rely on a high level of
scrutiny to the use of English and Spanish in Schachner’s writing. Therefore, when I look at her
correct of use of Spanish, I think of it, first in terms of her use of the English syntactic structure
because that is her mother tongue and I honor her language. Second, I reviewed punctuation in
terms of English rules to assess if the writer and reader is not literate, most likely, she or he will
not understand Spanish punctuation. The third reason is the likelihood of the editor being fully
versed in Spanish. I chose not to problematize those instances pertaining to publication.
Español or Spanish?
However, I did look at correct use of Spanish pragmatics and semantics within the realm
of code switching; it had to make sense and flow for a Spanish reader. For example, Schachner
(2003) wrote “Patricia Ottley, y Julianna Lucre” and “Peña y Kathleen.” In this instance both the
lack of the comma, and the use of the comma before y are acceptable in English. The same is not
true for Spanish; the first example is the correct use of the comma. I counted both of these
instances as correctly used because its use did not change the meaning of the text or cause an
awkward reading of it. In contrast, the phrase “[p]ara mi familia a la A Better” (Schachner,

48

2003) I did not count as correct because, as my former Spanish professor would say, chocan las
palabras or the joining of the languages distort meaning for a Spanish speaker. When
inaccurately used, it causes me to falter and trip over both the languages. I counted the Spanish
correctly where the code switch was fluid despite incorrect punctuation. I note the use of
Spanish as correct when it was spelled correctly and made sense in the sentence. Words such as
guacamole and piñata, which have been accepted into the English language, I counted correctly.
However, I also addressed instance where they may be counted incorrectly. Spanish words were
noted as correct in word-by-word instances.
Names were difficult to reason out as well and I questioned the ways in which they
should be catorgorized. I grew up believing that a person’s name must be honored. My mom
told me most teachers said my name incorrectly. Only one teacher, Mr. Woolls, said my name
correctly. At home I was Mandi, Mandita, when I was in trouble, spoken with the Spanish rules
for pronunciation, but at school I was named by the English rules. However, characters are not
people they are creations of the author. Character’s names have meaning. I would expect a
character with the name such as Salvador or Jesus to have a strong role and be cast as the hero or
the savior of the story, given the cultural signifiers in the name. Therefore, characters’ names in
Spanish were counted correctly when proper names, a commonly accepted use of the diminutive,
and were properly accented. A name that was a double diminutive like Muñequita Betita would
be incorrect. From El diccionario esencial de la Lengua Española the use of the diminutive can
be “[s]uele decirse que los diminuativos están valorados positivamente y que los aumentativos
suelen ser peyortivos. Pero tanto diminutivos com aumetativos puende interpretarse de los do
modos” (2017. p. 718). Essentially while the diminutive is positive. It can also be interpreted as
negative. I thought of all the affectionate names I have been called or have used with a double

49

diminutive. The one that came to mind was Mandita cabroncita, which is not affectionate at all,
when those around me used it I knew I was in trouble—no cuddles and hugs were coming my
way. Words used with affection have been amorcito, cosita, mi negrita/o, morenita, mamita, and
Mandi. The name “Tito” (Schachner, 2003) would be counted as correct but “Poquito Tito”
(Schacher, 2003) is not correct. It means lesser than less or a small amount of something already
small. It could not have been more derisively intended to reduce someone to just above less than
nothing.
Spanish was counted correctly when the codeswitching was fluid, words and names were
accented properly, proper names were used, as well as words that have been co-opted into
English, which were not hyper anglicized. Incorrect Spanish would then follow the opposite
rule; cuando chocan las palabras during a switch in code, as is the case with unaccented or
incorrectly spelled words and names, and hyper anglicized co-opted Spanish words.
English or Inglés
I tracked deviance from Standard English as incorrect. Exceptions were words that
Schachner modified for rhyming or use of affectionate for the kittens. Because the Skippyjon
Jones books series are picture books, I also read them aloud to see how I could interpret the
words orally. However, I do not delve far in-depth into this area, even though I think that it is an
area that could be studied further because many questions arose from this section. After all my
research, I remain with the questions: How do I say the Mock Spanish words? How do I read the
words after there is a shift in language from English to Mock Spanish? Is there a continuation of
using the same exaggerated manner of using speech to devalue or misrepresent a culture or a
people?

50

¿Qué pasa con el English or W’uz Happening with Spanish?s
Front Matter Speaks: The acknowledgements consist of seven lines with approximately
forty-six words that had seven instances of codeswitching, five instances of using Spanish
correctly, followed four instances of using Spanish incorrectly, and two instances of Mock
Spanish using the diminutive for of a name. Thus, Schachner opens the door to this imagined
world of derision and linguicism that sets the stage for a closeted world where Los
Chimichangos remain a hidden people with mixed codes and derided language for the
entertainment of a dominate world where the heroes are white and their language is English.
In this imagined worlds, I argue that code switching, incorrect use of Spanish and the use
of Mock Spanish, set the stage for how language is used in Skippyjon Jones. Codeswitching is a
linguistic topic all its own in which I delve only as it pertains to the narrative of Schchner’s
books. There are arguments for and against code switching and what its use implies about the
abilities of a second language learner. One argument puts forth the notion that the speaker is
unable to master a second language or, on the other hand, speaks to the ability of a bilingual
person to use both languages to convey most effective meaning.
In my lived experience, I have used code switching. As I struggled to regain my fluency
in Spanish, I would switch to English to converse with my grandparents. Now, however, I use
words and phrases at will to convey the most exact meaning, when I am trying to communicate
meaning or emotion. Schachner, I posit, uses code switching as a method of her inability to
function fully in Spanish or covertly devalue a language and a culture to which she is only a
tourist of superficial consumer. She has not cited, in neither her books nor website, that she has
formally studied Spanish in the past or presently, except for its use within the Skippyjon Jones’s
world where it is superficially used. She is isolated from Spanish in its everyday use and within

51

Mexican culture. Her knowledge of Spanish is artificial because at times it is awkward due to
improper use of Spanish or improper use of code switching, which does follow its own set of
rules.
There are those who would argue that her use of the language and the mistakes she makes
are unintended. While possibly unintentional, this lack of honoring another is premised on white
privilege by appropriating and retooling Spanish in her books. Spanish may make an easier
rhyme scheme, may be more fun and playful or possibly because she likes Mexican food, but
these are not sufficient reasons to appropriate and distort a language that is already derided and
devalued in the United States. These representations of language and this usage do not honor the
language or its people but rather mock and disregard Callahan (2010), Hill (1993, 2010). This is
the language of the others.
The suffixes of -ito/-ita and -o/-a fall under the umbrella of Mock Spanish. The two
instances of its use are “El Skippito” (Schachner, 2005) and “Mamalita” (Schachner, 2005).
Pragmatically and semantically, the use of the diminutive sends a mixed message, which I will
address in the narrative analysis part. I bring this up to show the beginning of Schachner’s
overreliance on the diminutive tone as evidence in the fifty-one total instances of its use. For
example, forty-five instances were applied to a character’s name; forty-one of which were used
in the imaginary world; thereby illustrating the hidden and devalued code of Los Chimichangos
in a lesser status.
Analysis of Idealized World
Language use in the idealized world consisted of: sixty-five lines with approximately 373
words, with nine instances of code switching, and eight instances of Mock Spanish. However, in
the first thirty-eight lines there was no use of Spanish or Mock Spanish.

52

Ito p’acá and Ita p’allá
Schachner uses the diminutive form of -ito/a when introducing the protagonist, “Skippito
Friskito” (Schachner, 2005). I offer that this is clear microaggression or a subtle, flies under the
radar word, that creates uncertainty in the reader. “by which they mean one of those many
sudden, or dispiriting transactions that mar the day of women and people of color” (Delgado and
Stefanic, p. 1, 2010). Mock Spanish is used only three times, the “unabashed mispronunciation
and” (Callahan, 2010, p. 203) in this case, the hyper-Spanishization of an English word. “My
ears are to beeg for my head. My head ees to beeg for my body” (Schachner, 2005). The author
mocks the accent of a Spanish-speaker learning English. A Spanish accented English is not
prestigious, unlike a British accented or a French accented English, which are highly valued in
our society. Speakers with such accents are not derided, they are held in high esteem. However,
Spanish accented English is not held in the same regards. Their accented English elicits negative
stereotypes of lesser valued immigrants who are perceived as unwilling to learn the official
language, who are thought of as lazy and supposedly steal jobs. This exaggerated use of ee for
the Spanish /i/ is Schachner’s most egregious use of Mock Spanish. Her linguistic device is not
subtle. It is on your face. A syllogistic argument can be made but the underlying humiliation is
the untold story.
Visible Only in the Closet World
The Closet World contains ninety-three lines with approximately 604 words, it is the
largest section of the story with over fifty instances of Mock Spanish, using the Spanish
diminutive in both English and Spanish, although the majority is in the diminutive use of a
character’s name, which all reflect the names of Los Chimichangos, except in instances when

53

Skippyjon lives in their world. In addition, there are twenty-eight instances of code switching
and forty-five instances of correct use of Spanish.
Up to this point Schachner had only used Skippyjon’s name in the diminutive form. The
majority of the Chimichangos have a diminutive name with the notable exception of Don Diego,
and it is not clear that the name signifies a title of respect because of age or if it is just to identify
one as having authority over the bunch of others—if this were not enough it emulates the
Californio Culture of Zorro. The diminutive form of a person name or nickname is a term of
endearment i.e. Mandita, mijita lindita or mi corazoncito. But when it is used in excess it
becomes pejorative (Foronda, 1994, p. 718). Then Poquito Tito is translated as Little Tito and
the reader never learns whether his name derives from Alberto, Gilberto, or Roberto.
Throughout her books, the Chimichangos remain little, diminished, almost insignificant—littlest
of the smallest for example.
Even though this practice is not in the English language, two suffixes -ita/o and -a/o,
“Skippito,” “indeed-o,” “Buzzito,” and “bangito” are added to the names of the residents in
Schachner’s closet. Also, the exaggerated I, with the use of “ee” appear in such names as
“Bubblebeeto” are two different attributes of Mock Spanish the exaggerated double /e/ and
diminutive suffix. While an argument can be made for rhyme schemes or keeping with the
established rhythm of the story, this is not a process that honors or exemplifies the linguistic
devices of Los Chimichangos aka Mexicans. For example, instead of “Bangito,” “Crashito,” and
“Popito” (Schachner, 2005), Spanish equivalents such ¡Bum! ¡Pum! y ¡Zaz! could have served

Analysis of Reentry of Idealized World
The re-entry to idealized world consisted of: twenty-five lines with approximately 130
words had zero references of Mock Spanish. There was 1 instance of incorrect Spanish.
The most striking trend in this section is the correct us of Spanish. “Hola muchachitas,”
“Buenas noches, amigos,” and “piñata” (Schachner, 2005). However, the grammatical rules of
English are applied. The times Schachner uses Spanish correctly it was for words that already
adopted into English, such as guacamole, piñata, and Chihuahua. Also, Spanish proper nouns
include names in their diminutives.
As talented as Schachner is, one can argue that she needs to find another device in
English or represent Spanish authentically. Adding Spanish suffixes does not elevate the
Spanish used in these texts, it diminishes its importance to the dominant culture further
reinforcing the racialized notions of those who speak a language other than English.
