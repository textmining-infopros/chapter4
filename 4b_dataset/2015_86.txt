This dissertation was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation through
the Bridging Spaces for Learning in Urban Extended Spaces grant (BLUES; Cyberlearning
1341882) and by Peabody College at Vanderbilt University and the Department of Teaching
and Learning.
This entire project would not have happened without the support of the Metro Public
Library. I was fortunate to be entering my third year of doctoral work when the library received
its own grant to pursue the development of its learning lab for youth. Tamara Benson and Dan
McWilliams were critical in helping me develop Metro: Building Blocks. Without their support,
the program never would have succeeded. Once the program got up-and-running, I met some
fantastic teens. I’m thankful for the energy they brought each day we met, their playfulness,
and their desire to be a part of something new and different at the library.
I will never be able to thank Kevin Leander enough for his friendship, guidance, time,
support, encouragement and more. He gave me the freedom to run with some wild ideas,
never pushing me down one path or another. He opened up a number of opportunities for me,
as well, including chances to write, chances to present, and chances to connect with people,
both in Metro and beyond. As students, we’re often (some: always) caught up in the learning
that happens in the classroom—and my courses with Kevin were great—but I really learned
from him in the interstitial spaces, so to speak—through texts messages, or over beer, or in a
group meeting. My research questions for this dissertation were initially scribbled on a bar
napkin. The opportunities to watch Kevin work through ideas in SLaM meetings were

iii

invaluable. Not everyone gets those opportunities. While never heavy-handed, Kevin has
always been there for me—often nudging me in a direction, making me think it was my idea.
Jedi-mind tricks.
Rogers Hall has also made a profound impact on me. Rogers consistently modeled how
cool this job is. His excitement about ideas was contagious, teaching me the importance of
“riffing” on ideas, playing with them, tweaking them. The freedom to think big has been
invaluable—never would have thought that I’d be throwing GPS devices on Mormon
missionaries and studying their spatiotemporal learning trajectories my second year. Rogers
also managed to support me throughout my time at Vanderbilt in numerous ways. He opened
up the financial support for me to think about and write this dissertation; he created solo
teaching opportunities for me; and he managed to let me co-teach with him, too, another way
for me to learn and work right alongside him. Rogers taught me that advisors want their
thinking pushed by their students just as much as they want to push their students thinking—an
important lesson that I take with me into the future.
Andy Hostetler has been an invaluable mentor and friend since he arrived at Vanderbilt.
Our 10:00 a.m. walks not only got us some FitBit points, but also opened spaces for
conversations both professional and personal. Andy was always there to listen—and to give
advice—throughout my dissertation writing and job search. The time we spent co-teaching
Human Geography was an absolute highlight and certainly helped me find my identity at
Vanderbilt as a teacher. While I’m sad to leave him, Claire, and Carter, I’m excited to see how
our friendship grows in the future.

iv

I was fortunate to get to know Jay Clayton throughout my time at Vanderbilt. Among
many other things, he has modeled how to make change at the university level by bringing
together both the local and academic communities. I presented some early work at the Mellon
Institute in Digital and Public Humanities Conference, which he organized. Getting some initial
positive feedback from Jay meant a lot to me at the time, as the idea of a dissertation was still
incredibly daunting.
Despite being on my third page of acknowledgements already, I’m just getting to the
person who may have had the biggest impact on my intellectual development. Christian Ehret
and I spent countless hours writing, arguing, cutting, imagining, thinking, handstanding (me),
presenting, debating, and more. We got our first publications together. I married him and Lea.
During that time, we also grew an incredible amount, recognizing the weaknesses in our
thinking and improving upon them over time. We developed a fantastic partnership, knowing
when to poke and prod ideas, when to let them simmer, and when to just walk-talk it out.
Christian constantly encouraged—and challenged—me. I’m thankful for the time we’ve had
here at Vanderbilt together and look forward to how our collaborations from afar take shape.
I was lucky to be sandwiched in between old-SlaM and new SLaM-BLUES members
(with BriSL somewhere in there, too). Jasmine Ma, Katie Taylor, and Nate Phillips guided and
supported me those first few years. I owe many of my ideas to the work they had begun prior
to my arrival. Secretly, I like to pretend that Katie’s dissertation and my own exist in the same
scholarly universe. Nate has been another model for me throughout my time here. He always
made time for me both at Vandy and then while up at UIC, listening to my questions, thoughts,
and fears. I had to lean on Nate every step of the way, from what I should wear to my first

v

conference (jeans and a sportcoat were fine, he said) to how to negotiate a job offer (ask for as
much money as possible! Nah, he didn’t say that).
Newcomers to SLaM, Alvin Pearman, Jen Kahn, Ben Shapiro, and Lara Heiberger, have
filled the void left by Jasmine, Nate, and Katie—as much as possible. I’m thankful for their
willingness to talk out ideas and to let me share some of what I’ve learned along the way, too. I
can’t wait to see where they go from here. I’m especially thankful for the friendship Alvin and I
have developed, the prolonged handshakes/daps we share each morning, and the drawings
his kids leave for me when I’m not in the office and they stop by to visit.
The faculty in the Department of Teaching and Learning have always been supportive
and willing to guide me in numerous ways. Bridget Dalton and Debbie Rowe really introduced
me to research both formally and informally. Our Multimodal Composition Research Group was
such a positive entry-point into this life. Simple feedback by Doug Clark my first year let me
know I was in the right place. Melissa Gresalfi took me on her first semester at Vanderbilt for an
independent study. I’m thankful for that experience, as well as her advice throughout my time
here. Ideas for this dissertation developed in a course with Marcy Singer-Gabella. I’m thankful
for her feedback as I took a spatial approach to teaching as a social practice. The layout of the
Wyatt Center put me in close proximity to Leona Schauble and Rich Lehrer. While we never
worked directly together, there were a number of times that I popped my head in to one of
their offices to ask them quick (or long!) questions. I’m grateful for their mentorship and care in
those moments. Cliff Hofwolt was also in that same suite and I always valued our conversations.
I had some fantastic opportunities to work with our pre-service teachers. Melanie
Hundley was always taking care of me, finding opportunities for me that fit my strengths,

vi

interests, and personality. Had she not brought Andy Hostetler and me together, my time here
would have been quite different. Barb Stengel also consistently watched out for me, checking
in on what I wanted to teach, and making it happen. Kris Neal was always there to offer some
words of wisdom and comfort. Trapper Baum always kept things positive!
The cohort I entered the program with was so critical in those first years. I never would
have survived Stats without Summer Wood and Jin-Sil Mock. Liz Self has always amazed me,
seemingly making the right comment at the right time. I always valued her perspective. Gokul
Krishnan was always fun to think and imagine alongside. Sam David and I took hacky-sack
breaks together when the weather was nice and the time was right. Adrian Larbi-Cherif has
been a great friend and yoga buddy. Robin Jocius has been there through it all and I’m so
grateful for her friendship, insights, and willingness to read anything Christian and I were
working on.
Shout out to Mark Pacheco! He introduced me to Shakti Yoga, which likely gave me the
physical and mental break that helped me complete this dissertation through ujaiyi breathing. I
always looked forward to getting to yoga early just to catch up and talk. And Grant van Eaton
was a constant source of support. Many more years of friendship ahead!
I always loved getting out of my pod and talking to people other than myself. Jackie
Griffin, obviously, kept me on track, asking when my “paper would be done” pretty much
every morning at 8:00 AM on the dot. Ron White also gave me welcome breaks each day. JJ
Street and I had some great fantasy football conversations. Angie Saylor, Brenda Jones, Sandra
Uti, Lee Druce, Michael Kokdynsky, and Shawn Blomker took care of so many things behindthe-scenes.

vii

Many friends, old and new, supported me in different ways throughout my time at
Vanderbilt. I was lucky to move in with one of my best friends, Ian Prunty, upon coming to
Metro. Through him, I got to meet Chris Song, too, whose friendship really eased me into that
first year. Alex Teece and Michal Nowicki were always in my head in some way, either calling
me Uncle or Professor. Steve Haraguchi, Sally Sorte, Taylor Kanzler, and Kristin King also firmly
believed that I had plenty of good ideas to offer. Their confidence in me meant a lot to me.
Sam and Lauren Pearcy were always thoughtful in checking in on how things were progressing.
Remi Holden, who I had the chance to connect with at DML, instantly became a collaborator
and friend. He helped me see that other people were thinking along the same lines as me and
helped me find the language to describe what I was even doing! I’m thankful for our
conversation that started over beers in Boston and has continued onward since then. Also,
thanks to Stephanie McCullough for initially meeting with me to help me think through some of
these ideas.
My immediate family has always let me follow my passions. My mom, Pat Adams, has
always, always believed in me. I’m thankful she brought AJ Adams into my life, who has
become such an incredible father-figure to me. My brother, Scott Clark, is a tremendous model
of the efforts one can go to in order to be there for family. My dad Robert S. Hollett, worked
tirelessly to give me a comfortable life. His death long ago set me on the path that I’m on
today.
I also lucked into an amazingly supportive family. I’ve always been thankful that I could
talk to Charlie Babbs about my work. He always asked for status updates and thoughtfully
responded. Pat Babbs has done so much for every other aspect of my life that it made the

viii

academic side much easier. Karen calls her a saint and I’m pretty sure it’s true. I’ve appreciated
Janice and KC Dyer’s words of encouragement, as well as those of Eric and Sarah Babbs.
Finally, Karen. Karen has been such a beautiful presence in my life day-in and day-out.
She is a caring, compassionate, gentle soul. She is a constant reminder of just how good we all
can be.

PRO LO GUE

This dissertation really began when I was a high school English teacher. In my
Expository Writing class, I had a student named Kervin (all names and places throughout this
dissertation are pseudonyms). Kervin typically sat towards the back of the classroom,
sunglasses on (it was Hawai’i), arms crossed, one iPod earbud inserted into his ear, the other
dangling. Kervin was never disruptive, never rude: he just didn’t care about breaking down
ethos, pathos, and logos in some political speech.
But then one day I brought up the video game Halo 2 in class and things changed. That
night, I got home to find an e-mail from Kervin. He had sent me a quick message about how
much he loved Halo 2 and attached a self-produced video of him playing with a group of
friends. I was shocked when I watched it. This guy who had never said a word in class, was now
leading a full-blown raid, commanding teammates which direction to attack, who should shoot
where, calling out those who weren’t pulling their weight. There was something so jarring
about this Kervin versus the one I knew—the loud, authoritative voice; the energy; the wellexecuted strategy and tactics. It hurt to know that this Kervin was dying to come out all day,
but instead that Kervin had to sit through four, ninety-minute block periods—likely with his
arms crossed, shades on, earbud dangling.
Kervin has stayed with me throughout my doctoral program. I could not shake that
video and the learning that likely surrounded it: the textual resources he accessed to develop
his expertise, the videos he watched and re-watched to hone his skills, the time he spent
practicing, critiquing, and analyzing his gameplay. So, I took my reflections on Kervin with me

1

to Vanderbilt. When observing student teachers in high school ELA classrooms, I saw more
Kervins at every school I visited. Silent, lethargic classrooms would become energized, filled
with noise the second the bell rang. Instead of putting earbuds in when class finished, students
were pulling them out to finally talk with friends.
That first year in my doctoral program, thanks to the generous support of my university,
I had the opportunity to attend the Digital Media and Learning Conference in Long Beach, CA.
In the Digital Media and Learning community I found like minded-scholars who were exploring
youth’s interest-powered practices—like gaming—and seeking ways to make greater
connections between informal learning settings, like libraries, and more formal ones, like
schools. Initially, this group was looking to better understand how teens were hanging out,
messing around and geeking out in places like virtual worlds and social networks. Later, they
would put forth guiding principles for interest-powered learning settings, detailing both how it
emerges in-the-wild, as well as how to design settings to promote it: they called it connected
learning.
With the support of the MacArthur Foundation, the digital media and learning
community began to take off: a research hub ran out of the University of California-Irvine; the
conference grew, spreading beyond academics and toward the inclusion of teachers, librarians,
and museum directors. Importantly, the MacArthur Foundation financially supported the
development—and spread—of digital media learning labs, similar to YouMedia, which had
been successful in Chicago. They opened a call for proposals for libraries and museums to
jumpstart these labs. Tamara Benson, emerging technologies administrator at the Metro Public

2

Library, put in an application. My advisor, Kevin Leander, supported her. They got the money.
They brought me in to begin brainstorming what this learning lab could feature.
By December of 2012, we had 12 local high school students who were going to help us
design this lab. At its core, the lab would have four guiding spaces—one dedicated to making,
one to gaming, another to music production, and another to writing. After twelve-weeks,
meeting once-per-week, we had designed The Studio @ MPL.
But even before The Studio was built, I had a number of questions I wanted to explore.
What would programming look like at The Studio? What does learning look—and feel—like
when it is powered by youth’s own interests? When it is bound neither by a single setting nor
arbitrary temporalities? How would it provide authentic learning opportunities beyond the
cultural representatives from the Japanese consulate or falcon trainers from the zoo who
currently visited? How could it make connections to school, but not become school?
I wanted to answer these kinds of questions. In the summer of 2013, Kevin and I
proposed to Tamara that she let me pilot the kinds of programming that could operate out of
The Studio. She agreed to it. So, founded on the principles of connected learning, I designed a
program called Metro: Building Blocks. Through it, participants would use the video game
Minecraft to take on authentic urban planning challenges in their city. I ran the program from
January-June of 2014.
Kervin, however, never left my mind. I created Metro: Building Blocks for someone like
him. Designed with the principles of connected learning, I sought to create a program that was
interest-powered, academically-oriented and that supported opportunities for civic
engagement. It was for the kids who got fired up the second they left the classroom; the kids

3

who mastered video games, shared tips, looked up cheats, and produced their own videos; it
was for the rage-quitters and the yellers, the strategists, the designers, the n00bs, the loners,
and the tinkerers alike. It was for the kids who didn’t need to sit in a class for 90 minutes
mastering rhetorical concepts like ethos/pathos/logos when they already mastered them by
arguing with friends why Halo was better than Call of Duty. Furthermore, it was a program that
employed kids’ own interests to give them the opportunity to be the experts, to connect their
expertise across settings, like home, school, and the library, and to put it on display, sharing,
reviewing, and critiquing with peers and adults alike. It gave them the opportunity to expand
disciplinary practices from the likes of social studies (and to my surprise, math and science)
beyond those 90-minute block periods. It provided an opportunity to participate in forms of
civic engagement that didn’t necessarily culminate with a presentation to adults.
Of course, questions often just lead to more questions. In terms of interests: What does
interest-powered learning really mean? How do interests ebb-and-flow? Or splinter off toward
other, new interests? In terms of academics: What are “academics” at the library? And why am
I creating this (false) dichotomy of school/not-school, or formal/informal, instead of following
the movements and circulations through them? In terms of civic engagement: How do we
understand civic engagement when it cuts across digital and physical spaces? To what degree
can it operate across various scales?
In beginning to think through all of these questions, I was continuously struck by
moments of intensity—shouts, groans, lulls—and how they were related to interests, to
academics, and to civic engagement. In the end, I always kept this quip by Deleuze (1990) in

4

mind: “It’s easier to remember a gesture or a laugh than a date” (p. 83). I hope you keep it in
mind, too, as you read.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRO DUCTIO N

In his lectures on school and society, Dewey (1899/1998) advocates for the need for a
connective approach to learning, especially in the design of relational, “unified” learning
settings. To do otherwise, he writes, is a waste. His discussion of waste in education, for
instance, asserts that school is “itself an institution, in relation both to society and to is own
members—the children” (p. 40). While he hints at potential waste regarding finances, or
objects, Dewey’s overt concern is vitriolic: the most egregious waste that school produces “is
that of human life, the life of the children while they are at school, and afterward because of
inadequate and perverted preparation” (p. 41). Dewey stresses the importance of a school’s
organization to reduce that waste. And organization, he states, “is nothing but getting things
into connection with one another” (p.43). To connect, he argues, is to “call attention to
isolation,” to stitch together the school system that has, over time, fractured itself into various
schools (e.g. primary, grammar, technical) with diverse emphases (e.g. culture, discipline,
utility). While Dewey adds the caveat that not “all of the isolation, all of the separation…still
persists” (p. 43), he is clear: “one must recognize that [different parts of the school system]
have never yet been welded into a complete whole” (p. 43).
Dewey suggests how to “unite the whole.” To do so means expanding one’s focus
beyond the school. Failing to expand this focus reinvigorates the kind of “artificial unity” that
stems from confining one’s “gaze to the school system itself.” To unite the whole, then, means
to take the school system “as a part of the larger whole of social life” (p. 44). Dewey represents

6

his take on a school system that “unites the whole” by depicting movement between various
learning venues (Figure 1-1).

Figure 1-1. Dewey’s portrayal of movement in-and-out of school.

To weld together the different parts of the school system, Dewey calls for mobility, for
movement, flow, between the home, school, and community. And part of that movement
stems from the integration of youth interests, or the “experiences he gets outside the school.”
From the viewpoint of the child, he writes:
the great waste in the school comes from his inability to utilize the experiences he gets
outside the school in any complete and free way within the school itself; while, on the
other hand, he is unable to apply in daily life what he is learning at school. That is the
isolation from school—its isolation from life. (p. 46)
Dewey delivered that lecture in 1899. Today, educators and researchers alike continue to
contend with the isolation of school, both spatially and temporally. Lemke (2004), for instance,
reiterates Dewey’s frustrations:
Classrooms are very small, cramped, over-crowded spaces that can afford not much
resource of place for more than conversation, reading, writing, and a few simple

7

activities with not very interesting materials. They were designed for mass education on
the cheap at a time when education was mostly about basic literacy and not much else.
Each room and subject and age-grade is cut off from the others, and all are cut off from
the authentic communities of practice in the rest of society for which education is said,
not very credibly, to prepare us. In time, each lesson is divided from those logically
connected to it by at least 24 hours, the duration of any activity is limited to 40 minutes,
topics change radically every few weeks, extended projects cannot continue beyond a
few months, and the critically important relationships between teachers and students
are arbitrarily terminated after much less than one year. This design and its familiar
chronotopes works against everything we know and value about significant learning.
(n.p.)
Lemke’s language resonates with (temporal) isolation—learning is repeatedly “cut off.”
Educators and researchers have made significant efforts to “unite the whole,” though. A
growing number of scholars—from learning and literacy to media and communication
studies—are exploring learning as a series of boundary-crossings within and across social
spaces (e.g. home, school, virtual communities) and temporalities. This stream of research
follows youth’s learning across ecologies (Barron, 2006), trajectories (Wortham, 2006) and
networks ( Leander & Lovvorn, 2006). In doing so, these scholars follow cultural theorists who
describe contemporary life in terms of “flows” (Appadurai, 1996) or as a “networked society”
(Castells, 2011). Echoing Dewey, such approaches research and promote learning as a holistic
experience that bridges formal and informal, embodied and digital, school and community
settings. These forms of boundary-crossing are an initial effort for both educators and
researchers to break free from this “straightjacket of container thinking” (Thrift, 2003, p. 100).
A contemporary arbiter for this holistic experience is connected learning (Ito et al., 2013).
The connected learning framework advocates broadened access to learning that is interestpowered, peer-supported and oriented toward academic, economic, or civic opportunity (p. 4).
Learning with and through digital media constitutes its core. Key features of the connected

8

paradigm include learning that develops through a shared purpose, is production-centered,
and openly-networked.
Dewey—in his own time—called for connected learning. To alleviate isolation, he urged
accessibility, transparency, and extensibility, envisioning learning that not only cut across
settings, but that also tapped into the “experiences [students] get outside the school”—their
interests. In terms of contemporary forms of connected learning, this means that barriers for
entry are low for participants as they pursue those interests. As such, participants should be
able to connect to people and institutions across various settings (e.g. home, library, school)
and across various technical platforms (e.g. mobile, PC, game device). Critically, settings
(physical and digital) should maintain an open-door policy while simultaneously leveraging
digital platforms that create permeable boundaries. Thus crucial components of connected
learning become the need for cross-institutional networks, the possibility for multiple points of
entry, and, finally, open access for participants to resources, tools and materials.
And yet, as education researchers aim to cast off that straight-jacket of container
thinking—traversing into spaces like libraries and virtual worlds—there are still a number of
overarching questions regarding the dynamic processes of learning: What happens at the
contact zones between one setting and another? How do learners make, or produce, their own
places of learning? What are the spatiotemporal dynamics within and beyond these places,
including their rhythms, tempos, spikes and lulls? And moreover, what research methods move
with and follow the dynamic processes of learning that become entangled with policies,
material objects, physical bodies, and texts (Leander, Phillips & Taylor, 2010). This dissertation
makes theoretical and methodological contributions towards answering those questions.

9

Furthermore, aligned with these questions regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics of
learning, this dissertation takes quite seriously connected learning’s emphasis on interestpowered learning. Specifically, it draws on theories of place, mobility, and affect, to understand
how youth’s interests initiate—how they spark— within and across connected learning venues.
Then, it questions how interests move and circulate, especially towards academic and civic
opportunities. In the end, it argues that these interest-powered engagements evince forms of
place-making by learners: the affectively-charged negotiation and subsequent transformation
of place for personal enrichment.
Guiding Contribution: Affectively-charged place-m aking
I began this dissertation with an interest in exploring how informal, media-rich settings,
like those emerging at public libraries, could employ digital media to foster both learning
opportunities as well as a deeper sense of community for youth. To explore these questions, I
designed, and facilitated, a youth-serving connected learning program at the Metro Public
Library (MPL). This program served as a prototype for the kinds of programming the library
could run for youth in its future digital media learning lab: Studio @ MPL. The program was
called Metro: Building Blocks (MBB). It challenged teen participants to build authentic areas in
the city of Metro within the familiar video game Minecraft. I designed the program in the fall
of 2013. Then, I ran the program, and collected data, from January through June of 2014. I
elaborate further on MBB in chapter three.
In creating MBB, I wanted youth interests to drive the program, to have teens pull on
their own experiences in both physical (e.g. embodied) spaces and in digital (e.g. gaming)
spaces. To understand what moves in-and-out of this setting, this dissertation relies on—and

10

has a deep commitment to—theories of place (Cresswell, 2014; Ingold, 2011; Massey, 1991,
2005; Tuan, 1977). While I further flesh out what I mean by place in chapter two, I align most
heavily with Ingold’s (2011) conception of the meshwork as place. The meshwork, he writes,
consists of “lines of growth issuing from multiple sources” which become
comprehensively entangled with one another, rather like the vines and creepers of a
dense patch of tropical forest, or the tangled root systems that you cut through with
your spade every time you dig the garden. What we have been accustomed to calling
‘the environment’ might, then, be better envisaged as a domain of entanglement. It is
within such a tangle of interlaced trails, continually ravelling here and unravelling there,
that beings grow or ‘issue forth’ along the lines of their relationships. (p. 71)
Place, per Ingold, is not a bound environment, but rather an entanglement produced through
“interlaced trails.”1 In Being Alive (2011), Ingold references a Kenyan Acacia tree to illustrate,
quite literally, the “tangled root system” of place (Figure 1-2).

Ingold’s conception of “meshworking” is not unlike Engeström’s conception of “knotworking”
(Engestrom, 1993; Engeström, Engeström, & Vähäaho, 1999). Two components of the meshwork stand
out for my purposes: 1) Ingold does not emphasize the meshwork itself; rather, he draws attention to the
lines of movement coursing through it. 2) By focusing on lines, he not only underscores movement, but
the ways in which those lines push forth and connect to other “meshworks,” or other places. In his take
on “wildfire activities,” Engeström (2008) cites Ingold (2007) to introduce new forms of thinking about
mobility, likely finding resonance with Engeström’s own previous depiction of the knotwork as “rapidly
pulsating, distributed and partially improvised orchestration of collaborative performance between
otherwise loosely connected actors and activity systems” (1999, p. 346-347).

Rather than an individual tree, as depicted in Figure 1-1, with its own bound environment—
consisting, say, of bark, branches, and leaves—Ingold pulls back the scope viewing this Acacia
tree, revealing the many lines which cut across and through it, including root systems, animal
(and human) pathways, and more (Figure 1-3).

2

Overall, this is visually rich dissertation. I employ a number of figures to help tell my story. I especially
lean on (multiple) images to carry weight in my analyses because of the representational constraints of
the dissertation-as-genre. I often turn to comics to represent movement of activity and discourse within
and across the real virtual setting.

12

Figure 1-3. The Acacia tree, connected by lines of animals, nature, humans, and more.

In adopting this anthropological construct for educational research, I began to ask: What
happens when I view learning not as occurring within a bound “environment” but as moving
throughout a “domain of entanglement”? When I see lines of movement “raveling here and
unravelling there” from school, home, the city, online affinity spaces, and more? When I view
learners, programming, and myself as issuing forth “along the lines of their relationships”?
Two additional concepts related to place helped me see (and sense) these lines of
movement: mobility and affect. In following movement, I found resonance with the “new
mobilities paradigm” (Hannam, Sheller, & Urry, 2006). The new mobilities paradigm
emphasizes that all places are tied together in, at least, thin networks of connections. As a
result, the paradigm challenges social science research that is a-mobile—both theoretically and
methodologically. It seeks out fluidity as opposed to fixed, contained, territories. Still,
throughout my analytic process, I became less concerned with what was moving and more

13

intrigued by why it moved: What pushed a participant to follow a new idea or interest? What
pulled her in? I began to attune myself to the affective intensities reverberating throughout the
regular activities within MBB. I doing so, I began to respond to the methodological call for
researchers of mobilities to “position movement, rhythm, force, energy, or affect as primitives
or registers that may be of equal importance when understand the unfolding of events”
(Merriman, 2014).
The more I moved with—and was moved by—my data, the more I got caught up in the
tangle, however. I kept coming back to Massey’s (2005) query: “And yet, if everything is
moving, where is here?” (p. 138). When learning is supposedly connected, bringing together
disparate settings—including home, school, and library—how do learners wrestle with those
disparate lines, or “stories?” Within all of that movement, how does learning coalesce? How do
learners bundle together disparate, distributed space-times into one setting? How do learners
make a here, now? To help answer these questions, I drew on emerging understandings of
place-making. That is, I sought to understand how learners place-make for their own learning. I
refer to place-making as the affectively-charged negotiation and subsequent transformation of
place for personal enrichment. In chapter two, I further describe how place, affect, and mobility
come together through place-making (Figure 1-4).

14

Figure 1-4. Place-making at the intersection of theories of place, mobility, and affect.

Committed to the connected learning design principles which I had adopted, I then
began to follow three guiding strands of MBB: 1) Interest-powered learning that promotes 2)
academic opportunity and 3) civic engagement. While these are certainly not the only lines
knotting up in the meshwork of MBB, they do offer a way forward in terms of how youth
employ digital media to transform the place of their learning for their own personal enrichment
(Figure 1-5).

recognition of others crossing through as well.
Overview: From Pathways to Place-m aking
At its broadest, this dissertation investigates the connected learning experiences of
youth participation in a video game-based program within and beyond a public library setting.
While it aligns with previous educational research that calls for “thick and multi-stranded”
learning networks (Barron, 2006), this dissertation is particularly wary of, and concerned with,
discourse that accumulates learning settings for youth. That is, discourse that calls for transspatial (Steinkuehler & Squire, 2009) learning for youth without attention to the affective and
spatiotemporal dimensions of learning that move within—and stretch beyond—those settings.
Specifically, this accumulative discourse is exemplified by language such as learning pathways
(Ito et al., 2013):
Young people can have diverse pathways into connected learning. Schools, homes,
afterschool clubs, religious institutions, and community centers and the parents,

16

teachers, friends, mentors and coaches that young people find at these diverse locales,
all potentially have a role to play in guiding young people to connected learning. (p. 8)
Informal learning settings—like libraries and virtual worlds—increasingly proliferate youth’s
learning pathways. And as they do, there continues to be pressing need to interrogate not
what youth learn in those settings—but how youth learn within and across them: how youth
interests develop and expand, how youth make meaning and experience feelings, how youth
not only cumulate but also calibrate other space-times into that learning, especially for both
academic and civic purposes. That is, how do participants place-make for their own learning?
Chapter Breakdown
Throughout this dissertation, I draw on theories of place, mobility, and affect to
understand the ways in which youth place-make for learning.
⁃

In chapter two, I bring together literature that has sought to describe learning that
traverses across settings. I detail the geographic conception of “setting” of four
dominant approaches to learning across settings. Then, I extend this literature,
bolstering it through emerging theories of place, mobility, and affect. In the end, I put
forth my approach to place-making.

⁃

My third chapter describes my methods. I first provide an initial overview of Minecraft.
For contextual purposes, I link Minecraft to literature of virtual worlds (Pearce, 2009).
From there, I describe my history at the Metro Public Library, further detailing the
design of Metro: Building Blocks, including descriptions of the setting, the participants,
and my role as a mentor and designer. Moreover, because my subject matter is mobile,

17

my methods are as well—thus I offer an expanded focus on mobile methodologies and
analyses.
⁃

Chapters four through six detail my findings. I blend theories of place, mobility, and
affect to explore first the ways in which interests spark, move and circulate (chapter 4). I
then give further texture to connected learning’s broad conceptions of “academics”
(chapter 5) and “civic engagement” (chapter 6) by depicting the ways in which both
academics and civic engagement are “splayed out and unfolded” (Doel, 1999, p. 7),
how they, too, move and circulate within and beyond the experience of Metro: Building
Blocks.

⁃

Chapter seven brings these analytical sections together through an overarching focus
on place-making, which I will continue to define as the affectively-charged negotiation
and subsequent transformation of place for personal enrichment. I then tease out
specific implications of this dissertation for mentors and designers hoping to develop
connected learning program in spaces like libraries. I conclude by examining the title of
this dissertation, questioning what it means to remap youth learning geographies.

Research Q uestions
This dissertation refines three of connected learning’s guiding principles: 1) interestpowered learning that is 2) academically-oriented and that 3) promotes political, or civic,
opportunity (Figure 1-6).

18

Figure 1-6. This dissertation first targets connected learning’s overarching emphasis on
interest-powered learning, and refines its focus on academics and civic opportunity.

To refine these principles of connected learning, this dissertation poses the following
questions:
Interest-powered learning: How are learners affected, or moved, toward interest-powered
learning opportunities? And how do interests move and circulate in service of learning?
Addressing this first set of questions is to take on the challenge put forth by Barron (2006), one
that has not yet, to date, been fulfilled:
We need to know more about the interpersonal micro-interactional processes and
affective processes that support interest development; for example, the role of
enthusiasm expressed by friends and family for a topic or artifact, or the excitement felt
when students employ their newfound knowledge in the context of their designs or
when they gain insight into a complex idea. (p. 219)
Barron’s call for attention to “micro-interactional” moments and “affective processes” signifies
a shift from tracing locations of learning and toward the lines of learning, how they move and

19

become entangled—what I develop as affective, emergent, always (un)folding, becoming,
enlivening (and deadening) lines. Such an analysis, I argue, offers a greater appreciation of
learning opportunities made available at disparate settings, from homes to libraries, to virtual
worlds and museums.
Academically-oriented: What is the topography of learning within an informal, media-rich
setting, and what vocabulary can describe the ways in which it takes form? In addressing this
second set of questions, I contemplate what entails “academics” within connected learning
settings. Rather than isolating static instances of so-called “academics,” I trace the relief of
activity within this setting—following its contours—to illuminate when, and how, learning
opportunities arise. To do so, I refine analytical approaches to movement and mobility through
an explicit emphasis on rhythm.
Civic opportunity: How does civic engagement, or opportunity, move and circulate
during participation in this game-based program? This chapter interrogates the spatiotemporal
contours—the variability—of youth civic engagement within and beyond my connected
learning setting. It questions the imagined geographies (Leander Phillips & Taylor, 2010) of
youth political participation, calling for connected learning approaches to foster civic
engagement opportunities that move across space, time, and scale. I refer to civic engagement
that extends across space, time, and scale as civic geographies.

20

CHAPTER TW O
LITERATURE REVIEW

From Learning Across Settings to Place-m aking for Learning
I begin this chapter with a brief survey of literature that has both empirically and
theoretically argued for the ways in which learning accrues across settings, over time. Four
approaches to learning across settings guide the front-end of this chapter, with Leander,
Phillips & Taylor’s (2010) review of the “changing spaces of learning” acting as an anchor text.
Their work considers the relation of learning to space and place, challenging “classroom-ascontainer” discourses of where—and when—learning occurs that dominate educational
research. I first bring together the three expansive metaphors that Leander and colleagues
deploy—place, trajectories, and networks—under the term learning geographies. Then, I
consider alternative efforts that have also sought to understand key characteristics of learning
across settings over time: cultural learning pathways (Bell, Bricker, Reeve, Zimmerman, & Tzou,
2013), learning lives (Erstad, 2013; Erstad, Gilje, Sefton-Green, & Vasbø, 2009), and connected
learning (Ito et al., 2013). Table 2-1 distills the geographic vision of each approach. This review
alights on the need for further interrogations of how learners integrate, or bring together,
experiences and resources from those disparate space-times. That is, rather than a chain (or
pathway) of connected settings, I consider the nexus of relations with other locales that aid
learners in their making of a place of learning.
Places of learning “have distinctive qualities about them that ‘recruit’ or draw learners to
them” (Leander, Phillips & Taylor, 2010, p. 336). To understand those qualities, the back-end of

21

this chapter draws on theories of place, mobility, and affect that, together, culminate in the
potential for place-making. I call for further attention to affective experiences within these
places of learning, or the ways in which learners are drawn toward, or captured, by a topic or
activity. The affective experience of learning calls attention to the mobility, or movement, of
multiple sensations—bursts of energy, lulls of boredom, shouts of joy or frustration—and how
those sensations move and circulate across settings. Furthermore, attention to these affective
dimensions of learning targets the various components, or “bodies,” that learners mobilize to
power interest, to shape engagement—physically co-present participants, virtual avatars,
songs, and more. This bundling together, I argue, aligns with an emerging understanding of
place-making for learning.
To understand the production of places of learning, I extend the literature that, to date,
has expansively sought connections to additional learning settings, without the theoretical
underpinning to support knowing how learners produce those settings—as places—for
themselves. What are the qualities of places that draw learners to them? And to what degree
do those qualities—not just learning—move to other settings? What learning occurs at the
contact zones between places? And how do learners agentively bundle together, or calibrate,
those disparate places?
Structurally, this chapter contains three parts. The first part constitutes the more
traditional literature review. Here, I drill down from the aforementioned literature exploring
learning across settings, paying initial attention to learning geographies, cultural learning
pathways (Bell, Bricker, Reeve, Zimmerman, & Tzou, 2013), learning lives (Erstad et al., 2009),
and connected learning. In the second part, I take a brief interlude. I describe a connected

22

learning setting, like YouMedia Chicago or the Studio @ MPL, (re)imagining it as an affectivelycharged place of learning. This interlude acts as a bridge to the third part, which unites current
thinking, primarily from human geography, on place, mobility, and affect. This section
culminates with place-making.
Situated Learning: The Sealed Envelope of Learning
In expanding human geographic understandings of space, Thrift (2006) writes:
bodies caught in freeze-frame might look like envelopes but, truth to tell, they are
leaky bags of water, constantly sloughing off pieces of themselves, constantly leaving
traces – effluent, memories, messages – through moments of good or bad encounter in
which practices of organization and community and enmity are passed on, sometimes all
but identically, sometimes bearing something new. (p. 140-141)
I am tired of thinking—and talking—about classrooms as containers, as bound learning
environments. Learning settings, like the bodies of which Thrift writes, are never caught in
“freeze-frame.” They are never sealed “envelopes.” Rather, classrooms—and any learning
setting—are porous, permeable, “leaky bags of water.” Theories of situated learning, however,
(Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989; Lave & Wenger, 1991) often seal up learning and activity
inside of localized envelopes. For example, despite Lave and Wenger’s description of
legitimate peripheral participation that is relational, mutually constituted through the
interaction among “agent, activity, and the world,” the activities the authors offer for analysis—
e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, butcher-shop and tailor apprenticeships—are relatively
contained, isolated to a specific space and time.
Importantly, however, Lave and Wenger offer a glimpse of the “leaky bag of water” that
Thrift imagines. They hint at the ways in which communities of practice depend upon
memberships that extend over the historical biographical trajectories of its members. Notably,

23

the production of communities of practices—and the knowledgeable identities that constitute
them—raises questions about the “sociocultural organization of space into places of activity
and the circulation of knowledgeable skill” (p. 55, my emphasis). How are generic, local spaces
of activity transformed (by learners) into meaningful places of activity? How does knowledge
move and circulate across settings (from the tailor’s shop, to the bar with other apprentices, to
YouTube videos played [and re-played] to hone specific skills)? A more fully relational
perspective on mobility and learning, Leander, Phillips, and Taylor (2010) write
will only come into being to the extent that specific relations are followed, traced, and
analyzed; the ‘social’ will be lost or epiphenomenal to activity when less visible
movements of people, texts, tools, and other cultural resources are bracketed out of
activity or assumed to exist through only local visibility. (p. 335)
This language is critical, calling for relations to be “followed” and “traced” as they circulate
within and beyond settings. Brackets, then, fall to the cutting room floor, so to speak, giving
way to permeability, flow.
Learning Geographies
Education research has adopted spatial approaches that follow, trace, and analyze to a
certain extent, asserting that learning and literacy are always situated and produced in
particular social—and spatial—relationships (Comber, Nixon, Ashmore, Loo, & Cook, 2006;
Kostogriz, 2006; Leander & Sheehy, 2004; Vadeboncoeur, Hirst, & Kostogriz, 2006). Such
approaches purport that space is socially produced, that it is co-constructed alongside social
life rather than simply acting as a backdrop for it (Leander, 2001, p. 639).
Educational spaces are not bound systems; rather, they are multi-layered, complex.
Nespor (1997), for example, suggests that a nuanced exploration of educational spaces will

24

“peel back its walls and inspect the strings…linking it to the outside world (which is no longer
outside)” (p. xi). Spatial theories of learning, then, underscore the variegated nature of what is
within those walls as well as how the “strings” within them stretches outward. Nespor’s (1997)
work, in particular, elegantly traces the complexities embedded within Thurber Elementary,
from its intersections with the local neighborhood, to teacher-parent struggles, to even the
bodies of its students. Similarly, Leander’s (2001) research explicating space-time and identity
calls for a greater understanding of the ways in which various discourses and identities, once
thought distant to schooling, become re-inscribed within school spaces (p. 641). In urging the
literacy community to consider the interaction between space and learning more carefully, he
argues for the need to understand how identities of students and teachers are always
hybridized through dynamic space-times that stretch in-and-out from schools. These dynamic
geographies and temporalities emerge through the “circulation of paper in classrooms and
media practices, on the boundaries for literacy shaped by walls, desks, and neighborhoods,
and on the ways in which material participants in the world—such as bodies—become sites for
writing of myriad texts” (Leander & Sheehy, 2004, p. 3).
Spatial approaches, illuminating the heterogeneous dynamics influencing learning and
literacy at play within classrooms, share similarities to ecological approaches learning beyond
classrooms and across settings (Barron, 2006). Crowley and Jacobs (2002) describe the “islands
of expertise” that young children develop, the ways in which that expertise stretches across
toys, talk, museums, and more. Parents, for instance, recognize this burgeoning expertise and
expand it through questions and explanations; peers support it. These supports facilitate
ecological transitions, (re)positioning learners in new ways to focal topics and contributing to

25

learning and identity development. Recently, Calabresa Barton and colleagues (2014) have
drawn attention to the identity work youth enacted across the borders of multiple communities,
honing in on critical moments, or “beads,” that fostered this identity development. In turn, this
identity development spanned, what Barron calls “thick and multi-stranded” networks which
reach into—and back out of—a learning setting.
To further expand classroom-as-container imaginaries, Leander and colleagues (2010)
offer three metaphors, which come together under the auspices of learning geographies:
learning-in-place, learning trajectories, and learning networks. First, the metaphor of learningin-place is most reminiscent of the aforementioned spatial turn in literacy and learning.
Learning “situations,’’ they argue, are better thought of as a “nexus of relations to other locals”
(p. 336). A learning-in-place approach to a given learning setting emphasizes the mobilities
evident within place, the way that setting is constantly formed and transformed. Second,
trajectories of learning shift the focus to space-time—and are reminiscent of ecological
thinking— following learning across events and contexts. Zacher’s (2009) portrait of Christina
exemplifies the ways in which the identity develops along a spatiotemporal trajectory:
“Christina redrew her racial identity map every day, adding new locations, new people, new
supporting characters and threads” (p. 275). Christina’s learning trajectory includes street
corners, and bus rides; she deliberately used space—over time—to promulgate a specific
identity. Third, learning networks posit that learners actively network learning resources across
space and time, and that those resource—pieces of paper, polices, megabytes of data—can
mobilize learners in disparate ways, including different speeds, frequencies, and rhythms.

26

With an initial mapping of this conceptual terrain, I now briefly outline resonant
approaches to learning across space and time. I first highlight cultural learning pathways (Bell
et al, 2013), or learning that is “accomplished across settings (i.e. translocally) by persons
acting within diversities of structures of social practice” (p. 272). I pay particular attention to the
emphasis the authors place on the ontogeny of interests and concerns across settings. From
there, I detail related thinking, with a specific emphasis on digital media, through Erstad’s
(2009) learning lives approach, a means to describe the expansive trajectories of learning youth
are involved over time and across settings. Finally, I conclude with a deeper description of
connected learning which, in many respects, brings together cultural learning pathways and
learning lives, and then infuses recent thinking regarding participatory culture (Jenkins, 2009).
In the end, I offer Table 2-1 as a means to represent three facets of each approach to learning
across settings: First, the exigence for studying learning across settings; second, the vision of
what it means to learn across settings; and third, the geographic conception of a so-called
setting.
Cultural Learning Pathways
The cultural learning pathways perspective develops a more holistic account of not only
how but also where people learn (Bell et al., 2013). For Bell and colleagues, cultural learning
pathways are “connected chains of personally consequential activity and sense-making” that
are “temporally extended, spatially variable, and cultural diverse with respect to value systems
and social practices” (p. 170). Drawing on the work of Banks and colleagues’ (2007), cultural
learning pathways describe learning that is life-long, life-wide, and life-deep.

27

Learning that is life-long is temporal. It traces the ways in which “significant abilities”
develop over the course of years through practice, social support, and reflection (p. 270). Bell
and colleagues recognize that “learning pathways are architected and disrupted” over a variety
of timescales, from month to years.
Life-wide learning is spatial. It recognizes how learners move through a number of
settings during their daily activities, including formal and informal learning spaces,
neighborhoods, and interest-powered learning settings, like museums and online venues. In
life-wide learning, learners adjudicate how to integrate their abilities and interests across
disparate locations in order to accomplish goals or work alongside others. Successfully doing
so enables learners to create connected and extended learning pathways from which they
benefit (p. 270).
Finally, life-deep learning is value-laden. This means that learning and development is
influenced by the social, ethical, and religious value systems of specific groups. Those value
systems (which can be both life-deep, and life-wide) shape the ways in which people
participate in activity. Moreover, they help define learning outcomes that are recognized (or
dismissed) as well as learner identities that are welcomed (or undesirable).
Notably, the cultural learning pathways emphasize the relationship between interest and
learning (Barron, 2006; Hidi & Renninger, 2006). Specifically, extended pathways of learning
are deepened through the “stabilization of situational interest (e.g., around domain topic,
practice, social relationship)” (p. 273). These interests may be individually elective or
community-based. Bell and colleagues provide the example of a youth who receives a hamster
as a pet: an initial interest in caring for an animal evolves into learning more about hamsters

28

(e.g. different breeds, the fact that they are nocturnal) and then extends into their exercise and
eating habits as well as their life cycle (Zimmerman, 2012). A permutation of interest, learning
pathways also develop from concerns, challenges, or desires. These concerns can vary, ranging
from a desire to serve and help the community to active participation in social justice issues.
Oftentimes, these interests and concerns then lead to forms of goal-directed learning as well
an emergence of related interests and concerns.
Cultural learning pathways are broad, covering everything from an interest in hamsters to
a concern for the well-being of undocumented immigrants. A related approach—learning lives
(Erstad, 2009)—gives further nuance to youth learning trajectories, particularly through an
emphasis on new media.
Learning Lives
By focusing on learners—their learning across space, time, and networks—education
researchers are more sensitive to youth’s “learning lives” (Erstad et al., 2009; Erstad, 2013). In
describing learning lives, Erstad and colleagues “look at learning among young persons within
and across different learning sites exploring the positioning and repositioning of the self or
learner identity across these different ‘locations’” (p. 100). Learning, in this case, is ontological
(Wortham, 2005), traversing spatial boundaries over time. It is highly connected to the
formation of identity, the ways in which learners develop a sense of self—or self-narrative—that
the learner then mobilizes across both formal and informal learning settings. Importantly,
Erstad and colleagues recognize that this holistic and pluralistic approach is not new. They
contend however, that moving with youth as they live and learn across settings—both formal
and informal—is “more necessary at this time as it offers a way of bridging the binary

29

opposition between formal and informal learning which is underpinning much debate about
how homes and schools may be re-inscribed as changed and changing sites of learning” (p.
100).
Digital media is crucial in bridging this (in)formal binary. One way of considering youth
learning lives, the authors argue, is to think in terms of “learners in motion.” Learners in motion
carry—move with—their media. In contrast to mass media, today’s digital media is “personal,
portable, and pedestrian” (Ito, 2007). In order to understand learners in motion, Erstad (2009)
argues, “we need to understand the role of digital media in their lives,” including where youth
go with it and what you do with it in each discrete locations, and the relationships between
digital media use across those locations.
In the following, I further elaborate on connected learning. As an approach to learning
and reform, it aligns with, and expands upon, both cultural learning pathways and learning
lives, especially in its aim to leverage the opportunities afforded by digital media to create
equitable learning settings for youth. I outline the guiding principles of connected learning,
with an explicit emphasis on its interest-powered core.
Connected Learning
Connected learning (Ito et al., 2013), to be clear, is not new. Rather it remixes
sociocultural learning theories (e.g. Cole, 1998) and applies an overarching focus on digital
media. As core principles, the connected learning framework advocates broadened access to
learning that is interest-powered and oriented toward academic, economic, or civic
opportunity (p. 4). Core properties of the connected learning paradigm include learning that
develops through a shared purpose, is production-centered, and openly-networked. While I

30

flesh out the design principles which informed MBB in the following chapter, I further describe
the body of learning research that informs connected learning here. This research, the authors
note, points toward three key findings that guide connected learning: “1) The disconnect
between classroom and everyday learning, 2) the meaningful nature of learning that is
embedded in valued relationships, practice, and culture, and 3) the need for learning contexts
that bring together in-school and out-of-school learning and activity” (p. 45).
Connected learning targets the disconnect between learning that takes place in formal
spaces, like school, and learning that takes place in informal spaces, like libraries, or online
venues. The authors’ emphasis on this disconnect is largely a critique of long-standing
arguments regarding the transfer of knowledge, or the ways in which “school subjects are often
thought to impart knowledge and skills that will be useful, or will ‘transfer to’ everyday life and
future work” (p. 45). A recent report from the National Academies, for instance, reveals that
“[o]ver a century of research on transfer has yielded little evidence that teaching can develop
general cognitive competencies that are transferable to any new discipline, problem or
context, in or out of school” (National Research Council, 2012).
Despite the recognition that the classroom “lacks utility and relevance for many young
people” (Ito et al., 2013, p. 55), school and future life-opportunity are incredibly entwined.
Thus, connected learning positions itself as a mediator between the formal and informal,
recognizing that it is not the institution which promotes learning (e.g. school, library) but the
relationships, practices, and culture shared therein (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Rogoff, 2003;
Scribner & Cole, 1981). Opportunities to work alongside more-capable others (Rogoff, 1990;
Vygotsky, 1980) including peers and mentors, are critical, helping youth refine not only their

31

thinking but skills as well (p. 57). Drawing on research that has documented the sociocultural
foundation of learning as happening through specific participatory practices within unique
communities, connected learning recognizes that learning is highly relational, and can be
understood as “changing participation in cultural activity rather than an endeavor sequestered
from everyday social life” (Ito et al., 2013, p. 46). Learning, the authors note, “happens within
the flow of everyday social life, work, and other kinds of purposeful activity” (p. 46).
Connected learning intends to facilitate connections and translations between in-and-out
of school learning. Rather than approaching learning across settings in terms of transfer, the
connected learning framework ascribes to an ecological approach to learning (Barron, 2006;
Bronfrenbrenner, 1979), which seeks to break out of a school-centric view of learning in favor
views that consider the “broader life spheres” of youth (Barron, 2006, p. 193). Importantly,
ecological—and thus connected learning—approaches are careful not to create false binaries
between in-school/out-of-school learning. Schools themselves, for instance, can be “places
where informal learning processes such as observation, imitation, collaboration, and
apprenticeship take place (Rogoff, 2003), while processes that we typically associate with
Western schooling such as quizzing or memorizing can be observed in homes and among
peers engaging in non-school learning” (Henze, 1992; Senechal & LeFevre, 2002, as cited in
Barron, 2006, p 198).
Connected learning recognizes the import of digital media in youth’s learning ecologies,
especially in facilitating boundary-crossing among learning settings. While technology is not
necessarily a prerequisite, connected learning does recognize that digital technologies provide
youth with greater access the spatiotemporally distributed social supports, including peers and

32

adults. New technologies, the authors write, foster new (media) literacies, or those which are
increasingly distributed, participatory, and collaborative (Lankshear & Knobel, 2013; Jenkins,
2006). In this “new culture of learning “ (Thomas & Brown, 2011), youth have the opportunity
to enter into vast, and widespread, interest-powered online groups, ranging from video
production, fan fiction writing, gaming and more. Importantly, the emphasis here is not on the
technology itself (“new technical stuff”), but in the collective ways of being that emerge
concomitant to those technologies (“new ethos stuff;” Lankshear & Knobel, 2011).
Synthesis of Learning Across Settings Literature
Table 2-1 offers a synthesis of the reviewed approaches to learning across settings. I
break down these approaches in three ways. First, I describe their exigence for the study of
learning across settings. Then, I detail their vision of what it means to learning across settings.
Finally, I delineate the geographic of conception of these so-called settings. Most notable here
are the diverse ways in which these four approaches conceptualize these so-called settings. On
the one hand, for instance, connected learning, offers a fairly simple conception of a setting,
noting “schools, homes, after-school clubs” and so forth. Leander and colleagues, on the other
hand, detail the (theoretical) nuances of settings, including the ways in which so-called settings,
as places, are relational, entwined. Erstad and colleagues, from another perspective, recognize
the role of local literacies (Barton & Hamilton, 1998) in their conception of setting—an example
of how approaches to learning across settings are influenced by their (often situated)
theoretical heritage.

vision, and geographic conception.

Interlude: The Contours of Interest-Powered Learning
Let us envision a learning setting like YouMedia Chicago or the Studio @ MPL, a space
that facilitates connected learning through, for instance, music production and podcast
creation. A pathway perspective might examine how learning occurs for one youth over time,
how her digital music production, for instance, develops from hanging out, to messing around
to geeking out, how she creates “products” with a “shared purpose” across “open networks.”
An emphasis on openly-networked access, while laudable, presupposes that learning
occurs differently at discrete locations—that youth become transported from one location and
learn differently in another—or that learning accumulates in some way. What happens when
“access” is not the issue, but the milieu that surrounds access: the Ingoldian meshwork (2011)
of access. What intersects as a youth, for instance, continues a digital media production from
home? What academic content might she draw on from school? (And what does she dismiss?)
And to what degree does this digital media production foster an entry-point toward other
forms of civic engagement?
More questions: What happens when we re-cast this setting—this environment—as a
place? When we stop connecting settings with the assumption that something from one setting
wends its way into the others, but account for the nexus of relations that exist in each setting.
How does that nexus coalesce into a place for learning? Or, more importantly, how do learners
actively negotiate, and subsequently transform this place for their own enrichment? For their
own learning?

35

Furthermore, what happens when we pay attention to affective resonances felt between
bodies—human and non-human? The ways in which those resonances flow at different
rhythms, including lulls and spikes? At fits and starts? Or how youth alight on certain interestpowered activities briefly, only to flee from them moments later (only to return, to re-ignite that
interest, individually, later). What do we unveil by following the affective undulations of
learning, the “wandering lines,” or “efficacious meanderings” (de Certeau, 1984, p. xviii)?
Such an approach, I argue, is more akin to place-making, the temporary intersection of
multiple lines—interests, academic content, civic engagement, for my purposes. To explore
these questions—and in further texturizing the experience of learning—I bring together
theories of place, mobility, and affect.

36

Affectively-charged Place-m aking: Place, M obility, Affect
This section supplements educational research on learning that extends across settings.
Through theories of place, mobility and affect, I first echo the ways in which each individual
setting is not a container of activity but rather a nexus of relations to other settings, other
locales. Then, I draw on literature related to the “new mobilities paradigm” to add further
texture to the ways in which people, ideas, and things move across places. I refine this
understanding of place and movement by underscoring affect’s role as catalyst of movement
by considering how it pushes and pulls actors through space. Finally, I bring these three
together with an overt emphasis on place-making (Figure 2-1).

Figure 2-1. Re-visiting the relationship between the guiding constructs in this chapter.

Place
In this dissertation, I adopt—and begin with—a topological sense of place. This
sensibility enables me to think about proximity, presence, and distance in a way that disrupts
my sense of what might be near or far (Hinchliffe et al., 2013). This sensibility contrasts with

37

perspectives on place, which describe it as “local, particular, and unique” (Pierce et al., 2010,
p. 55), as a locale, with a specific location and fostering a sense of place—of being here. More
expansive views of place are rich, multi-scalar, overlapping. One simple way of thinking about
this issue of proximity is the relationship between the global and local. The so-called global,
from this perspective, is implicated, present, in the so-called local. For example, for my
purposes, global Minecraft culture is implicated, present, in our regular MBB activities.
Such a sensibility comes into contact with relational thinking about place (Deleuze &
Guattari, 1987; Ingold, 2011; Massey 2005). Ingold’s (2011) meshwork may best exemplify a
relational place. It consists of a “web of flows,” that result from the “binding together of lines,
not in the connecting of points” (p. 152). Place is temporary; it is a process. Places are always
moving, shifting. They are “unfinished,” “throwntogether” (Massey, 2005). As a result, one
cannot separate its throwntogetherness from its movement. Places are shot through with
disparate trajectories, “stories-so-far” (Massey, 2005). Space and time, from this perspective,
are perhaps less important than the unique acts of “spacing” and “timing” (Bingham and
Thrift, 2000, p. 290). Place, from this perspective,
is an event…neither situated nor contained within a particular location, but is instead
splayed out and unfolded across a myriad of vectors…vectors of disjointure and
dislocation [that] may conjugate and reverberate, but there is no necessity for them to
converge on a particular experiential or physical location. (Doel, 1999, p. 7)
A topological sensibility posits that space-time is foldable, like a crumpled handkerchief. The
flat, well-ironed surfaces of the handkerchief which once appeared widely far apart become
folded over one another, previously separated corners now pressed up flush against one
another (Serres & Latour, 1995, p. 60-61). In much the same way, there is potential for re-

38

arrangements an re-assortment in any given learning setting; there is the possibility for
continual transformation, just as there is always the possibility for (temporary) stasis.
This description of place, however, is largely abstract. Place seems to consist of anything
and everything—it is global and local, near and far, related to this and that, there and then,
here and now. In this dissertation, I recognize this complexity, yet I intend to rein it in as well,
to appreciate its nuance but also to acknowledge that we—researchers, educators, students—
never fully take in that complexity in daily life. A critical component of place-making, I argue, is
bundling, or what Nespor (2006) calls “calibrating,” bringing spatiotemporal order to one’s
experience in-the-moment.
I will arrive at place-making through a theoretical review of literature that first, recognizes
the complexity of place, the movements within and beyond it; then, I specifically take note of
the intimate ways in which people make place, largely in collusion with affective intensities.
Thus, I first highlight literature related to the mobilities turn in the social sciences before honing
in on the relationship between place and affect.
M obilities
This topological sense of place has helped bring about what an inter-disciplinary group
calls the “new mobilities paradigm” or the “mobilities turn” (Hannam et al., 2006). Naive
approaches to mobilities assert that everything is on the move, that contemporary culture is
one of rapidity, speed. But this mobility occurs at different paces and intensities for different
people, having varying impacts and consequences. Within the mobile turn, mobility is
“acknowledged as part of the energetic buzz of the everyday (even while banal, or humdrum,
or even stilled) and seen as a set of highly meaningful social practices that make up social,

39

cultural, and political life” (Adey, Bissell, Hannam, Merriman, Sheller, 2013, p. 3). Geographers,
historians, and anthropologist shifted from fixing their work on “the field” to following their
work along “routes,” tracing sets of relations across sites. Thus the mobilities paradigm
emphasizes that all places are tied together in, at least, thin networks of connections. In the
end, the new mobilities paradigm challenges social science research that is a-mobile—both
theoretically and methodologically. It seeks out fluidity as opposed to fixed, contained,
territories.
Mobilities also underscore the phenomenological experience of the moving, sensing
body. The entails attention to the corporeal engagement with other bodies and technologies,
practices of movement (like biking, walking), as well as events of movement (commuting, sitting
in traffic). A number of studies have sought to understand the ways in which bodies engage
with and actively move through their surroundings, ranging from the subversive practices of
parkour practitioners (Mould, 2009) to the continual production of place by the kinesthetic
sensation produced by human-bike-road (Spinney, 2006). Others have explored the “micromobilities” of dancers, rock climbers, and walkers (Fincham et al., 2010). Still, bodies do not
move on their own—they always walk on, bike with. Thus mobilities studies also pay equal
attention to non-human bodies through an overt emphasis on materiality.
Materialities—both human and non-human— are also a dominant component of these
new mobilities. This is a post-human ethos very much motivated by the “material turn” across
the social sciences. Simply put, to move through the world demands that many things are in
the right place at the right time. Humans and non-humans produce hybrid geographies. The
social, as Law (1994) writes, is materially heterogeneous: talk, bodies, texts, machines,

40

architectures, all of these and many more are implicated in and perform the social” (p. 2). In
fact, Law’s depiction of a Portuguese man-o’-war ship has become the exemplar of a humannonhuman assemblage: more than men and women working together to sail the ship, men and
women, ropes and masts, timber and rigging become a unified, pulsing assemblage. The shiphuman assemblage is what Latour (1986) would call an immutable mobile: despite its mobility,
it still maintains its essential configuration (e.g. it does not become a submarine). de Laet and
Mol (2000) contrast the immutable mobile with the mutable mobile: something that can be
configured and re-configured depending on place or context. They explore mutability through
the example of the Zimbabwean bush pump, a fluid object with properties that are adaptable,
flexible, and responsive to needs in situ. I write of boats and bush pumps here to juxtapose two
forms of material mobility. The mobile turn draws attention to both physical movement through
space, as well as the movement—or mutability—of things. Materialities can generate different
forms of encounter, new configurations, new attachments.
The new mobilities paradigm has undergone consistent refinement. Cresswell (2010), for
instance, calls out the name itself, recognizing that it builds up false dichotomies (new/old,
mobile/immobile). In further differentiating mobility from movement3, he provides additional
nuance to mobility, arguing that “mobility involves a fragile entanglement of physical
movement, representations, and practices” (p. 19). This is the constellation of mobility. This

3

I use mobility and movement interchangeable throughout this dissertation. I do recognize, however,
that mobility is politically-loaded, and encompasses movement. For example: Students can physically
move but that physical movement takes on a different meaning when they do so at 11 a.m. within a
school on a Tuesday versus 11 a.m. outside of a school on a Tuesday. Issues of mobility are at stake
when students’ physical movements are loaded with meaning, or judgments, or expectations.

41

constellation of mobility, too, contains its own features. Cresswell urges mobile researchers to
further consider the elements of mobility: motive force, speed, rhythm, route, experience, and
friction.
Through qualities like rhythm and experience, Cresswell taps into emerging geographic
emphases on the experience of mobility, non-representational theories (Harrison & Anderson,
2012) that feel out the embodied and affective registers of mobility and technology. Others
have followed this feeling-thinking logic, questioning, for instance, the import of space and
time in understanding mobilities. Why not, as Merriman (2012) questions
position movement, rhythm, force, energy, or affect as primitives or registers that may
be of equal importance when understanding the unfolding of events, and why approach
space and time as privileged measures for conceptualizing location, position, and
context. (p. 24)
Mobilities occur at different speeds, tempos, and rhythms. They are affectively-charged,
pushing and pull actors. It is with this conception of mobility that I now narrow my focus
through an emphasis on the ways in which non-representational theories of affect inform this
work.
Affect
Those in the new mobilities camp most often adopt Nigel Thrift’s (2007) take on nonrepresentationalism and affect. With echoes of this topological sensibility, affects signal
relation. Affects circulate between objects and bodies as a “capacity to relate” (Adey, 2008, p.
439). They depend on a “sense of push in the world” (Thrift, 2004, p. 64). Others put affect
forth as the “energetic outcome of encounters between bodies in particular places”
(Conradson & Latham, 2007, p. 232). Massumi (2002), in his translation of Deleuze and

42

Guattari’s Thousand Plateaus (1997), ascribes affect as the ability to “affect and to be
affected,” as a “pre-personal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential
state of the body to another” (p. xvii). Affectivities are not the feelings of individuals; rather
they are the “intense sensations of bodies that are pre-personal and pre-discursive” (p. 133).
From such a perspective, bodily sensations are “beyond or before thought” (p. 133). HickeyMoody and Malins (2007) distill Deleuze and Guattari’s take on affect as that which is “felt
before it is thought,” as having a “visceral impact on the body” before the body gives off any
form of subjective or emotive meaning (p. 8). Who we are and what we are capable of stems
from embodied sensations. Examples of those affective sensations include when “we
encounter an image of a bomb victim, smell milk that has soured, or hear music that is out of
key” (p. 8). People are affected before they can verbally articulate their own aversion.
In line with the new mobilities paradigm’s emphasis on materiality, affect operates on
material schematism (Thrift, 2004). There is an overarching concern with “things,” or stuff. As
such, affect takes the “sense-catching forms of things seriously” (p. 9). Things become a part of
hybrid assemblages: “concretions, settings, flows” (p. 9). They are given equal weight. Thus,
such an approach seeks to avoid anthropocentrism. Aligned with this focal shift away from the
human subject, the forebear of affect, Spinoza, argues: “There is no subject but only
individuating affective states of an anonymous force. The plane is concerned only with
movements and rests, with dynamic affective changes” (cited in Alliez, 2004, p. 27).
Affect and place. Recent research within geography and sociology has begun to
explore the relationship between affect and place. Early theorizations sought to understand
place in regard to emotional resonance. Casey (2001) for instance, delineates between “thick”

43

and “thin” places. Thick places enable a form of “concernful absorption” in place, a layering of
affect, habits, and meaning which connects people personally to place. Thin places, in contrast,
lack the “rigor and substance of thickly lived places” (Casey, 2001, p. 684). They are diluted;
they disable one’s ability to engage with place. Moreover, they do not hold people in place;
they are not memorable (e.g. McDonald’s, airports). More recently, thick places have been
theorized as having an “affective atmosphere” (Anderson, 2009) that is established through
social, material and other discursive resources. They emanate from the assemblage of bodies:
“human bodies, discursive bodies, non-human bodies.” Anderson (2009), for instance,
specifically links the creation of atmosphere to practices like interior design and architecture
which produce atmospheres as they arrange light, sounds, symbols, texts, and more. Affect
describes the particular set of feeling states that can be realized in place. Atmospheres, then,
are enhanced, intensified, and shaped. Feeling, sensing bodies affectively respond to these
atmospheres—those produced by acoustics, haptics, visuals, and even other bodies.
Place-m aking
Place-making brings an agent into this discussion of place, mobility, and affect. Massey’s
(2005) conception of place, for instance, which is throwntogether, consists of stories, or
“bundles.” These bundles are space-time trajectories which individuals pull together through
cognitive and emotional processes (p. 119). Arriving in a new place, she writes, means
joining up with, somehow linking into, the collection of interwoven stories of which that
place is made. Arriving at the office, collecting the post, picking up the thread of
discussions, remembering to ask how that meeting went last night, noting gratefully
that your room’s been cleared. Picking up the threads and weaving them into a more
coherent feeling of being ‘here, ‘now.’ (p. 119)

44

This “joining up with,” this “linking into,” describes the agentive act of place-making. People
“bundle” disparate space-times—those near and far—and integrate them into place. They
make place. In doing so, they reference and (re)configure “the many places that they
participate in; the place-bundles are socially negotiated, constantly changing and contingent
(Pierce, Martin & Murphy, 2010, p. 58). Pierce, Martin and Murphy (2010) particularly
emphasize place-making as “bundling.” Bundling, they write, occurs through both conscious
and unconscious acts by people, by choice. People select, or choose, the “raw materials, or
elements, which comprise places in their experiences” (p. 58). If Massey describes place as a
“constellation of on-going trajectories” (2005, p. 92), then this act of choice is “akin to
identifying constellations among the stars of the night sky” (Pierce, Martin & Murphy, p. 59).
Despite coming from a different epistemological background than Massey, de Certeau
(1984) also offers useful insights into how people make place. He details the “procedures of
everyday creativity” people perform, especially as they move across the grid of the city (p. xiv).
de Certeau emphasizes people’s “ways of operating” in order to acknowledge, and even
conform to power, “only in order to evade it.” People subvert these powerful structures—and
their strategic forms of control—through “tactics.” Tactics, he writes, “make use of the cracks
that particular conjunctions open in the surveillance of the proprietary powers. It poaches
them. It creates surprises in them. It can be where it is least expected” (p. 37). People deploy
these tactics “to suit their own interests and their own rules” (p. xiv).
Mobility—either across space, time, or scale— is critical to place-making. For a number of
theorists, from de Certeau to Ingold, the physical, embodied movement of the human body
through space begins to produce place: “Their intertwined paths,” de Certeau writes, “give

45

their shape to spaces” (p. 97). And it is through the movement from one space to another that
people “weave places together.” This weaving, he notes, is akin to storytelling, part of the
“rhetoric of walking,” which leads to place-making. To walk, de Certeau writes, is to
continually “initiate, maintain, or interrupt contact” with others, both people and things.
Through “skips” and “leaps,” the walker carves out “gaps in the spatial continuum,” amplifying
the meaningful places among the space of the ordered grid: a “less,” de Certeau writes, is
created from more; the “whole” is miniaturized.
But neither de Certeau nor Massey emphasize the affective dimensions of place-making.
They make no explicit claim as to how people “identify, negotiate, and transform place” (Duff,
2010, p. 887). In his work following youth participants across important locations in Vancouver,
Duff found that, rather than the practices that occur within a given place, it was affect—
sensation—that threaded places together. Although specific practices certainly help a given
place take on meaning, “the motivating impulse that inspires young people to identify and
maintain these sites in the first place is born in and of the affects and capacities they express”
(p. 891). Duff provides the example of a skateboarder seeking a suitable location to skate to
underscore how people are affected by place—and its atmosphere, its potential:
Skateboarders encountering a courtyard outside an insurance firm, for example, are first
affected by the quality of the light, the expanse of flat concrete leading to a flight of
stairs, and the privacy afforded by high walls on two sides, before actually launching
into place, board under foot and practice in motion. (p. 891)
Affect, he argues, “serves as a kind of map or tool of navigation,” as people move through
space; it is the “strange attractor lingering in place awaiting is realization in practice, habit, and
sensation” (p. 892). Place-making, then, furnishes an array of resources useful for the realization

46

of personal enrichment: “specific experiences, ambitions, and capacities” in place (Duff, 2010,
p. 882).
Place-m aking in M BB
In my analyses, I tease apart three lines that constitute part of—certainly not all—of the
place that is Metro: Building Blocks. In chapter four, I follow circulations and movements of
initial interest, documenting affective intensities—those “strange attractor[s] lingering in
place”—that push and pull participants toward learning. I call these “interest-powered
mobilities.” Then, in chapter five, I follow the rhythms of activity within MBB, illuminating the
emergence of learning opportunities. I call these learning topographies. Finally, in chapter six, I
follow circulations and movements of civic engagement, or engaged citizenship that operates
across space, time, and scale. I call these civic geographies. While I present my analyses in
chapters four through six, I bring them together under the auspices of place-making in chapter
seven. In doing so, I argue for place-making as an affectively-charged negotiation, and
subsequent transformation, of place for personal enrichment.
Prior to turning to my analyses, however, I first describe my methodological approach to
my data. This section includes greater attention to the context of MBB and descriptions of my
participants, followed by further elaboration of my mobile methods. I thus turn to my methods
in chapter three, beginning first with description of a typical day at the library.

47

CHAPTER THREE
M ETHODS

Interlude: Typical Day at the Library
I walk in to the teen center at 2:47, saying hello to Jamie who is working at the front desk,
and Stephan, who is turning on the TVs for when the teens start entering. I make my way
toward the back of the teen center, unlocking the door to the contained study room that has
been transformed into Metro: Building Blocks’ headquarters (Figure 3-1).

Figure 3-1. The study room in which MBB was held.

By 3:00, I’ve logged-in users for all six computers so participants can get going right
when they come in. Still, one person might show up, or six—I never know. Cameras are set up
to record, one from the back of the room, one from the side. Wireless microphones placed.

48

When participants get going, they’ll turn on the iShowU software on their computer, capturing
their screen, face of the player, and all surrounding audio (Figure 3-2).

Figure 3-2. An example of iShowU screen capture.

At 3:05, Martin comes in, says hello and gets right to work, picking up where he left off
building a mixed-use apartment during our previous session. Jasper shows up a few minutes
later, sitting in his normal seat on the far left corner, saying hello to Martin and me but not
much else. Knowing that Jasper likes working with me, I sit down next to him, log into the
game, fly my avatar over to the single-family home he is building and ask what I can do. While
Martin keeps working on his building, Jasper and I plot out the outline of the home: I begin
carving out a driveway that leads to a garage in the back; Jasper chooses the wood he wants
to use for the walls and begins placing the blocks. As Jasper keeps working on his home, I fly
my avatar over to Martin’s project. It’s coming along: he has a green-roof in the works, trying to

49

give residents additional access to green space. He’s also aware of the environmental benefits
of it: “It keeps the building cool in the summer, and warm in the winter, so it lowers electric
costs.”
At 4:15, Eddy and Tom enter, still sweaty from track practice. They sit next to Jasper and
fly their avatars to the bridge they were working on during their last session. “Eddy, we need to
make that little jutting out part. See it [on Google Image]? It’s not straight; it has these parts
that jut out.” Eddy and Tom are really focused on verisimilitude: they want to make Metro.
They count blocks, trying to get the right number on the east and west side of the Columbia
River. Now that there’s some activity by the river, Martin flies over and begins tweaking the
restaurant he built there. Some Non Player Characters (NPCs) that he created walk around:
“Welcome to the Riverside Cafe,” one says, “What would you like to eat?” While Eddy and
Tom continue work on the bridge, Martin begins to develop an elaborate lighting system on
the outside of the cafe. He uses redstone to build a circuit underground that sends a charge
through glowstone blocks, temporarily lighting them up one-by-one, the light gradually rising
up each block and then coming back down. Jasper continues to build his house, calling me
over occasionally to help him with a bedroom, or a roof. Eddy moves away from the bridge
temporarily to begin building the Aiguille Building, while Tom keeps on adding details to the
bridge. Jasper gets a text from his mom letting him know she’s waiting for him outside. He
logs off and runs out the door.
At 5:30, I sense that everyone’s energy is waning. I suggest we do a build challenge—a
YouTube inspired activity in which builders duke it out in an arena, building whatever I direct

50

them to for a duration of five to ten minutes. I have everyone teleport to the arena that I built,
a large flat square with walls rising along the axes to separate four quadrants (Figure 3-3).

Figure 3-3. The author leads a build challenge with participants.

Eddy, Tom, and Martin go to their respective quadrants and await for me to start the
challenge. I send them a message that says “Build Challenge: Tiny, island oasis.” The
countdown begins. Eddy builds a tiny beach and a palm tree; Martin makes a small waterfall;
Tom struggles, building one tree before time runs out. I claim Eddy the victor just as a librarian
announces over the intercom that the library will close in ten minutes. We all log off of
Minecraft, shutting down IShowU, and putting the computers to sleep. I pack up my cameras
and microphones and follow the crew out of our room. Martin and I chat about his recent band
practice as we walk down the stairs to the main entryway. He meets his dad out front while I
exit through the back, just before the library closes at 6:00.

M obile M ethods and Analysis
The following Infographic (Figure 3-4) acts as an entry point into my methods chapter.

Figure 3-4. Infographic of the methods section.

52

As I noted in chapter one, this dissertation refines three of connected learning’s guiding
principles. It targets 1) interest-powered learning that is 2) academically-oriented and that 3)
promotes political, or civic, opportunity. To refine these principles of connected learning, this
dissertation poses the following research questions:
1)

How are learners affected, or moved, toward interest-powered learning
opportunities? And how do interests move and circulate in service of learning?

2)

What is the topography of learning within an informal, media-rich setting, and
what vocabulary can describe the ways in which it takes form?

3)

How does civic engagement, or opportunity, move and circulate during
participation in this game-based program?

Developing an approach to understanding the ways in which people, things, and ideas move
and circulate in the service of learning is critical to this dissertation. And, just as in this
dissertation, following movements and circulations of people, things, and ideas is a critical
concern to what is called the “new mobilities paradigm” (Hannam et al., 2006).
Methodologically, the new mobilities paradigm challenges existing methods in the social
sciences, arguing that they deal
poorly with the fleeting – that which is here today and gone tomorrow, only to
reappear the day after tomorrow. They deal poorly with the distributed – that is to be
found here and there but not in between – or that which slips and slides between one
place and another. They deal poorly with the multiple – that which takes different
shapes in different places. They deal poorly with the non-causal, the chaotic, the
complex. And such methods have difficulty dealing with the sensory – that which is
subject to vision, sound, taste, smell; with the emotional – time-space compressed
outbursts of anger, pain, rage, pleasure, desire, or the spiritual; and the kinesthetic –
the pleasures and pains that follow the movement and displacement of people, objects,
information, and ideas. (Law & Urry, 2004, p. 404)

53

While I provide plenty of contextual information to Metro: Building Blocks at the front-end of
this chapter, the mobile methodology and analysis that I describe later binds this dissertation
together. Specifically, I work to extend current mobile methods through a spatiotemporal and
affectively-charged approach to my analysis, including: ethnographic commuting, which
underscores my moving body as researcher directly after data collection; temporal circling,
which underscores my moving body at researcher/avatar in-game during and after data
collection; refrains, which underscores the affective space-times produced by participants
during programming; and, finally, felt focal moments, an affectively-charged unit of analysis
(Hollett & Ehret, 2014).
Prior to turning toward my mobile methods and analyses, I offer a thorough overview of
Metro: Building Blocks. First, I give a brief overview of Minecraft. To provide further nuance to
the creation of this program—and to situate its development more deeply within the literature
on virtual worlds—I affiliate my implementation of Minecraft at the Metro Public Library with
key characteristics of virtual worlds set forth by Pearce (2009). I link each of these characteristics
to Minecraft and participation in MBB as a means to underscore the many facets of virtual
worlds with which participants regularly interacted.
From there, I detail the history of Metro: Building Blocks. I describe the four phases of
its development, spanning December 2012-June 2014. I also provide a more thorough
overview of the design principles from connected learning that informed MBB. In addition, I
note my own theoretical and design conjectures that informed the program, which also align
with my theoretical orientation toward place, mobility, and affect. With that background intact,
I then provide background information of each of my participants, with additional narratives to

54

portray my focal participants. Finally, I describe my data sources, and then thoroughly expound
upon the mobile methodology that I employed, and the ways in which I analyzed my moving,
circulating, data.
M etro: Building Blocks
M inecraft
Minecraft is a recent phenomenon. Available on personal computer (PC)/Mac, iOS, and
XBox 360, Minecraft is slippery to define—it has qualities of both video games and virtual
worlds. As a game, it is simply about breaking and placing blocks. It operates from a firstperson perspective (although players can toggle between first- and third-person). As of this
writing, it has sold more than 12 million copies on PC alone, and more than 30 million copies
across various platforms. Players can choose between one of two modes: In survival mode, a
player might mine various resources (e.g. wood, stone), constructing simple tools (e.g. a
pickaxe, a sword), hoping to avoid, and survive, an attack from a zombie, creeper, or spider.
With time, players may build castles, farms, pistons, and more, all the while exploring the world
by traversing various biomes (e.g. jungle, forest, plains). In creative mode, a player has instant
access to all of the game’s resources and can thus build anything, from replicas of the Starship
Enterprise to forms of pixel art (e.g. a giant Pikachu). Minecraft—especially when playing on a
server, like the one used for MBB—shares many qualities with virtual worlds. While I do not
place Minecraft alongside popular virtual worlds like Club Penguin (Black & Reich, 2012) or
Whyville (Kafai, 2010; Kafai, Fields, & Cook, 2010)—primarily because of Minecraft’s
variability—there are specific qualities that produce a certain sense of community for

55

participants. In the following, I attend to those qualities, drawing on Pearce’s (2009) distillation
of virtual worlds, to provide further background to participants’ activity on our server.
Characteristics of M inecraft as a virtual world. Pearce (2009) defines a virtual
world as “a persistent online representation which contains the possibility of synchronous
communication between users and between user and world within a framework of space
designed as a navigable universe” (p. 27). This means that inhabitants can continuously access
that world—the same world—whenever they want. Additionally, they can communicate with
co-present others. Virtual worlds, like Minecraft, in this case, foster the “collective creation of
belief” (p. 18). In designing MBB, I sought to produce the collective creation of belief that
participants existed, designed, and built in their hometown—and that they could actively
create it. Virtual worlds—as well as massively multiplayer online games (MMOG)—share a host
of characteristics, ranging from their spatiality, to persistence, to embodied persistent
identities. Following Pearce (2009), I further elaborate on those characteristics below.
Spatiality. Virtual worlds allow for player-avatar exploration through space. Space, in this
case, ranges from three-dimensional environments (e.g. World of Warcraft) to textual
environments (e.g. old-school MUDs). In the case of Minecraft, the virtual space is visual,
enabling players to traverse a relatively endless landscape.
Contiguous. Very much related to spatiality, the contiguous nature of virtual world’s
denote the world’s continuity. There is a “geospatial adjacent” (Pearce, 2009, p. 18) to the
virtual world. It is mappable. Players have a sense of moving within a continuous space. In
Minecraft, for instance, players trek through various biomes—desert, snow, forest—that are all
connected. There is a sense of being in a singular world.

56

Explorable. Players can go anywhere. While there may be constraints upon where they
can explore based on their status or access to transportation, there is a general sense of
freedom for players within virtual worlds. Virtual worlds are primarily player-driven experiences.
Virtual worlds are open-ended and nonlinear, as opposed to, for example, video games, which
are often goal and result-oriented. Battle (2009) likens this open-mindedness to “Alice,”
(referring to the spontaneous adventures of Alice in Wonderland) as opposed the linearity of a
“Dorothy” approach (referring to Dorothy’s steadfastness adherence to the yellow brick road
as a means to get to Oz).
Persistent. Virtual worlds, like the MBB server, are accessible 24/7. Players can access
them at any time. Thus, virtual worlds are not like video games in which one turns on the
console and begins a new level or from a saved file. As opposed to short-term bursts of play,
virtual worlds enable players to visit and re-visit one world, shaping it over time.
Embodied persistent identities. Because of the persistence of virtual worlds, players
often shape and re-shape their avatar over time, adopting new clothes (as in Second Life) or
facial features (as in Whyville). In Minecraft, players spend time creating or choosing various
“skins,” ranging from pop culture characters, to animals, to average teenagers. In MBB, players
often adopted skins of popular figures, like Iron Man or Boba Fett.
Inhabitable. Virtual worlds are inhabitable and participatory. Unlike, for instance, firstperson shooters in which players move through a pre-determined landscape, virtual worlds
enable players to live within—and make changes to—that landscape over time. In doing so,
they can “actively contribute to its culture” (Pearce, 2009, p. 19). The ability to participate in a
culture is crucial here in that it differentiates virtual worlds from other fictional realms, such as

57

those created by film, television, or literature. Within MBB, for example, the ways in which
participants inhabited the virtual world was critical—we knew that what we built could
potentially last for an extended period of time, and that others would see it: those builds would
not disappear.
Consequential participation. The participation of a player matters within a virtual world.
One’s action can affect others’ experience within it. In Minecraft, for instance, the practice of
“griefing,” or destroying someone else’s build, is a salient example of this consequentiality.
Moreover, talking and interacting with others shapes the experience in ways that the linear
progression of video games cannot.
Populous. Virtual worlds are, by nature, social worlds. They develop populations that
mirror the real world—players develop communities, friendships, even love affairs. Minecraft
blends the capabilities of virtual worlds. Some players operate primarily in single-player mode,
while others solely play on multiplayer servers. In MBB, we always played together, on our
server, with occasional deviations onto other servers. Participants certainly developed a sense
of community that cut across digital and physical space, leading one participant, when
reflecting the relationships he developed, to tell me at the end of our time together: “This is
the best thing I’ve done.”
Worldness. Worldness, Pearce admits, is the “most elusive quality of virtual worlds” (p.
20). In short, worldness describes the unique aesthetic of the virtual world. In Minecraft, for
instance, a server based around the novels of George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones keeps up
the appearance of the world portrayed in the novel (and television series). The server does not
contain elements of Harry Potter or Star Wars. Servers develop their own aesthetics, from

58

contemporary cities, to Wild West towns, to re-creations of popular films, like The Hunger
Games. For our purposes, we sought to develop a sense of wordless related to the city of
Metro. To build edifices from other cities, for instance, would have fractured that worldness.
Developing M etro: Building Blocks
Metro: Building Blocks (MBB) provided youth participants the opportunity to imagine,
develop, and build a digital version of an idealized Metro cityscape. Using the Metro Civic
Design Center’s “Plan for Metro” as guide for in-game activity and development, the program
emphasized authentic, local issues facing Metro’s planners. In-game activity drew attention to,
for instance, planning and design with “respect for the natural and built environment,”
“reestablishing the streets as the principle public space of community and connectivity,” and
“strengthening the unique identity of neighborhoods (Kreyling & Center, 2005). This program
developed over an extended period of time, however. I describe this genesis in four phases
(Figure 3-5).

59

Figure 3-5. A visual timeline of Metro: Building Blocks’ four phases.

Phase 1: Learning Lab Developm ent (Decem ber 2012-April 2013)
Metro: Building Blocks emerged from my role as a consultant in the design of a new
digital media learning for youth at the Metro Public Library. My relationship with the MPL
began in 2012. Having received funding from The MacArthur Foundation to explore the
creation of a learning lab as an expansion to its current teen center (including digital media
production, making, gaming, and writing), the library sought the participation of local youth to
participate in this design process (Figure 3-6).

60

Figure 3-6. Participants in action during learning lab design-activities.

Along with a local architect and Kevin Leander, I designed activities to integrate youth into this
process over a twelve-week period, from December of 2012 through April of 2013. Twelve
high school students, from various local schools, took part in this program. Specifically, over
two of these weeks, I implemented design-activities within Minecraft, curious about how
lessons learned through the examination of physical space—aesthetics, color, flow, sound—
might extend into digital space. Inspired by the energy in the room, the youth’s ease of use of

61

with the game, the products they created and the discourse that ensued, I became drawn to
the possibilities of creating further Minecraft-based programming for youth at the library.
Metro: Building Blocks was born from these activities—and from gracious support of staff
members at the public library.
Phase 2: Gam eplay, Server Creation, Civic Design Center Consultation (JuneOctober 2013)
In late June, I proposed MBB as a pilot for the kinds of digital media based programming
that could run out of the Studio once fully operational. Upon acceptance, the library ordered
ten computers that would be used for my program as well as other programs in the future. In
the mean time, I began avidly playing Minecraft, getting a better sense of the game and its
surrounding culture (message boards, YouTube videos, etc.). Over the next few months, I
logged well over a 100 hours of gameplay. I also dipped into servers to play occasionally with
others, becoming a member one specific server called “Minetown” (Figure 3-7).

Figure 3-7. A screenshot from the welcome page of Minetown, a Minecraft server.

62

This gameplay led me to learn the norms of server communities, kinds of interactions, and the
design of external websites affiliated with the servers.
Based on my study of server communities, I created a site/social network for Metro:
Building Blocks. This site served as an initial location to interact with participants: I blogged
about our builds, linked to other Minecraft-oriented sites for inspiration, and added
screenshots from our activity to alert a wider audience to our efforts. Participants were able to
log in and comment on our site; many of them used existing usernames for similar Minecraftoriented sites (hosted by a company called Enjin; Figure 3-8).

Figure 3-8. A screenshot from the welcome page of the program’s website.

Concurrently, I bought server space through a company called Allgamer. Through them, I
hosted a Minecraft server. This means that the Minecraft world I loaded was available 24/7, as

63

long as participants had the version of Minecraft that we were using in the program.
Participants could then, conceivably, build, play, and interact on our server at any time—not
just when they were at the library.
In early September, I loaded up a Minecraft world that was randomly generated. Within
the game, I located an area that would be suitable for our builds in “Metro.” By locating a
suitable area, I mean that I found a swath of land that had a large river flowing through it. I
then used specific in-game tools to flatten certain parts, clearing out, for instance, the
Columbia riverfront area of Metro. I later cleared out other areas in Metro, ranging from parks
to farmland to locations for mixed-income housing residences. I made tweaks to this world
throughout October on the server.
From September through late October, I met four times with Rebecca, a member of the
Metro Civic Design Center, to describe the plan for MBB and seek advice and consultation.
This partnership was ongoing. Together, we devised areas around the Metro community that
youth could build within Minecraft. We also established learning objectives based upon the
“Plan of Metro,” ten principles that guide public policy, development practice, urban planning
and design in Metro.
Phase 3: Com puter Arrival and Installation (Novem ber-Decem ber 2013)
In November, six of the ten computers arrived. With a portion of their MacArthur funding,
the library purchased iMacs which I used for MBB activities. These computers were also used
by a poetry organization working with other youth at the library. Still, I had full control of the
computers, altering the desktop wallpaper, for instance, to display Minecraft characters. I
loaded Minecraft on all computers. Initially, I ran the program out of the large, empty annex in

64

which the new learning lab would be built. I populated the room with maps and other posters
given to me by Rebecca at the Metro Civic Design Center. This use of the posters was a
deliberate effort to boost the authenticity of the program. I also posted the Civic Design
Center’s “Plan of Metro” on the wall as guidelines for our builds (Figure 3-9).

Figure 3-9. The initial setup of the program, including computers, map of Metro, and MCDC’s
ten principles.

Phase 4: M BB Data Collection (January-June 2014)
MBB activities began in mid-January. I recruited participants through various channels,
ranging from school district-wide e-mails to principals (courtesy of the library’s outreach
program), to personal connections I had with youth who regularly visited the library. Flyers also
advertised the program at the library, as well as on television monitors at local schools

65

(Appendix A). I received a number of responses from youth and parents alike. The program
began, meeting regularly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from, on average, 3:00-6:00.
Mid-way through our sessions (March), the library officially commenced its construction of
the learning lab. Library administration moved MBB into the existing teen center, operating out
of one of the available study rooms. This garnered us more visibility. This new space was cozy,
keeping all participants close together as opposed to spread out like in the initial annex (Figure
3-10).

Figure 3-10. The setup once established in the teen space.

Operating the program out of the existing teen space also allowed other teens to see us
in action—a large window let other teens to peer in. Frequently, teens would walk in and ask
what we were doing. We used that window to display our work as well (Figure 3-10, top right).

66

This spatial shift was significant. MBB now felt like a legitimate program—running alongside
other programs/visitors, like African dancers and zoo representatives. As such, it was a first step
in re-shaping the existing culture of what opportunities teens could participate in at the library.
In total, we met as a group twenty-seven times, encompassing just over 80 hours of inroom gameplay (and thus data collection, which I discuss in-depth later). I also conducted
semi-structured interviews with six participants in June, once our formal meetings concluded,
for approximately 45 minutes each.
Connected Learning: Design Principles
In creating MBB, I drew on the design framework put forth by Connected Learning.
Knowing that connected learning would feature in the design of future programs developed in
the learning lab, I built MBB to prototype the kinds of programming that would be housed
there. The design framework for connected learning is meant to be picked up and adopted by
key figures at institutions like libraries and museums (Appendix B). In the following, I highlight
the design principles put forth by connected learning advocates: production-centered, shared
purpose, and openly networked. I describe each tenant and its relationship to MBB.
Production-centered. The production-centered nature of connected learning settings
provides youth with ample opportunities to produce and create with digital media. It supports
youth production through access to digital tools (Minecraft, in this case, but digital video and
audio, for instance, in others). Additionally, it enables youth to remix and curate digital content,
Photoshopping images to generate novel memes, for example. It also gives youth the chance
to circulate and make visible the artifacts that they produce, either physically or digitally
through social networks.

67

In MBB, participants continually produced—that is the spirit of Minecraft. As I will
describe in future sections, some participants found entry-points to participation and
production by digging tunnels underground while others tested out their skills by creating
simple circuits that would open and close drawbridges at the flip of a switch. No matter the
level of expertise, participants were able to create, make, produce, experiment, and remix
though their builds (Ito et al, 2013, p. 75). A common question among participants was “What
are you building today?” Or: “What are you working on?” Production was the backbone of our
daily activities.
Shared Purpose. A shared purpose embeds learners within purposeful, inquiry-driven
activity. These activities are highly social and collaborative; individuals work together, sharing
both ideas and challenges. The focus here is not necessarily on the assessment of individual
knowledge and expertise, but on the accomplishment of collective goals (p. 75). At times,
collaboration and competition can blend together as well. Video games, for instance, can
foster both competition as well as real-time collaboration. Additionally, these shared activities
can be inter-generational. They can allow both youth and adults to take on leadership roles,
providing diverse opportunities to collective efforts.
The purpose of MBB, from the perspective of the participants, was “to build Metro.” This
provided an automatic shared purpose for participants. They would shuttle between
collaboration and competition, working together to build a bridge, or an apartment complex,
while also competing, to various degrees, to build the biggest, or most detailed, edifice. As
noted earlier, I would also deliberately create competitive opportunities for participants in the
spirit of build challenges, five-minute sessions in which participants had to build an object

68

related to a specific theme (e.g. tiny oasis, or mammals). While the cross-generational
component stemmed largely from my role as an adult playing and contributing alongside
participants, parents were encouraged to stop in and play with their children when possible.
One parent, Stan, joined us one day, learning more about the program by
joining his son, Eddy, in-game. When asked what he wanted to call his avatar, Stan named his
self “El Stan” (Figure 3-11).

Figure 3-11. El Stan joins his son and others in-game.

Eddy taught El Stan how to move through the game world (at one point yelling out, “He’s
holding the mouse upside down!” to the laughter of others in the room). By the end of his tour,
El Stan was quite impressed with what Eddy and others had built. El Stan’s visit illustrated the
ways in which the participatory dynamics flipped when youth, rather than adults, took on

69

leadership and the role of the mentor—an uncommon occurred in more formal learning
settings.
Openly-networked. Digital media enables learners to cut through boundaries and
access a wide-range of resources across settings, like school, home, and alternative learning
settings. As such, these networks are cross-institutional, putting those settings—and the
learning occurring within—in contact with one another. While those capabilities place emphasis
networking, the fact that these networks are open is just as important. By being open, these
networks provide multiple entry-points for youth, giving access to n00bs and experts alike.
Moreover, they are clear about forms of assessment and certification, most notably (to date)
due to badging systems. Ideally, networks also operate through open intellectual property,
enabling access to resources (i.e. images) and tools (i.e. software) that are not denied because
of price or property rights.
Minecraft exemplifies this principle, enabling MBB to do so as well. At the broadest,
participants were able to access our server from both the library and home. This allowed them,
for example, to continue building for extended periods of time if necessary. Moreover, the
program provided participants with the chance to network their previous experiences playing
Minecraft into our program: some participants considered themselves to be builders, others
thought of themselves as helpers. Those identities shuttled back-and-forth between Minecraft
as an affinity space and MBB as a playful learning setting. From another perspective,
participants networked their experiences in school, using skill-sets developed in math, or
science, to help them obtain their own goals in MBB.

70

Perhaps even more importantly, participants often networked authentic Minecraft
resources into their gameplay—YouTube videos, block calculators, user-generated
modifications, and more. One important resource was the use of Minecraft schematics, or usercreated builds, like houses or stores, that people upload to schematic distribution sites.
Schematics, then, are downloadable files that players can upload—or paste—into their world
(Figure 3-12).

Figure 3-12. An example schematic made by a Minecraft player not affiliated with out program.

To give the feel of Metro, for instance, I pasted in certain similar looking buildings, like an
approximation of a library, to get us started. These tools and resources were open; they were
an important part of the Minecraft universe. While my description here has, to a certain extent,
begun to set up my analysis, the open access participants had to these resources was critical—
not only were they authentic, but they were also highly productive, enabling youth to achieve
the goals that they set for themselves.

71

Social platforms, like Youtube and Twitter, are typically blocked by public school systems.
The ways in which networks—so open outside of school—are closed within school hearkens
back to Dewey’s pronouncement from 1899: “the great waste in the school comes from his
inability to utilize the experiences he gets outside the school in any complete and free way
within the school itself.” Thus, in designing MBB, I worked diligently to understand the various
Minecraft practices players regularly enacted—from gameplay on servers to the creation and
installation of mods to the employment of various resource packs—and sought to make them
available as necessary for participants.
Design Conjectures: Place, M obility, and Affect
While the connected learning framework guided the design of MBB. I also developed my
own theoretical and design conjectures related to my guiding strands of place(-making),
mobility, and affect (Table 3-1). I do not view these conjectures as mutually exclusive from the
design principles of connected learning; rather, I view them as supplementary, a means to
further refine connected learning’s principles given my emphasis on place, affect, and mobility.
I sought to embed these characteristics within MBB.

Builders
Thirteen teenaged participants took part in MBB for extended periods of time (at least
one month). A number of other participants (approximately 10) dropped in on sessions for

74

various amounts of time (from 15 minutes to 2 hours). Focal participants ranged in age from 1216, all male, although females did stop in to check on what we were up to occasionally.4
Participants also varied in their Minecraft skill levels (although skill itself is complicated given
Minecraft’s open, you-can-do-anything nature). While most participants regularly hung out at
the teen center after school (e.g. socializing, playing video games, doing homework), others
came to the teen center strictly for the MBB program. Still, a few participants were stalwart in
their attendance, really driving activity—and possibilities—for others. I first provide general
background information for all participants in Table 3-2. Then, I describe my focal participants
in more detail within an Infographic-like figure below.

I recognize the gender discrepancy. Two quick responses: 1) The teen center at MPL is primarily visited
by males. While there are no formal statistics, I would put it at a 2:1 ratio. 2) Once MBB started up, I did
not formally recruit additional participants. While some newcomers joined, I believe other teens (male
and female) did not know that this was an open program that they could freely join (and leave) as they
pleased.

Others participants. A variety of others came through MBB, alongside Martin, Eddy,
Tom, Neil, and Arthur. Ricky, Doug, and Artie took part in early programming, always coming
and leaving together. They were critical in the initial stages. Jeremy also came through midMarch. Later, a new group of guys became regulars, including Malik, who frequently sang while
playing, and Jerome, who enjoyed having a common bond with the rest of the participants.
Jasper was also part of this final group, spending a large amount of his time building/designing
a single-family home. Powell also attended toward the latter stages, a true newcomer both to
the group and to Minecraft.
Data Collection
Data collection ran from mid-January to early-June. Sessions at the library typically lasted
roughly from 3:00-6:00 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The number of participants varied:
some days all computers would be filled up throughout the duration of the session. Other
days, one person would hang out with me before others would trickle in. Days in which fewer
participants attended meant that I had extended opportunities to learn about their gameplay
and to ask questions. Days in which many participants attended often meant I was playing
alongside them or taking care of technical difficulties.
In order to ensure a thick description of participant activities across settings (notably the
physical space of the library and the digital spaces of the game, although I work to eschew
such a binary), I document my observations and intra-actions as an experimental partner. The
term experimental partner aligns with an ontological shift toward “becoming with”—
becoming-with-humans, becoming-with-things (Haraway, 2007). I take experimental partnering
as an affective means of corresponding with participants (human and non-human) within the

78

setting. In short, this is an initial way to describe my role as more than participant-observer. I
sought to play as much as possible. Sometimes, I built within Minecraft on my own alongside
participants while they did their own thing. I felt the frustrations of server crashes; I felt the
excitement, the momentum and energy that developed around a unique project.
I maintained a variety of data sources (Table 3-3), including field notes, digital video, and
artifacts produced by participants. I also curated a file in the program Evernote to document all
field notes, including multiple screenshots from each day’s activity to serve as reminders of our
progress on the server. These screenshots also documented high-activity areas in which
participants played each day. Following Wohlwend (2008), I used this file “to deposit
emerging theories, to look up previous interpretations, and to question assumptions against
developing data patterns” (p. 36). I was also able to instantly search this file whenever I need to
revisit specific clips of data, for instance, thus I tagged each day of data collection by date as
well as key terms related to the day, like “Bridge Building,” “Sandcastle,” or “Redstone.”

Analytical M oves
In the following, I describe my methodological approach to my data. I do so extensively
up front in an effort to position myself alongside emerging efforts to develop mobile methods
within the social sciences. As such, my analytical movements follow interests—first in the ways
in which they are born, or sparked; then, in the ways in which they “slip and slide” among
traditional academic content; and finally, in how they evince forms of civic engagement that
takes “different shapes in different places” (Law & Urry, 2004, p. 404).
With an emphasis on mobile methodology, I turn to the ways in which I analyzed my data,
contributing three related ways of approaching mobile, (post)qualitative methods (Lather and
St. Pierre, 2013): ethnographic commuting, refrains and temporal circling. Together, these

80

contributions provide a methodological way forward as qualitative researchers continue to
grasp for ways to approach data that is always becoming, moving, “in the middle of things”
(Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 293).
M obile M ethodology
Within the social sciences, and especially in cultural and human geography, there is a
push toward developing more innovative, mobile methods (Merriman, 2014). This call for
greater expansion, diversification, of methods stems primarily from the epistemological shifts
affiliated with the “new mobilities paradigm” (Sheller and Urry, 2006). Mobile researchers, for
example, seek new ways to “capture, track, simulate, mimic, parallel and ‘go along’ with the
kinds of moving systems and experiences that seem to characterize the contemporary world”
(Büscher et al., 2010). Those working to expand existing methods question how
existing social scientific research methods that slow down and freeze experiences (the
interview, the focus group, the survey) inadequately capture mobile experiences,
practices where the context of movement itself may be crucial to understanding the
significance of the event to the participant, rather than being simply ‘read off’ from the
destination points and origins. (Fincham, McGuinness and Murray 2010, p. 2)
Thus, the argument stands that there is a need to more “accurately interpret, represent and
understand a world increasingly constituted in mobilities” (Fincham, McGuinness, and Murray,
2010, p. 5).
While my analysis aligns with this call for mobile methods, this argument is not entirely
unfamiliar to literacy researchers and learning scientists, especially those following participants’
across physical and digital spaces. Connective ethnographic methods (Hine, 2007; Leander,
2008) for instance, neither bound nor frame the sites of activity, but rather follow the everyday
“sitings” of participants across the settings. My analysis synthesizes connective ethnographic

81

methods with emerging mobile methodologies. Thus, I not only move with participants across
physical (e.g. in-room, in-library) spaces, but also follow them into the digital space of
Minecraft. I do not simply review data post hoc on a computer screen. Rather, my initial
analyses occurred in situ, with my participants as I played alongside them, built alongside
them, laughed alongside them, ate candy alongside them, and “rage quit” alongside them
(although the most rage we often felt occurred when the server crashed, destroying our
momentum). For all the “movement” that was happening, however, I was also particularly
attentive to “stillness, waiting, slowness and boredom,” recognize that those moments may be
“just as important to many situations, practices and movements as sensations an experience of
speed, movement, excitement, and exhilaration” (Merriman, 2014, p. 14). Such an approach
echoes sensory ethnographic efforts (Pink, 2013) which attend to experiential feeling, rather
than ocular-centric viewing, of data. The experience of data seeks to “create empathetic
connections” with participants, a shared goal of closeness.
Yet I by no means abandon traditional ethnographic methods. Merriman (2013) is quite
clear in calling out geographers, for instance, who jettison old methods for the new. Even
those focused on embodied, moving methods may find that “a well conceived set of interview
questions might well be far more effective [than a video recording] at capturing the tension of
the performing body as witnessed by the body of the interviewee” (Dewsbury, 2010, p. 325).
As a result, while playing alongside participants, I would frequently stop to ask semi-structured
questions about their activity. These questions would often turn into long, enthusiastic
descriptions of what they were working on, how they came up with the idea, and what they
planned on doing next. At the end of our time together, I also conducted more formal semi-

82

structured interviews, although I did invite participants to move through the game-world to
inspire further discussion, to elicit further response, or to teach me as if “I had no idea what
they were talking about.”
M obile Analysis
Often when confronted with the desire to do performative research the kneejerk
reaction is to speed fast into devising a research project that involves animating
knowledge by using video capture of one form or another: the ‘only way’ to get at
practice and performance, and any other present-tense action. (Dewsbury, 2010, p.
325)
While my analysis relied heavily on audio-video data, I want to first highlight the ways in
which I, as researcher, sought to maintain an awareness of affects reverberating throughout the
room throughout regular MBB sessions. I first describe this approach though ethnographic
commuting (Jungnickel, 2014), which, temporally, took place during and just after each session.
From there, I jump forward in time to after I had collected all of my data. There, I describe data
walking (Eakle, 2007) as a secondary means through which I moved through my data, logging it
still with an affective sensitivity. Finally I round out this description of my analysis by detailing
my implementation of temporal circling and the mapping of refrains. All of these initial stages
of analysis enabled me to target felt focal moments (Hollett and Ehret, 2014) related to
interest, academic content, and civic engagement for more thorough analysis. Importantly, for
the purposes of this dissertation, I re-visit methods in each analytical chapter (chapters 4-6),
providing further nuance to how I analyzed my data given each research question.
Ethnographic com m uting. Data analysis began at the library, in-the-moment of
gameplay. While I was highly attuned to affective intensities in the room during gameplay (e.g.
shouts, lulls, heightened attention to one in-game area), I sought to re-immerse myself in them

83

directly after collecting my data. Jungnickel (2014) has called attention to the commute that
the ethnographer takes to-and-from (or even between) data collection sites. Dubbing this
“ethnographic commuting,” she describes how her commute to and from her field site by
bicycle “became a valuable ethnographic tool” that heightened her “self-awareness in and
between field sites, interrupted [her] research and ostensibly changed the accounts of the
social worlds [she] encountered” (p. 642). In particular, she urges researchers adopting mobile
methods to question: “How are you moving between sites? Why did you choose this method?
Is this how your respondents move? Why, or why not?” (p. 647).
I did not ride a bike to and from my field site. I do want to draw attention, however, to
the part of my commute in which my analysis began: stopping at a local coffee shop directly
after data collection. The coffee shop is trivial; what happened there matters, however. Once at
the coffee shop, I dumped all data on to an external hard drive. While adding further detail to
my field notes, I would then re-enter the server space of MBB, re-visiting focal sites of activity
for participants that day—like the capitol building, or an urban farm. To onlookers, it appeared
as if I was playing Minecraft while sipping a latté. This post hoc gameplay was critical because
participants could also access the server from home (and thus change the server) directly after
school. By re-entering the virtual world, I had an opportunity to be affected, to notice, activity
that I may not have been privy to while in the moment during our program: “Who built that?” I
would wonder, or “How did that get there?” Moreover, I would take screenshots in-game of
focal areas as reminders within my (now visual) fields notes of areas to engage with when fully
immersing myself in my data.

84

Data walking. Upon returning to video data after my ethnographic commuting, I
expanded my field notes in a spreadsheet based on additional observations. I did so by
performing a variation of data walking (Eakle, 2007). Data walking is an exploration of data “as
if you were an open and receptive traveler in a new and unknown territory” (Eakle, 2007, p.
483). Such an approach is not unlike walking through physical space—there are pauses,
lingerings, lulls, moments of capture. I was also, of course, drawn back to those focal areas that
I highlighted in my field notes. These walks took me through video footage and interviews,
and notes. In addition, the three-dimensional nature of Minecraft and the footage I have within
it (e.g. iShowU video)—the fact that I see/feel the game through the eyes/body of the
participant—provided a further opportunity for me, as analyst, to correspond with participants’
excitement, frustrations, their tangents and returns. Efforts to feel, then, provided further
texture to this specific take on data walking: this is not just novel way of viewing data but,
rather, of experiencing data. As such, it aligns with (mobile) methodologies, which do not “slow
down and freeze experiences” (Fincham, McGuinness, Murray, 2010, p. 2) but rather
“apprehend and experience the mobilities of their research subjects/objects in more direct and
multi-sensuous ways—moving, being or seeing with their research subjects” (Merriman, 2010,
p. 174).
These observations came from my re-viewing of all video data in the program ChronoViz
(Figure 3-14).

85

Figure 3-14. Screenshot of ChronoViz analysis in action: two videos synced.

Within ChronoViz, I first logged the content of each video, noting particular strips of activity—
participants’ synchronous, if not collaborative, activity around a particular set of materials
(physical maps, in-game blocks, etc.). Within the software, I described each strip briefly. These
strips were “categorized” according to color. Strips of activity, as evidenced in Figure 3-14,
were blue. Because of my initial interest in how I, as a mentor, shaped inter (and intra-)action
within and beyond our setting, I also used another categorization (red) for my own pedagogical
moves. Depending on the number of other participants on a given day, I would use other
categorizations (e.g. orange, green) accordingly, especially if following surprising, interesting,
or aberrant developments.
ChronoViz was important because of its ability to sync—and then watch—multiple videos
as once. Thus, if Eddy, Tom, and Arthur were all playing together on one day, I would sync up
all of their videos to watch them simultaneously. I then exported all of these strips into a

86

spreadsheet. Within my expanded spreadsheet then, I not only summarized the general activity
from the day, but also noted timestamps of other strips, questions, aberrations for further
analysis. Additionally, I would hone in on individual videos as necessary, transcribing them
more fully in Inqscribe.
Tem poral circling. I did not only watch video, however. In addition to data walking, I
performed, what I call, temporal circling. Temporal circling adapts Lemke’s hermeneutic
circling—a means of following traversals of activity across timescales and settings where “data
of each type in each time and place point to and recontextualize interpretations of the others”
(p. 150). Hermeneutic circling is helpful when working with large data sets, especially capturing
and logging virtual world activity. By temporal circling, however, I underscore the ways in which
I went back in time to focal points of high energy, productivity, activity. I did so by revisiting
server backups of our world that I made throughout MBB. Thus, temporal circling is akin to
what I did in my ethnographic commutes, except I was not re-entering the “live” game-world.
Rather, I was re-entering backups from January, or February, or April, as necessary. No other
players were present. Temporal circling enabled me to re-experience the data from my own
avatar-embodied perspective. It was a means to supplement the video footage captured from
participants’ perspectives. Experiencing specific areas in the game world over time—in
combination with my other analytic experience of my data—enabled me to focus my analytical
attention on, what I call, refrains
Refrains. Put forth by Deleuze and Guattari (1987) the refrain (or ritournelle) alludes to
an affectively-charged block of spacetime. I employ this term to signal movement and
relationality. Within the refrain, certain practices, techniques and habits produce a temporary

87

territory. Musically, refrains are returns (and exits), parts of score that repeat, become familiar.
Deleuze and Guattari specifically define the refrain as “any aggregate of matters of expression
that draws a territory and developed into territorial motifs and landscapes” (p. 323). That is not
to say that these territories are made up by explicit borders, however: they can be “affective
complexes,” produced by the movement of intensities through bodies. Refrains settle and
unsettle; they are configured and re-configured.5
Because of the open-ended nature of our endeavor in Metro: Building Blocks,
participants often started out with a tabula rasa upon which they could build; I provided
minimal constraints. As participants made headway, new—albeit temporary—borders were
produced through their activity. That is, participants put large amount of energy and attention
into focal areas or builds. These protean borderlands are refrains (Figure 3-15). Figure 3-15
gives an example of some of the refrains produced by participants from March-April. These are
examples of where I targeted my analysis. While these refrains are visually “boxed,” they all
contain lines, trails, affects moving in-and-out of one another.

5

What I am calling “Refrains” are not unlike what Engeström calls the territory/terrain/zone of wildfire
activities. This territory is where lines (per Ingold) or “trails” (per Engeström) come together. As multiple
trails are marked, Engeström writes, “some trails intersect.” A territory is structured by means of a
network of landmarks. Multiple trails intersect, “gradually leading to a stable conceptualization of the
terrain, and subsequently again to destabilization” (p. 12). I use refrain because of my own
epistemological commitments, although Engeström, in this instance, and throughout his entire “wildfire
piece,” is blurring the lines between structuralist and post-structuralist thinking.

88

Figure 3-15. Refrains created by participants during MBB sessions over time (March and April)

Felt focal-m om ents. As a unit of analysis, I adopt what Hollett and Ehret (2014) and
Ehret, Hollett & Jocius (in submission) have called felt focal-moments: moments of interruption
that are felt upon bodies and that cause those bodies to move unexpectedly. Such a moment
arises when the body becomes a site of “intensity through which feelings, textures, and
resonances emerge” (Dawney, 2013, p. 635). While the “moment” of this unit of analysis may

89

signify a static instance, I sought out the resonances, or reverberations, that emanated from
this moment. Manning (2009) likens this emanation to elasticity, noting how “movement folds
around [this point] such that what is felt is not the point per se, but the elasticity of its
becoming “(p. 9, emphasis original). Thinking-feeling in terms of elasticity enabled me to trace
and tease out the forces that moved toward and dissipated from participants’ moments of
interruption. Moreover, elasticity provides a different kind of moving language to describe my
participants’ activity (e.g. folds, stretch, reverberate). It enables me to trace how energies
accelerate and dissipate, how force builds and releases.
Specially, within given refrains, I targeted intensities in three waves. In the first wave, I
sought out the initial sparks interest for participants, either when working with people,
concepts, or specific objects. In the second wave, I targeted intensities that were sought out
rhythms, including those at the group, individual, and individual-avatar levels. In the final wave,
I targeted intensities related to civic engagement, or political opportunity, following those
engagements across space, time, and scale.
Representations
I tell the story of this dissertation through a number of representations. My data is rich,
cutting across digital and physical space. I try not to commit too heavily to text to describe
events that occurred in-game, especially, often using screenshots to illustrate specific events.
Given the representational limitations of print, I have sought to depict my mobile analyses in
ways that do not simply freeze my data in individual, static images. While I still use static
images from my data to help tell its story (impossible to avoid), I have also created numerous
comics to move with talk, action, and feeling across the physical space of the room and the

90

digital space of the game. Thus, these representations are meant to give the sense of
circulation and movement—almost like quick, jump cuts used in film—as the reader/viewer is
forced to move along the page rather than simply view a singular image. I use comics primarily
in three ways, which I describe—and illustrate—below to ensure clarity as the reader
encounters them in ensuing chapters.
M oving alongside participant-avatar through virtual world. In this example, the
comic is simply read from left to right, and from top to bottom (Figure 3-16).

This comic, too, moves from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Each interlocutor’s discourse bubble
is a different color: the first to speak has a white bubble, the second to speak is yellow.
Connected bubbles aim to give a sense of simultaneity: interlocutors are not necessarily always
taking turns but often overlap (Figure 3-17).

These comics contain two images in them: The main image depicts the primary interlocutor
and his screen. Embedded within that image is an image from another interlocutor’s screen.
Although talk is often happening simultaneously, the main image and its bubble are read first,
followed by the embedded image and its bubble (Figure 3-18).

Research Q uestions
With the analytical chapters following, I re-visit my research questions.

93

1) How are learners affected, or moved, toward interest-powered learning opportunities? And
how do interests move and circulate in service of learning?
2) What is the topography of learning within an informal, media-rich setting, and what
vocabulary can describe the ways in which it takes form?
3) How does civic engagement move and circulate during participation in this game-based
program?

94

CHAPTER FOUR
INTEREST-PO W ERED M OBILITIES: M O VEM ENT AND CIRCULATIO N O F
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN THREE PARTS

…to have a body is to learn to be affected, meaning ‘effectuated’, moved, put into
motion by other entities, humans or non-humans. If you are not engaged in this
learning you become insensitive, dumb, you drop dead. (Latour, 2004, p. 205)
In this section, I address my first set of research questions: How are learners affected, or
moved, toward interest-powered learning opportunities? And how do interests move and
circulate in service of learning? In answering these questions, this chapter refines the “interestpowered” principle of connected learning (Ito et al., 2013). Specifically, I draw on theories of
affect and mobility to target the front-end of interest and engagement, the ways in which
interests spark, or ignite, and then spread. In the end, I argue for the need for educational
researchers to follow—and respond to—interests as they emerge rather than positing them as
a priori constructs internalized within individual learners. In order to dislocate interest from this
internal state, I trace its emergence through a series of mobilities.
I present this analysis as a series of three movements, akin to those in a symphonic
score. Each movement makes contact with guiding concerns from new mobilities scholarship:
1) the mobility of people/bodies; 2) the mobility of ideas/information; and 3) the mobility of
materials/objects (Hannam et al., 2006). Through this tripartite approach, I intend to depict
these findings as parts of a fuller-experience for participants within Metro: Building Blocks
(MBB) as opposed to isolated, bound incidents. Musically, a movement is transitional—new
movements within a score consist of different rhythms and tempos, like allegro, adagio, or

95

sonata. The various movements, of course, fit together as a whole despite the short, silent
breaks in-between. The first movement describes the affective intensities resonating between
two participants: I analyze this as passengering (Adey, Bissell, McCormack, & Merriman, 2012);
the second movement describes affects that emerge between a participant and a specific
concept with which he works: I analyze this as mutability (de Laet & Mol, 2000); the third
movement describes lingering affects, embedded within peer-produced virtual objects, which
stir participants toward action: I analyze this as residue. In the end, I argue that interestpowered learning opportunities opened up and moved throughout this setting by affects that
both pushed and pulled participants, that lured and lingered.
From Interest-powered Learning to Interest-powered M obilities
Youth interest constitutes the core of connected learning. As such, connected learning
is “interest-driven,” or “interest-powered.” At its most general, connected learning is “realized
when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of
friends and caring adults” (p. 4). It is important for both academic and community institutions
to provide resources and opportunities for youth to pursue their interests alongside one
another. Peers and adults within these institutions facilitate the important dialogs and practices
that can extend these pursuits into other domains. This process of “building connections to
other areas of expertise from the base of an area of deep interest is core to the connected
learning model” (p. 57).
There is a deep history of scholarship on interest and learning from which connected
learning builds (Hidi, 2000; Hidi & Renninger, 2006; Krapp, 1999). Hidi and Renninger (2006),
for example, detail a four-phase model of interest development, which thoroughly reviews

96

much of the scholarship on interest. The first phase of interest development, they argue, is
triggered situational interest. This phase is short-term, resulting from changes in emotional and
cognitive processing. These changes stem from surprises, for instance, intensity, or personal
relevance. This initial stage of interest can shift into maintained situational interest, focused
attention and persistence over a brief duration of time. Maintained situational interest occurs
when one was immersed in short tasks, especially those that provided opportunities to
collaborate with others. These tasks are often novel or complex. From here, an emerging
individual interest can develop, a desire to repeatedly engage with a particular activity or
content. This phase of interest is characterized by “positive feelings, stored knowledge, and
stored value” (p. 114). It is often driven by curiosity, a desire to ask—and solve—questions that
that are self-generated. Finally, emerging individual interests can lead to well-developed
individual interests. This deepest phase of interest is signaled by continuous (re)engagement
with particular tasks for which the student has a well-developed interest. In this case, students
not only self-generate challenges and questions, but also have collected ample resources to
help solve those problems, persevering even in the midst of frustration.
Studies of interest are not unrelated to studies of student engagement. Hickey’s (1997)
review of engagement traces a variety of research, much of it coming from experimental
psychology. Literature on engagement arrives in various guises, cutting across issues related to
student goals, motivation, and interest. Dweck’s (2000) treatise on cognitive-motivational
patterns, for instance, details the self-theories that people develop and the internal,
psychological worlds they create for themselves as a result. Those who hold entity views, for
instance, treat intelligence as fixed, stable. In contrast, those adopting an incremental view,

97

treat learning as malleable, as something that can be altered, changed. The learning goals for
each respective theory of intelligence shape forms of engagement.
As Azevedo and colleagues (2012) note, however, “experimental psychology has been
mute about the processes underlying student engagement” (p. 59). As such, the experimental
situations deployed have been unable to capture the realities—and complexities—of learning
settings, both formal and informal. The literature has been unable to provide answers for
questions such as: How does interest or engagement
develop over periods typical of lessons or whole units (e.g., days or weeks)? How does
engagement emerge from the interactions among participants in a classroom? How
does the material infrastructure available to students, analyzed in a moment-by-moment
fashion, affect their ability to engage classroom material? (p. 59)
While Azevedo and colleagues’ questions provide a way forward, a means to get interests and
engagement out of the head, these questions continue to promote an approach to interestpowered learning that is bound, contained, in numerous ways. They are concerned with the
temporal containers of lessons and units, for example, as well as the spatial containers of
classrooms. But Azevedo and colleagues also introduce new questions for those exploring the
genesis of interest and engagement, wondering how those engagements spread among
“participants in a classroom,” how the very materiality of infrastructure and tools (“interest
objects”) impacts engagement and interest. These questions are critical, moving educational
research toward an understanding of interest-powered learning that recognizes its contours, its
variability, rather than tracing it along a linear pathway of phases. Importantly, Azevedo calls
attention to the emergent qualities of interest and engagement, how interests and
engagement can develop in a “moment-by-moment” fashion. Interest, as I will argue, is not an

98

a priori entity that must be connected to a specific activity, rather it moves and emerges inbetween—in-between bodies, in-between ideas, and in-between (im)material objects. Interest,
I argue, is mobile.
Interest, Affect, and Enthusiastic M obilities
Scholars adopting the new mobilities paradigm have sought to differentiate the various
qualities of movement. These qualities include, for instance, the speed of movement, as well
time, tempo, and rhythm. Cresswell (2013) has particularly highlighted the relationship
between friction and movement, how friction draws attention to “the ways in which people,
things, and ideas are slowed down or stopped (p. 108). In addressing my research questions, I
am particularly attuned to interest-powered moments where things appear to slow down—
where bodies take interest (Dawney, 2013). To analyze these moments of interest, of affective
sparks, I draw on recent work from mobility studies which explores the intersection of mobility,
affect, and enthusiasm (Hui, 2014). Enthusiasm spurs mobility. Enthusiastic relationships among
“people, things, and ideas shift the capacity and potential for mobilities” (p. 173). Connections
among people, ideas, and objects “reveal and inspire potential movements” (p. 173). These
are enthusiastic mobilities.
Hui (2014) distills enthusiastic mobilities down to three components: atmospheres that
promote mobility within space, forces pushing people through space, and lures pulling people
to space. In this chapter, I am particularly concerned with the latter two. Attention to affect,
enthusiasm, and mobility displays ecologies of affect—the ways in which disparate affects
bundle together (i.e. affect manifested as fear + affect manifested as enthusiasm), pushing and
pulling a person through space. For example, mountain bikers, cycling downhill, follow “desire

99

lines”: residual traces of mobility, of interaction with the world, which project possible
trajectories for people. In response, Hui notes that the “push and pull relationship of affect
therefore becomes central to the mountain bikers’ movements” (p. 176). Similarly, parkour, a
form of street running, or urban gymnastics, also illustrates this affectively-charged push-pull.
Parkour enthusiasts, for example, not only propel themselves through space—their enthusiasm
carrying, pushing them forward—but they are also lured in by the qualities of specific walls or
rooftops. Exploring enthusiastic mobilities is therefore, Hui writes, “not about identifying
people who move during emotional states of passion”; rather, “it is about interrogating
relationships where passion and inspiration are manifest in mobilities” (p. 173). To target
moments in my data in which “passion and inspiration are manifest in mobilities,” I further
refine my overarching mobile methods to account for the specific forms of “following” that I
perform. I articulate this methodological nuance below.
M ethodological Refinement
Researchers have adopted mobile methods in variegated ways. Jungnickel (2014)
provides a thorough overview of mobile methods, including methods that follow those that
“follow the people, thing, or idea.” This approach is most recognized in Marcus’ (1998) stance
that multi-sited ethnography is useful for “suturing locations of cultural production that had not
been obviously connected and consequently, for creating empirically argued new envisionings
of social landscapes” (p. 93). In my analysis, I build from my previously described methods by
performing a variation of this approach. While my participants were not physically mobile, their
collaboration, their ideas, and their avatars were. And, importantly, much of this movement was
powered by enthusiasm. Thus, in the first movement—passengering—I begin with an

100

enthusiastic felt focal moment as two participants collaborate with one another. In the second
movement—mutability—I begin with an enthusiastic felt focal moment as one participant
moves with and develops a specific structure over time. Finally, in the third movement—
residue—I begin with an enthusiastic felt focal moment related to an in-game object that lures
a participant toward it, moving, and pulling him toward participation. To be clear, however, I
am not arbitrarily trifurcating people/things/ideas. When moving with people, for instance, I am
often moving with ideas; when moving with ideas, I am often moving with things.
Relatedly, by presenting these findings in movements, I do not intend to imply that they
are mutually exclusive. Rather, I argue that these movements are very much related: they are
separated here for clarity. Within each movement, I organize my followings by (1) providing a
thick description of the interactions among participants, game-based artifacts and/or characters
that contribute to the refrain; (2) identifying the felt focal moment; and (3) analyzing the ways in
which learning opportunities emerged from that felt focal moment.
Three M ovem ents
M ovement 1: Passengering
In this section, I describe the ways in which enthusiastic affects reverberated between
one collaborative pair, Martin and Jeremy. Specifically, I emphasize the ways in which Martin’s
bursts of excitement in learning how to create a non-player character (NPC) spurred Jeremy’s
own interest-powered learning. As such, I contribute an expansion of peer pedagogy (Carter
Ching and Kafai, 2008) that emphasizes the affects between learners and (peer) teachers as
they move forward together along a learning trajectory. Borrowing from mobility studies, I will

101

refer to this affective learning progression as passengering (Adey et al., 2012; Hui, 2014;
Laurier et al., 2008)
On the third day of activity (January 28), Martin and Jeremy worked next to one another
in-room, but far apart from one another in-game. Martin worked by the Columbia riverfront;
Jeremy by B. Dewitt Dam (Figure 4-1).

102

Figure 4-1. A map of Metro, including the initial refrains, in its earliest stages of the MBB
program, the final two weeks in January.

Martin picked up where he left off the previous day, concentrating most of his activity on a park
adjacent to the Columbia River. He took his time, first clearing out aesthetically unpleasant

103

blocks, then placing down the sidewalk that circled throughout the park. To do see, he drew
on inspiration from both his own embodied experience in the park, as well as a host of pictures
that he called up via Google Images. He recognized that there was no art in the park, so he
built his own: a circular stone structure reminiscent of a globe. Upon completion, Martin
explored the surrounding landscape, stopping by the library, and eventually finding an open
area with nothing nearby it. He began to build a giant rupee, a form of currency found in video
games.
Once the rupee was completed—an hour and twenty-five minutes after his arrival—
Martin made his way to the capitol building, which he built in a session the previous week—
and began exploring the creation of non-player characters (NPCs). NPCs are in-game
characters with whom human players can interact. In a role-playing game, for instance, an NPC
might send a player on a quest, or give her a healing potion. In MBB, participants used a
modification to the game called “Custom NPCs,” which allowed players to create and insert
their own NPCs into the game. In designing his NPC, Martin took his time, testing out the
different possibilities for an NPC—trade with it; giving it a bow, a sword; enabling it to move
quickly, slowly. Eventually, Martin created a skeleton, making it a guard that would protect
Martin if other zombies came and attacked him (Figure 4-2).

104

Figure 4-2. Martin’s process of creating an NPC, including selecting the type, altering its
settings, placing it, and adjusting it (clockwise, from left).

Martin’s playful trials taught him that he could make an automatic “spawner”—a block that
would infrequently spawn, or create, additional skeleton guards. This awareness led him to
shout out, “Ohhhh….oh God!...Oh jeez!” as he realized what he had just stumbled upon.
Textually, it is difficult to show feeling, the ways in which Martin’s interest began to transform at

105

this moment and how it adhered to Jeremy. Audibly, this moment sounded like this (Figure 43):

Figure 4-3. Audio visualization of the rise of Martin’s excitement and Jeremy’s initial orientation
toward it.

I identify this moment of excitement between the two participants as a felt focal moment, the
instant in which Jeremy and Martin both exuded an increased level of interest, of momentum,
evinced through their body-talk. This enthusiasm re-oriented their participation as Jeremy,
seeing what Martin had just created, beseeched: “You gotta show me how to do that…”
Initially, Martin took the lead, giving Jeremy an overview of possibilities for the creation
of an NPC: the kinds of NPCs available, their capabilities, their aesthetics, and more. But Martin
was still learning how to work with the NPCs himself: His skeleton guard would not actually
guard him; rather, it would simply walk toward enemies without shooting arrows. Jeremy was
unimpressed, asking: “So, it just leaps at him?” With a captive audience, Martin had to quickly
figure out how to fix his supposed guard: he tweaked the “Advanced” settings, assigning the
skeleton the role of “Guard.” Upon his return to the game, his skeleton had now attacked a
nearby zombie, turning the zombie into a slab of rotten meat (as so happens in Minecraft).
Martin then spawned a number of zombies for his guard to practice on (Figure 4-4).

106

Figure 4-4. Martin’s guard defeats the dreaded zombie horde.

Martin’s guard made quick work of the zombies, shooting arrows which engulfed the zombies
in flames. This led Jeremy to exclaim, “Whoa! They’re super fast!” He then began to work on
his own guard.
While Martin instigated the implementation of NPCs, Jeremy quickly caught up—
becoming more active, more excited—testing out new capacities for the NPCs on his own.
Jeremy partially narrated his progress, asking questions to Martin along the way (Figure 4-5). I
present their dialogue in the following figures in comic form, as a means to move with talk as it
traverses both real and virtual, room and game:

107

Figure 4-5. Jeremy seeks Martin’s guidance as he develops his own NPC.

Jeremy queried the interface that enabled him to create an NPC. He began by asking for
Martin’s help, although Martin was caught up in his own NPC creation. As Jeremy cycled
through different options for his NPC, he encountered an issue with which Martin also just

108

overcome: the rate at which his NPC would fire a weapon. This piqued Martin’s attention—he
knew how to solve this issue—and he leaned toward Jeremy, clarifying that a fire rate of one
would be slow.
With the issue of fire rate solved, Jeremy tested out his NPC—but nothing happened.
His NPC would not retaliate against nearby enemies. Jeremy was frustrated; he kept tweaking
options—narrating them out loud— but nothing seemed to work. Jeremy again posed his
question out loud: “Why won’t he shoot?” His frustration, and desire to figure out what was
wrong, was evident in his rapid talk as he again sought an answer in the NPC interface,
hovering his mouse over options: “Stats…AI.” When nothing in the interface clarified the issue,
he called out to Martin: “Can you please help me?” Martin guided Jeremy to the “Advanced”
tab; from there, Jeremy chose the kinds of monsters he wanted his NPC to attack, clicked save,
and returned to the game to find that his NPC had attacked and killed a nearby zombie (Figure
4-6).

Figure 4-6. Jeremy solves his NPC problem with Martin’s guidance.

Analysis: Passengering as affectively-charged peer pedagogy. Martin and
Jeremy progressed forward, learning how to create NPCs together as they encountered a
difficult, yet engaging. This experience, however, was not just interest-powered, but interestpropelled. Martin and Jeremy learned how to develop NPCs alongside one another, rapidly
prototyping, failing, re-adjusting and, finally, succeeding. But this learning progression, I argue,
emerged from more than their dialogic interaction between one another, or the spatial
configuration of their bodies. Rather, it was affectively-charged, led forth by the enthusiastic,
responsive, push-pull between Jeremy and Martin. This is passengering.
Etymologically, the term passenger dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries where it
marked both the person who travelled, as well as the person, or thing, that enabled the
travelling. Within cultural geography, a number of studies have investigated the experience of
the passenger (Adey et al., 2012; Hui, 2014; Laurier et al., 2008). These studies note that the
“bodily experience of the passenger—be it by boat, car, or train— is not simply one in which
[the body] is an anonymized parcel of flesh…shunted from place to place just like other goods”
(Thrift, 1996, p 266). Rather, for one to become a passenger, one is always in the emergent
process of “being” or “becoming with” (Bissell, 2010, p. 270). In fact to talk of “‘fellow
passengers might gesture to the fraternity of togetherness that emerges through moving with
others” (Adey, 2012, p. 171). Passengers are always “becoming with” someone or
something—other riders, other drivers, other things. In “becoming with,” the passenger
emerges through the “torsion of the active and the passive; the deliberative and the
acquiescent” (Adey et al, 2012, p. 187). Over a span of 12 minutes, I argue, Martin and Jeremy
“became with” one another.

111

In previous work, I have described the ways in which various “bodies”—human and
non-human—“became with” one another throughout the experience of gameplay (Hollett &
Ehret, 2014). In that case, I described how those bodies—including chairs, lights, game
characters, sounds— were “in a constant state of becoming” with one another throughout the
experience. In the case of Martin and Jeremy, while I emphasize the enthusiasm that propelled
both of them to learn how to implement NPCs, in-game bodies (the ability to make NPCS,
zombies, spawners, etc.) certainly contributed to the emergence of this enthusiasm. Jeremy’s
interest, initiated by Martin’s shouts, waxed and waned as he sought to create his own
skeleton-guard. He was first captivated by Martin’s overt excitement, lured in by those shouts
and the fact that Martin could now, conceivably, spawn as many zombie-guards as he wanted.
But Jeremy’s interest faded as the skeleton-guard failed to do its job: it only leapt at its target;
it would not shoot the zombie. Martin felt, and responded to the attenuation of Jeremy’s
enthusiasm, rapidly trying to figure out what was causing this failure. Martin’s so-called
“success,” then, was not only apparent in his guard’s crushing defeat of a horde of zombies,
but also in Jeremy’s renewed excitement toward learning how to create his own skeletonguard. “Please, show me how to do that,” Jeremy requested again.
Figure 4-7 illustrates this sense of “togetherness” that emerged among Martin, Jeremy,
and even the in-game “bodies” throughout their joint-production of NPCs. It re-visits pivotal
moments (portrayed as images or through quotations) introduced above. Rather than isolating
individual frames, however, I am interested in ebb-and-flow of enthusiasm and how it propelled
both Martin’s and Jeremy’s creation of their respective NPCs.

112

Figure 4-7. Enthusiastic flow across Martin, Jeremy, and in-game bodies toward production of
NPCs.

While affective intensities reverberated between the two players throughout the duration of
their play, this twelve-minute period was particularly charged with affect. In this span, an
energy—and excitement—emerged that propelled the production of NPCs further for both
Martin and Jeremy. I put forth passengering as a form of peer pedagogy (Carter Ching & Kafai,
2008) that results from “becoming with” another learner, from repeated affective encounters
between (or among) learners. Passengering is one form of mobility within this learning setting.
In this instance, both Martin and Jeremy moved onward—they traveled—together as they
learned how to develop NPCs. While Martin’s initial affective encounter introduced NPCs to
Jeremy, affective intensities continued to reverberate between Martin and Jeremy as they

113

experimented with alternative ways to create NPCs. Martin and Jeremy became-with. They
moved together, further learning how to work with NPCs, through this torsion between active
and passive, deliberative and acquiescent.
Martin passengered Jeremy, acting as both catalyst of his learning, then docent, and
then learning partner. This shepherding, I recognize, is not unlike the long history of
conceptions of learning that appreciate scaffolding by more capable others (Rogoff, Paradise,
Arauz, Correa-Chávez, & Angelillo, 2003), collaborative learning (King, 1993), or peer
pedagogy (Carter Ching & Kafai, 2008). Passengering offers an extension to peer pedagogy,
however, that moves beyond “patterns of student collaboration” (Carter Ching & Kafai, 2008,
p. 2611). Martin certainly fell into patterns of talk—responding to Jeremy, suggesting what to
click—but Jeremy’s successful creation of an attacking NPC was the result of more than simple
guidance throughout this episode. In “becoming with” Martin, Jeremy sensed and felt his
excitement. He responded to that enthusiasm, and that enthusiasm pushed him to pursue a
new learning goal. Martin, too, responded to Jeremy—first his initial intrigue, then the waning
of his enthusiasm, and later his pleas for his help. Patterns of talk—which cohere to make up
the “everyday collaborations between experienced and inexperienced students” (Carter Ching
and Kafai, 2008, p. 2611)—cannot describe the feeling that surrounds emergent learning
opportunities. Passengering provides further nuance to the experience of learning alongside
another.
M ovement 2: M utability
This section transitions into an explicit focus on the ways in which learning opportunities
circulated between Martin and a non-human component of the game that he created. That is,

114

rather than following the enthusiasm that circulated between two players learning together, I
now follow a specific idea—a lighting system developed by Martin. Specifically, I focus on the
mutability of the lighting system, the ways in which Martin repeatedly manipulated the lighting
system, building it in multiple locations, to re-new interest—and learning opportunities—for
himself.
Our initial production of Metro began on the Columbia Riverfront Park—a large familyfriendly greenspace that the city recently developed next to Argonaut Stadium. The park
includes a play area for youth, including climbing walls, waterspouts, as well as a nearby
walking trail that is designed to attract butterflies. A small stage sits in the middle of the park, a
flat green in front providing seating for an audience (Figure 4-8).

115

Figure 4-8. A juxtaposition of the actual park (top) and as built by participants (bottom).

The pedestrian bridge looms over the park, making travel to the other side of the river easily
accessible. Next to the Pedestrian Bridge is the Bridge Building, a small structure often used
for celebratory events because of its proximity to the riverfront, large windows, and rooftop
view. An elevator stands along the southern side of the building, making the Pedestrian Bridge
easily accessible from the park.
The group spent its first two weeks together working on the riverfront. Artie and Ricky
carved out the area for the park; Eddy and Tom built the bridge; Doug developed the elevator

116

leading up to the bridge. Martin, however, planned, built, and designed the jewel of the park:
The Bridge Building (Figure 4-9).

Figure 4-9. A juxtaposition of the actual Bridge Building and Martin’s re-vision of it.

Because of the persistence of the virtual world, and the (a)synchronous nature of our activity,
new builds emerged while some participants were not physically present. Notably, the
elevator, for instance, came about while Martin was not in attendance. Upon his return to the
group, and the server, the following week, Martin, made his way toward the park, saying, “I
had an idea of what I could build today. I was thinking about building the building across from
the elevator. The Bridge Building.”

117

Later that day, while Martin was working on the building, Tom entered the room/game,
and remembered: “Last time I was working on lights.” To effectively work on lights, he needed
the gaming environment to be dark, so he used the in-game command “/time set 40000” to
change the game mode from day to night. All commands were visible for all players, so this
command showed up on Martin’s screen as well (Figure 4-10).

Figure 4-10. Tom sets the time; a notification appears on Martin’s screen.

This emphasis on lighting triggered something in Martin—it affected him—and pulled him
away from his work on the Bridge Building. “Oh, I just had a brand new idea,” he said
immediately. He then readied himself to develop a lighting system for the elevator that would
move a current of energy up the elevator one block at a time, signifying the elevator moving
upward. I identity Martin’s sudden shift from the Bridge Building to the lighting system as a felt
focal moment. From here, I analyze what I will describe as the mutability of this intricate
lighting system which he will make—and alter—multiple times throughout the duration of the

118

program. Importantly, that initial affective encounter stretched across space (in-game locations)
and time (three weeks) each instance in which Martin reconfigured his lighting system.
Martin’s lighting system—in which he used a particular block called redstone—was
intricate. As he initially described it:
I had the idea for a redstone schematic that would be lights and the redstone would
move up the light strand, because it would have a red stone torch on top of each
redstone lamp. The redstone torch below that, on the lamp, on the next lamp down,
would activate the one above it, turning it off, so you would kind of have this endless
stream of lights moving up the elevator, and I was going to check like the first thing that
I need to do is kinda build a redstone clock…
Briefly, redstone—a specific block in Minecraft, just like cobblestone or sandstone—is the only
block that can carry the equivalent of an electric charge. When redstone blocks are linked with
redstone dust and a redstone torch that electric charge can travel (Figure 4-11).

Figure 4-11. A crude redstone demonstration.

Martin’s redstone “schematic” was much more elaborate (Note: I will continue to use the term
schematic to follow Martin). He employed what are called “redstone repeaters” to propel a

119

greater amount of energy through the system. For aesthetic purposes, he designed this
redstone schematic underground, out of sight, below the elevator (Figure 4-12).

Figure 4-12. Martin’s underground redstone schematic and aboveground elevator.

While Martin’s expertise with redstone circuitry is worthy of deeper analysis (which I revisit
through another participant in the following chapter), I focus particularly on how he continually
adopted this redstone schematic for other purposes across space and time—the ways in which
this concept—this specific redstone schematic—moved throughout our cityscape, serving a
similar purpose, yet subtly re-arranged each time.

120

Martin’s redstone schematic was mutable. It moved and changed form over time.
Throughout the next week, Martin moved this particular schematic to two other locations. As
the group continued to work on Columbia Riverfront Park, they eventually created a large
stage for concerts and other public presentations. Martin recognized that the stage needed a
lighting system, so he dug underground once again, planted his redstone clock and then
linked it to glowstone blocks that he placed on the stage. Martin not only flexibly used his
schematic in different locations, but also consistently re-created a version of it based on the
underground landscape (Figure 4-13).

Figure 4-13. Martin’s underground redstone schematic and its aboveground stage.

121

In another instance, Martin built a small restaurant that overlooked the Columbia River inside of
the Bridge Building. Once again, he reconfigured his redstone schematic to produce a stream
of lights rising upward from the base of the restaurant (Figure 4-14).

Figure 4-14. Martin’s redstone schematic re-configured as exterior restaurant lighting.

Analysis: M aking light with m utable m obiles. Martin’s redstone schematic is a
mutable mobile (de Laet & Mol, 2000). It is a fluid concept. As a mutable mobile, it not only
allowed Martin to work with it in three discrete locations but it also allowed him to test out his
continually burgeoning expertise each time. Martin generated learning opportunities for
himself, gradually increasing his own level of difficulty, as he repeatedly encountered a new

122

problem set consisting of new materials within a new setting—the material configuration of the
elevator was much different than that of the stage; the material configuration of the stage was
much different than that of the restaurant. His interest, in this case, spread, moving across time
and space through his consistent re-production of the schematic-as-idea.
Mutable mobiles, as de Laet and Mol (2000) write, are fluid. Their boundaries are vague
and moving. There are “many grades and shades of working,” they write. “[T]here are
adaptations and variants” (p. 225). Mutable mobiles are strong because of their adaptability,
flexibility, and responsiveness. Furthermore, mutable mobiles challenge what it means to be an
actor, allowing that category to “include non-human, and non-rational entities” (p. 227). de
Laet and Mol pursue the notion of a mutable mobile through their description of a
Zimbabawean bush pump, how it not only acts as water-producing device but also as
sanitation and hydraulic device. It takes on a new state depending on the actors using it, the
materials it with which it combines, and the needs of a particular setting. This is not to say that
the pump is “everywhere and anything,” they write. Rather, its “various boundaries define a
limited set of configurations” (p. 237).
Martin did not consistently re-configure his lighting schematic in a vacuum, though.
That schematic existed in social milieu that blended together our MBB community with the
overarching community of Minecraft. His lighting system lingered and provoked, it drew others
towards it. When other players were nearby the elevator, for instance, Martin had the
opportunity to describe the ways in which he “rigged up the elevator.” That is, Martin’s interest
not only emerged through the mutability of idea of the schematic in-and-of-itself, it also
emerged—or even took on a new form—when he could share that idea with others.

123

Showcasing his work in situ to other participants also enabled Martin to reflect upon and
question the design decisions that he had made. When describing to Ricky how the elevatorlights worked, for example, Martin began to re-think is design: “Now that I think about it, I
should have made the lights actually part of the elevator. Just like destroy the corners and then
move them, like one block in,” he told Ricky.
Martin’s redstone schematic, like the bush pump, had its own limited set of
configurations. It was meant to produce light—yet Martin was able to re-arrange how the
schematic emitted light each time based on both the underground layout upon which he built
the schematic, and the above ground layout of the lighting system. Thus, not only did the nonhuman schematic move Martin towards additional learning opportunities, but those learning
opportunities were also dependent upon other non-human components of the game (e.g. the
ground, the elevator, the stage, the restaurant).
In the following section, I build from this focus on mutability to delve further into the
role of the non-human in activity, particularly how it lingers and lures. Specifically, I focus on
the ways in which non-human artifacts—oftentimes left in the wake of activity—acted as
affective lures for participants, especially as entry-points for newcomers to the group. I call this
affective residue.
M ovement 3: Residue
Throughout the duration of the MBB, participants often encountered vestigial artifacts,
or markings, resulting from the activity of other participants. As a result, participants would pick
up where others left off, finding inspiration in existing builds, in order to take part in
production-centered activities. Field notes from Day 15, for instance, describe the ways in

124

which two new participants—Neil and Lito—were drawn to the affective residue left by others
the previous week:
Today, two new guys showed up, Neil and Lito. After a few minutes of poking around
the downtown area, Tito asked: “Do you have Lawson?” “Yeah,” I replied, “Some guys
just started building it last week.” “Cool, I’ll work there then,” he said. Both Neil and
Lito attend Lawson, a nearby magnet school. Both guys flew their avatars over to
Lawson with Lito critiquing the current build, saying Lawson doesn’t have those, like,
castle things on the sides—they’re more in the center.” Unable to deal with this issue,
he got to work laying down the floor inside the building. I flew over and helped him
out.
In this movement, I further elaborate on the productive detritus from previous activity that
enticed others toward it—what I call affective residue. Affective residue denotes existing
products—builds, structures, or objects in this setting—which first lured participants toward
them and then engendered learning opportunities for those participants. I pay particular
attention to the ways in which affective residue moved participants toward in-bound learning
trajectories (Nasir & Cooks, 2009) through Neil and Lito’s initial interest-powered continuation
of Lawson.
In describing affective residue, I first detail the initial production of Lawson by Ricky,
Jeremy, and Doug. Then, I jump forward in time two weeks to the point in which Neil and Lito
were lured in by the remnants of Lawson. In this sense, rather than “follow the thing”—
Lawson— as it moves through space, I follow the thing as it moves (or, rather, remains still)
through time.
Leaving It For Others: The Initial Stages of Lawson
About two weeks into the program, we began working as a group along a major
thoroughfare in downtown Metro. Because Lawson was located at the western edge of this

125

area—and because many of the participants attended the school—they decided to build it
together. Doug, Ricky and Artie began discussing an approach: Who should build the stairs?
What about the columns out front? The process was slow as we tried to negotiate the height
and width of the building. Ricky pulled up images of Lawson from Google Images, using them
as models to build the façade of the school. What ensued was a complex adjudication that cut
across digital, physical, and imagined spaces. In short, Ricky is trying to build a frame for the
school, counting off the embrasures at the top of the building. Jeremy, who does not attend
Lawson, begins to add “half slabs” to Ricky’s work—which Ricky calls out for not being
accurate. Doug, who has been monitoring development of the school, inserts himself into the
conversation, letting everyone know that the height of the building is, in fact, wrong. I illustrate
this process in comic form to illustrate how residue initially becomes embedded in-game
(Figure[s] 4-15):

The group did not make much headway. About five minutes after this exchange, three of them
had to leave for the day. Because of circumstances related to their respective after school
schedules, they were unable to return to the group to complete the school. Thus, Lawson
remained unfinished, a rough frame and the foundation for two columns the only identifiable
features (Figure 4-13).

Picking Up the Pieces: Lawson as Entry Point for Newcom ers
Just over two weeks later, Neil and Lito joined the group for the first time. They each flew their
avatars around the main strip of downtown, checking out buildings, but unsure of what to do. I
return now to Lito’s first meeting with Lawson from my fieldnotes to describe the school as
form of affective residue:
After a few minutes of poking around the downtown area, Lito asked:
“Do you have Lawson?” “Yeah,” I replied, “Some guys just started building it last
week.” “Cool, I’ll work there then,” he said. Both Neil and Lito attend Lawson, a nearby
magnet school. Both guys flew their avatars over to Lawson, with Lito critiquing the
current build, saying Lawson doesn’t have those, like, castle things on the sides—
they’re more in the center” (Figure 4-17).

129

Figure 4-17. Malik watches on as Neil and Lito add on to Lawson.

Lito was searching for some way to contribute on his first day. His excitement to take part in
this program—and this new opportunity provided by the library—was evident. But, he came on
his own, curious about this Minecraft program people were talking about in the teen center.
Without any real peer docent, however, he was unsure of how he could contribute: What could
he build? What was possible? What might be frowned upon by regular participants? Lito was
pushed toward the program by his enthusiasm; an interest in Minecraft brought him there.
Lawson, however, pulled him in. It provided him with an in-bound learning trajectory that
already existed. That is, the persistence of the virtual space pre-loaded the world with peerdriven possibilities for Lito. These possibilities, in turn, mobilized his participation. And he took
advantage of this opportunity, quickly offering design critiques to Neil, stating: “Lawson
doesn’t have those, like castle things on the sides—they’re more in the center.” From there, he

130

got to work, re-shaping those “castle things” to his liking, and finishing off the floors for each
level in the school.
Analysis: Persistent artifacts as affective lures. Affects push and pull. They
catalyze mobilities. Lito, as noted, was pushed toward the program by initial interests related to
Minecraft, to an overarching peer culture. Once in the program, however, that interest
stagnated: Lito did not know what to do, how to contribute. The skeleton remains of Lawson,
however, pulled him in. They acted as an affective lure, giving Lito a means to effectively
enter—and contribute to—the community instantly. Lawson was saturated with affective
residue, traces of participation that previous participants had left behind—buildings, bridges,
homes.
It is important to note, however, that Lito did not move towards those buildings,
bridges, or homes. He was lured toward the school, likely because of his familiarity with it (the
fact that is was multi-spatial, existing in both the physical and digital world), but also because it
was incorrect: Lawson didn’t “have those, like castle things on the sides.” Lawson, as both a
real virtual and affectively-charged edifice, put Lito on an in-bound trajectory of participation.
He was already an expert to a certain degree: He regularly moved toward, through, and from
(the real, physical) Lawson each day. While educational researchers frequently describe, and
encourage, the funds of knowledge (Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992) that teachers can
activate in formal learning settings, researchers have placed less emphasis on embodied waysof-being that youth tap into on their own. That is, how do learners, move, for example, at
home? How might that movement contrast with how they move outside of school? (Ehret &
Hollett, 2013). Here, I argue, that Lito does not simply make a “strategic connection” (Moll et

131

al., 1992, p. 132) to those embodied experiences, but an emergent connection to them: his
own history of moving through the city of Metro, of arriving and departing from Lawson,
intersected with his participation in MBB at this time (his first day at MBB) and this space (sitting
down with the group for the first time) with this thing (Lawson High). Because of the coming
together of these elements—time, space, thing—Lito rapidly found a productive line of
participation for himself, one in which he was particularly interested.
Interest in digital media spaces—especially social networks—waxes and wanes.
Facebook, for instance is structured in such a way that the “new”—comments, pictures, links—
continually overtakes the old. As a result, interest spikes and flat-lines. My emphasis on residue
stems from research within these venues, particularly in the social networking “traces left on
projects or profiles such as ‘love-its,’ friend requests, ‘favorites,’ ‘likes’ and even gifts …that
show that users have viewed and appreciate projects” (Grimes & Fields, 2012). Grimes and
Fields call this “networking residue”—all of the chatter and discussion that emerges on social
networking platforms around a given topic. Oftentimes, that chatter, however, dies out rapidly,
either buried by other posts, or replaced by new, more pressing topics (see Shapiro & Hall,
2015). Lee (2014) provides a striking visual of this gradual affective deterioration through the
rise and fall of Twitter-based discussion surrounding the Ebola virus in the fall of 2014 (Figure
4-18).

132

Figure 4-18. Ebola-related tweets from, July 28th through September, 19, 2014. Accessed from:
http://goo.gl/97zayu

Unlike social media networks, in which that residue is buried, only accessible through variations
of deep, digital scraping (Shapiro & Hall, 2015), virtual worlds—and the objects and artifacts
within—are persistent. As opposed to the affective spikes evident in social networking, virtual
worlds produce affects that are potentially sustainable: Residue is accessible rather than
submerged. This residue, then, has the potential to affect—and re-affect—participants like Lito.
While this is not an apology for virtual worlds, I am struck by the ways in which affects resonate
from artifacts and objects, luring learners toward them, moving learners both physically and
emotionally. Unlike a school classroom, which might be called a site of erasure (e.g. whiteboard
wiped clean after each period, markers re-writing the same notes, over previous etchings, each
class period), the server that MBB operated on was a site of duration. Previous artifacts

133

persisted, like Lawson, their residue flickering with affect, drawing potential participants
towards possible learning trajectories.
Sum m ary
In this section, I have addressed my first set of research questions: How are learners
affected, or moved, toward learning opportunities? And how do interests move and circulate in
service of learning? Analytically, I have targeted felt focal moments as sparks of interest. From
there, I moved forwards and backwards through time and space, tracing the contours of
interest development. Learners were affected toward learning opportunities in variegated
ways: First, through passengering, or interest that moved and circulated through affective
intensities resonating between participants; second, through mutability, or interest that moved
and circulated through affective intensities resonating between participants and concepts; and
third, through residue; or interests that moved and circulated through affective intensities
resonating between participants and peer-created objects embedded in-game.
I answered these research questions in a series of movements. In doing so, I recognize
that the dissertation genre in which I am writing does not typically support brief snapshots. In
fact, each of these movements could be extended into its own analytical chapter. That
predicament, however, is precisely what makes working with topological, or relational, theories
of place so frustrating—and so powerful. Lines, per Ingold, or stories, per Massey, are always
moving though place, knotting up, or coalescing temporarily. But other lines, and stories,
remain invisible, dismissed, forgotten. In this chapter, I have specifically targeted instances in
which participants were moved, lured, toward potential learning opportunities, with an eye

134

(and body) toward initial sparks of interest. And I have demonstrated that these instances—and
intensities—are not always individually, or even human, driven.
Of course, there were many other interests operating throughout MBB—from Minecraft,
to the challenge of building Metro, to the opportunity to collaborate with friends at the library
after school. All of these are other lines moving and circulating throughout this program,
components of the meshwork. Still, this begs the question, and I return to Massey’s query: “…if
everything is moving, where is here?” Here, I argue, is made by participants through placemaking, which I revisit in my final discussion—chapter seven—to bring together the ensuing
analytical chapters.

135

CHAPTER FIVE
TO PO GRAPHIES O F LEARNING: AM PLIFICATIO N, PRO PAGATION,
OSCILLATION

Introduction
In the previous chapter, I was particularly attuned to affectively-charged moments that
signaled initial sparks of interest for participants. I traced the relationship between affect,
mobility, and interest in three movements, emphasizing affective reverberations between
peers, affective reverberations between participants and mutable ideas, and affective
reverberations between participants and peer-created objects. In this chapter, I shift my
analytical attention toward the topography of interest-powered learning. I alluded to the
topography of participation in the previous chapter, particularly through my description of the
affective flow—rising and falling—between Martin and Jeremy. I use the term topography here
to denote the relief, or the texture, of participation within MBB. Through topography, I hope to
both “express and enliven,” the ways in which participants—as a group—come together, only
to pull apart, following their own lines of activity. Topography, I argue, can attune the
researcher’s gaze—and body—to the contours, the relationality of activity within a given
setting.
Moreover, rather than isolating static instances of “academically-oriented” participation
(Ito et al., 2013), I trace the relief of activity within this setting—following its contours—to
illuminate when, how, and through what configurations, learning opportunities arise. To do so,
I refine analytical approaches to movement and mobility through an explicit emphasis on

136

rhythm. Thus, by focusing my analysis focus on activity surrounding the development of one
artifact in MBB—a transit station—I contribute three ways of moving alongside the rhythms of
participation: amplification, propagation and oscillation. These three approaches to rhythm
help me address my second research question: What is the topography of learning within an
informal, media-rich setting, and what vocabulary can describe the ways in which it takes form?
“Check-Box” Learning W ithin and Across Inform al Settings
Research within informal, media-rich settings has, to date, focused primarily on
individual trajectories—how to track and map youth learning, participation, or identity
development, over time, checking boxes for what learners did, like blogging of playing a
game, or with whom they interacted (Barron, 2013; Dixie, Ching, Santo, Hoadley & Peppler,
2014). And this overt emphasis on the individual is justified given that a tell-tail sign of learning
within informal settings stems results from learners’ participation in an activity “for its own sake,
often engaging in it intensely of their own accord and remaining committed to it of their own
accord” (Lemke et al., 2015, p. 3). While this research certainly emerges from corpuses of data
that include collaborative learning engagements, it does not account for the dynamic
experience of learning for youth within—and beyond—these settings. That is, this research for
does not trace the ways in which learning moves and fluctuates, ebbs and flows; how it rises in
intensity, whether individually, with a collaborator, or among an entire group. Barron’s
biography of one learner, for instance, details Luis’ developmental pathways as a producer of
stop-animation films over time, noting that he played “reading and math games” at school
from the ages of eight to nine and played computer games from home during that same span.

137

Others have adopted similar ways of documenting learning across space-time. Nacu and
Pinkard’s (2012) portrayal of one youth’s activity at YouMedia, for instance, illustrates her
development of new media skills—primarily photography—over a two-year duration as
relatively static points (Figure 5-2). Both cases exhibit signs of techno-determinism, focusing
primarily on tools employed, like “computer games” (Barron, 2013) or “photo” (Nacu &
Pinkard, 2013), thereby disconnecting those forms of participation from the socio-emotional
milieu within which youth find themselves in informal, media-rich settings

Figure 5-1. Activity at YouMedia over time (Nacu & Pinkard, 2012).
More recently, however, Lemke and colleagues (2015) have called attention to this
socio-emotional milieu. They conclude that “the scope of valued learning outcomes for
informal learning activities should include social, emotional, and developmental outcomes as
well as content knowledge and should include learning by groups and whole projects as well as

138

by individuals” (p. 89). Rather than individual snapshots, Lemke and colleagues cite the need
to follow learning as it scales across individuals, groups, and projects. They do so by breaking
down their overarching outcomes into two categories: the first dedicated to social-emotionalidentity development and the second dedicated to the cognitive-academic development, or
what they call “know-how.” Each category of analysis, then, contains its own outcomes for the
project/community, group, and individual. Table 5-1 depicts this matrix:

Table 5-1: The outcomes-by-levels model for documentation and assessment of informal
learning in media-rich environments.

Yet, despite the multi-scalar (e.g. project/community, group, individual) approach to
documenting and assessing learning in informal settings put forth by Lemke and colleagues, I
wonder: To what degree do these different scales support, or collide with, one another? To
what degree do they co-exist, albeit perhaps at different intensities for different individuals?

139

How are individuals pulled in to the group, only to pull away on their own accord? How do
elements of one scale, spark, or ignite, another? What if, as opposed to plotting learning as a
series, or pathway, of incremental practices over time, we visualized it as musical score, with
varying intensities, combinations, and connections (Figure 5-3)? Steiner’s artistic representation
of “Solitude,” for instance, disrupts traditional, Western musical notation systems by depicting
the “texture” of various sounds over time—the rising and falling of intensities, near-silences,
rapid fluctuations. Steiner’s work, I argue, depicts a musical topography.

Figure 5-2. “Solitude,” a musical score depiction by Hans-Christian Steiner.
With Steiner’s depiction of “Solitude” as an influence, this chapter questions: What is the
topography of learning within an informal, media-rich setting, and what vocabulary can
describe the ways in which it takes form?
Theoretical Refinem ent
In describing my theoretical orientation, I want to bring back key points from my initial
focus on place, mobility, and affect. In terms of place I again call attention to what is moving
within a given setting. For example, Leander and colleagues (2010) allude to Lefebvre’s (1991)

140

description of a house to initially describe their take on learning-in-place. Rather than
contained, the house is “permeated from every direction by streams of energy which run in
and out of it by every imaginable route: water, gas, electricity, telephone lines…and so on” (p.
92-93). This house is a “complex of mobilities,” an “active body” (Leander et al., 2010, p. 332).
Through this emphasis on the mobilities coursing through the house, Leander and colleagues
pivot toward classrooms, questioning what happens when researchers “destroy the
appearance of solidity” and instead see the movements, the flows, operating within and
beyond:
What types of materials (books, clay, earthworms, mounds of trash), energies
(electricity, gas), resources (federal money, lottery surplus), information flows
(Channel One, Internet, parent phone calls) permeate the classroom from every
direction? (p. 333)
By following materials, energies, and information flows, the classroom becomes less as a
container and more nexus of relations: a (relational) place. Such a vision of place resonates
with Ingold’s (2011) description of the meshwork, a “web of flows,” he writes, that come
through the “intertwined trails along which people carry on their lives” (p. 149). Place—the
meshwork— is produced through the “binding together of lines, not in the connecting of
points” (p. 152).
But not everything moves in the same way. The world is not awash in fluidities (Marston,
2005, p. 423). As Marston and colleagues note, scholarship has confronted its own static,
structuralist calculus, by replacing it with the language of flows and fluidity. According to this
approach, they note,
the material world is subsumed under the concepts of movement and mobility,
replacing old notions of fixity and categorization with absolute deterritorialization and

141

openness. While we do not find ourselves at odds with the possibilities of flow thinking
per se, we are troubled by what we see as liberalist trajectories (absolute freedom of
movement) driving such approaches, particularly when these develop alongside largescale imaginaries such as the global and the transnational. (p. 425)
An overt emphasis on fluidity fetishizes movement in a way that makes invisible its blockages,
coagulations, and assemblages (p. 425). To alleviate this fetishization, scholarship on place and
affect has begun to provide a language that recognizes the dynamics of movement. In other
words, rather than considering the lines that are moving through a given setting, scholars have
turned to rhythm to describe the topography of that setting, tracing, feeling and moving
alongside its contours (Figure 5-3).
Rhythm brings together place, mobility, and affect, while also providing a vocabulary to
describe the textures of a given setting. Everywhere there is an interaction “between a place, a
time, and expenditure of energy,” Lefebvre writes, “there is rhythm.” For Deleuze rhythm is
entwined with sensation. Rhythm, is “a movement ‘in-place,’ a spasm . . . the action of invisible
forces on the body’ (Deleuze, 2003, p. 41). While there is a large literature dedicated to rhythm
and place, ranging from Lefebvre’s influential rhythmanalysis (2004) to more recent studies in
human geography (e.g. Edensor, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013), I am drawn to Henriques’ recent
(2010, 2014) exploration of the vibration of affect within a given setting (i.e. a Jamaican
dancehall), because of its emphasis on bodies that move and feel. Specifically, it acknowledges
the dynamics of movement through bodies, including their “relationships, reciprocations,
resonances, syncopations, and harmonies” (p. 58). This rhythmic variation of movement,
Henriques (2010) writes, is made with a “control-release pattern, or movement and rest” (p.
77). Overall, a rhythmic take on movement consists of

142

the intensive variations, (meta)stabilities, and transmissions of activity that underpin and
constantly – imperceptibly – reorganize the seemingly permanent substance and
phenomenological qualities of material, physical, and perceptual entities. (Henriques,
2014a, p. 19)
Furthermore, this approach does not simply break rhythm down into eurhythmia or arrhythmia
(pace Edensor, 2013), for instance, but rather provides the language to describe the ways in
which bodies—both in ensemble and as individuals—move.
To trace the topography of activity within MBB, I adapt three approaches to rhythm that
describe the “kinetic expression of feeling” in activity (Henriques, 2010; Table 5-2) across three
scales: 1) the collective-group (ensemble); 2) the collective-individual; and 3) and the individualgame. The first approach at the scale of the collective-group, amplitude and amplification,
underscores the “driving up [of] pressure gradients, temperatures and volumes, or accelerating
intensive processes” (p. 81). These intensities, however, spread from the group toward the
individual—they propagate—opening up new, affectively-charged, opportunities for
participants. Thus, following amplification, I turn to propagation. Finally, I dial down to microrhythms that emerged within MBB by describing the oscillations that participants enacted
during gameplay, or the ways in which they routinely expanded and contraction activity across
embodied perspectives.

143

Table 5-2. Guiding rhythmic elements.
M ethodological Refinement
An emphasis on rhythm in this chapter necessitated a few methodological tweaks to my
overarching analytical approach. Just as in the previous chapter, I continue to adopt a mobile
methodology (Büscher, Urry, & Witchger, 2011), moving with participants through our real
virtual space. When “walking” through my data (Eakle, 2007), however, I paid attention to
forms of participation within specific refrains that were particularly saturated with affect. That is,
those refrains which lured all participants toward them—and facilitated participation—at some
point during a given session. This emphasis led me to focus more closely on the transit station,
which I describe in more depth below. My interpretive coding of this data, then, was further
informed by my aforementioned emphasis on rhythm. My process can best be described as
identification, coding, and comparison of the guiding rhythmic elements of amplification,
propagation, and oscillation (e.g. Leander & Lovvorn, 2006, and their analytical deployment of
Actor Network Theory). To be clear, however, these elements are very much entwined,

144

operating simultaneously, although separated here for analytic purposes. This rhythmic
orientation is emergent and incomplete, by no means encompassing all rhythmic elements
present within a given setting, yet it is a productive heuristic for describing the topography of
learning and activity within an informal, media-rich setting.
Data and Analysis: The Topography of Activity
In this section, I analyze the topography of activity—the rhythmic ebbs, flows, bursts, and
pulsations—surrounding the development of a transit station spearheaded by Arthur. After a
brief description of the initial stages of Arthur’s development of the transit station, I then turn
to the three focal characteristics of rhythm—amplification, propagation, and oscillation—as
they coursed through participants’ experience developing the transit station.
The Transit Station
The most prominent build in Lutece Place was the transit station. The station was to
Lutece Place what Martin’s Bridge Building was to the Columbia Riverfront: participants
gravitated toward it, finding ways to participate in various components of the system, like
setting down tracks, building the front lobby, or even test driving the cars. Arthur, however,
was the mastermind behind the whole system, having begun the transit station on his own by
appropriating components of it from a YouTube video demonstration. “There really wasn’t any
kind of transportation,” he said, so he “built something that the community needed.” Here’s
how Arthur described how the train station worked once (nearly) completed (Figure 5-3):

145

Figure 5-3. Arthur’s explanation of how the transit station operates.

146

While the transit station was never developed to the point that tracks were connecting different
neighborhoods in the city, its production became a hotbed of activity over a three-day period.
The second day, on which I focus the ensuing analysis, demanded the greatest workload from
participants. This day, more than the others, was the most affectively-charged. In addition to
Arthur, Tom, Eddy, Neil and Jerome all took ownership of some component of the system. An
energy developed across the real virtual setting as each participant, to some degree, jointly
envisioned and developed the transport system alongside Arthur. I begin with an overall
description of this day before focusing more explicitly on the intensities coursing throughout.
Prior to Arthur’s arrival that day, all other participants worked on individual projects.
Neil continued to work on an urban farm, which he had begun previously. Tom and Eddy
entered about twenty minutes later. Tom had brought his personal laptop with him, hoping he
could use it to modify our server through a specific package called “Feed the Beast” (FtB).
Eddy tried to help Tom. Upon realizing it would be to difficult to install on each computer,
Eddy re-entered our server, observing a number of buildings before flying his avatar to a Metro
station entrance, not yet connected to the transit station, and entering it. Tom, however, did
not want to give up and continued to research FtB, staring down at his laptop. While Tom
continued to work on FtB, Jerome entered the room, flying back over to the movie theater that
he had started in another session (Figure 5-4).

147

Figure 5-4. Eddy, Jerome, Tom, and Neil simultaneously, geographically distributed across
game-world at 3:30 PM.
Thirty minutes after Eddy and Tom arrived, Arthur entered as well, flying his avatar back
to his transit station, ready to get back to work. Upon Arthur’s arrival, Eddy stood up and

148

walked over to him, asking if Arthur was the one who had started to build the transit system.
Eddy explained to Arthur the plan that he developed to connect the transit system to the
underground Metro stop that he had explored earlier. Arthur agreed to the plan, recognizing
the distribution of labor. Jerome then walked over to Arthur, first asking Arthur to explain how
the transit system worked, and later acting as track tester, riding the carts to troubleshoot any
problems. Tom, realizing that trying to install FtB was futile, joined in as well, asking if he could
build a “canopy” and signs for the waiting area. Neil flitted back and forth between his new
project, a fallout shelter, and the transit system.
Arthur’s arrival shifted the rhythm of other participants in the room. Analytically, I
identify his arrival as a felt focal moment. Not unlike my emphasis on passengering in the
previous chapter, the enthusiasm Asher and Eddy exuded as they developed the transit station
was contagious, adhering to Jamal, Neil, and, later, Tom who each adopted tasks within the
emerging project. This enthusiasm amplified the energy in the room. Arthur and Eddy, for
instance, became highly engaged in the production of a fully functional transport system; Tom
participated in bursts, focusing primarily on the entrance to the station; and Neil flew his avatar
in to check in on the action, before returning to his own build (Figure 5-5). Jerome, less skilled
than the others, found a way to become an active participant by testing out how well the rails
actually worked by riding in a rail cart, as wells by querying Arthur about how it worked.

149

Figure 5-5. Eddy, Tom, Arthur, and Neil converge at the train station at 4:15PM. Jerome had
turned off his screen-capture software after leaving briefly.
In the following, I attend to the rhythmic dynamics that reverberated throughout the
production of the transit station. First, I focus on the rhythmic dynamics of the group, moving
alongise the emergent amplification of the setting. Then, I follow one participant as he peels

150

off in his own related direction, following the affective propagation of intensity. Finally, I scale
down further, following the rhythmic oscillations of one participant-as-avatar.
Am plification
The amplitude of this moment rose steadily, over time, building up to Arthur’s arrival
and the subsequent joint-production by the group of the transit station. As evidenced in Figure
5-4, all participants were geographically distributed throughout the game world prior to the
rise of energy which, inevitably, drew them toward the transit station and the activity
surrounding it (Figure 5-5). This rise of energy indicates amplification, the felt-sense that
reverberated among Arthur, Eddy, Jerome, Tom, and Neil, bringing them all together in the
moment. The energetic buzz surrounding the transit station necessitated multiple
participants—a crowd, so to speak. Thus, amplification, as Henriques (2014) writes, “requires
energy…These intensities are expressed across areas and volumes, as pressure, force, effort,
heat or auditory volume.” In the following, I concern myself with the ways in which this
energetic force “expresse[d] itself” across area, or space, and adhered to others participants.
Acceleration toward this period of intense production was most evident in Eddy’s
participation. Eddy, at first hoping to install the FtB on our server with Tom, was lured toward
the unfinished Metro stops, residue from previous unfinished activity. Curious about why the
Metro stop didn’t connect to the transit station, Eddy began to consider taking the completion
of the tracks on as his personal project for the day, exploring the subterranean lair prior to
Arthur’s arrival. At this point, Eddy was in the early stages of extending the track of the Metro
stop—and of realizing how difficult it would be to connect them to the existing transit station.

151

When Arthur arrived, though, Eddy noticed that Arthur was also working near the transit
station. Because Eddy and Arthur typically did not attend NBB on the same day, Eddy asked,
“Are you the one that’s working on [the transit station]?” Once Arthur confirmed, Eddy told
him his plan: to make the tracks connect to one another.
As a result of their collaboration, activity surrounding the connection between the
Metro stop and the transit station continued to accelerate. Upon Arthur’s logging in to the
game, Neil, although focused on his own build, acknowledged Arthur’s entrance by chatting
“wb,” or “welcome back” to Arthur. Jerome returned to the game as well, immediately sensed
the flurry of activity surrounding the transit station and began to explore it. Arthur quickly
realized there was an issue with the transit system: the carts were not moving forward with a
passenger; rather, they were getting sent back to their original location (a fail-safe of sorts that
Arthur had created to maintain enough carts in the system). In short, Arthur needed to install a
specific rail along the track to “detect” when a passenger was present, thus propelling the cart
forward. Arthur began to narrate his own progress, and the issues he was confronting, to others
out loud: “THAT’S WHY”, he blurted. “I figured out the problem! I think. Yup! No detector rail!
I connected that for nothing. I’m so proud of myself.” Jerome enticed, by Arthur’s narration,
jokingly responded: “I’m proud of you, too.” Arthur continued to demonstrate aspects of the
transit station to Jerome, hopping in to a mine cart to exhibit how the various train lines work.
Upon successfully doing so, Jamal, expressing approval, said: “Like a Boss.”Participants’
energies continued to amplify this moment, now luring Tom in—and away—from his attention
to the FtB server. As Tom engaged with the production of the station, he noticed the system

152

that Arthur had put in place to make carts continuously re-generate for passengers. Tom flew
his avatar around the building, stating: “I gotta try it now.” To understand the mechanics of
the system, Tom was able to “open [it] up” to “see how it works”—literally breaking (and later
replacing) the blocks so he could see the mechanism itself. As Tom checked it out, Arthur
clarified what was happening, noting that the “trap door makes a quick enough pulse for one
cart to come out.”
While Arthur did not give himself credit, the ability to drop carts down for passengers
was quite profound. Facilitated by simple circuits, a redstone torch sent an electric pulse
through redstone dust (creating a current); the trapped door, then, received that current
(Figure 5-6).

completion.

153

As a result of Arthur’s brief tutorial, Tom now understood how the redstone mechanism
opened the trapped door and dropped a cart down to the rail. From there, Tom became
heavily invested in the entrance to the station, beginning to self-generate tasks for himself that
would add to the collaborative effort: “What if we put a blocker here?” he asked Arthur before
moving on, and continuing “Can I build, like a canopy part, and maybe some signs on these
[buttons]?” It is important to note, from this instance, that amplification not only accelerates
from human-human interaction, but also through the (potential) energy residing, as evidenced
in the previous chapter, in both ideas (this complex mechanism) and things (redstone-powered
entities).
By this point, the pronounced amplitude related to the production of the transit station
began to fall, to decelerate. Although Tom’s attention was directed toward the development of
the transit station’s canopy, Arthur’s work was primarily finished. Thus, Arthur flew his avatar
toward another project, leaving both Tom (now working on the canopy), Eddy (continuing the
connection of tracks) and Jerome (testing out the carts), to complete their own projects, all of
which were off-shoots of Arthur’s original creation.
It is important to note that amplification does not reside simply in the collective
ensemble, or in individuals themselves. While Arthur’s presence certainly catalyzed the energy
surrounding the transit system, the system itself was an assemblage, consisting of—to recall
elements from the previous chapter—mutable ideas, as well as residual “things.” Jerome, for
instance, continued to pepper Arthur with questions about how the system worked; Tom,

154

already aware of how it worked, began saw possibility in how he could contribute to, and
expand, Arthur’s original conception.
Amplification offers a means to target, or move with, affectively-charged flows of
activity. It builds through movement: Physical bodies move toward each other, digital avatars

155

come together, chat messages are sent, ideas are altered (Figure 5-7).

Figure 5-7. Amplification through coming together of bodies, avatars, messages, ideas.

156

This movement of “information, people and things, Engström (2009) writes, “create textures
that are constantly changing but not arbitrary or momentary” (p. 4). Amplification is not unique
to informal, media-rich settings like MBB; it is not uncommon in any given learning setting,
although certain constraints—including those related to bodily surveillance, or audible volume,
for instance—modulate the amplitude of more formal settings. This is not to say that a greater
amplitude is more desirable in a learning setting, either. But intensely amplified settings do
open up new forms of participation for learners. Amplified settings are emergent, dependent
upon accelerations and decelerations; energies rise and fall, only to ignite again elsewhere.
Moreover, through an emphasis on amplification, I have sought to move away from
individual acts of engagement—or deep, extensive immersion in one topic, or activity—
seeking, instead, to follow how amplification beget emergent forms of participation for
numerous participants. In the following, I trace one of those emergent forms of participation
through an emphasis on propagation, a means to describe the affective spread arising from the
group ensemble.
Propagation
The energy that surrounded the group’s joint-production of the transit station began to
propagate. By propagation, I mean the transmission, or spread, of intensity from the group to
the individual and his or her subsequent (pop-up) objectives. Importantly, propagation is both
“individual and collective” (Henriques, 2014), p. 99): it is not stripped away from the group.
Rather, propagation serves as a mean to accent individual, affectively-charged practices that
occur simultaneously alongside those of the group. In this case, heterogeneous participants

157

work together “symbiotically,” thriving not only on mutually beneficial partnerships, but also on
their mutual energy (Engestöm, 2009, p. 6). For instance, individuals, like Tom, began to offer
their own extensions to the (collective) station. Lured in by the amplified transit station, Tom
now had the opportunity to offer his own, personal contributions to what had become a jointproduction by the group.
One way in which amplified energy propagates is through, what Henriques (2014) calls
inflection. In terms of rhythmic expression, inflection denotes the ways in which a pitch, or
tone, can be altered, modulated. Specifically, when describing inflections, Henriques (2014)
calls them the “twist, the flick, the spin—that special touch of novelty that makes a style
distinctive” (p. 82). Inflection entails unique personalizations that arise from intensities.
Inflection denotes “personal style,” where certain elements are “selected for additional
emphases” (Henriques, 2014, p. 82). Tom’s ongoing production of the “canopy,” an entrance
to the transit station, was his own extension of the intense activity surrounding the station. It
displayed his own style, his own, unique “spin” on what the station’s entrance could look—and
feel—like to visitors. Although he had left to work on a new project (the propagation of energy
in a separate toward a separate objective), Arthur continued to come and check on Tom’s work
over a period of forty minutes (Figure 5-8).

158

Figure 5-8. Arthur’s checks in on Tom as Tom builds the transit station’s canopy.

Over that period of time, Tom set down wood flooring and created his canopy out of a
combination various brick elements, including blocks and individual stairs to give off a roof-like
pattern. Tom’s inflection resulted from the energetic rise surrounding the transit station. It
emerged naturally alongside the ongoing development of the station. That is, it did not arise in

159

a vacuum on its own. Tom’s inflection was an expression that was both “individual and
collective.”
I want to hold propagation closely to amplification, to intensity. That is, while participants
regularly built their own unique artifacts, propagation, as described here, is not separated from
the energetic build-up resulting from amplification. Participants, like Tom, pulled apart from
the group tenuously, moving in their own individual(-collective) directions yet maintaining
“presence” with the group. Tom, for instance, consistently punctuated his building process
with (embodied) discourse directed towards the group, both directly related to his work (e.g.
asking them to check out his evolving canopy) and unrelated to it (e.g. joining in on singing
songs with Jerome; although, I’d argue that singing along was just as connected). In that
regard Tom entered into rhythmic cycle of individual-collective work à direct consultation à
indirect “presencing” à individual-collective work.
This rhythmic movement across the real virtual space, and collective-individual
contributions echoes (very) early work on networked settings, which sought to support a “social
rhythm and density of interaction necessary for community building (Mynatt, Adler, Ito &
O’Day, 1997). This work calls for the need for networked venues to provide workers, or even
learners, with the “ability to engage in many different kinds of interaction, such as ‘face-to-face’
conversation, ‘hallway’ meetings, and greetings, or peripheral or ambient awareness of ‘distant’
noise or conversation” (p. 211). Moreover, the authors note importance of “livability” within
networked spaces that enabled members to enter into “different but reliable social rhythms for
interaction” (p. 199). In this case, however, I want to accent how Tom rhythmically cycled

160

through these forms of social interaction—not because they were built into the system, but
because of the propagation of that affective intensity that surrounded the transit system.
Propagation signals a felt-response to collective intensities. It enables playful, individualcollective participation: the opportunity to be a part of something, working—and feeling—
alongside others incrementally. Propagation does not arise from neat, pre-planned pathways;
rather, propagated participation stems from pulsations, excitable bursts, the desire to
contribute to the collective, while also testing out one’s own developing expertise. As such,
the stakes for participants are relatively low as no individual takes completely control of the
ongoing project.
Oscillation
Rhythmanalyses often seek to unearth, or feel out, the multiple rhythms, or
polyrhythms, operating within a given setting. Lefebvre, for instance, senses not only to the
rhythms of the body, but also to those of institutional, regional, national, and even global
scales (DeLyser & Sui, 2013, p. 299) embedded within place. In the following, and building
from the propagation of affect from the group to the individual, I hone in further on bodily
rhythms that participants regularly enacted throughout the program. Specifically, I focus on the
ways in which participants regularly oscillated, or cycled, among embodied perspectives during
activity.
Oscillation denotes the expansion and contraction of activity. Here, I am particularly
attuned to the ways in which participants regularly oscillated, or cycled, through embodied
perspectives in-game. I describe this oscillation by elaborating on Eddy’s efforts to connect the

161

transit station to the nearby Metro stop. In particular, I pay close attention to Eddy’s oscillation
between his first-person embodied perspective and a god’s-eye, map-based perspective to
coordinate his activity.
Eddy’s experience that day was not completely removed from previous practices he
enacted. Throughout MBB, participants often deployed cartographic representations to
identify their location or to follow a desired trajectory of movement. Using a modification (mod)
to the game called MapWriter, participants were able to locate themselves in-game using a
mini-map positioned in the top-right corner of the screen, a frequent feature of first-/thirdperson video games (Figure 5-9). The map itself displayed one’s position in the center, as well
as one’s orientation (i.e. which direction the player was currently facing).

Figure 5-9. Example of mini-map in top-right corner.

162

Players could also toggle back-and-forth between a full screen map and the mini-map. In
addition to enabling a player to locate themselves in-game, the full screen map also allowed
players to plot their own way points, making it easier for them to move from one location to
the next or to name specific regions or areas. Moreover, the full screen map provided one’s
latitude/elevation/longitude as a distance from the player’s origin, or spawn point (Figure 513). In this case, Minecraft uses latitude to reference the number of blocks the player has
moved horizontally (x-axis) from that point, elevation to denote how much higher or lower she
is from the point (z-axis), and longitude to describe how far vertically (y-axis) she has moved
from that point.
Making the connection between the Metro and transit station necessitated that Eddy
orient himself to the distant transit station while below ground. That is, Eddy had to figure out
not only where he was located in reference to the transit station, but also what direction he
needed to build toward in order to make the connection. Thus, because the Metro tracks were
underground, Eddy was quite literally in the dark—both in terms of the surrounding landscape
and in his understanding of which direction he needed to move. To remedy the former, Eddy
began to place light bulbs around the cavern, thus greatly improving his ability to see. To
improve the latter, Eddy remembered about the capabilities of the mini-map. It dawned on
him: “Oh, I have that map that goes above my head so I can see where I’m going!” At this
point, Eddy began to rhythmically oscillate between first-person (avatar) and god’s eye (minimap) perspectives—moving forward incrementally by cycling between the two.

163

Using the map’s representation of his avatar as a guide, Eddy began to build the
underground tracks in the general direction of the transit system, recognizing that he would
have to turn the tracks multiple times to make them line up. He rhythmically oscillated between
his first-person perspective and map-based perspective, hybridizing the two in order to
continue his forward progress (Leander & Lovvorn, 2006). This oscillation led to repeated
adjustments, shifting his avatar-body one block to the left or right side in order to align himself
correctly with rapidly approaching location of the transit system (Figure 5-10).

Figure 5-10. Eddy repeatedly oscillated between first-person embodied perspective and god’seye perspective to orient himself.
Eventually—and guided by the map—Eddy found himself in the vicinity of the train
station, letting Arthur know: “I’m getting really close to your thing!” Because he was
completely underground, however, Eddy only knew of his proximity to the transit system
because of his oscillation between first-person avatar and god’s-eye map. Eddy did not want to
tunnel beyond the station, however, so he began to move forward incrementally. At this point,
Eddy added another map into his cycle, opting for the full-screen map upon which he could
plot specific points to both find his current location as well as mark his desired location (Figure
5-11).

164

Figure 5-11. Eddy toggles to the full screen map in order to check his location when compared
to the train station.

For Eddy’s purposes, two coordinates were important: 1) his own personal position in respect
to the train station and 2) his desired position, or where he wanted to tunnel up and break the
surface in front of the train station. By hovering his cursor over the arrow representing his
avatar, the map displayed Eddy’s latitude, elevation, and longitude coordinates (-452, 48, 676).
Because he wanted to be exact with the location in which he would both stop building tracks
and then tunnel upwards to the surface, Eddy plotted a stopping point for himself on the map
(-447, 64, 678), naming the point “STOP.” Over a period of fifty seconds, Eddy observed the
map, hovering his cursor first over his personal coordinates and then over the stop coordinates
(Figure 5-12).

165

Figure 5-12. An enhanced version of Eddy’s overhead map, depicting the view from his current
location and the view from his stop location.

After three hovers back and forth he said out loud, yet to himself, “452…447.” With those
numbers in mind—a distance of 5 blocks—Eddy then exited the full-screen map and returned
to his avatar’s perspective, oscillating again between avatar and mini-map with the knowledge
(and feeling) that he had to move his avatar forward those five blocks. He tunneled forward a
distance of seven blocks (as opposed to the required five, although it did not make a
difference), set down the tracks, and then tunneled upward, breaking through the surface and
arriving directly in front of the train station, shouting, “Okay, perfect, look, look where I am!”
In the end, Eddy spent nearly one hour oscillating between avatar-body and mini-map
in order to extend his track.

166

In a final interview, Eddy reflected on his use of maps throughout the program, stating:
We started looking at a lot of maps and I started to see where all of the major buildings
were, so you go down to the city and you see all these bigger uh buildings, and you’re
like, oh yeah that big building’s on second and that’s on first so you know like, you can
basically see the map while you’re standing there.
There is a difference between looking at a lot of maps and being in a lot of maps. Even further,
however, there was a greater difference in being in maps and moving in maps, of being
mobile. Eddy’s oscillations between first- and god’s-eye perspectives were rhythmic, constantly
moving as he progressed forward from the metro station toward Arthur’s transit system. Rather
than taking on the perspective of an avatar, I argue, Eddy became the arrow, on his mini-map,
that represented his avatar. As a result, Eddy entered into what might be called embodied
metonymic activity as his avatar-body was translated into the directional arrow (map-body).
This experience for Eddy was highly mobile, however, forcing him, initially, to adjudicate
between avatar-body and map-body. Later, once he toggled into the full-screen map mode,
Eddy was also forced to play with temporality, plotting out future locations for his avatar-body
and coordinating how to arrive there. Following Leander and Lovvorn (2006), then, it was never
that Eddy himself was simply “smart and motivated” in working to connect the tracks. Rather,
Eddy-as-avatar-body became embroiled in a robust configuration that mobilized him—that
affected him—by enabling these rhythmic oscillations. Classroom and gameworld, write
Leander & Lovvorn, “are not dull and unmotivating merely because they are filled with
unmotivated persons. They are unmotivating because they are immobile” (p. 336). Eddy—and
his activity—was incredibly mobile, continually oscillating across embodied perspectives to
overcome a self-generated challenge.

167

Sum m ary
In this chapter, I have described the topography of activity in MBB. Rather than isolating
static instances of so-called “academics,” I traced the relief of activity within this setting—
following its contours—to illustrate the ways in which activity was an emergent production,
often bubbling up in felt-response to other participants. In describing the topography of
activity, I have also contributed an initial means to move across the multiple levels, or scales,
put forth by those documenting and assessing learning in informal, media-rich settings (Lemke
et al., 2015), which call attention not only to individual learning, but also to the development of
the group and project. Specifically, I followed the contours of activity through an emphasis on
rhythm. I focused my analytic attention on the development of one artifact in MBB—a transit
station—to contribute three ways of moving alongside the rhythms of participation:
amplitude/amplification, propagation, and oscillation. Amplification described the accelerating,
and dissipating, intensities during activity: the joint-production of the transit system by all
present participants evidenced amplification. Propagation described how those intensities led
individual participants to peel off toward their own, related projects. Tom’s unique, personal
flourishes on the transit system provided him access into its production. Finally, oscillation took
these rhythms to a micro-level, describing the rapid back-and-forth that Eddy enacted as he
hybridized both avatar- and map-based perspectives.

CHAPTER SIX
CIVIC GEOGRAPHIES: ENGAGING CITIZENSHIP ACRO SS SPACE, TIM E, AND
SCALE

Introduction
My previous analytical chapters followed two “lines” of MBB’s meshwork, respectively.
First, I targeted sparks of interest, moving alongside participants as they pursed their personal
interests, like learning how to make non-player characters. Then, I followed the topography of
activity by following the rhythmic contours of participation in MBB. In this chapter, I foreground
civic engagement, another dominant “line of growth” that stretched outward throughout MBB.
In introducing civic geographies, I challenge existing, spatiotemporally bound conceptions of
the kinds of civic engagement, or political participation, that youth enact within, and beyond,
informal, media-rich settings. Specifically, I offer civic geographies as a means to imagine civic
engagement opportunities for youth that cut across multiple spaces, temporalities, and scales.
By drawing on relational theories of place, I marshal civic geographies to question the
“agential cuts” (Barad, 2003) researchers, teachers, and mentors make during civic enactments.
That is, in what ways do teachers, students, and mentors care for—and design opportunities for
youth to engage with—“this place” rather than “that place”? And to what degree does “that
place” become integrated into “this place,” or vice versa? An emphasis on civic geographies
advances Metzger’s (2014) query: “What are the limits to responsibility and how are these
worked through in different [spatiotemporal] arrangements?” (p. 1007). To align this query with
my research questions, then, this chapter asks: How does civic engagement move and circulate
during this game-based program?

169

I situate this chapter alongside research that has sought to document heightened forms
of youth civic engagement and political participation through digital media. In doing so, I
develop a working understanding of civic engagement in a digital era with an emphasis on
Mihailidis and Thevenin’s (2013) definition of engaged citizenship. I then expand engaged
citizenship through my focus on civic geographies.
I explore the civic geography of MBB in two ways. First, I tease apart the ways in which
engaged citizenship cuts across space, scale, and time individually. I do so in order to setup
the heart of this chapter in which I explore the fluid civic geography enacted by Neil. There, I
describe how Neil’s civic engagement dilates outward into another Minecraft server and then
contracts back into our MBB server. In doing so, I pay particular attention to how Neil
calibrates his civic practices on another server (“that place”) into his gameplay on our server
(“this place”).
Digital M edia and Engaged Citizenship: Participatory, Collaborative, and
Expressive
A number of scholars across disciplines have sought to describe traditional conceptions
of civic engagement through digital media (Jenkins, 2006; Kahne et al., 2012; Kahne et al.,
2013; Lenhart et al., 2008; Vickery, 2014; Östman, 2012). Traditional conceptions of civic
engagement, in this case, describe citizen duties, like voting, paying taxes, and obeying laws.
In contrast, an engaged citizenship displays signs of independence, greater assertiveness, and
a concern for others (Dalton, 2008, p. 4). Importantly, Mihailidis and Thevenin (2013) have
developed a media literacy framework for an engaged citizenship. In doing so, they call for an
engaged citizenship that operates with a participatory competency (Jenkins, 2006), or a

170

“culture of participation as default” that often begins in digital spheres and promotes
“responsible, aware, and purposeful contributions to local, national, and global communities”
(p. 1618). In addition to a participatory competency, an engaged citizenship sustains a
collaborative competency, or a means to “recognize the capacity they have to form
connections and extend their communications to a large group of interested peers” (p. 1618).
Moreover, to participate and collaborate with others, engaged citizens must have expressive
media literacy competency, or the ability to contribute, receive, and reflect on civic content.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly for my purposes, an engaged citizen operates with a
critical competency, where the critical consumption of content also “helps define and orient a
sense of place and cultural connection to the world” (p. 1618).
In this chapter, I expand Mihailidis and Thevenin’s (2013) take on engaged citizenship. I
approach engaged citizenship as an act that is relational and extensive. Specifically, I follow the
contours of engaged citizenship that circulated within and beyond MBB. In doing so, I
contribute to reports of youth civic engagement that seek to locate what Sandor and Putnam
(2010) have called the “right mix of virtual and real strands.” Specifically, I offer civic
geographies as a means to further describe—and follow—the spatiotemporal contours of civic
engagement, or the ways in which civic engagement moves across space, time, and scale.
Theoretical Refinem ent
Civic Geographies
In developing civic geographies, I draw on relational conceptions of place, which
approach place as a multiplicity of intersections (Massey, 1994), and as a product of practices
and trajectories, including “interactions at all levels, from the (so-called) local to the (so-called)

171

global” (Massey, 2004, p. 5). Specifically, I focus on Massey’s (2004) articulation of
“geographies of responsibility.” Three principles guide geographies of responsibility: 1)
responsibility is relational, depending on any entity (an individual, a group) being constructed
through its relations to others; 2) responsibility implies extension rather than restriction to the
immediate or local; and 3) responsibility stretches across time and is not temporally bound to a
specific event.
I bring together geographies of responsibility with work related to (educational) scale.
Scale refers to spatial and temporal orders that teens, in this case, generate as they move
toward, detach from, circulate through, and, finally, assemble within certain sites (Nespor,
2004, p. 310). Scale is dynamic, rather than static. Thus, Following Herod (2001), there are no
“‘natural’ scales by which to order and organize human geographies. Rather, scales are
historically and geographically negotiated…social actors create geographic scales through
their activities” (p. 38-39, as cited in Nespor, 2004, p. 310).
Scales and calibration. I apply Nespor’s (2004) five aspects of “educational scale”
toward engaged citizenship. First, people generate scale through the production and
circulation of artifacts. These artifacts can circulate at different rhythms and flows. For Nespor,
these artifacts include textbooks, tests, desks, homework assignments, and more. Textbooks,
for instance, signify a scale that expands to education at the state level. Second, people
produce scale by the ways in which they are moved physically by various entities (e.g. their
school, the MBB program). Schools, for example, physically and symbolically transport youth at
specific times of day. This means that scale is produced as youth are transported (by school)
through and across both social and material landscapes. Third, scale depends upon the space-

172

time properties of the networks—including people and environments—in which youth are
enmeshed. Nespor thinks in terms of person-as-network, or the fact that people themselves are
geographically and temporally distributed. Encountering a new person means encountering a
new network. Fourth, scale is produced by what is made visible, and what remains invisible.
Systems of power are at play, in this case, that facilitate (in)visibility. As an illustration, Nespor,
compares schools to prisons, specifically noting the ways in which both institutions carefully
control their public presentation: certain events, activities, or people can be made
“unseeable.” Finally, and importantly, scale depends upon the ways in which people
“calibrate” events that occur in disparate locations (e.g. school and home). Teaching and
learning, for instance do not occur within a container; rather, teaching and learning occur in
response to events and space-times outside of the classroom. No description of teaching,
Nespor writes, “can be complete without a description of the spatial and temporal orders of
the worlds to which is it calibrated by teachers and students” (p. 313).
Place-m aking. Nespor’s emphasis on calibration resonates particularly well with my
aforementioned emphasis on place-making. Calibration, I argue is similar to the act of
“bundling,” of joining up with or linking into other space-times. Importantly, when bundling
people select, or choose, the raw materials, or elements, which comprise the places that they
experience (Pierce, Martin & Murphy, 2010, p. 58). Still, those selections, as I have argued, are
affectively-charged. While, affect may be the “strange attractor lingering in place awaiting its
realization in practice, habit, and sensation” (Duff, 2013, p. 892), I argue that through the
process of calibration, affects can also traverse scale. This deliberate transformation of place by

173

integrating not only external space-times, but also external affects, gives shape to civic
geographies. Thus, “scale-making” as Nespor calls it, occurs during place-making.
M ethodological Refinement
The focus on civic engagement in this chapter demanded a few tweaks to the
methodological approach employed in the previous chapter. Overall, I continued to adopt a
mobile methodology, considering civic engagement a “moving system” (Büscher et al., 2010)
that I followed across digital and physical spaces. When “walking” through my data (Eakle,
2007), however, I was particularly attuned to instances of engaged citizenship (Mihailidis &
Thevenin, 2013). When re-viewing video data, field notes, and interviews, I did not adhere to a
strict definition of this term; rather, I held on to it loosely in order to be open to various forms
of “responsible, aware, and purposeful contributions to local, national, and global
communities” (Mihailidis & Thevenin, 2013, p. 1618). Thus upon logging data in ChronViz, I
noted particular moments of engaged citizenship—like helping people in-game, or
collaborating in-room; of an awareness of others’ needs—like those in the Lutece Place
community; and of the feeling of making potential, purposeful contributions to the city—like
developing new forms of art, or community centers.
After logging the data and developing an initial awareness of these emerging forms of
engaged citizenship, I then continued with my previously described analytical methods,
including temporal circling and the identification of refrains. Both temporal circling and the
identification of refrains worked together, enabling me to develop an acute sense of the
“affective complexes” that participants produced through activity. With an awareness of these
affective complexes, I then returned to my data logs, working to bring together those

174

affectively-charged zones of production with my initial notes detailing the space-times of
engaged citizenship.
A few new alterations to my initial description of methods transpired at this point.
Inspired by social learning ecology maps (Ching et al., 2014) and event mapping (Putney,
2007), my approach resulted in mapping sites of participation with a specific focus on the
spatiotemporal contours of our participants’ civic engagements. Following the contours of civic
engagement led me to reimagine civic engagement in terms of civic geographies by attending
to the space, time, and scale of activity. I present the civic geography “map” up front in the
findings as an initial entry point into describing the civic geography of MBB.
However, the data also pointed me toward the need to articulate the expansive scale of
the civic geography, especially in terms of how it reached beyond MBB, the library, and the city
of Metro. Specifically, I followed the networked residue (Grimes and Fields, 2012) of one
participant, Neil, to trace his civic engagement on another Minecraft server removed from his
MBB experience. Neil, an active participant on a server called Mariande Realms, left a trail of
networked residue on his profile page affiliated with the server (which he directed me towards
and said I should check out). In following this residue, I again targeted instances of engaged
citizenship by Neil as demonstrated by posts to the server’s forum, messages left for other
players, screenshots taken from gameplay, and posts directed toward moderators noting when
other players have broken the rules of the server. From there, I was able to make direct
connections between how Neil calibrated his citizenship across servers, from the Mariande
server to our MBB server, and made place while doing so.
Findings

175

The Contours of Engaged Citizenship in M etro: Building Blocks
In the following, I first introduce the civic geography of MBB. To do so, I pull apart the
ways in which engaged citizenship opportunities for youth expanded across space, time, and
scale. Of course, while I pull apart space, time, and scale to be more precise in this analysis,
each element overlaps with the others considerably. Thus, in the latter portion of this chapter, I
describe the fluidity of Neil’s civic geography, with a specific focus on the ways in which he
actively calibrated civic engagement across multiple Minecraft servers. I begin, though, by
illustrating the ways in which engaged citizenship cut across space, time, and scale (Figure 6-1).

176

Figure 6-1. The civic geography of MBB, including space, time, and scale.

Space. MBB was a real virtual space (Ehret & Hollett, 2014). Rather than traversing
back and forth between “physical” space and an imagined “cyberspace,” bodily activities in
digital and physical spaces are connected. Thus, the digital does not exist simply “on the
screen” but rather spills outward into reality and “become[s] the experience” (Castells, 1996, p.
328). Here, through an emphasis on space, I first underscore the permeable settings of

177

engaged citizenship. That is, in emphasizing space, I emphasize “where” activity occurred.
Scale, which will follow, emphasizes “what” forms of engaged citizenship occurred within those
spaces.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the ways in which room, game, and city interacted with one
another. The real virtual space of MBB was produced through the complex interplay of game,
room, and city (Stevens, Satwicz, & McCarthy, 2008). Given the task of building the city of
Metro in-game meant that, from the start, the real and virtual regularly intermingled.
Participants, for instance, would often turn to visual (and, one could argue, embodied)
resources like Google Maps’s Streetview capacity to help fine-tune specific details related to
their builds.
This spatial blending of embodied and digital space was most evident as activity shifted
towards Lutece Place, a neighborhood that had been slated for further development for the
Metro housing authority. For example, having lived near Lutece Place at one point in his life,
Tom wanted to develop a richer, more embodied perspective regarding its location prior to
building anything within Lutece in-game. To do so, he located his former home on Google
Maps, zoomed into it, and then “walked” from there to Lutece Place via Google Streetview
(Figure 6-2).

178

Figure 6-2. Tom locates his former home using Google Maps and then “walks” to Lutece Place.

Tom refused to participate in kind of building until he had adequately felt—and sensed—
the area in which he was working. By traversing through the (virtual) space provided by Google
Streetview, he primed himself for a form of engaged citizenship that was not detached from his
own personal experience living in a nearby—although very different—community. Tom’s
spatial experience in this case quite literally provided an initial means for him to “orient a sense
of place” (Mihailidis & Thevenin, 2013) from which he could engage critically—if not

179

emotionally and bodily—with a neighborhood undergoing change. Still, Tom’s previous
experiences in his neighborhood near Lutece place were not only spatial but also temporal. In
recovering those memories—like walking to school, playing with friends, or driving with
parents—Tom reached back through time, enabling himself to draw upon his own lived
experience in Metro. Thus, just as multiple spaces interpenetrated one another, so did multiple
temporalities.
Tim e. As evidenced in Tom’s walk down the street, participants’ lived experience in
Metro acted as an overarching—and ongoing—temporality that influenced their (civic)
engagement in MBB. While his lived experience in the surrounding area largely shaped Tom’s
participation once we began building in Lutece Place, that was not the case for all participants.
Arthur, for example, rarely referenced his experience living in, and moving through, Metro.
Certain temporalities carried more weight, so to speak, for each participant (i.e. Tom’s Lived
Experience > Arthur’s Lived Experience). Figure 6-3 illustrates some—not all—of the
temporalities that streamed through—and intersected with—focal participants’ experience of
MBB. Thicker lines denote extended temporal experiences. Tom’s line for “Lived” experience
is thus thicker than Arthur’s. I further elaborate upon these temporalities below.

180

Figure 6-3. Timestreams of MBB participants.

As depicted here, all participants drew upon their lived experience living in Metro to
some degree. Each stream, however, is weighted differently for each participant. As I have
described, Tom, for example, evidenced a much greater reliance on previous (and ongoing)
spatiotemporal lived experiences than Arthur did. Neil, like Arthur, also rarely referenced his
personal experiences in Metro.
Moreover, forms of engaged citizenship were ongoing, keeping pace with everexpanding urban planning initiatives. For instance, while earlier phases of MBB production
focused on the downtown Cumberland Riverfront park, later phases moved alongside current

181

citywide planning initiatives, enabling participants to work in neighborhoods like Lutece Place,
using the same documents presented at meetings with residents (Figure 6-4).

Figure 6-4. An example of documents (made accessible by the Metro housing authority) used

Alongside overarching temporalities like lived experiences and planning initiatives,
MBB produced its own temporalities. Subsequent phases moved participants across areas in
the city, moving from the riverfront park, then to the downtown/Broadway area and, finally,
toward to Lutece Place. Moreover, regular activity provided its own temporalities for each
participant and their individual builds—some participants worked on one project, or build, for
extended periods of time whereas other participants moved quickly from one build to the next,
helping and collaborating with others as necessary. Jasper, for instance, spent his entire time in
MBB working on a single-family home (Figure 6-5), first building the home itself, then the

182

rooms, then the car in the driveway, and finally adding various accoutrements within individual
rooms.
Finally, time stretched beyond our regular sessions for some participants, too, as they
continued to contribute to and play on our server from home after installing it on their personal
computers. Arthur, as depicted in Figure 6-3, took advantage of this opportunity the most,
noting that “there’s no time limit.” He was most proud of his work when it “took its time,”
when he could continue to think and work over days, and even weeks, at home and during
MBB. This capability was a stark contrast to, as he noted, the twenty minutes he often had to
complete worksheets in math class, which he often rushed through and rarely completed.
Scale. These spatiotemporal dynamics contributed to the possible scales of engaged
citizenship within MBB. If space describes the setting of engagement (viewed broadly as roomgame – city here), then scale describes what forms of engaged citizenship occur within (and
beyond) those settings. In the following, I describe the forms of engaged citizenship
happening across scales, temporarily sifting them apart. Once I have done so, I then illustrate
the ways in which scales in fact, operated simultaneously—a critical component of the civic
geography of MBB.
At its broadest, engaged citizenship worked at the scale of the city as participants
questioned and analyzed ongoing planning and housing issues in Metro, like mixed-use
housing and urban farms. Because we were using the Metro Civic Design Center’s “Plan for
Metro,” all activity centered around its guiding principles. Thus, participant talk—and the
structures they built—revolved around forms of engaged citizenship, like maintaining visual
order in the city, developing housing, considering the role of art, and imagining new forms of

183

transportation. Rather than boxing up these civic practices, however, I “unfold” and “splay
them out” (Doel, 1999), recognizing that participants shift their attention to specific practices at
the city-scale over time (i.e. focusing more on transportation, as evidenced in the previous
chapter, than on art). Figure 6-5 illustrates the unfolding of these practices. I play these
representations out at each scale, “unfolding” them here only to re-fold—and re-mix—them
later.

Figure 6-5. Unfolding engaged citizenship practices at scale of city.

Engaged citizenship at the scale of the city and the scale of the room were never truly
separated, however. Participants collaborated with one another at the scale of the room,
working together as they encountered problems and sought help from each other. MBB
activity was often peppered with chatter across the room as participants swarmed to certain ingame locations and then worked through problems together across the real virtual space
(Figure 6-6). Figure 6-6, for instance, offers a brief example of this kind of collaboration. Here,
Malik has begun to build a “sand castle that looks like a real castle” within a community park.
Eddy has flown his avatar over to the location of the castle, notices the thin moat that Malik has

184

built, and offers to contribute a drawbridge to the park.

Figure 6-6. Eddy and Malik collaborate at the scale of the room.

While this kind of collaboration was frequent, participants also routinely assisted one another
with builds, taking on joint-responsibilities for various components. Moreover, they recognized
one another’s expertise, making bids for help as needed. Again, I unfold those practices below
(Figure 6-7).

185

Figure 6-7. Unfolding engaged citizenship practices at scale of room.

While this kind of room-based collaboration was frequent, participants also helped and
collaborated with one another uniquely in-game (e.g. the ways in which the transport station
came about in chapter five). Many of these practices aligned with forms of participatory
culture, like the sharing of diverse links, videos, and other resources, as well as the remixing of
others’ builds. The differences between in-room and in-game aid are not trivial, however, as
certain participants were more willing to engage with others in different spaces. For instance,
one participant, Neil rarely spoke to others in-room, but often helped them in-game, flying in
to teach others how to build a specific edifice, or helping them along with their ongoing builds.
Thus, while there was certainly cross-over between forms of engaged citizenship that occurred
at the scale of the room, the scale of the game provided additional opportunities as well
(Figure 6-8).

186

Figure 6-8. Unfolding engaged citizenship practices at scale of game.
Again, these scales are not necessarily separate. I have only pulled them apart for
illustrative purposes. Importantly, each of these scales—as depicted in the figures above—can
be calibrated differently by participants. Participants calibrate seemingly disparate scales (e.g.
room/game/city) by bringing them into contact with one another, by tracing out “particular
networks of association” (Nespor, 2004, p. 312). Participant-driven calibrations, then, loosen an
overt focus of forms of civic engagement at one scale, bringing them together as multi-scalar
civic enactments (Figure 6-9). Each participant re-folds, and re-mixes, his or her own, unique,
forms of civic engagement. Thus the boxes, as evidenced on the right of Figure 6-9, neither
fold back up in the same manner nor do they contain the same elements.

187

Figure 6-9. Scales of city, room, and game, unfolded and re-configured.
With this overarching understanding of the ways in which MBB operated across space,
time, and scale, I now turn more specifically to Neil’s civic geography and the expansive scale
that informed it. In the following, I analyze the ways in which the scale of Neil’s Minecraft
gameplay ventured beyond the library and impacted the ways in which he civically-oriented
himself within the MBB community. Thus, I attend more explicitly to how Neil calibrated his
forms of civic engagement across space, time, and scale.

188

Calibrating Engaged Citizenship Across M ultiplayer Servers
Neil’s way of engaging—and helping—others revealed a scale that expanded beyond
that of the game, room, and city and into the affinity space of Minecraft more broadly. I refer to
Neil’s integration of gameplay outside of the program into the program as calibrating. Within
the program, Neil participated differently than others. As described above, he did not often
engage with others in-room, but frequently helped and collaborated with others in-game—to
the degree that he maintained in-game proximity to others in order to help out as needed.
On one occasion, for example, a newcomer, Powell, was building a fountain in Lutece
Place. Powell frequently sought out help while creating his fountain, asking Neil directly if he
could “make it more symmetrical” once things began to go awry. Neil quickly flew to Powell’s
aid, taking a break from his own project to fix up minor details in the fountain, like making its
base more symmetrical and adding components to the surrounding area, like a picnic table
with chairs. In fact, Neil even put on a mini-lesson for Powell, highlighting how three very
different blocks, once put together, could give the impression of chairs (Figure 6-10).

189

Figure 6-10. Neil’s mini-demonstration to Powell on how to create chairs.

Neil’s post-interview illuminated where this helpful style of play originated. Outside of
our program, Neil was a frequent player on a Minecraft server called Mariande Realms
(hereafter Mariande). In our interview, he was excited to show me the online portal through
which he interacted with others who played on the server: “It has forum posts, your wall, like
Facebook for gamers,” he said. And then added, “there’s no swearing.”
Neil’s comment about swearing is important because of the culture that surrounds socalled inappropriate activity on Mariande. There are specific rules and regulations on the server
that make it a positive community for Neil and other members. Because Neil “really love[s] the

190

server and the people on it,” he helps the server’s moderators (mods) as they monitor players
who may not abide by the rules. This means that when players break the rules—like swearing,
“scamming,” or destroying people’s work (griefing)—Neil will report them to the mods. Once
reported, the mods can ban players, mute (making them unable to speak with others), or even
kick players off the server. In response, players can argue for an appeal, or for a shortened
sentence (Figure 6-11).

Figure 6-11. Appeal made to the mods by a player who “called an American fat.”

In Figure 6-11, for instance, a player has filed a “Mute Appeal” for “calling an American fat.”
The player has also sought to prove to the mods that he or she understands the wrongdoing
and “realizes that saying those kinds of comments will get me nowhere in life.”
While this communications occurs on the server’s forum, others forms of engaged citizenship
occur in-game. For instance, players regularly organized protests to dispute bans in hopes of
gaining the mods’ attention. Neil established one such protest, calling for others to take action
in removing a ban from an undeserving friend (Figure 6-12). Each clump of “dirt” dropped into

191

the chest signified another players’ support of Ninjapotao06, who had been banned. Upon
opening the chest, mods could see how much “dirt” was in there and thus confirm the amount
of support others had for Ninjapotato06.

Figure 6-12. Screenshot from Neil’s call to action to support a player who had been banned.

In our interview, Neil pointed out a specific instance in which he reported someone.
“It’s pretty vulgar,” he said, as he showed me a screenshot of the sexually-charged tirade
directed towards another players mother, which Neil submitted to the mods.
The embedded chat log also displayed other players’ response to this attack:
Awesome_guy1122, for instance, called out, “Whoa! language bro!” User defectiveclaws
laughed, “lol there’s another language report tonight that makes 2.” As evidenced by players
like Awesome_guy1122 and defectiveclaws, Neil was not alone in his recognition of the
original infraction.

192

Neil was not merely tattling on another player, though. Aside from that fact that it “gets
annoying when someone is constantly swearing,” Neil was also trying to prove to the mods
that he was a responsible member of the server, someone who could demonstrate leadership
qualities by helping the mods monitor a rather massive server that, on average, had about 250
people online playing together (Figure 6-13):

193

Figure 6-13. Neil’s states his desire to be a staff member on the Mariande server.

194

It was Neil’s desire to be on staff—to take on a larger role in this meaningful community—that
not only spurred him to report people, but also to help newcomers, much like he did with
Powell. He consistently wanted to “help any one that’s new.” Neil made good on this
statement two weeks after our interview, formally applying for a position on staff as a Junior
Moderator of Mariande. In his application, he wrote:
I believe I should be JrMod because I am good at helping other people, while being
funny and useful to everyone. I am 15 years old, I will help new players to get started on
the server, and I can help people with and basic - advanced Minecraft skills (sic). I would
really like to be JrMod, however, it is ok if this is rejected.
Neil noted not only that he would help people with basic and advanced Minecraft skills, but he
would also “get people started on the server,” acting as a mentor as they acclimated. This is
precisely how he worked with Powell, sticking close by him in case Powell needed help,
coming to Powell’s aid when he was unsure of how to do something specific. And Neil was
able to articulate his strategy when working with newcomers.
Like teachers say sometimes, you don’t just tell someone what to do. Well you don't
just tell, or do it for them. But you tell them how. If you don't tell them how, then they
don't understand it and they'll have co constantly ask you and you don't want that to
happen.
Neil’s calibration of scale. Neil is an example of a person-as-network (Nespor,
2004). People, Nespor writes, are never alone; they are “always entangled with artifacts and
environments.” In this case, the ways in which Neil guided and supported Powell were highly
entangled with the ways he guided and supported new players on the Mariande server. Thus,
Neil calibrated his civic engagement across server spaces. The scale of Neil’s civic engagement
was extensive—dilating and contracting between the Mariande server and our MBB server.
Neil-as-network, then, was “geographically and temporally distributed” (Nespor, 2004, p. 311).

195

Moreover, when Powell sought and received Neil’s help, Powell also gained access to that
Mariande space, no matter how fleetingly. In turn, Powell was “brought into association” with
Mariande, with the ways in which players guide, help, and support one another there.
Neil-as-network operates within a civic geography. His form of engaged citizenship was
neither spatially isolated to MBB nor was it temporally bound, occurring only during a framed
period of time. Rather, it was extensive, circulating back-and-forth between Mariande and
MBB. In fact, Neil calibrated his civic engagement between Mariande and MBB, agentively
reaching into his past (and current) experiences on Mariande and integrating them into MBB.
An analysis of the multiple scales across which this civic engagement operated makes
clear that civic engagement—like learning—does not occur in a container (Leander, Phillips,
and Taylor, 2010). Yet, digital media researchers continue to make “agential cuts” (Barad,
2007) that isolate civic engagement as political participation (Ostman, 2012), or providing an
urban planning experience for teens on the civic web (Gordon 2013). In doing so, specific
scales of civic engagement, of political opportunity, become dominant, more authoritative than
others. As a result, responsibility—and engaged citizenship—fails to circulate between “here”
and “there.”
When certain scales of civic engagement become dominant (typical those that are
“here”), others become hidden, invisible (“there”). Tracing forms of responsibility (Massey,
2004) as simple as Neil’s helping and supporting of Powell (contracted scale) unearthed Neil’s
rich history of engaged citizenship on the Mariande server (dilated scale), of nurturing
newcomers, flagging language infractions, and protesting for friends who had been treated
unfairly. While settings designed according to the principles of connected learning seek to

196

promote political opportunities for youth—often highly localized— there is still a need to trace
the ways in which opportunities for civic engagement operate at various scales, including those
that youth calibrate across settings, like libraries, cities, and online spaces. Civic engagement
should not be collapsed by teachers or researchers into spatiotemporally bound, one-anddone, localized enactments. Doing so defines “certain meanings and spacetime relations as
the meanings and connections that count in these networks of power, and to make other
meanings, connections, and processes invisible and unseeable” (Nespor, 2004, p. 321).
Massey’s conception of geographies of responsibility particularly helped me develop
civic geographies. Geographies of responsibility stem from Massey’s history of thinking toward
a “global sense of place” (1994). Through a global sense of place, the character of cities,
regions, and nations as places has far less to do with physical geography or location than with
the “effects of spatial and temporal exposure and connectivity” (Amin, 2001, p. 391). Despite a
growing awareness of the multi-faceted ways in which teens connect with one another—both
physically and digitally—youth civic engagement continues to be hidden, made invisible, with
scholars focusing primarily on what youth know about politics or what politically-charged
material they create and post on social media sites. What is a teen’s “spatial and temporal
exposure and connectivity” to forms of engaged citizenship? How do these forms of engaged
citizenship intersect with new literacies? With teens’ ongoing learning through digital media?
What happens when mentors, teachers, and scholars stop targeting the local and in civic
engagement and begin to develop a global sense of engaged citizenship, following the digital
and physical strands of engaged citizenship that teens calibrate across time and space, and at
dilated and contracted scales?

197

Sum m ary
In this chapter, I have put forth civic geographies to imagine civic engagement
opportunities for youth that cut across multiple spaces, temporalities, and scales. The construct
of civic geographies is a deliberate attempt to introduce a mobile perspective to civic
engagement. Typically civic engagement is bound, framed as individual enactments, or as
political participation. Civic geographies, in contrast, are a way forward toward finding the
“right mix of virtual and real strands” that youth weave together through engaged citizenship
(Sandor & Putnam, 2010). First, I teased apart the civic geography that MBB fostered for
participants. Teens regularly assessed and critiqued the needs of the city (dilated scale), while
also striving to efficiently collaborate both in-room and in-game (contracted scales). Moreover,
teens were able to engage with the city, and one another, at varying temporalities, ranging
from days, to weeks, and months. To underscore the fluidity of the civic geography, though, I
demonstrated the ways in which Neil calibrated specific civic practices—helping, guiding,
teaching, demonstrating—across server spaces. On his Mariande server Neil took pride in
guiding and teaching newcomers; he evidenced those same practices when working with
Powell, a newcomer to MBB. In the end, I argued that re-orienting civic engagement toward
civic geographies follows the contours of civic enactments across space, time, and scale—from
hours helping a newcomer on one server, to days spent protesting for a friend on another.

CHAPTER SEVEN
DISCUSSIO N, IM PLICATIO NS, AND CONCLUSION

In the following, I re-visit my analytical chapters through the lens of affectively-charged
place-making. I discuss the art of place-making participants enacted in MBB. From there, I
hone in on the implications for this dissertation, underscoring potential contributions toward 1)
pedagogy/mentoring within informal media-rich settings, as well as 2) designing for mobility
within informal, media-rich learning settings.
Affectively-charged Place-m aking
The art of place-making, Duff writes, “serves to enmesh bodies in relational networks of
meaning and belonging, of time and space” (p. 890). While place-making is often attributed to
the ways in which people carve out places for themselves in specific geographic locales,
typically urban settings (Lepofsky & Fraser, 2003; McCann, 2002; Pink, 2008; Wu, 2000), I bring
place-making into contact with the ways in which learners transform learning settings into
places of learning for their own personal enrichment. I have specifically adopted a relational
approach to place, one in which place consists of lines (Ingold, 2007), or stories (Massey,
2005)—space-time trajectories which individuals pull together through cognitive and emotional
processes (Massey, 2005, p. 119). As Massey writes, people join “up with, somehow linking
into, the collection of interwoven stories of which that place is made.” People pick up the
“threads and weave them together into a more coherent feeling of being ‘here’, ‘now”
(Massey, 2005, p. 119).

199

Chapter four detailed the interest-powered mobilities of participants in MBB. In that
chapter, I described how learners were affected toward interest-powered learning
opportunities in three ways: First, through passengering, or interest that moved and circulated
through affective intensities resonating between participants; second, through mutability, or
interest that moved and circulated through affective intensities resonating between participants
and concepts; and third, through residue; or interest that moved and circulated through
affective intensities resonating between participants and peer-created objects embedded ingame. Each of these sub-sections illustrated the way in which affects moved participants
toward interest-powered learning opportunities. I targeted sparks of interest and then moved
alongside participants as they pursued those interests. In doing so, I showed that interest is
mobile, and that it is sparked in multiple ways, including by other participants, by specific
ideas, and by existing artifacts.
The affective connections with each of these elements, though, may best describe the
kinds of “relational networks” that Duff emphasizes in the making of place. Participants’ bodies
were “enmeshed” in these networks. These bodies were feeling and sensing the surrounding
real virtual setting (Ehret & Hollett, 2014). Subsequently, they were lured in by affect, that
“strange attractor lingering in place awaiting its realization (Duff, 2013, p. 890).” Interest, then,
was not necessarily an a priori construct but rather something that emerged on a daily, if not
moment-to-moment basis. Martin and Jeremy, for instance, demonstrated the ways in which
enthusiasm beget an interest in the development of non-player characters.
Affect, as Duff notes, “serves as a kind of map or tool of navigation.” When entering
into new learning spaces—like those at public libraries—learners often encounter relatively

200

uncharted educational territory. Libraries, historically, have not been viewed as learning
settings by patrons. In the case of MBB, for example, participants found themselves unsure of
whether or not they were supposed to raise their hands when directing questions toward me.
Tom would, jokingly, and hesitantly, raise his hand, saying, “Ummm….Mr Hollett” to grab my
attention. In this place of learning, formal learning space-times, like school, were present—their
ways of talking, sitting, and gaining the attention of the teacher/mentor permeating our
activity. Participants adjudicated how to transform this place of learning into one that was not
necessarily school, yet one that was not necessarily free-play. Thus, informal learning initiatives
like MBB, while enticing, leave learners seeking out new ways of being, acting, and doing. As
evidenced in the description of Neil and Leto, for example, who sought out in-bound
trajectories, affect became the “tool of navigation” that provided them with an initial point of
entry into participation, including not only learning how to plan and build, but also how to
participate.
Place-making positions learners as agentive in their pursuits. While theories of place
note the many “lines” and “stories” that cut across any given locale, theories of place-making
clarify how place becomes a “here” “now.” The place of MBB was made and re-made each
time I met with participants (although previous “stories,” of course, remained). By being
affected—by having an interest sparked and then pursuing it—participants began to carve out
the place that, temporarily, as MBB. And it took my affective attunement as a designer and
mentor to recognize the ways in which participants were carving out their own place within
MBB and to support those carvings. Once I recognized the ways in which Martin and Jeremy
were working with NPCs, for example, I began to seek out additional ways in which they could

201

deploy their newfound skill-set. Once I became aware of the way in which Martin had
continually shaped and re-shaped his redstone schematic, I not only challenged him to
produce new variations of it, but also challenged others to learn the mechanics of redstone as
well, using Martin’s schematic as an example. In doing so, I reached back temporally—
grabbing on to previous “stories” produced in MBB—and (re)placed them in subsequent
meetings. This place of MBB was always a place-in-the-making.
In chapter five, I described the topography of activity in MBB. Rather than isolating
static instances of so-called “academics,” I traced the relief of activity within MBB—following
its contours—to illustrate the ways in which activity was an emergent production, often
bubbling up in felt-response to other participants. In describing the topography of activity, I
also contributed an initial means to move across the multiple levels, or scales, put forth by
those documenting and assessing learning in informal, media-rich settings (Lemke et al., 2015).
Specifically, I followed the contours of activity through an emphasis on rhythm. I focused my
analytic attention on the development of one artifact in MBB—a transit station—to contribute
three ways of moving alongside the rhythms of participation: amplitude/amplification,
propagation, and oscillation. In feeling, sensing, and creating their own rhythms in MBB, I
argue, participants were often transforming place for their own enrichment.
Rhythm, especially, enabled me to follow activity as punctuated by ebbs and flows,
spikes and lulls. Amplification, for instance, gave me a means to trace the accelerations and
decelerations of collective participation; propagation enabled me to follow collectiveindividuals as they pursued their own unique, personal flourishes and cycled through

202

interactional arrangements with the ensemble; oscillation attuned me to the rapid, cycling of
perspectives that participant-avatars enacted when navigating the digital space.
Part of making place, though, is making rhythm. Within urban spaces, as Edensor (2014)
notes, a number of rhythms interpenetrate as people place-make given their own desires and
needs:
the time-tabled throngs of children walking along routes that converge on schools,
crossing roads as lollipop men and women arrest the flow of vehicles, often themselves
conveying children to school, intersect with the routine marches of early shoppers and
strolling workers, en route to places of employment….the early morning amblings of
the unemployed or flaneurs of various kinds…Contrast these mobile morning rhythms
of walking with those of the evening, as shoppers and commuters have already drifted
back home, and hedonistic crowds of evening clubbers, drinkers, and cinema-goers
animate the streets of the city with purposive and more exuberant styles of walking. (p.
164)
Formal learning settings not only produce their own familiar chronotopes, as Lemke described
in chapter one, but they also produce their own familiar rhythms. Ehret and Hollett (2013), for
instance, tell the story of Tiana, who upon enrolling in their mobile-device-based digital
enrichment course, found herself moving within the school in ways, and rhythms, that she
previous had not. Moving in such a way was “different,” she said, “because during school
hours we’ll sit the period, stay in advisory, go to lunch, recess, and then go to do the whole
thing [makes circling motion with her index finger] again and again every day (p. 118).” That
circling motion is telling, acting as a form of metonymy representing all the students at Tiana’s
school: one finger, one circle.
While my goal is neither to demonize formal learning settings, nor to romanticize
informal learning settings, there were a number of rhythms operating throughout MBB on a
daily basis. As evidenced in chapter five, participants were often geographically distributed

203

throughout the virtual world, operating at their own rhythms (akin to Edensor’s description of
children, shoppers, flaneurs and workers), only to come together after sensing the acceleration
of activity around a given person or build. I described this shift in participation as amplification.
Rhythm-making, in this instance, was also very much related to the ability to sense and respond
to accelerating tempos, or amplified scenes. While I’ve described place-making above as
becoming enmeshed into a relational networks, perhaps true place-making occurs when one
becomes enmeshed in relational rhythms—sensing, feeling, and responding to others—with
the capacity to harness the energy guiding that rhythm towards one’s own pursuits.
Chapter six detailed the civic geography in which MBB participants immersed
themselves. In that chapter, I put forth civic geographies to imagine civic engagement
opportunities for youth that cut across multiple spaces, temporalities, and scales. Through civic
geographies, I deliberately sought to introduce a mobile perspective to forms of civic
engagement. That is, I followed forms of engaged citizenship that were fluid, that moved
through space and time, and that dilated and contracted to macro- and micro-scales,
respectively. To specifically underscore the fluidity of the civic geography, I followed the ways
in which Neil calibrated his civic practices—helping, guiding, teaching—across server spaces.
Neil’s calibration of engaged citizenship across servers was a primary example of placemaking. Through his calibrations, Neil brought civic practices from the server he loved playing
on, Mariande Realms, into contact with the server he was just beginning to play on, MBB. This
calibration, however, was far more involved than making contact between those two servers.
When calibrating between the two, Neil commingled specific practices, ways of being, and
perhaps most importantly, an affectively-charged feeling of play. Whereas place-making is

204

certainly about making a “here”, “now”—it is also about producing a feeling of being-in-place,
about the production of an “intensive space-time” or an “affective atmosphere” (Anderson,
2009, p. 79).
Atmospheres, broadly, envelope. They are a kind of “indeterminate affective ‘excess’
through which intensive-space times can be created” (Anderson, 2009, p. 80). Anderson (2009)
urges researchers to think of how atmospheres are “sealed off through protective measures
such as gated communities or certain types of building design. Or how atmospheres are
intensified by creating patterns of affective imitation in sports stadiums and concert halls (p.
80).” This envelopment results from the affective intensities that emanate from the assemblage,
the-intra-action, of bodies, human and non-human. In the case of a sport’s stadium, for
example, atmospheres are not only produced through the human bodies present—athletes,
fans, vendors—but also through their intra-action with non-human “bodies”—sound effects,
bright lights, the scent of popcorn and hot dogs, a cold (and perhaps terrible-tasting) Miller
light. That beer, no matter how watered-down, though, helps produce that specific
atmosphere.
How do affective atmospheres move and circulate, though? In the case of sports, the
best example might be in the re-production of the affective atmosphere of an arena at a local
bar. Fans gather, beer is poured; hot wings (in the US) are eaten. TVs surround the space; the
volume turned up so as to envelop customers, to produce the feeling of being at a stadium
when one cannot actually be at a stadium. The atmosphere of the stadium circulates through
bars across the country, its intensity likely felt more, or less, intensely at disparate bars.

205

In their analysis of one hospitalized youth’s video gameplay, Hollett and Ehret (2014),
move towards an understanding of how atmospheres move and circulate. First, they detail the
ways in which an affective atmosphere of intimacy is produced through the comingtogether,
the intra-action, of the darkness the video game coupled with a darkened room, the growl of
in-game zombies, and the humming of the Jaws theme by another player in the room. Later
instances of gameplay with that youth re-produced this intimate atmosphere, expanding it to
include his mother and other caretakers at the hospital. In other words, that intimate
atmosphere was mobile, it circulated.
But while their research describes the ways in which atmospheres emerge and circulate,
it does not illustrate the ways in which youth agentively, if not deliberately, produce
atmospheres for themselves and others. Neil’s calibration of engaged citizenship across the
servers of Mariande and MBB was an example of this agentive place-making. He produced a
visible “here, now” within MBB, actively working to re-produce the ways of being, and the
collaborative, helpful-to-newcomers atmosphere on the MBB server. By doing so, he collapsed,
or even folded, the “here, now” on to the invisible “there, then” of Mariande.
As I push forward to more direct implications that bring place-making together with
pedagogy/mentoring and the design of learning spaces, I want to hold tightly to my guiding
constructs of place, mobility, and affect. Thus, in the following, I wonder: How can mentors
within informal, media-rich settings foster opportunities for youth place-making? And,
furthermore, how can the space itself, and the programming therein, be designed in such a
way to promote mobile configurations and circulations?

206

Pedagogy/M entoring W ithin, and Beyond, Inform al, M edia-rich Settings
Educational researchers recognize that teachers—and non-teachers—carry with them
nearly 13,000 hours of “training” from previous experiences in classroom settings. With so
much contact time, students become adept at taking “the role” of the teacher, to the point of
learning to anticipate his or her behavior. As a result, as Lortie (1975) notes, “unless beginning
teachers undergo training experiences which offset their individualistic and traditional
experiences, the occupation will be staffed by people who have little concern with building a
shared technical culture” (p. 67). Teachers, through this conception, are “self-made” (p. 80)
individuals, fusing together previous experiences with on-the-job trial-and-error. Without a
shared technical culture—without the belief that teaching is a “shared intellectual possession”
(p. 81)—teachers tend to hold fast to biography as they make pedagogical decisions; they fail
to acquire new approaches to historically-sedimented pedagogy. In settings like libraries and
museums, connected learning is gaining momentum. In doing so, it is becoming the “shared
technical culture” of which Lortie writes. But that new “shared technical culture,” I argue, is in
danger of being co-opted by previous experiences in formal learning settings.
I am concerned about historically-sedimented pedagogy and the ways in which it finds
its way into the youth learning programs at settings like libraries. In my development of MBB,
and my own experiences collaborating with those seeking to design programs for youth, that
historical sedimentation—part of the imagined geography of learning—is hard to disrupt.
When initially creating MBB, I wanted to produce something roughly called “social studies,” if
not “urban planning.” I wanted to plot out objectives; I urged participants to build certain
edifices, asked them questions that a teacher would ask (And, of course, my own history as an

207

educator influenced these actions). How do mentors, though, learn to stray from their “lesson
plan” that they create for youth at the library? (Or, better, why are they asked for plans, as
such?) To become attuned to affective intensities means that mentors must move alongside
participants and their interests, following along as participants become lured in by certain
components of the experience, be it the excitement expressed by peers, or the opportunity to
repeatedly develop an idea, or the desire to re-produce/remix something seen at the library, or
online.
Throughout this dissertation, I have continually noted the ways in which I, as a
mentor/designer, attuned myself to what moved within—and beyond—MBB, including
interests, rhythms, and civic engagement. In chapter four, for instance, I described interest as
mobile and fluid—as protean. Participants’ interests moved and circulated throughout the
duration of MBB in numerous ways. While it is not my intention for a mentor to identify
moments of passengering, or mutability, or residue within a given learning setting, I do want to
re-imagine what it means for mentors to be attuned to those sparks of interests as their
programs progress.
To attune one’s self to sparks of interest necessitates loosening what we, as
mentors/adults/researchers consider a so-called interest. For example, I designed MBB with
the open-world video game Minecraft at its core. While I was drawn to a number of Minecraft’s
attributes—including its world-building potential, multiplayer capabilities, and educatorfriendly community—I was primarily drawn to it because I knew that my participants were
interested in it. I knew there was a robust fan culture surrounding Minecraft and that it was a
rich affinity space, ripe with potential to study emerging forms of learning. That said, I was

208

drawn to the front-end of interest: what I, as a designer/mentor, knew about my participants
and their interests.
When I designed MBB, I made the initial mistake of assuming that interest was a
finalized entity, that I had done my job, so to speak, by identifying something that my
participants enjoyed and built a program around it—a problem, I believe, that plagues the
current theory of connected learning. By moving with interest as it emerged in my analysis, I
sought to avoid an overt emphasis on Minecraft-as-interest. Rather, I began to attune myself to
related interests that sparked, those that lured learners toward them and then enabled
participants, as Tom once said, to “get in and see how that works.” As a result of these initial
sparks, participants began to shuttle across a number of participatory competencies (Peppler,
2013), including debugging and decoding; critical practices, like critiquing and reworking
media; creative practices, like multimodal composition; and ethical practices, like providing
insider information and crediting ownership.
I want to return to Tom, and his desire to “get in to see how that works,” as an
exemplar of an interest-spark. To recall, I referenced this moment in chapter five, when Tom
was lured toward Arthur’s transit system. Tom, curious about how the system operated,
“open[ed] it up,” quite literally by breaking blocks to peer inside. Tom’s curiosity led to a backand-forth with Arthur that enabled Arthur to reflect on the process of the system’s creation,
narrating out-loud how it worked. This was a rich moment in that it pushed beyond merely
observing others’ work and commenting on it, but rather provided both the opportunity for
participants to see, feel, pull apart, and put back together again.

209

Tom’s “get[ting] in to see how that works” (like Jeremy’s “You gotta show me how to
do that,” from chapter four) could be considered a pop-up learning opportunity: It emerged,
in-the-moment, resulting from the amplified scene surrounding Arthur’s transit system. While it
is worthy to note the ways in which pop-up learning opportunities emerge in informal, mediarich settings, a more pressing question might be: What happens afterwards? Again, in
tracing—and designing for—motility (i.e. the potential to move), I am not only concerned with
how learning opportunities pop-up, but also with how they “pop-out” and “pop-in.” That is,
how might mentors harness the energy surrounding those emergent interests and create
subsequent learning opportunities around them (pop-out)? And further, how can those
opportunities go back into circulation (pop-in), enabling greater opportunity for refinement, or
even mutability, by learners over time? In short, pop-in/out learning integrates the mentor into
this emergent scene.
Moreover, how do mentors navigate the collective ensemble of which individual
learners are a part in these settings? The pathways perspectives adopted by connected
learning have continuously emphasized individual trajectories (focusing on academics and
careers) with less attention given to the group or overarching project. This emphasis on
pathways underscores vertical progression toward some vision of expertise. Pop-out/in learning
opportunities signify lateral, or horizontal movement, rather than simply vertical, forward
progression. By bringing attention to horizontal movements, mentors can more explicitly link
group and project objectives with the individual. An emphasis not only on vertical movement,
but also horizontal movement, then, offers a means to trace the emergence of the collectiveindividual, which I focused on in chapter five.

210

The pedagogy/mentoring enacted in an informal, media-rich setting is not uncoupled
from the design of the learning space itself. By learning space, in this case, I eschew an
emphasis on materiality—I’m not concerned with tables, chairs, walls; rather, I focus the
following section on the design of informal, media-rich learning spaces, with an eye—and
body—toward the “motivated circulations” (Leander & Lovvorn, 2006)—of bodies, things
ideas—that they can foster.
Designing for M obility within Inform al, M edia-rich Learning Settings
Classrooms and game worlds, Leander & Lovvorn (2006) write, “are not dull and
unmotivating merely because they are filled with unmotivated persons. They are unmotivating
because they are immobile” (p. 336). If classrooms and game worlds can be “immobile,” what
does it mean—or better, look and feel like—when those settings are mobile? And how can
learning settings be designed in such a way to promote that mobility? Thus, in the following, I
evolve mobility from theoretical construct to design principle. To do so, I wonder, especially,
how informal, media-rich settings can be designed so as to promote, what Leander and
Lovvorn (2006) refer to as “smart configurations” and “motivated circulations.” (p. 336).
Throughout this dissertation, I traced movement—of bodies, of things, and of ideas. In
the design of MBB, I expanded beyond the library and our room itself, seeking connections to
youth interest-powered affinity spaces, like Minecraft, enabling youth participants to integrate
their experiences—and feelings—from beyond. By integrating authentic urban issues into their
gameplay, I sought to further solidify connections to the surrounding community. These
connections also led to partnerships in Metro, namely with the local Civic Design Center.
Importantly, I also wanted youth participation and learning to be powered by their own

211

experiences, memories, and feelings related to moving through their local community. Beyond
connections, however, I sought out what Dewey (1899) calls the “free interplay”—mobility—
between what was occurring within our room (and our game) at the library and what was
occurring—and had occurred—beyond.
Additionally, I became highly attuned to what was moving within our setting. Thus, the
ways in which things—experiences, materials, and ideas—came together as “smart
configurations” (Leander & Lovvorn, 2006) has been important to me throughout this
dissertation. In chapter four, for instance, I targeted the ways in participants passengered one
another, how they were moved, pushed, toward each other by their jointly-forged excitement
about working with non-player characters (NPCs) in-game. In that same chapter, I also followed
participants as they moved along with specific ideas, calling it mutability, as well as how they
were pulled toward embedded artifacts, calling it residue. In chapter five, I expanded upon the
ways in which learners were pulled toward learning opportunities, focusing on the rhythms of
their participation. I emphasized, especially, how settings became amplified, and how that
energy propagated through individual participants. In chapter six, I not only followed the ways
in which civic engagement cut across space and time, but also how it dilated and contracted
among scale as well.
I want to highlight one specific example from chapter five as springboard into the
various spatio-temporal configurations that emerged in MBB. There, I described the ways in
which Tom, caught up in the amplified moment surrounding the transit station, began to
rhythmically interact with those in the room by entering into the cycle of individual-collective
work —> direct consultation —> indirect “presencing” —> individual-collective work. The

212

real virtual space of MBB promoted this kind of social rhythm, this circulation across different
“styles of interaction,” such as ‘face-to-face’ conversation, ‘hallway’ meetings, and greetings, or
peripheral or ambient awareness of ‘distant’ noise or conversation” (Mynatt, Adler, Ito &
O’Day, 1997, p. 211).
MBB fostered a number of spatial, and temporal, learning configurations, like this social
rhythm within which Tom became immersed. Spatially, this echoes configurations that are
found in alternative learning settings, like studios. As I described across chapters four and five,
participants often shuttled among individual, paired and collective, or ensemble,
arrangements. These arrangements, in turn, produced interactional assemblages that included
ways of being affiliated with participatory culture—like seeking out relevant YouTube videos,
skipping to relevant parts, and watching and re-watching (and re-watching!)—while also
incorporating “pedagogical structures found in more formal studio-based settings, such as
demonstration, facilitated workshops, and critique (Sheridan et al., 2015, p. 527). In chapter six,
for example, Neil created his own demonstration for Powell, showing him how he could
potentially create makeshift chairs out of disparate materials. Other participants would
regularly put their work out for critique—asking others to come check it out (both physically
and virtually). While these arrangements are micro-versions of those affiliated with art, or
architecture, studios they do hint at the spatial arrangements that can move and circulate
within informal, media-rich settings.
These spatial arrangements, however, also lead to a variety of temporal arrangements.
In chapter six, for instance, Arthur noted how he appreciated that, in MBB “there’s no time
limit.” He took pride in his transit system—which took almost a month to complete—because it

213

“took its time.” While Arthur perseverated over his transit system, other participants opted for
projects that could be completed within, for example, one individual session, or even twenty
minutes. The temporal structures that we—educators, researchers, teachers—have inherited
often dictate the temporal arrangements that we make possible for students. This adherence
to ingrained temporalities recalls Lemke’s (2004) position on time in formal learning settings,
referenced in chapter one:
Each lesson is divided from those logically connected to it by at least 24 hours, the
duration of any activity is limited to 40 minutes, topics change radically every few
weeks, extended projects cannot continue beyond a few months, and the critically
important relationships between teachers and students are arbitrarily terminated after
much less than one year. (n.p.)S
Educators, researchers, and even mentors excel at enabling “pair-work” or “group projects” in
formal settings—accustomed to playing with spatial structures—yet we are less comfortable in
loosening the temporal constraints to which we have grown accustomed.
Finally, and in acknowledging spato-temporal configurations at a larger scale, I want to
close by returning to Neil’s calibration of civic engagement across server spaces. Neil’s
Mariande server was an incredibly important space to him. While media outlets continue to
demonize video games, arguing that video games make people more aggressive (Park,
2014)—or not (Stuart, 2014)—those outlets have placed less attention on forms of engaged
citizenship occurring in gaming, and other digital media, venues. By observing forms of
engaged citizenship by Neil on his Mariande server—and following them as they circulated
back into MBB—I described how engaged citizenship operated at a scale much larger than our
program, and much larger than the city of Metro. Neil was not only calling out language
infractions on this (global) server, but he was also actively petitioning for friends who had been

214

banned or muted on the Mariande there. He was not only hoping to take on a leadership role
with his friends, but was also mentoring newcomers both on Mariande and MBB.
Neil demonstrated a reversal of what Gee (2003) calls a projective identity: the ways in
which gamers “project” their identity onto their virtual character during gameplay (e.g. I’m a
nice person in the real world thus I will make my in-game character a nice guy, too). In Neil’s
case, the identity that he established on the Mariande server spilled out and into the real virtual
identity he was creating for himself in MBB. Without getting mired in issues of identity, Neil
did not just project an identity, but circulated his identity. This circulation of identity, for Neil,
was an incredibly “motivated circulation” in that he was very deliberate in how he presented
himself across servers, acknowledging that he wanted to become a part of the leadership team
on Mariande—and applied for that role later. Without co-opting, or colonizing, youth game
spaces, I wonder what circulations can be designed into informal, media-rich learning settings,
like libraries, that do not just move through formal, so-called “social networks” (e.g. YouMedia
Chicago’s iRemix)? What opportunities are there for “smart configurations” that bring together
“global” servers with “local” participation? How can real/virtual hybridities be designed that
enable traversals for learners, rather than isolating, or cutting them off, from one another?
Closing
Life will not be contained, but rather threads its way through the world along the myriad
lines of its relations. (Ingold, 2007, p. 103)
This dissertation has not been about seeing movement for movement’s sake. Rather, it
has approached mobility as a means to break free of the “straightjacket of container thinking”
(Thrift, 2004), to re-imagine, and remap, the learning geographies of youth. Through an

215

emphasis on place, affect, and mobility, I recognize—and believe—that despite the fact that
“everything is moving,” youth make a “here, now” for themselves, weaving together
experiences, feelings, relationships and resources across space-time.
But an emphasis on mobilities recognizes a much larger paradigm of thought that
stretches across the social sciences and humanities, bringing together research in sociology,
geography, history, anthropology and communication studies. This paradigm has sought to
disrupt the “a-mobile” nature of social science research, or how the social sciences have failed
“to examine how the spatialities of social life presuppose (and frequently involve conflict over)
both the actual and the imagined movement of people from place to place, person to person,
event to event” (Hannam et al., 2006, p. 208). Still, educational scholarship has been slow to
move, so to speak, weighed down by geographically confined approaches to learning born
from the lineage of behaviorism, instructionism, situated cognition and more. The new
mobilities paradigm reconfigures the social—the foundation of sociocultural learning—as
“mobile, with many aspects of social life, civil society, and political participation increasingly
understood as being performed through mobilities” (Adey, Bissell, Hannam, Merriman &
Sheller, 2014, p. 3). Rather than accumulating learning settings, however—as much learning
scholarship continues to do—I have questioned what was happening through that journey from
one place—or even within one place—and another. Following mobility scholars, I have asked—
and will continue to ask—questions such as:
How were different mobilities involved in making people’s lives meaningful? How were
these mobilities meaningful in and of themselves? How was all this mobility inherently
uneven and unequal? And how might attending to such questions require different
modes of analysis and critique? (Adey, Bissell, Hannam, Merriman & Sheller, 2014, p. 34)

216

These questions are a way forward toward the remapping of youth learning geographies.
Although educational scholarship recognizes that learning traverses settings, it continues to
define those learning opportunities (including, afterschool, informal contexts, and
flexible/alternative school programs) either in relation to—or against—the learning
opportunities provided by school (Vadeboncoeur, 2014). Positioning those so-called informal
contexts in such a manner not only continues to dichotomize school and not-school (SeftonGreen, 2013), but also cuts off movement between those settings, rendering those settings “amobile,” still, and sedentary.
Furthermore, a remapping of youth learning geographies destroys the solidity of
“transport” models of learning (Ingold, 2011). Transport models, I argue, plot out potential
learning settings for youth, whether informal or formal, emphasizing the “point,” as opposed
to the “line.” Thus, these models are destination-oriented. Connected learning, I have noted, is
dangerously close to this transport model, signaled by its accumulative discourse of settings
(i.e. “Schools, homes, afterschool clubs, religious institutions, and community centers” [Ito et
al., 2013p. 8]). By remapping learning geographies, we—researchers, teachers, mentors,
students—must adopt an approach to learning that follows the “wandering lines”, or
“efficacious meanderings” (de Certeau, 1984, p. xviii), along which learning develops, moving
alongside learners as they move within—and between—settings. For Ingold, these lines
emerge through the act of wayfaring, of being “continually on the move” (p. 75). Wayfaring “is
neither placeless nor place-bound but place-making” (p. 101, my emphasis). Mobility, in this
case, is not a matter of moving from destination to destination, but rather the very experience

217

of movement, of the path traveled. Transport models adhere to socially constructed
spatiotemporal scales that, in turn, bracket our conceptions of learning. They dictate where—
and when—we believe learning occurs. As researchers, we often put our own straightjackets on
ourselves (How many of us conduct research after, say, 6PM?). Why, as Lemke (2001) asks, “do
we observe students on the timescale of the lesson, inside the math classroom, and not follow
them out the door, down the hall, to another classroom, lunchroom, street corner, work, or
home?” (p. 20).
By remapping youth learning geographies, I argue, we regain the sense of “inbetweenness” through which learning transpires. Remapping learning geographies
necessitates following, moving with learners (and ideas, and things) as they move within and
beyond physical and digital spaces. Learning (and the research of it) is not bound, contained,
but rather continuous (Dewey, 1938). While some children, Vadeboncoeur (2014) writes
may piece together learning opportunities across diverse contexts and experience a
semblance of continuity in spite of a fragmented system, reimagining education
holistically may be the impetus required to begin to organize learning more
intentionally. (p. 344)
We reimagine education holistically by remapping the learning geographies of youth that have
haunted us for years: those same geographies haunted Dewey in 1899. To enable learners to
“piece together learning opportunities across different contexts” is to enable them to placemake across the “fragmented system”—to actively negotiate, and subsequently transform this
place for their own enrichment.
