INVESTIGATING SEARCH PROCESSES IN
COLLABORATIVE EXPLORATORY WEB SEARCH
Zhen Yue, PhD
University of Pittsburgh, 2014

People are often engaged in collaboration in workplaces or daily life due to the complexity of
tasks. In the information seeking and retrieval environment, the task can be as simple as factfinding or a known-item search, or as complex as exploratory search. Given the complex nature
of the information needs, exploratory searches may require the collaboration among multiple
people who share the same search goal. For instance, students may work together to search for
information in a collaborative course project; friends may search together while planning a
vacation.
There are demands for collaborative search systems that could support this new format of
search (Morris, 2013). Despite the recognized importance of understanding search process for
designing successful search system (Bates, 1990; Hearst, 2009), it is particularly difficult to
study collaborative search process because of the complex interactions involved.
In this dissertation, I propose and demonstrate a framework of investigating search
processes in the collaborative exploratory search. I designed a laboratory-based user study to
collect the data, compared two search conditions: individual search and collaborative search as
well as two task types through the study. I first applied a novel Hidden Markov Model approach
to analyze the search states in the collaborative search process, the results of which provide a
holistic picture of the collaborative search process. I then investigated two important components
in the collaborative search process – query behaviors and communications. The findings reveal
4

the characteristics of query and communication patterns in the collaborative search. It also
suggests that although the collaboration between two people on search did not achieve a higher
performance than two individuals, the collaboration indeed make people feel more satisfied with
their performance and less stressed. The results of this study not only provide implications for
designing effective collaborative search systems, but also show valuable research directions and
methodologies for other researchers.

INTRODUCTION

Information seeking was traditionally studied as an individual activity. However, users may
collaborate with others when the information need is complex and exploratory, a scenario that is
similar to that they collaborate on other complex tasks in workplaces and daily life. Previous
research (Morris & Horvitz, 2007) showed that collaboration in a simple search task may not
bring many benefits. However, when the search task is exploratory, it may be in the searchers’
best interests to collaboratively explore the information space and participate in shared learning
(White & Roth, 2009). For instance, students may work together to search for information in a
collaborative course project; friends may search together while planning a vacation; healthcare
providers might collaboratively search for information to diagnose a patient’s illness (Reddy &
Spence, 2008); or family members might collaboratively search the web to buy a car (Morris,
2008). Therefore, although information seeking has been studied traditionally as an individual
activity, collaborative information seeking has attracted a significant amount of attention
(Hansen & Järvelin, 2005).

1.1

PROBLEM STATEMENT

A recent survey reported that the percentage of respondents engaged in collaborative web search
on a daily basis had increased from 0.9% in 2006 to 11% in 2012 (Morris, 2013) . As the needs
15

of collaborative search continue to gain more and more attentions, researchers have developed
many new systems and interfaces to support collaborative information seeking and retrieval
(Amershi & Morris, 2008; Diriye, Golovchinsky, Dunnigan, & Alto, 2012.; Golovchinsky &
Adcock, 2008; Morris & Horvitz, 2007; Shah & Marchionini, 2010a). The design of a wellfunctional system for collaborative search is still a challenging task and way more complex than
designing a system for individual search. The previous studies found that the understanding of
users’ information search process can facilitate the development of search systems. For example,
Bates (1989) incorporated a “berry-picking” information search process model into a real search
interface designing, and Hearst (2009) emphasized the necessity to understand human
information search processes in designing successful search systems. However, those studies of
information search processes mainly focused on the individual search. Previous researches
(Hyldegard, 2006; Shah & González-ibáñez, 2010) further found that it was inappropriate to
directly apply individual search process models to the collaborative search. Both of the studies
found that the social dimensions of collaborative search were not covered in the individual
search process models.
I assert that the design of collaborative search systems can benefit from studies of
collaborative search processes. Due to the fact that there are much fewer studies focusing on
investigating collaborative search process in comparison to the studies of individual search
process (Shah & González-ibáñez, 2010), a comprehensive investigation on collaborative search
processes can fill the gap in this research field. Search and communication are two major
components in the collaborative search process, which are also my focuses in this dissertation
study.

16

Specifying information needs as search queries and refining those queries during search
sessions are two key steps in an exploratory search process (Belkin et al., 2001). Researchers
have devoted massive efforts to understand users’ query behavior during web search processes,
such as query tactics (Bates, 1979), patterns of query reformulation (Jansen, Booth, & Spink,
2009) and the effects of contextual factors on users’ query behaviors (Ingrid Hsieh-Yee, 1993).
Researchers have also developed successful techniques to support query formulation and
refinement towards more effective and efficient searches, such as query expansion (White &
Marchionini, 2006) and query suggestions (Kelly, 2011). However, as a much more complex
form of exploratory search, collaborative exploratory searches have seldom been the focus of
query behavior studies. It is unclear how users’ query behaviors would be different in a
collaborative setting, making it difficult for researchers to design query support in a collaborative
search system. Previous research pointed out that the successful assistance to queries and
subsequent refinement must be designed based on the understanding of users’ query behaviors
(Jansen et al., 2009). Therefore, it is important to study the query behaviors involved in the
collaborative search process. If we can learn when and how team users generate queries and
reformulate queries during the collaborative search process and the associated collaborative
context of their searches, it is possible for the collaborative search system to provide targeted
query supports that are efficient and effective for team users.
Compared to individual search process, a unique component of collaborative search
process is the communications among multiple users. Many collaborative search studies have
showed the important role of communications in the collaborative search process (Reddy,
Jansen, & Krishnappa, 2009). Users may communicate with other users in a collaborative search
to seek for help or brainstorm for search strategies (Twidale, 1997), or to share knowledge and

17

maintain awareness among multiple users (Foley & Smeaton, 2010). Most existing collaborative
search systems have implemented features for supporting communications among multiple users,
such as instant message (Morris & Horvitz, 2007; Shah, 2010). However, few studies have
considered the cost and benefits of communications in the collaborative search process
(González-Ibáñez, Haseki, & Shah, 2013). On the one hand, communications could be effective
in establishing common ground among multiple users (Hertzum, 2008). On the other hand,
communication could also introduce extra workload or distract users from their search tasks
(Carroll, Rosson, Convertino, & Ganoe, 2006). Therefore, it is imperative to conduct an
investigation on communications in the collaborative search process, and to examine the
relationships between communication patterns and search outcomes. All of these will help
researchers to understand the benefits and costs of communication, and to design systems for
supporting effective communications in the collaborative search process.
The ultimate goal of investigating search processes is to understand users’ information
seeking behavior so that the design of search systems can be user-centric and based on the
understanding of users’ needs. With regards to exploratory search, researchers had developed
many features to support the information exploration process, such as querying support, offering
facets and visualization, and supporting histories and workspaces (White & Roth, 2009). Adding
collaboration factor to the exploratory search imposes more challenges on the search system
design. The studies on the collaborative search processes can shed light on the improvement of
system design for collaborative search.
How to investigate and support search processes in collaborative exploratory search is an
open question requiring systematic studies. The previous research methods and findings in
individual exploratory search can provide some guidance for the study of collaborative

18

exploratory search. However, we must explore the new methods because the interactions
involved in collaborative search are much more complex than individual search. The interactions
exist not only between the user and the system, but also among the multiple collaborative users.
How to model these interactions and support them are worth studying.

1.2

CURRENT RESEARCH STATUS

In the individual search, researchers have employed two major approaches to investigate the
information search process. One approach focuses on qualitative constructs, such as stages and
context in the search process. Kuhlthau’s model (1991) and Marchionini’s (1995) model adopted
such an approach. The other approach tried to derive search patterns through the analysis of
logged user behaviors. These studies were based on the units of search behaviors, such as actions
(Chen & Cooper, 2002; Holscher & Strube, 2000), search tactics (Xie & Joo, 2010), and search
strategies (Belkin, 1995), which are labeled either by human raters (Xie & Joo, 2010) or
automatic methods (Chen & Cooper, 2001, 2002). The manually labeling method is more
controllable but requires extensive human efforts and is difficult for scaling to large datasets. By
contrast, the automatic methods need fewer human interventions. However, such methods missed
a global view of the entire search process as the search states are arbitrary chucked sequential
actions.
To investigate the collaborative search process, Hyldegard (2006) and Shah et al.(2010)
attempted to map the individual information search model into a collaborative web search. Both
papers found this approach inappropriate. Although not specifically targeting a collaborative
web search, Evans and Chi’s social search model (2008) contributed to the study of the
19

collaborative search process. The model was built upon survey data rather than logged user data.
Considering the complexity of interactions involved in the collaborative search, studying
collaborative search processes through logged user behaviors remains a problem.
A few studies have been specifically designed to compare information search in
individual and collaborative conditions. Lazonder (2005) compared pairs of students with
individual students in web search tasks and found that pairs produce better search outcome than
individuals. Joho et. al (2008) compared two conditions of synchronous search with independent
search. In one of the synchronous condition team members only share search history while in the
other synchronous condition they can communicate with each other. The major findings from
this study are that collaboration was helpful to diversify search vocabulary and reduce
redundancy in finding relevant documents. However, the search performance was not improved
in collaborative conditions than two artificially combine independent users. Shah and GonzálezIbáñez (2011) compared team users and single user in five different conditions. One of the
conditions involved the single user and the other condition artificially combined two single users.
The rest three conditions were synchronous collaborative search in which location varied from
each other, including co-located using same computer, co-located using different computer, and
remotely located. A set of measurements were employed to evaluate the synergic effect of
collaboration in information seeking, including precision, recall and F-measure, coverage,
usefulness, query diversity and cognitive load. They found that two collaborators using the same
computer achieved the similar results as the individual users. Two collaborators using different
computers, either co-located or remotely located, had a better performance in discovering more
and diverse information. These comparison studies between the individual search and
collaborative search are mainly focused on search outcomes rather than search processes.

20

According to Golovchinsky et al. (2008), collaborative search can be classified as
implicit or explicit in terms of search intent. The implicit collaboration often occurs in
collaborative recommendation and filtering systems where the information from different users
is shared without explicit modeling of the collaboration. Explicit collaboration occurs on a
smaller scale such as a team of several collaborators. The collaborative querying is a technique
that has been widely used in implicit collaborative information retrieval. The technique enables
users of an information retrieval system to draw on previous query preferences of other users at
the query formulation and reformulation stages of an information search (Foster, 2006).
Previously-learned queries and relevant documents are reused in new and similar search sessions
to improve the overall retrieval quality (Hust, 2004). Often, the simulated experiments are
employed in these studies, rather than user studies involving human subjects. In contrast to the
implicit collaborative search, the queries studies in explicit collaborative search are rare (Capra
et al., 2012).
Query behavior studies have reached maturity in the context of individuals. However, the
studies on query behavior in the collaborative search context were relatively fewer and primarily
focused on implicit collaborative search. There were some studies investigating the differences
between collaborative and individual search, but they were not particularly focused on the
differences in query behavior. Therefore, a comparative study on query behavior in collaborative
search and individual search can fill the gap in this research field.
The collaborative search is a form of teamwork. Teamwork in general has been the focus
of several research communities, including computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW)
(Mishra & Mishra, 2009), computer mediated communication (CMC) (Fletcher & Major, 2006)
and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) (Strijbos, Martens, Jochems, & Broers,

21

2004).

The theories and methodologies from these research fields can be transferred to

collaborative search studies. For example, González-Ibáñez and collegue (2013) looked into the
effects of three different communication medium on the collaborative search. Besides the
communication medium, I think that the comunications in a collaborative search process can be
affected by other factors , such as the type of search task. Another study focused on the content
of communications by analyzing all the chat messages intended for coordination (Shah, 2013).
According to the content analysis schema devloped by (Strijbos et al., 2004) for
communications, the types of communication include task content, task social or non-task
related. The schema have been applied in another study on the effect of communication medium
(González-Ibáñez et al., 2013). It will be beneficial to apply this schema for a study on
investigating the patterns of communication content in the collaborative search process. Finally,
the timing of communications is a very important angle to examine the patterns of
communications. Even and Chi (2010) investigated the social interactions involved in the before,
during and after search stages in the social search. This motivated me to analyze
communications involved in different stages of collaborative search because it can help us to
better understand the role of communications in the collaborative search process.
In summary, there is a lack of studies on collaborative search processes in the literature.
Particularly, it is worth studying the two key components in the collaborative search process:
query behaviors and communications.

1.3

SIGNIFICANCE

In this dissertation, I focus on the automatic methods for analyzing the collaborative information
search process using logged user behaviors. The previous studies on investigating the search
process using logged data either focused on the observed action level or the manually coded
search tactics/strategies level. The connections between the observed actions and search
tactics/strategies are missing. To study such connections, I took a two-level view of the basic
unit in the search process. The first level is observable actions, which are the manifestation of
users’ behavior. The second level is unobservable search tactics or strategies. I assume that users
can move between different search tactics. In each tactic, users have a list of choices (each
choice is an action), and each choice has its probability of being adopted by the user. The
observed actions represent the users’ adopted choices. Fuhr’s theoretical framework for
interactive retrieval (Fuhr, 2008), which assumes that a user moves between situations in the
interactive information retrieval, supports this assumption.
In order to model the temporal sequence of user behaviors and simultaneously leverage
these two levels, I propose using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Baum, Soules, & Weiss,
1970). Because search tactics usually represent the users’ internal choices and are difficult to
observe, it is reasonable to model the search tactics as the hidden variables. Moreover, unlike the
Markov models that have been employed (Chen & Cooper, 2002; Xie & Joo, 2010) to analyze
individual search processes, HMM assumes a Markov chain on the unobserved hidden tactics
rather than the observed user actions. This approach helps to remove the over-simplistic
assumption in Markov models: user’s future action depends only upon the present user action,
not on the other actions before the present action. HMM consider the holistic view of the entire
search process and model search states as hidden variables which can be seen has latent search
23

tactics. One additional benefit of HMM is that rather than manually labeling user actions, HMM
is an automatic method that can be easily applied to large datasets.
Although HMM is a well-established model, most its applications focus on predicting
future events, such as the weather and stock prices. To the best of my knowledge, the use of
HMM in analyzing search processes is rare. No previous works have applied HMM in
collaborative web search. Therefore, little available information explains how to categorize the
observable user actions, how to choose appropriate parameters and how to make sense and
interpret the outputs. All these issues are studied in this dissertation.
The automatic approaches of studying search processes usually miss the content
associated with user actions. For example, query actions have query terms as content and
communication actions are associated with the messages being sent or received. To complement
the search states analysis and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the collaborative
search process, I also consider studying the collaborative search process at the content level.
Issuing queries is one of the most important steps in the exploratory search process because the
query reformulations advance the search process. Communications are unique actions in the
collaborative search process. Considering these two reasons, I select query behaviors and
communications as the foci of analyzing collaborative search process at the content level.
In this study, I examine the query behaviors in the collaborative search process through a
comparison to the query behavior in the individual search process. The query behavior is an
important aspect for studying in exploratory search (Belkin et al., 2001). Queries are
representations of users’ information needs and users’ abilities to transform information needs to
queries greatly influence the process of exploratory search (Marchionini, 2006). Researchers
found that social inputs may help users to frame their search problems and solving vocabulary

24

problems during the search (Evans, Kairam, & Pirolli, 2010). Other researchers reported that
submitting different queries is a very frequently used search strategy used in the collaborative
search (Joho et al., 2008). Therefore, it is very important to look at the vocabulary features of the
queries such as vocabulary richness and query diversity in the collaborative search. Unlike
simple fact-finding search, exploratory search is featured by multiple queries during the search
session (White & Roth, 2009). Query reformulations allow users to explore different parts of the
information space. The patterns of query reformulation are reflections of users’ search tactics
employed in the search process (Kelly, 2009). Thereby, the pattern of query reformulation is
another angle I select to study the query behaviors involved in the collaborative search
performance. The goal of query iterations in an exploratory search task is to satisfy the
information needs. Thus it’s important to look into the performance of queries. In this study, I
look at the success of each of query (whether or not resulting in the saving of relevant
documents) as well as the performance of the whole such session such as precision and recall. In
addition, I also measure the performance from the users’ perspective, including users’
satisfaction towards the search performance and users’ cognitive load regarding the search
experience. In summary, through a comparison between the individual search and collaborative
search from three dimensions - query vocabulary features, query reformulation patterns, and
query performances, I provide a comprehensive study of query behaviors in the collaborative
search.
Through the comparison of the individual search and the collaborative search, we can
obtain the differences between these two forms of search. However, we may still be unclear
about the causes of the differences. Studying the unique component – communication involved
in the collaborative search process may provide us with better understanding of where the

25

differences between the individual search and the collaborative search are coming from. The
important role of the communication has been emphasized by many researchers in the
collaborative search community (González-Ibáñez et al., 2013; Morris & Horvitz, 2007; Reddy,
Jansen, & Krishnappa, 2009b). Communications can be used to discuss the requirement of the
search task, coordinate the search efforts of multiple users, share knowledge and provide social
support among users. Different types of communications may be triggered by various context
throughout the collaborative search process (Reddy & Jansen, 2008). I think it’s crucial to study
the communications from both timing and content prospects to understand when and what users
communicate with each other during the collaborative search process. In this study, I also
examine the relationships between communication patterns and search outcomes. The findings
can help us to understand the potential benefits and costs of communications in the collaborative
search process, which is essential for designing better collaborative search systems.
Another important contribution of this study is that I consider task type as a factor for
studying the collaborative search process. Task type has been examined in many research studies
for its effect on users’ search behaviors. Hsieh-Yee (2001) found that the types of search tasks
influence users’ search tactics. The study of Toms et al. (2008) indicated that task type has a
significant impact on users’ query behaviors. Liu and colleagues (2010) found that the query
reformulation patterns were affected by task types. Researchers in the CSCW field suggested that
an effective collaborative system should be built on the characteristics of the collaboration task
(Mennecke, Wheeler, & Iubacs, 1993). The also illustrated the importance of analyzing different
task scenarios when evaluating the effectiveness of a collaborative system (Cugini, J., Damianos,
L., Hirschman, L., Kozierok, R., Kurtz, J., Laskowski, S., & Scholtz, 1997). Researchers in the
collaborative search community have realized the importance of task characteristics in

26

collaborative search (Morris & Teevan, 2010). However, a solo type of search task was used in
most collaborative search studies (Paul & Morris, 2010; Shah & Marchionini, 2010b). To
overcome this shortcoming, I use two different tasks in the study. From a survey of collaborative
search experiences, travel planning and literature search are recognized as two of the top three
topics for the collaborative search. Hearst (2014) summarized that information-gathering and
decision-making are two representative scenarios for collaborative search. These research
findings provide me with the criteria for selecting the two search tasks used in this study. One
task is an information-gathering task with the literature search topic, and the other task is a
decision-making task with travel planning as the topic. In this study, I consider the task type as
an independent variable to study its effects on the search states patterns, query behaviors as well
as communication patterns in the collaborative search process.

1.4

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

From the discussion above, it is clear that collaboration search is a new format of search and
there is a demanding need for systems that can support collaborative search. Investigating
interactions involved in the collaborative exploratory search process is crucial for designing and
evaluating systems to support collaborative search. Search state analysis has been widely used in
individual search studies to examine the search processes. The basic unit in the analysis varies
from study to study. I propose using HMM to model search states as hidden variables. Besides
the analysis of search states, I also propose to analyze the query behaviors and communications
involved in the collaborative search process. Having identified the focus on investigating the
search processes in collaborative exploratory search, the following research questions arise:
27

RQ1. How to model the search states in the collaborative exploratory search process? What are
the characteristics of search states in the collaborative exploratory search process?
1.1 How to apply HMM to analyze search states in the exploratory search process,
especially in the collaborative search?
1.2 How to interpret the outputs of HMM? How to determine whether HMM is a valid
method for analyzing the individual and the collaborative exploratory search process?
1.3 What are the patterns of search states in the collaborative exploratory search process?
What are the differences compared to patterns in the individual exploratory search?
1.4 Are there any differences on the patterns of search states for different search tasks?
1.5 What are the connections between the patterns of search states and the search
outcomes?
RQ2. What are the characteristics of query behaviors in the collaborative exploratory search
process?
2.1 What are the characteristics of query vocabulary features, query reformulation
patterns and the query performance?
2.2 What are the differences on query behaviors between the individual and the
collaborative search?
2.3 Are there any differences on query behaviors for different search tasks?
RQ3. What are the characteristics of communications between team members in the
collaborative exploratory search process?

tasks?

outcomes?

SCOPE DEFINITION

The collaborative information seeking has been studied in various environments including both
organizational and web setting (Hansen & Järvelin, 2005; Morris, 2008). Our study focuses on
collaborative exploratory search in the web search environment.
Golovchinsky et al. (2008) classified the collaboration in web search using three
dimensions: intent, concurrency and location. The collaborative web search can be implicit or
explicit in terms of the search intent. On the one hand, the implicit collaboration often occurs in
collaborative recommendation and filtering systems, where information from different users is
shared without explicitly modeling the collaboration. On the other hand, the explicit
collaboration occurs on smaller scales such as in groups of several collaborators. In my study, I
focus on the explicit collaboration of a team with two members. In terms of location,
collaborative web search can be co-located or remotely located. I am interested in remotely
located collaborative searches where a collaborative search system is needed to support both
communication and search. Collaboration in web search can also be synchronous or
asynchronous in terms of concurrency. In synchronous collaboration, team members can get
29

instant feedback from each other while in asynchronous collaboration only those who search
later can benefit from the work of earlier team members. I am particular interested in the
synchronous collaborative search in this study.
There are different roles of people in a team that collaborate with each other in exploratory
search. For example, a search novice may be collaborating with a search expert. In this study,
only teams of two members who are peers are considered, and both of team members are
required to be experienced searcher. The dynamics among team members is likely to change for
different sizes and different roles of team members. In the user study, the topics for the task
assigned to group users were pre-defined. They may not be a true reflection of users’ information
needs in real life. The nature of this study is a laboratory experiment. The findings and lessons
learned in this study should be interpreted with caution.

RELATED WORK

The study of collaborative exploratory search processes can benefit from various research topics
including individual information seeking process studies, collaborative information seeking
studies, exploratory search and query behavior studies and communications in teamwork.
Therefore, the related works in this chapter are organized in four sections. Section 2.1 focuses on
information seeking studies in the individual context. Section 2.2 discusses studies which focus
on collaborative information seeking. Section 2.3 highlights the query behavior studies in both
individual and collaborative context. Finally, Section 2.4 focuses on the communication studies
in both general teamwork setting and the collaborative search setting.

2.1

INFORMATION SEEKING

For a long time information seeking study has focused on the individual user, the wellestablished theory and research findings in the field can provide foundations and useful guidance
for the collaborative information seeking study. Two topics in information seeking relevant to
this study – information seeking process and exploratory search are discussed in this section.

32

2.1.1

Information Seeking Process

Information seeking process is one of the major topics in information seeking behavior research.
Researchers employed two major approaches to investigate information seeking process. One is
modeling macro-level information seeking process, which focuses on qualitative constructs such
as stages and context in information seeking process. The other one is modeling micro-level
information seeking process by identifying descriptive categories such as user action, search
strategies or search tactics and the transition relationships among them (Kim, 2009) .

2.1.1.1 Macro-level Process Studies
Kuhlthau (1991) proposed an information search process model which presents a holistic view of
information seeking from the user’s perspective in six stages: task initiation, selection,
exploration, focus formulation, collection and presentation. Based on the empirical research, the
model incorporates the physical, affective, and cognitive aspects of users experience common to
each stage. Also derived from empirical study, Ellis (1993) developed a model addressing a
series of features of users’ behavior involved in information seeking process, including starting,
chaining, browsing, differentiating, monitoring, extracting, verifying and ending.
Wilson (1999) did an interesting comparison of Kuhlthau and Ellis’s model and found the
similarity of them. Typically, the two models share the notion that users start with an information
problem. By recognizing the information need, users start searching general topic or perform
browsing actions. After analyzing and evaluating the initial results they get, they become more
certain about their information problem. Then they start formulating search on more specific area
and collect relevant information on their focus. When their information problems have been
solved, users feel satisfied and complete the search. The strength of Kuhlthau and Ellis’s model
33

is that they are based on experiments and observation in empirical studies and has been tested in
many subsequent studies. Wilson also pointed out that Ellis does not present features of
information seeking behavior as stages but as elements that may occur in different sequences
with different context. It suggests that the sequences of behavioral characteristics may vary as
users jump back and forth between different phases. The possibilities of transitions between
stages are modeled more explicit by Marchionini (1995). He proposes an information-seeking
process model composed of eight stages with possible transitions between each of them: (1)
recognize and accept an information problem, (2) define and understand the problem, (3) choose
a search system, (4) formulate a query statement, (5)execute search, (6) examine results, (7)
extract information, and (8) reflect/iterate/stop. Similar to Kuhlthau and Ellis, the information
seeking begins with the recognition and acceptance of the problem and continues until the
problem is solved. However, this model highlights the likelihood of a stage calling another stage
in three types: most likely transitions, high-probability transitions and low-transition
probabilities. Marchionini’s model is more suitable for electronic environments as it captures
many important elements of information seeking, including knowledge acquisition in extract
information, and collection exploration in examine results.

2.1.1.2 Micro-level Process Studies
Realizing the continuous and iterative nature of search behavior, Spink (1997) proposes a model
of the search process identifies user judgments, search tactics or moves, interactive feedback
loops, and cycles as constituting the search process of a user in interaction with a system. She
pointed out that an interactive search process may consist of one or more search strategies made
up of a series of cycles. Each cycle is an interactive feedback loop composed of a series of search
tactics or moves. The value of this view of search process is that it highlights search strategies
34

and tactics as components of search process. Bates (1979, 1990) defines four levels of search
activities from move to strategy. Bates’ work identifies 29 search tactics into monitoring, file
structure, search formulation and term tactics. Marchionini (1995) also defines moves, tactics
and strategies. In his definition, moves are discrete behavioral actions, tactics are discrete
intellectual choices manifested as a group of behavioral actions, and strategies are approaches
taken to solve problems. He proposed two types of search strategies: analytical strategies and
browse strategies. While analytical strategies tend to be more goal-driven, browsing strategies
are more informal and interactive.
Incorporating Bates and Marchionini’s definitions, Xie and Joo (2010) defines moves as
basic thoughts or actions in the information search process, tactics as to a move or moves that
users apply to advance their searches, and search strategies as patterns of sequential tactics that
imply users’ plans for the search process as well as changes occurring in the search process. In
the study, they point out that information search process is a complicated and dynamic process,
and it is necessary to look into the transition of search tactics to understand the search process.
By applying Markov chain, a probabilistic model, Xie and Joo present the most common search
strategies representing patterns of tactics transition at the beginning, middle and ending phases in
the search process. The value of the study is that the result provides guidance for information
search system design to support the most frequently applied tactics and transitions.
Belkin (1995) proposed a faceted classification of interactions between the user and the
other components of the IR system. Four dimensions used for the classification includes method
of interaction (scanning or searching), goal of interaction (learning or selecting), mode of
retrieval (recognition or specification) and resource considered (information or metainformation). He suggest that any single interaction can be described according to its location

35

along these four dimensions, and the information seeking process can be characterized by
movement from one interaction to another within the course of a single information-seeking
episode. Kim (2009) modified Belkin’s model to make it suitable to describe the interactions in
web search environment. Then the model was used to analyze the transition patterns in web
search process for different task types. Xie (2002) also applied faceted dimensions to classify
user interactions. The two dimensions used in the study are methods and resources. Instead of
assigning binary value for each dimension, more values for each dimension are considered. For
example, the value of methods can be scan, search, acquire, compare, consult, select, track and
trial and error.
This line of interaction transition pattern studies are all based on predefined framework of
descriptive categories of behaviors such as interactions or search tactics and the data analysis
highly rely on manually coding of search transaction logs. Automatic methods have been
explored in some work. Chen and Cooper (2001, 2002) used both stochastic model and
clustering techniques to examine search tactics in a web-based library catalog. However, they
usually missed explain the latent rationale behind the search tactics. Their identified search
tactics are simply the aggregation of sequential behaviors while the connections among user
actions and search tactics are missing.

2.1.2 Exploratory Search

Exploratory search describe information processes that are opportunistic, iterative, and multitactical, in which the query-document matching power of search engines plays a less important
role (White et al., 2006). Marchionini (2006) identifies a number of search activities that
differentiate exploratory search from look up search. Figure 2.1 shows that exploratory search is
36

especially pertinent to learn and investigate activities. When users’ information needs are well
defined, look up is sufficient for them to locate information. However, when users’ needs are illdefined, look up search is necessary but not sufficient for users to seek information for learning
and investigation. The activities are shown as overlapping clouds because there is generally
interplay between them, and some activities may be embedded in others.

Figure 2.1. Exploratory search activities by Marchionini

Many studies have showed that exploratory search activities are common information
seeking behavior exhibited by users. In an investigation of how people performed personally
motivated searches in their emails, files, and on the web. Teevan et al. (2004) found that 61% of
searches include more exploratory forms of search. In another empirical study, White and
Drucker (2007) showed the evidence that 23% searchers are almost entirely exploratory, and
only 17% of searches did not exhibit any exploratory behavior. Wilson and Schraefel (2008)

37

studied an interface that supports both searching and browsing and found that around 50% of
searches showed the alternatives to keyword search.
To support users’ needs for exploratory search, information seeking support systems that
provide more than query-response functions are needed. White and Roth (2009) propose a set of
features that must be present in system that support exploratory search: (1) support querying and
rapid query refinement, (2) offer facets and metadata-based result filtering, (3) leverage search
context, (4) offer visualizations to support insight and decision making, (5) support learning and
understanding, (6) facilitate collaboration, (7) offer histories, workspaces, and progress update,
and (8) support task management. The features of facilitate collaboration are of the most interest
to my study. In an exploratory search, the information-seeking problem context is open-ended,
persistent, and multi-faceted (White et al., 2006). When people bring diverse perspectives,
experiences, expertise and vocabulary to the exploratory search (Golovchinsky et al., 2009), each
user’s understanding of the problem context can be pooled to identify the salient aspects, and
complex problem solving can be more effective as people’s ideas are pooled for a coverage of
the solution space (White & Roth, 2009).

2.2

COLLABORATIVE INFORMATION SEEKING

In collaborative information seeking, a small group of people share the same information need
and they look for information together within the same frame of time (Shah & Marchionini,
2010b).

38

2.2.1 Collaborative Information Behavior

Collaborative information behavior (CIB) is a relatively new research area compared to
individual information behavior research. Poltrock et al. (2003) defined CIB as “activities that a
group or team of people undertakes to identify and resolve a shared information need” Two
central concept of CIB are included in the definition: one concept is people working together to
seek information and the other concept is resolving an information need, which includes seeking,
retrieving, and using information to solve a problem (Reddy & Jansen, 2008). This definition
provides us a starting point to recognize CIB among all the human information behaviors. Recent
studies undertaken across a wide variety of domains showed that the CIB is as common and
natural as individual information behavior (Hansen & Järvelin, 2005; McKenzie, 2003; Talja,
2002).

2.2.1.1 CIB Studies in the Web Context
Collaborative information seeking has been studied in the web environment. Morris (Morris,
2008) conducted a survey among 204 information workers about when they used web search
tools collaboratively and on what tasks they usually collaborate with others. Evans and Chi
(2008) also conducted a survey among 150 people using Mechanical Turk to investigate
collaborative search strategies involved in before search, during search and after search stage.
The surveys revealed that the collaborative web search is a surprisingly common activity.
However, collaborative web search are not well-supported by current web search tools. A most
recent survey (Morris, 2013) reported that respondents engaged in collaborative web search on a
daily basis has increased from 0.9% in 2006 to 11% in 2012. The author suggested the increased
prevalence is a result of the significant change of technology landscape particularly the rise of
39

social networking sites and the growing usage of smartphones. The survey also suggested that
users’ frustration regarding lack of awareness of collaborators’ activities and resulting redundant
work are the primary concerns in current collaborative web search practice. Shah and
Marchionini (2010) presented a user study to study the awareness in collaborative information
seeking. Three instances of the authors’ collaborative web system for exploratory search were
used in user study which is a between-subject design that involved 14 pairs of participants in
each of three conditions. They showed that supporting for group awareness is more signiﬁcant
for effective collaboration than having awareness of personal actions and history.

2.2.1.2 CIB Studies in Academic Settings
Communication and social network among scholars have been recognized and emphasized by
researchers since decades ago. Studies of scholarly communication conducted in the 1960s and
1970s established that scholar’s social tie and networks profoundly affect their information
gathering, reading, awareness and interpretation of documents and literature (Talja & Hansen,
2006). However, only until recently did researchers start to focus on scholar’s collaboration
during the information seeking and retrieval process.
Based on a comparative qualitative study of scholars across a range of humanistic, socialscientific, and scientific disciplines, Talja (2002) identified four types of information-sharing
practice: strategic, paradigmatic, directive and social. Talja (2003) concluded that different kinds
of functionalities within existing systems, and different types of IR systems are needed to
support different types of information sharing.
In a combined ethnographic and experimental study of physicists, researchers discovered
that successful scientific collaboration requires the collection and use of a range of awareness
information that updates team members on the current state of their team’s activities
40

(Sonnenwald et al., 2004). The study investigated the types of information and knowledge that
need to be shared to support situation awareness and the ways in which technology can be used
to facilitate such information sharing.
Blake & Pratt (2002) observed two groups of scientists in public health and biomedical
conducting systematic literature review for the Cochrane Collaboration database. They found
that scientists actively collaborated as they refined the retrieval, extraction, and analysis phases
of a process that they called information synthesis. Based on the characterizations of user
behavior during information synthesis, they proposed the design and progress towards
implementing a tool METIS, which will support the collaborative, iterative, interactive
information synthesis process of scientists.

2.2.1.3 CIB Studies in other Settings
Researchers are studying the collaborative dimensions of information seeking behavior in several
different settings other than academic, such as industry, medicine, military and everyday life.
Hansen and Jarvelin (2005) did an empirical study of collaborative activities within
information seeking and retrieval process in a real-life and information –intensive setting within
the patent domain. The results showed that the patent task performance process involves highly
collaborative aspects throughout the stages of information seeking and retrieval process. They
categorized the activities into document-related collaborative activities and human-related
activities. Finally, a refined IR framework involving collaborative aspects was proposed.
A study of two teams engaged in the software design focused on how team members
collectively sought and shared external information acquired within the team (Poltrock, et al.,
2003). In the study, they identified five collaborative information retrieval strategies: (1)
identifying needs collaboratively, (2) formulating queries collaboratively, (3) retrieving
41

information collaboratively, (4) communicating about information needs and sharing retrieved
information, and (5) coordinating information retrieval activities.
Through a study of CIB of two healthcare teams, Reddy and Jansen (2008) proposed a
model for understanding CIB in context. They found that collaborative information behavior
differs from individual information behavior with respect to how individuals interact with each
other, the complexity of the information need, and the role of information technology. They also
found triggers for collaboration, including lack of domain expertise.
In a study of information behavior in military command and control teams, Sonnenwald
and Pirerce (2000) studied collaboration in dynamic situations with rapidly changing information
and a need for continuous information exchange. They found that the commander played an
important role in identifying critical information needs. Three types of collaborative information
behavior were distinguished: (1) information seeking by recommendation, (2) direct questioning,
and (3) advertising information paths.
Within everyday life information seeking (ELIS) studies, McKenzie (2003) found that
people routinely assist each other in solving information problems. For example, in representing
themselves as information seekers, participants gave accounts that showed them to be active and
on guard, attentively receptive, and surrounded by a supportive network of others like them. The
findings suggest that information seeking theories and models have limited insight into how
information comes or is given through the initiative or actions of another agent.

2.2.1.4 Collaborative Information Seeking Process
In terms of macro-level collaborative search processes, there are several studies attempting to
explore Kuhlthau’s ISP model in collaborative setting. Hyldegard (2006) explored ISP model in
a group educational setting based on a qualitative preliminary case study. She found that
42

collaborative search process cannot be modeled the same way as individual search process. She
suggested that the ISP model should be extended to incorporate the impact of social and
contextual factors in relation to collaborative information seeking process. Shah and Gonzalezlbanez (2010) also attempted to map Kuhlthau’s ISP model to collaborative information seeking.
Through a laboratory study with 42 pairs of participants, they investigated similarities and
disparities between individual and collaborative information seeking process. Similar to
Hyldgard, they also declared that social elements are missing when applying the ISP model in a
collaborative setting.
Very few studies had focused on the micro-level of collaborative search processes.
Halvey et al. (2010) investigated frequency and temporal distribution of user interactions by
analyzing log data in an asynchronous collaborative search system for online video search.
Based on the above literature review, we can see that there are plenty of investigations on
search processes in individual user setting. Approaches from both macro-level and micro-level
had been explored to examine search processes. Particularly, search tactics had been recognized
as a mean of investigating search processes to bridging the macro-level and micro-level
approaches. Search processes were examined in the individual web exploratory search in terms
of transitions or sequences of search tactics. However, current investigations on macro-level
collaborative search processes are limited to employ Kuhlthau’s ISP model in collaborative
environment. Studies on micro-level are very few and limited to online video search and implicit
collaborative search in which users do not explicitly aware their collaborators.

43

2.2.2 Collaborative Search System and Evaluation

Collaborative information seeking retrieval activities has been studied in various environments
including both organizational and the web setting. This dissertation will focus on the online and
web search environment as the context for study collaborative exploratory search. Golovchinsky
et al. (2008) classified the collaboration in web search using three dimensions – intent,
concurrency and location. Collaborative web search can be implicit or explicit in terms of intent.
The implicit collaboration usually occurs in recommendation and filtering systems and it is also
called social search because the large scale of collaboration. However, explicit collaboration
occurs on smaller scales such as in groups of several collaborators. Collaboration in web search
can also be synchronous or asynchronous in terms of concurrency. The collaborative exploratory
search is defined as synchronous and explicit collaborative search in this framework.

There are two modes that a collaborative search system can support the collaborative
exploratory search process: communication mediation and algorithmic mediation (Golovchinsky

44

et al, 2011). In the communication mediation mode, the system serves as intermediary for
collaborators to communicate and share information. In the algorithmic mediation, the search
queries, results and relevance feedback are manipulated by the system so that the collaborators
can be benefit from each other’ search.

2.2.2.1 Systems using Communication Mediation
Recently, several systems have been described in the literature to be designed for supporting
explicit collaboration using communication mediation.
SearchTogether (Morris & Horvitz, 2007) is a prototype that enables remote users to
synchronously or asynchronously collaborate when searching the web. The system aims to
support collaboration with several mechanisms for awareness, division of labor and persistence.
SeachTogether’s collaboration features include group query histories, split searching, page-level
rating and commenting, automatically-generated shared summaries, peek-and-follow browsing,
and integrated chat. An updated version of SearchTogether, called CoSense (Paul & Morris,
2010) added several new features for collaborative information sense-making, including search
strategies view, timeline view, workspace view and chat-centric view.
CoSearch (Amershi & Morris, 2008) is a tool that provides explicit support for groups of
co-located people to search the web when gathered around a single computer. The primary
design goal for CoSearch was to enhance the experience of co-located collaborative web search
in settings where computing resources are limited, by enabling distributed control and division of
labor while maintaining group communication and awareness level.
Coagmento (Shah, 2010) is a system supporting multiple people work together
conducting online information seeking tasks. Coagmento is designed as a plug-in for Firefox. It
allows one to perform various information seeking and communication activities from right
45

within the browser. There are two components of the system, a toolbar and a sidebar. The toolbar
helps user collect information and be aware of the progress in a given collaboration while the
sidebar provide collaboration features such as chat window history of queries, saved pages, and
snippets.
Results space (Capra et al., 2012) is designed to support asynchronous collaborative web
search. The system implements a set of collaborative awareness features that are embedded in
the search results list. Users can use the system to share ratings on search results and share
queries histories.
HeyStaks (Mahony et al., 2009) is a collaborative search tool that utilize the shared
interests with a community of users. Community preferences, rather than individual preferences
are used to re-rank the search results from mainstream search engines.

2.2.2.2 Systems using Algorithmic Mediation
Cerchiamo (Pickens et al., 2008) implements a form of algorithmic mediation, while each team
member searches and browses results independently, the system coordinates their judgments of
relevance, and offers search term suggestions based on team partners’ actions. Furthermore, the
two team members act in different roles – Prospector to discover potentially relevant documents,
and Miner to explore such groupings – and therefore use different interfaces. The system
mediates their activities, enabling the team to discover more, and different, relevant documents
than they would by working separately in parallel.
Querium (Golovchinsky et al, 2011) implements both algorithmic mediation and
communication mediation components. The communication components include chat and notetaking facility, documents and queries sharing, and commenting on documents. The algorithmic

46

mediation components include query fusion and relevance feedback that operate on queries and
documents.

2.2.2.3 Evaluation
Evaluation in a collaborative information seeking environment can be a huge challenge due to
the variety of interactions among system and users. A few efforts had been made to evaluate
various parameters in a collaborative information seeking environment by using traditional IR or
HCI measures (Shah, 2010). Baeza-Yates and Pino (1997) presented an initial attempt to
evaluate performance measures in collaborative IR. They tried to extend the performance
measure in single-user IR system and treat the performance of a group as the summation of
performance of individuals. In a later work (Baeza-yates & Pino, 2006), they evaluated the
relationships among quality of the outcomes, number of people involved and time spent on the
overall task, and total work done. As both works only use measures for evaluating performance,
how well the system support user in the process of collaboration was not evaluated.
There are several studies focused on the usability of the collaborative interface. Wilson
and Schraefel (2008) proposed an analytical inspection evaluation for information seeking
interface which incorporate information seeking models in HCI usability evaluation method. And
later (Wilson & Schreafel, 2009) they extended the framework for application of evaluating
collaborative search interface. This method was designed for HCI experts to evaluate the
usability of the interface; no real users are involved in the evaluation. Morris and Horvitz (2007)
evaluated their SearchTogether system with a user study of fourteen subjects in 7 pairs. They
collected log, observation and questionnaire data from the study. The evaluation showed the
effectiveness of their interface by analyzing the usage of certain features and asking user how
they feel about the features in helping them accomplish the task. In the evaluation of CoSearch
47

system, Amershi and Morris (2008) recruited 36 subjects in 12 groups to use the system.
Subjects were asked to comment on the usability of CoSearch by answering 5-point Likert scale
questions. Shah (2010) evaluated the Coagmento system using a set of objective and subjective
measures in a user study involved 42 pairs of subjects. Objective measures include effectiveness
and efficiency which are based on analyzing search outcome of individual and group. Subjective
measures such as awareness, effort, ease of use and satisfaction, engagement were evaluated
through questionnaire.
Capra et al. (2012) used the TREC Robust corpus for a collaborative search user study so
that standard recall and precision measures can be computed. However, when the collection is
the open web, there is no ground truth can be used to calculate recall and precision. Shah and
González-Ibáñez (2011) proposed precision and recall that can be used in an open-web collection
context. Recall is defined as the ratio of relevant web pages collected by a single team to the
relevant web pages collected by all the teams. Precision is defined as the ratio of relevant web
pages collected by a single team to all the web pages viewed by that team. In addition, the
authors also proposed other measurements such as query diversity, useful webpages and
likelihood discovery. Lavenshtein distance is used to compute the distance between pairs of
queries for each team to measure the query diversity. Useful webpages are defined as webpages
that a user spends at least 30 seconds on it. Likelihood of discovery is used to measure hard to
find information, which is measured by the inverted frequency that each webpage is visited by all
the teams.

2.3

QUERY BEHAVIOR STUDIES

Complex and explorative web searches often involve iterative interaction with retrieval systems,
so that query behaviors have been important topics in individual explorative searches. However,
as a much more complex form of explorative search, collaborative web searches have seldom
been the focus for query behavior studies. A few studies on query behaviors in collaborative
information retrieval have been based on implicit collaborative search where information from a
community of like-minded searchers is shared without explicitly modeling the collaboration
(Balfe & Smyth, 2005). In this section, query behaviors in both individual and collaborative
context are discussed.

2.3.1 Query Behaviors in Individual Search

Researchers have investigated the effect of various factors on users’ query behavior. Bates
(1979) proposed the notion of search tactics and a set of term tactics referring to the search
tactics for reformulating queries in search. Contextual factors such as search experience and
domain knowledge affect search tactics (Ingrid Hsieh-Yee, 1993). Task type is the focus of many
research studies looking at its effect on users’ search behavior. Toms et al. (2008) classified
tasks into three different types: decision–making , fact-finding, and information-gathering. Two
types of task structure -- hierarchical and parallel -- were also considered. They found that the
query length in fact-finding and information-gathering tasks with a hierarchical structure tended
to be longer than those with parallel structure. In information-gathering tasks, users are more
likely to use additional and unprompted terminology. Liu et al, (2010) examined the effect of
task type on query reformulation patterns. Three types of tasks are recognized including simple,
49

hierarchical, and parallel. They also classified query reformulation into five categories:
Generalization, Specialization, Word substitution, Repeat and New. They found that
specialization is used more often in simple and hierarchical tasks while word substitution is used
more often in parallel tasks. Other taxonomies were used to classify query reformulation
patterns. Jansen et al. (2009) summarized six different types of query reformulation patterns:
New, Assistance, Content change, Generalization, Reformulation, and Specialization. Lau and
Horvitz (1999) and He et al. (2002) used the same taxonomy and, depending upon the changes in
query content and query length, four types of patterns can be distinguished: Generalization, New,
Reformulation, and Specialization.
Previous research pointed out that successful assistance to query reformulations must be
designed based on the understanding of users’ query behavior (Jansen et al., 2009). Various
techniques had been used to generate query suggestions. Depends on whether or not a query log
is available, there are two lines of research on query suggestion algorithms. If a query log is
available, the goal is to find good query suggestion candidate in terms of both similarity and
diversity. One approach is to use query cluster – given a query, first identify the cluster of the
query belong to, and then the rest queries in the same cluster can be presented as query
suggestion (Cao et al., 2008). Another approach optimizes the query suggestion using the users’
implicit feedback such as hitting time (Mei, Zhou, & Church, 2008). These techniques require a
large scale of existing query log. A combination of semantic clustering and pseudo-relevance
feedback method was used to generate terms for suggestion when query log is not available (D.
Kelly, Gyllstrom, & Bailey, 2009). Another approach to generate query suggestion without query
logs is to use anchor text (Dang & Croft, 2010).

50

Besides the query suggestion algorithms, there are many studies focused on the query
suggestion presentation. Joho et al. (2002) compared a list and a menu hierarchy display of query
expansion terms. The authors found that although there were no differences on search
performance, users select more terms from the menu hierarchy. Kelly et al. (2009) investigated
the differences between term suggestion and query suggestion. A user study was conducted and
the authors found that subjects prefer query suggestion to term suggestion while there was no
significant difference on search performance. Another study (Kelly, Cushing, Dostert, Niu, &
Gyllstrom, 2010) investigated the effects of usage statistic information on the use of query
suggestion. In the user study, fake usage information of each suggestion query is provided to the
user. The researchers found that subjects were able to distinguish high quality and low quality
queries and were not influenced by the usage information. Kato et al. (2012) proposed a novel
structured presentation interface for query suggestion which can support two popular query
reformulation actions – specialization and parallel movement. Categories with labels are used in
the query suggestion presentation. In addition, new entities as alternative are shown as
alternatives to current entity. Through a task-based evaluation, the results showed that the
structured query suggestion presentation increase the search performance than a flat list
presentation of query suggestions.

2.3.2 Query Behaviors in Collaborative Search

Collaborative querying is a technology that has been widely used in implicit collaborative
information retrieval. Collaborative querying enables users of an information retrieval system to
draw on previous query preferences of other users at the query formulation and reformulation
stages of an information search (Foster, 2006). Previously-learned queries and relevant
51

documents are reused in new and similar search sessions to improve the overall retrieval quality
(Hust, 2004). Often, simulated experiments are employed in these studies, rather than user
studies involving human subjects. Walkderine & Rodden (2001) described the design and
evaluation of a prototype environment that supports community use of query recommendation.
Smyth et al. (2005) introduced a community-based search engine I-SPY. The system
implements a collaborative ranking function based on similar query-document pairs and suggests
similar queries to users. The evaluation results showed that the system offers potential
improvements in search performance, especially when communities of searchers share similar
information needs and use similar queries to express their needs. Another study incorporate ISPY search engine with a social navigation function. The integrated system allows users to
effectively combine their search and browsing activities. The findings from the study indicate
that subjects found the query suggestions were useful during the browsing as it provides the
“community wisdom”.
A study that investigated query formulation and reformulation in explicit collaborative
search is conducted by Capra et al. (2012). They designed an asynchronous collaborative search
user study using the system Results Space. In the study, subjects who did the search later were
provided with query histories of the participants who did the search earlier. They found that
although only 4 participants actually clicked on the provided queries from previous participants,
10 out of 11 participants reported that they indeed looked at the query history and made use of it.
Four motivations of using the query history were summarized from the interview. The first
motivation is to write different queries from what the previous participants had already done.
The second one is to get an overall sense of what the previously participants had searched for.
The third motivation is trying to figure out where to start their search by examining the train of

52

thought of previous participants through query history. The last motivation is that the query
history can inspire participants to get new ideas for issuing their quires.
From the literature, it can be seen that the query behavior and reformulation studies have
reached maturity in the context of individuals. However, the studies on query behavior in the
collaborative search context were relatively fewer and primarily focused on implicit
collaborative search. A comparative study on query behaviors in collaborative search and
individual search can help researchers to understand how users’ query behaviors are affected in
the collaboration setting.

2.4

COMMUNICATION STUDIES

Communication is the process of sending and receiving information. It is vital to the success of
two or more individuals working as a team (Dickinson & McIntyre, 1997). Although the studies
of communication in collaborative searches is a relatively new topic, researchers in other
domains, such as computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), computer mediated
communication (CMC) and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), have studied
communications for a long time. In this section, I first review the studies of communication in a
general teamwork setting, and then I focus on the communication studies in collaborative search.

2.4.1 Communications in Teamwork

There is a stream of work investigating the medium of communications. A well-known media
richness theory (Daft & Lengel, 1984) recognized four different types of communication
53

medium according to the varying degree of richness: face-to-face, video, audio and computermediated text transfers. Different tasks are best mediated by different mediums. For example,
video is good for judgment task but too rich for generating ideas. Text messaging is good for
generating ideas but not rich enough for negotiation (McGrath & Hollingshead, 1993).
Researchers examined the collaborative performance among team members through different
communication medium (Stone & Posey, 2008). They found that the perceived performance was
lower in computer-mediated text groups than that in face-to-face groups when the groups were
not trained. But with training, there is no difference on perceived performances between the
groups using two different communication medium.
Two types of communication styles were recognized in the literature: task oriented versus
socially oriented (Bass, 1990). Task oriented communication focuses on fulfilling the
responsibilities while socially oriented communication focuses on satisfying the emotional needs
of interpersonal relationships. In a study of investigating communication in CSCL environment
(Strijbos et al., 2004), the researchers proposed a framework of coding communication messages,
which can be used to distinguish socially oriented communication from task oriented
communication. There is also a line of work investigate the emotions involved in the text-based
communication. For example, Brooks and colleagues (2013) proposed a machine learning
technique that can automatically detect and classify affections in the chat logs.
The theories and methodologies from communication studies in general teamwork
settings can be borrowed by researchers in collaborative search studies to investigate the role of
communication in the collaborative search process.

54

2.4.2 Communications in Collaborative Search

Many collaborative search strategies and tactics have been identified to be related to
communications between team members in the collaborative search process. Foley and Smeaton
(2010) proposed division of labor and sharing of knowledge as two important strategies of
successful collaboration in search. Both strategies can be facilitated by the communication
between team members. Through a study of library users, Twidale (1997) identified a set of
search tactics that may require the communication with others. Examples include, users may
seek for help from the reference librarian or brainstorm with others to generate new approach for
search. Reddy and colleagues (2009) identified three reasons for communication among team
members while looking for information: consulting, brainstorming and team cognition. Based on
the identified importance of communication in collaborative search, most existing collaborative
search systems have implemented instant message as the function to support the communication
among team members (Morris & Horvitz, 2007; Shah, 2010).
Instant message is the simplest way of supporting communication and it offers high user
freedom. How to design advanced support for communications should be based upon the
understanding of cost and benefits of communications in the collaborative search process
(González-Ibáñez et al., 2013). Hertzum (2008) found that communications could be effective in
establishing common ground between team members. However, other researchers also reported
that communication could introduce extra workload or distract users from their search tasks
(Carroll et al., 2006). González-Ibáñez and colleagues (2013) investigated the cost and benefit of
three different communication mediums: face-to-face, computer-mediated text, and audio plus
the text. They found that the face-to-face medium allows users to interact effortlessly, but it also
generated more non-task related communications which are at the risk of hurting the search
55

performance. The communication through text medium was more focused on the task-related
conversations but also limit the social aspects of communication in collaborative search. The
audio plus text medium was able to provide the right level of social presence and at the same
time did not distract team members from the task too much. Another study focused on the usages
of communication for coordination (Shah, 2013) in the collaborative search process. The study
presented the effects of three different awareness conditions on the coordination through chat
messages. Their findings showed that a lower level of awareness support increases the cost of
coordination in the collaborative search process.
The research community of collaborative search has realized and emphasized the
importance of communication in collaborative search process. I think additional studies of
investigating the patterns of communication, especially the relationship between communication
patterns and search outcomes are needed. These studies can help researchers to understand the
benefits and costs of communication, and can help to design systems to support effective
communications in the collaborative search process.

METHODOLOGY

The data used in this study was collected from a laboratory-based user study. Participants were
recruited to our lab to use a collaborative search system I designed. The participants were
required to work on exploratory search tasks either collaboratively with a partner or individually.
In this chapter, I introduce the experiment design of the user study, including system design,
participants and tasks, experiment conditions and procedures, and data analysis methods.

3.1

SYSTEM DESIGN

3.1.1 System Features

In this study, I need a system that could help team users conduct web search collaboratively. One
option is to use an integrated collaborative search system that have both search and collaboration
features. Another option is to use one system for search and the other system for communication,
such as using both Google and Skype in the study. The reason I chose an integrated system is
that I need to study the activity and information flow during the collaborative search process. If
the activities are logged in different systems, it would be difficult to examine the activity and
information flow. In addition, dealing with multiple systems may be an extra workload for the
57

users. A good collaborative search system for this study should meet two requirements. First, the
system should have basic functions that make the collaborative search possible. Second, the
system should not be too complicated so that users can easily learn how to use the system and at
the mean time have the flexibility in exploring various search tactics themselves. Third, the
features in the system should have been commonly used and accepted in previous studies, so that
the findings based on the user behavior of using the system can be generalized.
Recently, several systems have been described in the literature to be designed for
supporting explicit collaboration, including SearchTogether (Morris & Horvitz, 2007),
Coagmento (Shah & Marchionini, 2010), Cerchiamo (Pickens et al., 2008) and Querium
(Golovchinsky et al., 2011). The prototype system CollabSearch1 was built upon the examination
of features in these systems. Some features that have been reported to be very important, such as
chat and shared workspace were implemented in CollabSearch. As shown in figure 1, the left
side of the system’s interface is the space for chat. And the main interface contains three frames:
topic statement, web search and team workspace. The topic statement frame shows the task
description on which the user is currently working. Users can also post their comments below the
task description. The search frame connects the user’s query to Google, and displays the Google
search results. Users can also see their search histories (queries) as well as those of their
teammates. Users examine search results for relevant information, and can save a whole web
page or a snippet of the page. All the saved web pages and snippets, collected by the user and the
teammate, are stored in the team workspace frame.

All the features implemented in

CollabSearch are well studied and commonly used in other collaborative search studies.
Therefore, the generalizability of observed user behavior using this system can be achieved.

3.1.2 Design Rational for Process Collaboration

Coordinated searching is an important search strategies observed by (Twidale, 1997). Using
CollabSearch, users in the same team can communicate with each other by sending instant text
messages to coordinate their search processes. I didn’t implement advanced features such as split
search in SearchTogether because the coordination process can be accomplished through
communication and users can be creative in how they want to complete the search tasks
collaboratively. In addition, implementing uncommonly used features would result in unique
behaviors observed in this particular collaborative search system. The shared search history
provide support for the process collaboration as team members can be aware of each other’s
search progress by checking the search history.

Figure 3.1. The web search frame of CollabSearch

59

3.1.3 Design Rational for Products Collaboration

In addition to the collaboration on search process, sharing search products have been recognized
as very important search strategies. The team workspace is designed for users to share the
relevant search results. All of the saved web pages and snippets, collected by the users in the
same team, are saved in the team workspace. A notice is displayed at the top when new items are
saved to the team workspace. Users can click on the title of an item to view more details about
the item in the workspace. Users can also decide whether a particular item is visible to other
team members or not. The items saved by the user him/herself and the teammates are displayed
in different colors and the user can choose to view a particular sets of items by using the filter.

Figure 3.2. The workspace frame of CollabSearch

For each item saved in the workspace, the user need to assign a rating to indicate the
quality of the saved item. One- star means that the item is not relevant and has low quality and
60

five-star means the item is highly relevant and has high quality. Users also have the options to
assign tags to the items in the workspace saved by themselves or they can comments on the items
saved by themselves and the partners.

3.2

EXPERIMENT DESIGN

3.2.1 Experiment Conditions

I adopted a mix-method experiment design with one within-subject factor: search task; and one
between-subject factor: search condition, which refers to two search modes:
Collaborative search condition (COL). In this condition, two participants formed a team, and
they worked on the same task simultaneously. As I was trying to simulate remotely-located
collaboration, the team members could only communicate with each other by sending instant
messages or reading each other’s search histories. The collected results are shared in the team
workspace, but no face-to-face communication was allowed.
Individual search condition (IND). This condition was devised as a baseline. In this
condition, participants worked on the exploratory search tasks individually. When used by
individual users, the chat function of CollabSearch was hidden.

3.2.2 Participants and Tasks

Fifty-four participants including 26 females and 28 males were recruited from the University of
Pittsburgh. Among all of the participants, 36 signed up in pairs and thus formed 18 teams, which
61

were assigned to the COL condition. Two participants work as a team know each other before
they sign up for the study because it’s uncommon for strangers to do collaborative search
together. The remaining 18 individual participants were assigned to the IND condition. All
participants are students and they use computers and conduct web searches on a daily basis.
Twenty-four participants are graduate students whereas the other 30 are undergraduates.
According to a question asking them to rate their search experiences from 1-7 (with 1 as the least
experienced and 7 as the most experienced), the responses ranged from 4 to 7. Thus most of our
participants were experienced searchers.
Two exploratory web search tasks were used in this study. Both of them have been used
in other collaborative web search studies (Paul & Morris, 2010; Shah & Marchionini, 2010). The
topic of one task is literature search, asking the participants to collect information for a report on
the effect of social networking service and software. The topic of the other task is travel
planning, asking the participants to collect information for planning a trip to Helsinki. Morris
(2008) noted that literature search and travel planning are two common collaborative search
tasks. Therefore, both of the tasks are appropriate to study collaborative web search. The
description of each task is shown in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 respectively.
The reason that I chose these two tasks is that they represent two different types of
exploratory web search tasks. First, the T1 is a recall-oriented information-gathering task,
whereas T2 is a utility-based decision-making task. Second, the relevance criteria in these two
tasks are different according to Saracevic’s relevance theory (2007). Topical relevance is
probably the most important criterion in T1 because the topic is more objective in relevance
judgments, whereas T2 involves users’ subjective judgments and even personal preferences, so
the relevance criteria contain many subjective and personal flavors.
62

Task 1: Literature search 2
The College Network News Channel wants to do a documentary on the effects of social
networking services and software. You are responsible for collecting various relevant
information about this topic from the web. Your goal is to collect information for preparing
a report on this topic and it should address the following issues:
Emergence and spread of social networking sites, such as MySpace, Facebook,
Twitter, and del.icio.us, statistics about popularity of such sites (How many users? How
much time they spend? How much content?), impacts on students and professionals,
commerce around these sites (How do they make money? How do users use them to make
money?), and examples of usage of such services in various domains, such as health-care
and politics."
To prepare this report, search and visit any website that you want and look for
specific aspects as given in the guideline above. As you find useful information, highlight
and save relevant snippets. Later, you can use these snippets to compile your report. You
may also want to save the relevant websites as bookmarks. Remember your main objective
here is to collect as many relevant snippets as possible.
Figure 3.3. Information-gathering task (T1)

Task 2: Travel Planning3
You and your friend are planning a four-day vacation in Helsinki, Finland from Dec 23th 26th. You want to search for information about how you will spend your vacation in
Finland. Assume that your flights are booked (leaving the US on the 22th of Dec and
returning to the US on the 27th of Dec) and your hotels are booked too. But you have not
yet planned the activities for your vacation. Your goal is to come up with a travel plan of
things you will be doing on your vacation. You have certain constraints as follows:
You can only spend 200 Euros (100 Euros per person). Of all the activities your group
chooses for the vacation, one has to be an outdoor activity, the other is a dining activity,
and the third is a cultural activity. You are free to choose any other types of activities in
addition to these three.
As you find useful information, highlight and save relevant snippets. Later, you can use
these snippets to compile your travel plan. You may also want to save the relevant websites
as bookmarks. Remember you main objective is to collect as many relevant snippets as
possible.

3.2.3 Experiment Procedure

Each team in COL worked on both tasks. The order of the two tasks was rotated to reduce the
learning and fatigue effect. During the experiment, participants were introduced to the study and
the system, and completed an entry questionnaire to establish their background. Then,
participants worked on a training task for 15 minutes to become familiar with the system. They
went on T1 or T2, depending on the task order assigned to each team. They had 30 minutes for
each task. At the end of each task, participant completed a post-search questionnaire about their
satisfaction on the performance and the cognitive load of the search experiences. At the end of
the experiment, I conducted a short interview with both of the participants in the team.
The experiment procedure in IND is identical to the COL condition except that only one
participant undertaking the entire process. The questionnaire used in the IND was modified to
remove the questions related to the collaboration, and no interview was conducted at the end.

3.3

DATA ANALYSIS METHODS

3.3.1 Building the Groundtruth

When the participants were saving documents in the workspace, they rated the relevance of the
saved documents using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 being not relevant and 5 being highly
relevant. I built a pool that contains all the saved documents from the 54 participants for each
task. Documents that have the same URL are considered as the same documents. One document
could be saved by multiple participants. In order to determine the relevance of each document, I
64

adopted the IMDB’s Weighted Ranking method, whose purpose is to determine the top 250 rated
movies in IMDB (Wikipedia, 2014).
For a given saved document di, a simple way of computing the relevance ȓ(di) is through
the average of all ratings. IMDB’s Weighted Ranking method also takes into account the
confidence of the averaged rating. In this method, the relevance score of each document ȓ’(di) is
computed based on Equation (3.1). Cm is the average rating for all documents in the pool, which
is 3.99 in my study. In the formula, v denotes the number of voters and in my study is the
number of participants that had saved the documents. In IMDB method, m is the minimum votes
to be displayed for top 250 movies. Here I set it to 1.
Eq. (3.1)
The thread-hold for a relevant document is set to be ȓ’(di) greater than 3.5. The value is
determined based on the principle that at least one participant had rated the document as great
than 3.

3.3.2 Performance Measurements

Precision and recall are commonly used measurements for search performance. Based on the
method introduced in Section 3.3.1, I defined the pool of the relevant webpages (Ground-Truth
data denoted by G). Then, for each participant u, the precision P(u) and recall R(u) were
computed using Equation (3.2) and Equation (3.3), in which S(u) are a set of webpages saved by
participant u.

65

Eq. (3.2)

Eq. (3.3)
User satisfaction Sat is a subjective measurement which reflects the participants’
perception of the search outcome (Spink, 2002). In this study, I measure the participants’
satisfaction based on their responses to three questions asking them to evaluate their satisfaction
on the search outcome and performance using 7-point Likert scale. A higher score indicates a
better satisfaction.
For participants in COL condition, the questions were asked as follows:
1. I am satisfied with the amount of the information collected by our team.
2. I am satisfied with the quality of the information collected our team.
3. I am satisfied with the overall performance of our team.
For participants in IND, the questions were asked as follows:
1. I am satisfied with the amount of the information I collected.
2. I am satisfied with the quality of the information I collected.
3. I am satisfied with my overall performance.
Cognitive load (Cog) can measure how hard one have to work for solving a complex
problem, which can be used as a subjective measurement to evaluate the participants’ perception
towards their search experience. I used the instrument which has been used in another
collaborative web search study (Shah & González-Ibáñez, 2011) to measure participants’

66

cognitive load, which is a simplified version of NASA’s Task Load index (TLX) (Hart &
Staveland, 1988). The instrument includes the following five questions.
The participants responded to these questions in the post-task questionnaire on a 7-point

a negative user perception to the search experience.

3.3.3 Statistical Model

Since my study contains both within-subject and between-subject factors, and data maybe
correlated, I adopted generalized estimating equation (GEE) to fit the model to the data, and
analyzed the relationships between the independent variables and dependent variables, as well as
the correlations. p≤.05 was used to test any significant differences. GEE is a flexible statistical
tool which deals with repeated measure and non-normal distributed data.

SUMMARY

In this chapter, I introduced the experiment design of the user study. A collaborative web search
system that could support both web search and collaboration was developed and used in the user
study. The experiment was designed with one within-subject factor task type and one betweensubject factor search condition (individual search or collaborative search). Eighteen pairs of
participants were recruited to work in the collaborative search condition, and another eighteen
individual participants were recruited to work in the individual search condition. Participants in
both search conditions worked on two tasks. One task is a recall-oriented information-gathering
task and the other task is a utility-based decision-making task. Participants’ behaviors were
logged in the system and their perceptions of the search experiences were collected using
questionnaires.
The data collected in this user study was used for the analysis in the following three
chapters. Chapter 4 provides the analysis of the overall picture of search states involved in the
collaborative search process. Chapter 5 concentrates on the query behaviors. Chapter 6 is a deep
dive into the communications between team members in the collaborative search process.

SEARCH STATES IN COLLABORATIVE SEARCH

There are two approaches to study search process. The first approach is modeling information
seeking process from top-down, focusing on qualitative constructs such as stages and context in
information seeking process. The second approach is modeling information seeking process from
bottom up by identifying descriptive categories such as user action, search strategies or search
tactics and the transition relationships among them (Kim, 2009). In my study, I adopted the
bottom-up approach which generates data-driven search process model based on the analysis of
log data. The data was collected from the user study described in chapter 3. This chapter
addresses the first research question RQ1 - How to model the search states in collaborative
exploratory search process? The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method is used to model the
search states in the search process as hidden variables. I detailed this process in section 4.1. The
procedures to apply HMM are shown in section 4.2 (RQ1.1). Section 4.3 introduces the HMM
results for individual search process and collaborative search process. The validity of HMM and
the comparison between individual and collaborative search process are addressed in this section
(RQ1.2, RQ1.3). The applications of HMM outputs in analyzing the connections between
patterns of search process and task differences or search performances are discussed in section
4.4 (RQ1.4, RQ1.5).

4.1

MODELING SEARCH STATES USING HMM

A popular method for examining the search process is to analyze the sequence of user action
transitions. The Markov chain has been applied in many research works to model user’s action or
tactic sequence. The differences among these studies are the units in the Markov Chain. Chen
and Cooper (2002) directly use the actions recorded in a library catalog system as the unit and
apply Markov Chain to identify user action patterns. Chapman (1981) recognized nine states as
the basic units and calculated the probability of search-state transition using Markov Chain.
Using Markov Chain analyses, Xie and Joo (2010) first manually coded the transition logs into
13 search tactics and then adopted a five-order Markov chain to do the analysis. Most abovementioned works use the Markov model on the observed action level, which made the oversimplistic Markov assumption – each action in the sequence is only related to the previous one
action. One way to overcome the inappropriate assumption is to model the sequence at the
unobserved search states level. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a well-established model
with mature techniques for parameter estimation, which can be used to model the unobserved
hidden search states and the observed user actions simultaneously.
The HMM model is described in Figure 4.1. There is a sequence of user actions from A1
to AM. Using HMM, it is assumed that there is also a sequence of hidden search states, from H1
to HM. HMM assumes that each action is generated by a corresponding hidden search state, but
different actions can be generated by the same search state with different probabilities. In this
case, each action is corresponding to only one search state, and the search state sequence forms a
Markov Chain.
A HMM model has several parameters: the number of hidden states N, the start
probability of each state π, the transition probabilities among any two hidden states Aij and the
70

emission probability from each state to each action Bij. By only defining the N and π, a BaumWelch algorithm (Baum, Soules, & Weiss, 1970) can be used to estimate the emission and
transition probabilities.

4.2

PROCEDURES OF APPLYING HMM

4.2.1 Categorizing User Interactions

Before using HMM, I preprocessed user actions by classifying them into meaningful categories.
Belkin and colleagues (1995) classified user interactions using four dimensions: method of
searching, mode of retrieval, goal of retrieval, and resource considered. The combination of
dimensions defines multiple user interactions. In his model, each dimension was presented as
binary values. Later Kim (2009) expanded some dimensions with more than two values and
removed some dimensions and values that do not apply to web search environment. Xie (2010)
used two dimensions—methods and resources to classify user interactions, and she defined 8
values for methods and 6 values for resources.
71

For team users, the interactions are more complex than individual users. For example,
when team users use CollabSearch for a collaborative web search, the items saved in the
workspace are both the ones saved by user him or herself and the partner. Therefore, it is useful
to distinguish the interactions in which the user clicks the workspace to check on his/her own
saved items from the interactions where the user checks on the partners’ items.

Figure 4.2. Three dimensions for classifying user interactions

Inspired by those ideas of classifying interactions using dimensions, I employed the
following three dimensions to categorize user interactions in collaborative web search: method,
object and source, as shown in Figure 3. Some of the values of the method dimension, like
search, scan, select and capture were also used in Kim’s model (Kim, 2009). However, I added
another value communicate, which is unique in collaborative search. The values of the object
dimension include all the possible objects that may exist in the collaborative web search process,

72

including query, topic statement, single item in search result, chat messages, list of saved items,
and single saved items. The source dimension is unique in collaborative search context because it
is important to distinguish the source of a particular object in collaborative process, whether it is
from the user him/herself or from the partner or it is a shared/mix object.

Table 4.1. User action categorization

Actions

Description

Search – query – self (Q)

A user issues a query

Select- item-self (V)

A user clicks on a result in the returned result list

Capture-item-self (S)

A user saves a snippet or bookmarks a webpage

Scan-list of saved item – mixed (Wm) A user checks the workspace without clicking on any
particular item.
Select – single saved item –self (Ws)

A user clicks on an item in the workspace saved by
him/herself

Select – single saved item – partner A user clicks on an item in the workspace saved by
the partner
(Wp)
Scan-topic -shared (T)

A user clicks on the topic statement for view

Communicate- messages-self (Cs)

A user sends a message to the other user

Communicate-message-partner (Cp)

A user receives a message from the other user

Using the combination of the above three dimensions, the following observable user
interactions are defined. Search-query-self represents user issue a query while search-querypartner represents user issue a query originally proposed by the partner (user issue the query by
click a query in the search history). In terms of the actions related to workspace, user can scan
the whole workspace without clicking on any particular item; this kind of interaction is the scanlist of saved item-mix. If user click on a particular item; depends on whether the item is saved by
the user or the partner, the interaction can be select-single saved-item-self or select –single saved
73

item- partner. All the possible combinations of the three dimensions that can be observed in the
CollabSearch system are listed in Table 4.1. There are other possible combinations like select –
item – partner, which means user can click on an item in the partner’s search result. However,
this interaction is not supported in CollabSearch because team users do not share the screen and
they cannot see the process when the partner issuing a query and get a returned results list. The
process is not shared in CollabSearch.

4.2.2 Model Selection

It is still an open issue for determining the number of hidden states. Determining number of
hidden states N is a model selection problem in learning the Hidden Markov Model. A complex
model with large number of states will help to increase the sequence likelihood because there are
more parameters that can be used to describe the model more precisely. But it has high risk to
cause over-fitting. A simple model is less likely to over-fit on the given dataset, but it may not be
able to uncover the natural feature of datasets. In model selection, the information criterion such
as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or its variants (Akaike, 1974) and Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) (McQuarrie & Tsai, 1998) can be used to determining the optimal
number of states. In this paper, I used BIC because it also considers the sample size.
Eq. (4.1)

The number of parameters in HMM is p, and the number of total samples is s. The BIC is
defined in Equation (3.1), in which L denotes the log-likelihood of all samples. The p can be
calculated using p = (N – 1) + (N – 1) × (N – 1) + N × (M – 1), considering the summation of all

74

probabilities is 1. The M denotes the number of action types. A large log-likelihood and less
parameter are preferred for BIC.
Figure 4.3 plots the BIC values against the number of hidden states in the IND condition.
We can see that BIC has the optimal value when the number of hidden states is set to 4.

Figure 4.3. BIC Evaluation of HMM parameters in IND

In Figure 4.4, we can see that the BIC has the optimal value when the number of hidden
states in the COL condition is set to 6.

HMM RESULTS

4.3.1 HMM Results for Individual Search

Hidden states of HMM are represented by the emission probability distribution over observable
user actions. The results of emission probability distribution in IND are shown in Table 4.2, in
which I removed the probabilities that are smaller than 0.05 for better visualizing each hidden
state. The first hidden state has a very high probability (0.99) of generating the interaction Q
(defined in Table 1). Therefore, I termed it HQ. Using the same naming criteria, I defined the
second and third hidden states as HV and HS, respectively. It is clear that these three hidden
states are directly related to search. The fourth hidden state is the most interesting one; it has a
0.57 probability of generating Ws and a 0.42 probability of generating T. I think that this hidden
state is related to sense-making, which is the process of bridging a knowledge gap that prevents
the user from accomplishing the task (Dervin, Foreman_Wernet, & Lauterbach, 2003). In the
exploratory search, participants may lack knowledge about the information problem, result space
or the needed vocabulary for search (Qu & Furnas, 2007). In this hidden state, the participants
were trying to evaluate the current search stage and define the current search problem in order to
advance the search. Therefore, I named it the hidden state of defining search problem (HD).

In HMM, each observed action corresponds to a hidden state in Table 4.2. To compare
the differences between two tasks (in Section 4.4.1), I computed the mean transition probabilities
from each hidden state to any of the four (including itself) hidden states across all the
participants. The transition probabilities are visualized in Figure 4.5 (probabilities lower than
0.05 are omitted). There is a pattern of high transition probabilities on HQHVHS, which
represents a typical search pattern – a query is issued and results are viewed and saved if they are
relevant. After saving an item, the participant may continue view another item HSHV, issue
another query HS HQ, or transitioned to the sense-making states before issuing another query
HSHDHQ.

Figure 4.5. Comparison of transition probabilities of hidden states in IND for two tasks
(left: T1, right: T2; a red arrow indicates significant difference: *p<0.05)

To validate HMM, I compared its output with Marchionini’s information search process
(ISP) model (Marchionini, 1995), which is a well-established model in the information seeking
77

field. I found that the transitions among hidden states were very similar to the transitions among
sub-processes in the ISP model. The default transitions in the ISP model can be mapped into
HDHQHVHSHD (Table 3), which is also the pattern of the highest transition
probabilities in Figure 6. The ISP model also described the high and low transition probabilities
among different sub-processes. For example, “extract information” (HS) had a high probability
of transitioning to “examining results” (HV) and “formulate query” (HQ). Those transitions were
also represented in the HMM output, with more details on the probabilities. Another model that
can be used to validate the HMM result is the model of sense-making loop (Russell, Stefik,
Pirolli, & Card, 1993). The sense-making loop is also reflected in the HMM output (transitions
between sense-making related hidden states and search related hidden states) with more details
on the transition probabilities.

4.3.2 HMM Results for Collaborative Search

The emission probabilities of each hidden state over observable interactions are shown in Table
4.4. The first three hidden states have high probabilities of generating Q, V and S respectively,
78

which are similar to the first three hidden states in the IND condition. Therefore, I assigned them
with the same names as in IND. These hidden states are directly related to the search while the
rest three are related sense-making.

HD has a 0.36 probability of generating Wm, a 0.36 probability of generating T and a
0.21 probability of generating Cs. I think that this is a sense-making hidden state in which the
participants define the current search problem. Besides looking at the information in workspace
and topic statement, the participants may also communicate with their partner to discuss the
current search problem. The remaining two hidden states HW and HC are related to the
communication between team members during the sense-making stage. HW represents the state
of checking the saved item details in the workspace whereas HC represents the continuous
communication between team members.
The transition probabilities were visualized for each search task respectively in Figure 4.6
(probabilities lower than 0.05 are omitted). The results show that sense-making in the
collaborative exploratory search (HD+HW+HC) are more important and complex than that in the
individual search (HD only). I also recognized different types of sense-making states, such as
79

chat-centric sense-making (HC) and workspace-centric sense-making (HW). These results are
consistent with the sense-making types mentioned in (Paul & Morris, 2010). In addition, our
HMM outputs were consistent with Evans and Chi’s model (Evans & Chi, 2008). Their model
consists of three phases: before search, during search and after search. In the before-search
stage, users mainly focus on gathering requirements, which can be mapped to the HD in the
HMM output. The during search stage for informational tasks highlights the fact that “the
foraging and sense-making loops are tightly coupled,” which is also reflected in the HMM
output. The sharing of information with others in the after-search stage is also reflected in the
HMM output with more details on what follows the sharing. The HMM output shows that after
sharing, users could explicitly communicate about it or continue to the next round of defining a
search problem.

(left: T1, right: T2; red arrows indicate significant difference: *p<0.05, **p<0.01)

80

The consistency of our HMM results with that of previous search process models in both
individual search and collaborative search demonstrate the validity of HMM. The HMM results
not only reveal the patterns found by previous models, but also provided more detailed
information than previous model such as probabilities of transitions among different hidden
tactics, which can be utilized to better understand users’ search behavior.

4.3.3 Comparison of IND and COL

When comparing the hidden states in IND and COL, it is clear that they both have search related
and sense-making related hidden states. The three search related hidden states (HQ, HV and HS)
are similar in both IND and COL. Although there is a similar sense-making state HD, it is
slightly different in IND and COL. HD in COL has a certain probability of generating Cs,
indicating that explicit communication is also a way for defining search problem in COL. In
addition, there are two more sense-making related hidden states HW and HC in COL. This
shows that sense-making is more complex in COL. the participants not only need to make sense
of their own information but also the partner’s information.

81

I further examined the differences using statistical test. The mean percentage of search
related hidden states (HQ+HV+HS) in compared in IND and COL on the two tasks (Figure
4.7(a)) and found significant differences (Table 4.5). The percentage of search related hidden
states in IND is significantly higher than that in COL (Mean diff = .46, SE=.03, p<.001). The
participants in IND had more activities on the search and fewer activities on sense-making
compared to the participants in COL. Comparing to COL, the sense-making is relatively easier in
IND because there is only one person’s information. The percentage of search related hidden
states is significantly higher in T1 than in T2 (Mean diff = .11, SE=.02, p<.001). This might
indicate that in a recall-oriented information gathering task, sense-making is less critical than in
utility-based decision making task, in which users need to negotiate on what kind of information
is relevant.
The interaction of condition and task is shown in Figure 4.7(b). There is no significant
difference on search percentage between the two tasks in IND. However in COL, search
percentage is significantly higher in T1 than in T2. This suggests that the task difference is more
sensitive in COL. The participants were more likely to take different search strategies in COL for
different tasks.

In terms of transition probabilities, there are also similarities and differences between
COL and IND (Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6). The similarity is that transitions within search related
hidden states and within sense-making hidden states are higher than between them. The
difference is that the transition between search hidden states and sense-making hidden states is
higher in COL than in IND, which means that the participants in COL needed to switch between
search and sense-making more often.

4.4

APPLICATIONS OF HMM

The benefit of HMM is that it provides detailed information on the transition probabilities among
different states in the search process. In this section, I show the applications of such information
through two cases.

4.4.1 Task Differences

Evans and Chi’s model (Evans & Chi, 2008) built different search processes for three different
types of user needs: informational, navigational and transactional. However, their model cannot
distinguish two tasks within the same category. In this study, I showed that the HMM outputs
can be used to reveal task differences.
In HMM, each observed action is corresponding to a hidden state (Table 4.2; Table 4.4).
To compare the differences between two tasks, I computed the mean transition probabilities from
each hidden state to any of the four (including itself) hidden states across all the participants. The

83

task comparison of individual search and collaborative search using HMM outputs are visualized
in Figure 6 and Figure 8, respectively.
In individual search, the patterns in the two tasks are very similar except HVHQ,
which I found it is significantly lower in T1 than in T2 (Mean diff = -.06, SE=.02, p=.012). In
T2, participants were more likely to issuing another query after viewing a result, which might
because the item was irrelevant. This may reflect the differences of task requirements. T2 is a
decision making task, the participants are more concerned about the integration of information
rather than collecting information. Therefore, they may be more selective on what information to
save.
In the collaborative search, we can see that there are several significant differences
between the two tasks, especially for the transitions between search related hidden states and
sense-making related hidden states. HVHC is significantly lower in T1 than in T2 (Mean diff
= -.20, SE=.03, p<.001), so does HSHC (Mean diff = -.10, SE=.03, p=.001). These differences
suggest that when working on decision-making task T2, the participants were more likely to
communicate with each other after they viewed or saved an item. Also, HWHC is significantly
lower in T1 than in T2 (Mean diff = -.17, SE=.07, p=.013). After viewing an item saved in the
workspace, the participants were more likely to discuss what they think about the saved item in
decision-making task T2. The transitions from HD are also different in the two tasks. HDHQ
is significantly higher in T1 than in T2 (Mean diff =.11, SE=.03, p<.001) whereas HDHW is
significantly lower in T1 than in T2 (Mean diff = -.16, SE=.06, p=.003). These results may
indicate that in the information-gathering task such as T1, the participants preferred to have an
overview of the workspace when they need to make sense of the current search problem whereas
the users in decision-making task such as T2 preferred to look at the details of each saved items.

84

In both of the individual search and the collaborative search process, HMM recognized two types
of hidden tactics, i.e. the search related tactics and the sense-making related tactics. The search
related tactics remain similar in both search conditions, but sense-making related tactics are more
complex in the collaborative search than that in the individual search. In terms of task difference,
the collaborative search process exhibits more sensitivity on task differences. The ability of
HMM on detecting task differences can be used for intelligent system design. When certain task
type is detected, the system can provide support that is more suitable for the task.

4.4.2 Connections between Search Processes and Search Outcomes

The ultimate goal of studying search process is to locate the core factors that influence search
outcomes and provide better support for those factors. I am interested in locating those factors in
collaborative web search process from real user behaviors, particularly how sense-making tactics
influence the overall search performance.
In this study, I am particularly interested in how sense-making are related to search
performance. Therefore, I examined the correlation of the following transitions with the search
performance, including HSHD, HSHC, HVHC, HDHQ and HCHQ. These
transitions are chosen based on two criteria: 1) the probability in either task is higher than 0.05;
2) it represents a transition between search and sense-making. I also considered HWHC
because it represents the transition between two different types of communication: from implicit
communication to explicit communication.

The results are shown in Table 4.6. ↑ means that the transition is positively related to the
performance and user perception while ↓ represents a negative relationship. I didn’t find any
significant differences on HVHC and HSHC, thus they are not shown in the table. I found
that the transition from sense-making to search (HDHQ) is positively related to performance
and user perception. However, the transition from search to sense-making (HSHD) is
negatively related to performance and user perception. This might be caused by the fact that
when the participants were facing knowledge gap during exploratory search, they need to transit
to sense-making states; and when the problems were solved, they transited back to the search
states. Another interest finding is about HCHQ, which is negatively related to the satisfaction.
It might suggest that the explicit communication maybe triggered by a problem in search; which
makes the participants feeling less satisfied with their performance. In addition, I found that
HWHC is positively related to cognitive load, which means that a transition from implicit
communication to explicit communication increases the participants’ efforts. This might indicate
that team members had something to negotiate through explicit communication, which increases
the cognitive load.

SUMMARY

In this chapter, I adopted a novel approach HMM to automatically model search process using
hidden states. The HMM outputs on search process were used to compare the search process in
collaborative exploratory search and individual exploratory search. Through the analysis, I
demonstrated that HMM is a valid method for automatically analyzing search processes.
Different patterns of hidden states were recognized and compared in both individual and
collaborative search. In addition, the patterns of hidden states between two types of tasks were
quite different in collaborative search. I also discovered the relationships between search
processes and search outcomes.
Through the analysis of search processes in exploratory search using HMM, I have
several important findings. First, two types of hidden states are recognized in both individual and
collaborative search processes: the search related hidden states and the sense-making related
hidden states. This is consistent with previous studies that exploratory search can be regarded as
an intertwine process of search and sense-making (Qu & Furnas, 2007). Second, by using HMM
in analyzing the individual search process and the collaborative search process, I obtained similar
transition patterns as defined in several well-established information seeking process models,
demonstrating the validity of our model. Third, I found that the search related states are similar
in both individual and collaborative search. However, sense-making related states are more
complex in collaborative search. This again is consistent with previous findings. The ability to
capture different types of sense-making demonstrates the generalizability of our model.
With regards to task type, the collaborative search is more sensitive to the task difference.
I didn’t find many differences on the search process between two tasks in the individual search.
However, the search processes between the two tasks in collaborative search are quite different.
87

There are more transitions between search and explicit communications in the utility-based
decision-making task. It indicates that this type of task requires users to be more active in the
collaboration, a fact that might be caused by the need for negotiation and achieving agreement.
Based on the analysis of relationship between search processes and search outcomes, I found that
the transition from search to sense-making has a negative relationship with the performance
while the transition from sense-making to search has a positive relationship with the
performance. I think that when sense-making is needed, it means the user has to spend time on
absorbing information or on resolving problems. If we can make the transition smoother, it may
improve the search performance.

QUERY BEHAVIORS IN COLLABORATIVE SEARCH PROCESSES

The goal of information seeking is to find relevant information. In this process, issuing queries is
a very important component. This chapter focuses on the analysis of query behavior involved in
the search process. The data are transaction logs including user queries and user actions collected
from the user study in Chapter 3. To serve as a baseline for testing the effect of collaboration on
users’ query behaviors, individual search is included in the comparison. The previous studies
indicate that task type has a significant impact on users’ query behavior (Tom et al., 2008).
Therefore, I consider the task as an independent variable. Query behavior can be measured from
many aspects. In this study, I focus on three dimensions of query behavior: query vocabulary
features, query reformulation patterns and successful query rate. Section 5.1 introduces the
measurements for these three dimensions of query behaviors. The effects of search condition and
task type on query behaviors are discussed in Section 5.2. RQ2 including RQ2.1-RQ2.3 are
addressed in this section. Section 5.3 summarizes the findings in this chapter.

5.1

QUERY BEHAVIOR MEASUREMENTS

The data was analyzed in three dimensions: query vocabulary features, query reformulation
patterns and the query performance. The details of measurements in each dimension are
introduced in this section.
89

5.1.1 Query Vocabulary Features

In order to complete a task, users need to formulate or reformulate a set of queries. Because the
exploratory web search tasks in this study require the participants to explore different aspects of
a topic, it is critical to determine whether the participants can employ a goodly number of queries
and query terms. Therefore, I relied on the following set of methods in order to measure the
vocabulary features of queries in a search session:


The number of unique queries (NQ) of a user during the process of completing one task.



The query vocabulary richness (QVR) is the ratio of the number of unique query terms to
the number of queries, and QVR implies the vocabulary richness of a user’s queries.
QVR is defined in Equation 5.1, where Γ(S) denotes the number of elements in the set S.

Eq. (5.1)

Common search strategies employed by team members include submitting different
queries and avoiding viewing duplicate retrieved results (Joho et al., 2008). Therefore, a group
level measurement for examining query features is to look at the query diversity within a team.
The more diverse the queries issued by two participants in a team, the higher the chance that the
team will be more efficient. The following two measurements were proposed to measure the
diversity of queries within a team.


One way is to measure query diversity (QD) using the Levenshtein distance (Shah &
González-Ibáñez, 2011) to calculate the difference between a pair of queries. The average
Levenshtein distance between any pair of queries from two participants is used to
measure the query diversity of the group.

90



Another way is to measure query result similarity (QRS) (Kromer, Snasel, & Platos,
2008), which looks at the overlap in corresponding returned top N documents between
two queries. The calculation is shown in Equation 5.2, where ψ(p1) denotes the
aggregated result set retrieved in response to all the queries issued by one of the users on
a team and ψ(p2) denotes the aggregated result set retrieved in response to all the queries
issued by the other user in the same team. Here, I use the top 10 returned results as the
corresponding results set for each query.

Eq. (5.2)

5.1.2 Query Reformulation

Based on the query log obtained from this study and the classification of query reformulation
types in the literature (Jansen & Pooch, 2000), I defined the four types of query reformulation
patterns as: New, Generalization, Specialization and Reconstruction (Table 5.1). Qi-1 and Qi are
two consecutive queries in the same search session.

Table 5.1. Definition of query reformulation types

Type

Qi is the first query or does not share any common terms with Q i-1

Generalization (Ge)

Qi shares common terms with Qi-1 ; and Qi contains fewer terms than Qi-1

Specialization (Sp)

Qi shares common terms with Qi-1 ; and Qi contains more terms than Qi-1

Reconstruction (Rc) Qi shares common terms with Qi-1 ; and Qi has the same length as Qi-1

5.1.3 Query Performance

Precision and recall introduced in Section 3.3.1 are two performance measurements. User
satisfaction and cognitive load are also two measurements related to users’ perceptions of the
search performance and efforts put into the search. In addition, I propose another measurement
for analyzing the success of each query. The success of a query is measured by whether an item
or several items are saved after the query was issued. This measurement reports the number of
queries with items collected normalized by the number of queries issued, which is termed as a
successful query rate (SQ):

Eq. (5.3)

Table 5.2 summarizes all of the measurements for query behavior used in this study.
Some of the measurements such as query diversity and query results similarity cannot be
computed for single participants. In order to perform a comparison between COL and IND, I
artificially created pairs of participants for IND. All possible pairs of the 18 participants in IND
are generated, which is 153 in total. Therefore, for the single participant measurements, the
sample sizes were COL (36) and IND (18), whereas for the paired participants’ measurements,
the sample sizes were COL (18) and IND (153). Therefore, the analysis unit of some
measurements is a single participant (e.g. NQ, SQ), whereas other measurements use a pair of
participants as the analysis unit (e.g. QD, QRS). Two different prefixes, S (single) and P (pair),
are used to distinguish between these two sets of measurements.

5.2

RESULTS

The analysis results of measurement in three dimensions are reported in this section: query
vocabulary features, query reformulation patterns and query performance.

5.2.1 Query Vocabulary Features

I first present the query features that are measured at a single participant level: number of queries
(NQ) and query vocabulary richness (QVR). I then offer two measurements of query features on
the paired participants’ level: query diversity (QD) and query results similarity (QRS). For the
statistical analysis, I included the following in the model: main effect of condition, main effect of
task, and interaction of condition and task (condition * task).
93

The mean and standard error of number of queries and query vocabulary richness are
shown in Figure 5.1. Significant differences are reported in Table 5.3 and Table 5.4.

5.2.1.1 Number of Queries (NQ)
There is a significant effect of condition (Table 5.3) on the number of queries (Mean diff = -2.71,
SE=1.28, p=.035). Participants in COL issued fewer queries than participants in IND. This might
be caused by the fact that participants in COL had to spend time on collaboration; thus, they had
less time for search.

participants tend to issue more queries for recall-oriented tasks, which is intuitive.

5.2.1.2 Query Vocabulary Richness (QVR)
There is a significant effect of condition (Table 5.4) on query vocabulary richness (Mean diff =

than those in IND.

There is a significant effect of task (Table 5.4) on query vocabulary richness (Mean diff =
.20, SE=.09, p=.035). The query vocabulary richness is higher in T1 than in T2, which might
indicate that a rich vocabulary is not necessary in the travel planning task because the goal was
to find the specific results of most interest to the participants, rather than being recall-oriented as
in T1.
The interaction of condition and task on query vocabulary richness is shown in Figure
5.2. The participants in COL have significantly higher query vocabulary richness in T1 than in
T2; however, the participants in IND have no significant difference in query vocabulary richness

95

between the two tasks. This indicates that recall-oriented tasks may benefit from collaboration
among team participants by more effectively generating rich search vocabularies.

There is a significant effect of condition (Table 5.5) on query diversity (Mean diff = 5.18,
SE=.85, p<.001). Two team members in COL issued more diverse queries than two random
individuals in IND. In other words, participants in COL were able to avoid similar queries being
submitted by members of the same team.
There is a significant effect of task (Table 5.5) on query diversity (Mean diff = 5.11,
SE=.85, p<.001). Query diversity between two participants is higher in T1 than in T2. This might
indicate that the information needs of T1 are expressed more diversely by the participants.

5.2.1.4 Query Results Similarity (QRS)
There is a significant effect of condition (Table 5.6) on query results similarity (Mean diff =.03,
SE=.01, p<.001). Two team members in COL have less similarity than two random individuals
in IND. This shows another benefit of collaboration in search, in that it helps to avoid the same
document being seen by the participants on the same team.

Table 5.7 summarizes all of the findings about basic query features. It seems that
although the participants in COL issued fewer queries, they were able to issue more different
queries than two random individual participants. In COL, the participants were able to divide the
whole search topic into subtopics and each took charge of a set of subtopics. Therefore, their
queries reflect a different focus on the information needs.

5.2.2 Query Reformulation

In order to compare the distribution of different types of query reformulations, query
reformulation type is included as a predictor in the statistic model. I also considered the
interaction of condition and type (condition * type) and the interaction of task and type (task *
type). Significant differences are reported in Table 5.8. There are significant effects of type and
two interaction effects, and the details are discussed in the following section.

As shown in Figure 5.4, New (29.7%) was the most frequently used reformulation type,
followed by Reconstruction (26.0%) and Specialization (24.9%). Generalization (19.4%) was the
least used reformulation type. The percentages of four types of query reformulation are
significantly different. Pairwise comparison of types with the Bonferroni adjustment shows that
the percentage of Generalization is significantly smaller than the other three types (Ge vs N:
Mean diff=-.10, SE=.02, p<.001; Ge vs Sp: Mean diff=-.05, SE=.01, p<.001; Ge vs Rc: Mean
diff=-.11, SE=.03, p<.001). The comparison also shows that the percentage of Specialization is
significantly smaller than New and Reconstruction (Sp vs N: Mean diff=-.05, SE=.02, p=0.05; Sp
vs Rc: Mean diff=-.06, SE=.03, p=0.05).

There is a significant interaction effect of condition *type (Figure 5.5 (a)). The
participants in the COL condition used more New than those in the IND condition (Mean diff=.08, SE=.03, p=0.026). Specialization was also used significantly more often in COL than in IND
(Mean diff=-.07, SE=.02, p=0.009). However, the participants in the IND condition used
Reconstruction significantly more often than those in the COL condition (Mean diff=-.19,
SE=.04, p<0.001).

(b)

Figure 5.5. Effect of condition*type (a) and effect of task*type (b) on query reformulation

There is a significant interaction effect of task*type (Figure 5.5 (b)). The participants
used New significantly more often in the T1 than in T2 (Mean diff=-.08, SE=.03, p=0.026). This
might be due to the fact that many queries in T2 contained any of the two terms “Helsinki” or
“Finland”. Therefore, most query reformulations share common terms.

100

Statistical test results

Table 5.9 summarizes all the significant findings of query reformulation patterns. The
results suggest that the participants in COL tended to use the New and Specialization patterns,
while those in IND were more likely to use Reconstruction. One possible explanation is that in
collaborative search, most teams split the topic into subtopics. Because each team member
focused on only a subset of the subtopics, they were able to explore each subtopic in depth.
However, in the individual search, the participants need to cover all facets of a topic, leading to a
situation that they use the Reconstruction strategies more frequently to explore the topic in depth.

5.2.3 Query Performance

In the previous two sections, I have compared the vocabulary feature and reformulation patterns
of the queries in both collaborative search and individual search. Since the goal of query iteration
in an exploratory search is to satisfy the information need, it’s important to examine the search
performance and users’ perception on their search experience. Here I compared the precision,
recall, satisfaction, cognitive load as well as successful query rate between the collaborative
search and individual search.
The mean and standard error of satisfaction and cognitive load are shown in Figure 5.6.
Significant differences are reported in Table 5.10 and Table 5.11.

101

Figure 5.6. Precision (a) and Recall (b)

The precision in the information-gathering task T1 is significantly lower than that in the
decision-making task T2 (Mean diff =-.21, SE=.03, p<.001). It might because that the
participants were more selective for the information collected for the decision-making task while
in the information-gathering task they are more open to somewhat relevant documents.

The recall in the IND is significantly higher than that in COL (Mean diff =-.011,
SE=.004, p=.005). One possible reason for the low recall in COL is that team members
frequently communicated with each other to share thoughts and findings so they ended up
spending less time on collecting relevant results.

It’s interesting that there is no significant difference on precision and recall in
collaborative search is significantly lower than that in individual search, the participants in
collaborative search are significantly more satisfied with their search performance (Mean diff

I also found that the cognitive load in collaborative search is significantly lower than that
in individual search (Mean diff =.70, SE=.26, p=.007), which indicates that although in
collaborative search conditions, participants had to do extra work to facilitate the collaboration,
the collaboration work seems lower their cognitive load for the whole exploratory search task. In
terms of task difference, the participants’ cognitive load is significantly higher in the
information-gathering task than the decision-making task (Mean diff =.43, SE=.14, p=.002). This
might because that the topic of the information-gathering task is academic while the topic for the
decision-making task is leisure.

The total average successful query rate is 66.0%, which indicates that about two-thirds of
queries issued by the participants were followed by at least one saved item. I examined the effect
of condition, task, query reformulation type and their interactions on successful query rates.
Significant results are shown in Table 5.14.
The average successful query rate is 61.3% in COL and 75.1% in IND, the difference of
which is significant (Mean diff =-.14, SE=.04, p=.001). There is also a significant effect of task
104

on successful query rates (Mean diff =.19, SE=.03, p<.001). T1 has a higher successful query
rate (77.7%) than T2 (58.7%).

The fact that T2 has a lower successful query rate might be due to the difference in
relevance criteria. In T2, user subjective relevance is more important than topic relevance;
therefore, although some items were relevant to the topic, they did not meet the participant’s
personal interest. The participants were less likely to save items in this situation.
The low successful query rate in COL might also be caused by more stringent relevance
criteria. When saving an item, the participant not only needs to consider his/her own judgment
about the relevance, but also consider the needs of their partner. Therefore, the participants in
COL were more cautious when they saved webpages.
I also find a significant interaction of task and type (Figure 5.9). New, Generalization,
and Specialization have significantly higher successful query rates in T1 than in T2, but that is
not the case for Reconstruction. Pairwise comparison with the Bonferroni adjustment shows that
in T2, Reconstruction has a significantly higher successful query rate than that of Generalization
and New (Rc vs Ge: Mean diff=-.18, SE=.06, p=.009; Rc vs N: Mean diff=-.19, SE=.07, p=.007).
This indicates that Reconstruction is a more useful reformulation strategy in T2.

SUMMARY

In this chapter, I report the analysis on examining the effect of collaboration and task type on
users’ query behaviors. The participants worked on two different exploratory web search tasks
using our CollabSearch system under two conditions: the collaborative search and individual
search. I examined the effects of search conditions and task type on users’ query behavior from
three dimensions: query vocabulary features, query reformulation patterns and query
performance.
Through the analysis of the results, I have following major observations. The participants
in the collaborative search issue fewer queries than those in the individual search. One possible
reason is that participants in collaborative search need to spend time not only on search, but also
on collaboration. Therefore, they have allocated less time to search than someone undertaking
individual search. However, the effort on collaboration has benefits. The participants in
collaborative search are able to issue queries with a wider range of vocabulary for recall-oriented
107

tasks. In addition, because they can coordinate on the search, they are able to issue more diverse
queries and avoid overlapping of query results in both tasks. This finding is consistent with Joho
et al. (2008) and Shah & González-Ibáñez (2011). Regarding task differences, the participants
issue more queries, use a richer vocabulary, and expresse their information need in more diverse
ways for recall-oriented tasks, a fact that is intuitive.
For the query reformulation, Generalization was used less frequent than other types of
query reformulation. In exploratory search, users usually start with general queries and then start
exploring the topic in more depth (Jansen et al., 2009). This might be the reason why
Generalization is less frequently used. For the effect of collaboration on query reformulation, I
found that the participants in collaborative search tend to use New and Specialization more often
than those in individual search. I believe that this is because the participants in collaborative
search usually split the topic and each focuses on only part of it. Since the scope of the topic they
worked on became smaller, they were able to explore the topic more deeply. In contrast, the
participants in individual search employ Reconstruction more frequently. This suggests that they
may need to explore multiple facets of the topic at the same level. Another explanation is that
New and Specialization are higher cost reformulation types than Reconstruction. The participants
in collaborative search were able to afford higher cost reformulation. This hypothesis needs
further study to confirm.
By analyzing the query performance, I found that the successful query rate is higher and
precision is significantly lower in the recall-oriented information-gathering task than that in the
utility-based decision-making task. I noted that for the decision-making task, participants’
personal judgment matters more than the topical relevance. Therefore, the participants were more
selective in saving relevant items. Similarly, the lower successful query rate in collaborative

108

search might also be caused by more stringent relevance criteria. The participants in
collaborative search need to consider their partner’s opinion, and they both need to agree on the
relevant items. Although there is no significant difference on precision and the recall is
significantly lower in the collaborative search than that in the individual search, participants felt
more satisfied with their search performance and have less cognitive load in the collaborative
search. This suggests two possible benefits of collaboration – making people happen and less
stressed.

COMMUNICATIONS IN COLLABORATIVE SEARCH PROCESSES

One essential difference between collaborative search and individual search is that the former
involves communications among team members. On the one hand, communication could be
effective in establishing common ground between team members; on the other hand,
communication could also introduce extra workload or distract users from their search activities.
In order to understand the role of communication in collaborative search, I conducted the
analysis of chat messages from two aspects – content and timing of communications. Section 6.1
introduces the content and timing analysis methods of chat messages. The results of content and
timing analysis of chat as well as the relationship between communications and search
performance are discussed in section 6.2. RQ3 including RQ3.1-RQ3.4 are addressed in this
section. Section 6.3 summarizes the findings in this chapter.

6.1

CHAT MESSAGES ANALYSIS METHODS

The chat messages were generated by all the 36 participants in the COL condition. I retrieved all
the messages from the chat log in the CollabSearch system. The basic unit for chat message
analysis is a sentence or part of a compound sentence (Strijbos et al., 2004). In the chat log, each
message was generated as the participant press the “Send” button. Thus, a message may contain
multiple sentences or a single sentence may be distributed in a set of consecutive messages. I
110

manually applied a pre-processing procedure to merge or split chat messages into the analysis
units as defined. After the pre-processing, 36 participants (18 teams) generated 676 cleaned
messages in the information-gathering task (T1) and 1137 cleaned messages in the decisionmaking task (T2).

6.1.1 Content Analysis Method

One way to look into the characteristic of communications is to analyze the content of
communications. A coding schema of text messages was adapted from a framework developed in
a CSCL study (Strijbos et al., 2004). The framework was also used in a collaborative search
study (González-Ibáñez et al., 2013). It includes four main categories – task social (TS), task
coordination (TC), task content (TN) and non-task related (NT). A summary of each category in
the coding schema is depicted in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1. Coding schema for the content analysis of chat messages

Code

Description
All types of statements concern group effort or attitude as well as
opinions in regards to information obtained or information resources

Task coordination (TC)

All types of statements regarding coordination of the search task,
which include division of labor and checking task status

Task content (TN)

All types of statements related to the content of the search task,
which involve task requirement assessment and information sources

Non-task related (NT)

All types of statements that are not related to the search task or
regarding the issues of the user study itself

111

Two coders went through all the chat messages and manually assign a category for each
message. A training process was applied at the beginning to make sure the two coders have a
common understanding of the coding framework. The first round of coding was conducted by
each of the coders independently. The agreement between the two coders is 86.1% for T1 and
83.3% for T2. Then a second round of coding was conducted to resolve the discrepancies
between the two coders. After the two rounds of coding, the two coders made agreement on the
categories of all the chat messages.
A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis methods is adopted. The content of
the communication is coded and then the frequencies are used for statistical comparisons.

6.1.2 Timing Analysis Method

Another angle to examine the characteristics of communications in collaborative search process
is analyzing the timing of communications. All the chat messages are categorized into before
search, during search and after search in terms of the timing. The boundaries among these three
categories are determined based on the first and last search actions of a participant. Issuing a
query, viewing a search result and saving a result are considered as search related actions. Any
communications before the first search action is before search while any communications after
the last search action is after search. The rest of the communications are categorized as during
search.

112

Figure 6.1. Communication timing

The before search communications are not affected by any of the search activities while
the during search communications might be influenced by the search results. The reason to have
an after search category is that unlike the before search and during search, the after search
communications do not have impact on the search activities.
When calculating the time spent on communication, I use the following strategies: first,
both sending and receiving a chat message were labeled as chat, and the rest of the actions in the
log data were labeled as non-chat. Then the time intervals from a chat action to another chat
action or from a chat action to a non-chat action are counted as the communication time. The two
participants in the same team may start of end their search actions at different time. Therefore,
the before search, during search and after search communication times may be different for the
two team members.

RESULTS OF CONTENT ANALYSIS

6.2.1 Characteristics of Communication Content

Using the content analysis method introduced in section 6.1.1, the 676 messages in T1 and 1137
messages in T2 were classified into four categories. I use both the number of messages (Table
6.2) and percentage of messages (Table 6.3) to show the results.

12.34 (15.89)

We can see that the communication patterns are very different in the two tasks. Among
the four types of communication content, the number of task content is significantly higher in T2
than in T1 (Mean diff=-27.94, SE=3.31, p<.001). With regards to the percentage, there are
114

significantly more task coordination messages (Mean diff=.23, SE=.04, p<.001) in the
information-gathering task (T1) while the decision-making task (T2) has more task content
messages (Mean diff=-.33, SE=.04, p<.001). This reveals the nature of the differences of these
two tasks. For the information-gathering task, the criteria of what information is relevant are
objective and participants didn’t have much discussion on the assessments of information
obtained. However in the decision-making task, the relevance criteria are subjective, which
depends on personal opinions of each team member. Therefore, participants were more involved
in the discussion of their information need and search results.
In order to provide a clearer vision on how team members communicate with each other
in the search process, I provide some examples of chat messages in each of the four categories.

6.2.1.1 Task Social
The main purposes of task social messages are initializing the task and providing social support.
Chat messages fell into the task social category include the greetings between team members at
the beginning. And sometimes participants may joke about the topic of the task.
S0301:” well hello there”
S0302:” helsinki!”
S0701: “is yodeling a thing people do in finland?”
S0702: “hahaha”
Another typical type of chat messages for task social is to express attitude or opinions on
the information obtained or shared.
S0302: “this one is way more fun than the other”

115

Participant may also comment about the group functioning and effort. I found that most
of the expressions are positive. It seems that participants are more likely to encourage each other
for the group efforts.
S1601: “everything looks great so far!”

6.2.1.2 Task Coordination
The most common task coordination is the division of labor between team members. The
exploratory search task in this study contains several sub-topics. Participants may want to divide
the whole search into several sub-topics and assign each sub-topic with an owner.
S1802: “okay how would you like to split this up?”
S1801: “you do stats and I"ll do impacts on students and professionals, commerce
around these sites”
Participants may also inform the partner their current status or progress on the sub-topic
they own. Or they may ask for their partners’ status.
S0401: “have you done impact yet?”
S0402: “I think I got impact done”
S0402: “going for econ now”

6.2.1.3 Task Content
Participants communicate with each other on the requirement of the task, especially when there
is particular constraint. For example there are two constrains in the decision-making task, budget
limit to 200 euros and time of travel is during Christmas. These two constrains generated many
discussions between the team members.
S1801: “we each get 100 euros so let’s set aside 25 euros each for dining”
S1601: “The climate is very cold in December”
116

S1602“ok so outdoor activities will be hard”
S0701: “the only one i could find is the nutcracker because the city of Helsinki is
like practically shut down between Dec. 22-25 for Christmas”
There are many communications related to the assessment of information resources and
information obtained. These communications enable team members to share knowledge with
each other.
S0401: “visitfinland isn’t much help”
S0401: “I think I found one site to cover all of the usage stuff”
S0402: “okay, if you see anything about the value of a site(s), pass it off to me”
S1601: “what’s the Christmas Market?”
S1602: “in December they set up tons of markets and stuff in the streets”
It’s also possible that a participant may ask the partner for a question related to the task or
talk about the difficulties encountered in the search. Getting a response from the partner may
help the participant to better understand the context of the task.
S1502: “What is del.icio.us?
S1501: “saves bookmarks. it’s now delicious”
S1401: “all these websites I try to go on are in what I can only assume is Finnish”
S1402: “put "English" in the search?”

6.2.1.4 Non-task Related
Participants sometimes talked about random things that were not related to the search task. These
communications could also be viewed as social interactions. But they are different from the task
social because the content of the communication has nothing to do with the search topic.
S1001: “Can we eat after this?”

117

Another typical type of non-task related communications are about the user study itself
and the system being used in the study.
S1401: “I wish there was a notification every time we saved a page”
In a few cases, the team members may also discuss about the time constrains of the study.
I consider these communications as non-task related because the 30 minutes time limitation was
not a naturalized constrain. It’s a requirement specially designed for this particular lab-based user
study.

6.2.2 Coordination Strategies

Division of labor was recognized by many previous collaborative search studies as an import
collaborative search strategy (Foley & Smeaton, 2009; Halvey et al., 2010; M. R. Morris &
Horvitz, 2007). Researchers also reported that the simplest form of coordinating divided labor is
through communication (Kelly, Kingdom, & Payne, 2013). Through the analysis of task
coordination chat messages, I recognized four different ways of coordinating search among the
18 teams in the study. Table 6.4 shows the names of the teams that take each coordination
strategy for the two tasks respectively.
The first coordination strategy is pre-defined division of topics. Teams using this strategy
made a complete and detailed division of labor topic wise before the search. Team members split
the search topic into sub-topics and each team member take part of it. Using this strategy, they
can avoid redundant work. Sometimes they may find it hard to divide the subtopics; they would
propose some strategies like using search history to coordinate. (“The first one is pretty large maybe both do it and keep an eye on the search history?” – S0301). The second strategy of
coordination is evolving division of topics. The difference of this coordination strategy from the
118

first one is that the team members didn’t well-planned everything before the search. They usually
quickly start the search and inform each other what subtopic they pick to start with. As the search
going on, they would further coordinate the on the topic depending on the progress. The benefit
of this strategy is that they can quickly start working on the search without spend too much time
on the planning. However, team members need to monitor each other’s progress to coordinate in
the middle of their search process.

Previous research (Pickens et al., 2008) recognized different roles of prospector and
miner in collaborative search. In my study, I only find one team using this coordination strategy
of division of roles. In team 08, one of the participants took the role of prospector and in charge
of exploring the information. The other participant in the same team worked as a miner to
examine the information found by the prospector in detail. The minor keep updating the
prospector what had been found and what were still missing. There are also teams which do not
divide the labor explicitly through communication. Teams taken this strategy may need to
monitor each other’s progress through other means like checking the shared workspace to avoid
repeated work.

119

Through the comparison of coordination strategies in the two tasks, I found that most
teams stick to the same coordination in both tasks. Therefore, the coordination strategy is a
reflection of the team’s collaboration style, which is not very likely to be affected by the task.

6.2.3 Correlation between Communication Content and Search Outcomes

From the results in Table 6.2 and Table 6.3, we can see that the variance for each type of
communication is large. It indicates that the content of communication is very different across
different teams. In order to better understand the benefit and cost of communication in the
collaborative search process, I conduct the analysis of correlation between communication
content and the search outcomes.

Table 6.5 shows the correlations between time spent on each type of communication
content and the five indicators of search outcomes. ↑ means the communication time is positively
related to the performance and user perception while ↓ represents a negative relationship.
The previous section showed that the recall in collaborative search is significantly lower
than that in individual search. One of the reasons might be the communications take time and

120

thus the participants had less time devoted to the search. The results in Table 6.5 evidence that
the longer a participant spent time on task coordination, task content and non-task related
communications, the lower the recall is.

In addition, the time spent on task content

communication is positively correlated to the cognitive load. It requires additional effort from the
participants discuss the matters of task content through explicit communication.
An interesting finding is on the task social communications. Unlike other types of
communication, the time spent on task social is positively correlated with the recall and
satisfaction and negatively correlated with cognitive load. For teams with more communications
on task social, it’s more likely that they perform better, and the team members were more likely
to be satisfied with the results and feel less stressed. This might because that the task social
communications promoted the social ties between team members and their engagement to the
search task.

6.3

RESULTS OF TIMING ANALYSIS

The previous section introduced what the characteristics of communication in terms of content,
which reveals what the team members communicated with each other during the collaborative
search process. In this section, I focus on investigating when they communicate.

6.3.1 Communication Timing Patterns

As shown in Table 6.6, the participants communicated more in the decision-making task (T2)
than in the information-gathering task (T1) (Mean diff=-253.61, SE=58.62, p<.001). Particularly,
121

there are more communications in the during search (Mean diff=-172.94, SE=56.04, p=.002) and
the after search (Mean diff=-101.75, SE=47.06, p=.031) stages in the decision-making task than
in the information-gathering task. This may indicate that the participants generated more
discussions based on the information found in the search process for the decision-making task.
However, the information-gathering task has significantly more communications in the before
search stage than the decision-making task (Mean diff=21.08, SE=8.63, p=.015). According to
Evans and Chi (2008), the before search stage involves context framing and understanding the
details of the task. The topic of T1 is academic while the topic of T2 is leisure. The requirement
in an academic search topic might require the participants spending longer time to communicate
in order to understand the details.

In order to understand what the participants communicated in each stage, I analyzed the
percentage of each communication content type within each stage. Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 plot
the distribution of communication content for the before, during and after search stage in T1 and
T2 respectively.

122

We can see that the majority of communications in the before search stage are task
coordination. This is more obvious in T1, for which 59.2% of the before search communications
are task coordination. The percentage of task coordination in the before search stage of T2 is
43.0%, which is lower than T1 but still dominate the before search communications.
The percentage of coordination is lower in the during search stage (32%.7 in T1 and
13.0% in T2). Instead, the majority type of communication is task content in the during search
stage (35.6% in T1 and 66.2% in T2). This represents that as participants started the search
exploration, they communicated with each other about the information obtained and information
resources.

Figure 6.2. Proportion of each communication content type within stage (T1)

123

Figure 6.3. Proportion of each communication content type within stage (T2)

The percentage of task content is the highest (60.4%) among the four types of
communications in the after search stage of T2. The participants may communicate with each
other to come out with a decision – the travel plan after they finished the search. In the
information gathering task, the percentage of task social is relatively higher than the other types
of communication in the after search stage. This might because that participants commented on
the group effort or express their opinions on the information obtained in the after search stage.
Another interesting finding is that task social is relatively higher in the before and after
search stage while task content is relatively higher in the during search stage. While the
participants were performing search, their communication were more focused on achieving the
goal of the task. The fact that the percentage of task coordination is the highest in the before
search stage and the lowest in the after search stage indicate that coordination through
communication is more important in the beginning of the collaborative search process. The nontask related communication is more likely to happen in the after search stage. This is intuitive as
the participants may talk about irrelevant stuff after they finished the task.
124

6.3.2 Team Differences on Communication Timing

The large variance of communication time in each stage shown in Table 6.6 suggests the
communication patterns are very different across teams. When analyzing the chat logs, I also
noticed that some teams communicated a lot in the after search stages while some other teams
didn’t communicate at all in the after search stage, especially for T1. The participants were
given instructions to collect information that could be used for writing a high quality report, but
they didn’t need to actually write the report. In the after search stage, some team still discussed
about issues around crafting the report while some other teams talked about random things that
were not related to the task.
Here I am more interested in the before search and during search communications as
these communications have potential impact on the search activates. Through the analysis of
communication time in before search and during search, I identified four different
communication patters. Depending on whether the before search communication time for a
particular team is larger or smaller than the average before search communication time, the team
can be classified as more planning or less planning. Depending on whether the during search
communication time for a particular team is larger or smaller than the average during search
communication time, the team can be classified as more dependent or less dependent. The
combination of the two dimensions generates four different patterns (shown in Table 6.7).
Team members having the more planning and more dependent pattern are more engaged
to each other through communications in both before search and during search stages. It
represents a pattern of continuous communication. Team members using the more planning and
less dependent communication style focused more on the planning of the search but later became
more independent from each other during the search. In contrast, team members taking the less
125

planning and more dependent communication style teams may spend less time on planning the
search but they are more engaged with each other through communications during the search.
The last communication pattern less planning and less dependent is featured by less than average
communication in both before and during search stages. The team members who took this
communication style may work more independently on the search tasks throughout the whole
process.

Table 6.7. Patterns of communication timing

T1 (team names)
More planning + More dependent 03, 05, 14
More planning + Less dependent 04, 17, 18

06, 07, 09, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22

08, 09, 16, 19, 20, 22

An interesting finding is that most of the teams have different communication styles in
the two tasks. This may suggest that the timing of communication is greatly influenced by the
task.

6.3.3 Correlation between Communication Timing and Search Outcomes

The communication in different stages play different roles in the collaboration process and they
may have different impact on the teams’ search outcomes. Therefore, I conducted an analysis of
the correlations between communication timing and search outcomes.

126

The results in Table 6.8 suggest that longer the total communication time, the lower the
recall is. However, the communication indeed brings some benefit as we can see that the total
communication time has a positive correlation with the vocabulary richness (QVR). The
communications may promote participants to employ wider range of vocabularies for the search.
The results also suggest that the before search and after search have a negative correlation with
the recall. When the team members spent more time on planning the search through
communication, they were also at the risk of shortening their time on the search and thus have a
lower recall. This explanation also applies to the relationship between the after search
communication and the recall.

6.4

SUMMARY

In this chapter, I report the analysis on communications in the collaborative exploratory search
process from two aspects: the content of communication and the timing of communication. I
applied a content analysis method to manually classify all the chat messages into four categories:
task social, task coordination, task content and non-task related. In terms of timing, all the chat
messages were categorized as before search, during search and after search stage
127

communications. First, communication is an essential component in the collaborative search
process. Team members may communicate with each other in any of three stages. Second, the
communication content varies in the three stages. The before search stage communication is
more focused on the task coordination. In the during search stage, team members are more
involved in the task content communication. Task social communication is more common in the
before search and after search stage than in the during search stage.
The communication patterns in the information-gathering task are very different from the
decision-making task. There is more task coordination in the information-gathering task while
there is more task content in the decision-making task. This reflects the different nature of the
two tasks. For the information-gathering task, the criteria of what information is relevant are
objective and participants didn’t have much discussion on the assessments of information
obtained. However in the decision-making task, the relevance criteria are subjective, which
depend on personal opinions of each team member. Therefore, participants were more involved
in the discussion of their information need and search results. The communication timing
patterns are also very different in the two tasks. The before search communication is longer in
the information-gathering task while the during search and after search communications are
longer in the decision-making task. The participants may need longer time to plan the search
through communication for the information-gathering task. In the decision-making task, more
discussions were generated based on the search results.
Through the analysis of task coordination, I identified four different coordination
strategies. Some teams did a complete division of search topics before search while some other
teams only did an incomplete division of topics at the beginning and they did follow-up
coordination through the search process. There are teams which didn’t divide the labor through

128

explicit communications. I only found one team using the coordination strategy of taking
different roles in the search – one act as the prospector while the other one act as the minor.
Through the analysis of before and during search communications, I also identified four
different communication styles: continuous communication in both before search and during
search stages, more engaged in the planning before search, more engaged in the communication
during search, and relatively independent in both before search and during search stages.
The analysis on the correlation between communication patterns and search outcomes
reveals the benefit and cost of communications. The results suggested that communication can
promote participants to explore a wider range of vocabularies for the queries. However, the
communication also takes time and additional effort from the participants, thereby decreasing the
recall and increase the cognitive load. An interesting finding is that task social communication
actually has a positive correlation with the recall and satisfaction, suggesting that the social
interaction may engage participants to the search task. However, there is indeed cost for other
types of communications. Task coordination, task content and non-task related communications
have negative relationships with the recall, and task content also has a positive correlation with
the cognitive load. Therefore, there are both benefits and cost of communications in the
collaborative search processes.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

The previous three chapters (Chapter 4-6) present the results analysis in response to each of the
three research questions raised in the introduction (Chapter 1) respectively. In this chapter, I
discuss and conclude all the findings and implications of the entire study. Section 7.1 provides a
comprehensive discussion of the results from previous three chapters. Then in Section 7.2 I
discuss the contributions and implications that can be drawn from the findings of this study.
Limitations of this study are discussed in Section 7.3. Finally, Section 7.4 presents the
conclusions and future work.

7.1

DISCUSSIONS OF RESULTS

7.1.1 Application of HMM for Analyzing Search States

When users seeking for information, they often apply a series of search tactics (Bates, 1979).
These tactics then guide the users to take certain search actions. However, it is not
straightforward to infer users’ search tactics by only observing users’ actions, particularly in
collaborative searches where users’ tactics may be affected not only by their own searches but
also by that of their team members. Because of this, I think that it is desirable to model tactics as

130

hidden states in analyzing the collaborative search process. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
is the method that can satisfy this need.
The application of HMM for analyzing search states has proven to be successful in this
study. I demonstrated its validity based on the finding that the HMM outputs on hidden states
are consistent with several existing well-known information seeking models. More importantly,
HMM can provide more detailed and richer information than existing models on the search states
involved in exploratory search processes. The search states expressed as hidden variables in the
HMM model are represented by emission probabilities to different user actions. Thus the
relationship between the search states and user actions can be clearly interpreted by the model.
The HMM method also provides transition probabilities between any two search states, which
can be used to identify various patterns in the search process.
In summary, there are several benefits of using HMM: 1) search processes are temporal
sequential behaviors and HMM is a well-established method for temporal pattern recognition; 2)
HMM assumes a Markov process with unobserved/hidden states, the unobserved search tactics
in search process can be modeled as hidden variables. The Markov process with hidden states in
HMM overcomes the disadvantage in Markov-chain which assumes a Markov process with the
observable actions, i.e. the next action depends only on the current action and not on the
sequence of actions that preceded it; 3) HMM can model both the observed action and the latent
states, therefore it uncover the relationships between users’ actions and search tactics. In the
Markov chain method, the meaning of an observable action is the same no matter where it occurs
in the sequence. However, users may take the same action for different purposes. In HMM, the
same action can be generated by different hidden states and a hidden state can also generate
several different actions. While the hidden states that are dominated by a single action can also

131

be found using Markov-chain method, the hidden states that are represented by multiple actions
cannot be discovered without using HMM; 4) HMM is an automatic method that can be applied
to a large dataset and thus avoid the labor of manually coding. Although the manually labelling
method can also recognize hidden search tactics in a search process, such method is timeconsuming. A possible future work is to use manually labeled data as training dataset for a
supervised HMM method.

7.1.2 Comparison of Search States Patterns

Based on the HMM output, I discovered two different categories of hidden states that exist in
both individual search and collaborative search, which I summarized as the search related hidden
states and the sense-making related hidden states. Within the search related hidden states, users’
interactions are focused directly on search activities, such as specifying a query, viewing a result
or saving a result, whereas the sense-making related hidden states tend to support the search in
terms of evaluating and defining search problems, or making sense of the information through
communications.
The search related hidden states are similar in the individual search and collaborative
search. However, the sense-making related hidden states are quite different. Individual searches
only have one type of sense-making related hidden state, but there are three different types in
collaborative search. In addition, sense-making related hidden states have occurred significantly
more in the collaborative search than in the individual search. Between the two tasks in
collaborative search, the percentage of sense-making is significantly higher in the decisionmaking task than that in the information gathering task. These findings suggest that the demand

132

of sense-making is higher in the collaborative search and especially in the decision-making task.
Moreover, people are utilizing multiple approaches for sense-making in the collaborative search.
The comparison also showed that cross-category transitions, i.e. the transitions between
search related states and sense-making related states are different. There are more cross-category
transitions in the collaborative search than in the individual search. In particular, the crosscategory transitions occurred more often in the decision-making task. These findings indicate
that the search and sense-making are more tightly connected with each other in the collaborative
search.
The cross-category transitions in the collaborative search also have impacts on the search
outcomes. The transition from the sense-making to search has a positive correlation with the
search outcomes while the transition from search to sense-making has a negative correlation with
search outcomes. This may imply that the timing of sense-making in the collaborative search
process matters for the search outcomes.
The analysis of hidden states through HMM provides us a holistic picture of the
collaborative search processes. The findings suggest that there are great differences between the
individual search and the collaborative search. Task type also plays an important role for the
differences in the search process. The results highlight the importance of sense-making in the
collaborative search, leading to the investigation on communications, which is one of the most
important methods of sense-making in collaborative search. Moreover, the impact of sensemaking to search is likely to be reflected on query behaviors due to high transition probabilities
from sense-making to query hidden states. Therefore, I’ve selected query behaviors and
communications as two important aspects for further investigations on the collaborative search
processes.

133

7.1.3 Effects of the Collaboration

The comparison between the individual search and the collaborative search suggests possible
benefits and costs of the collaboration in information search. The study on the unique component
in the collaborative search, which is the communication, provides us a deeper understanding of
the factors that accounts for the benefits and costs.
One important benefit of collaboration in information search is that it makes people
happy and less stressed. Although the recall is significantly lower in the collaborative search, the
user satisfaction on the search performance is significantly higher and the participants’ cognitive
loads are significantly lower in the collaborative search. The analysis on the relationships
between communication content and the search outcomes showed the time spent on task social
communication has a positive correlation with the search outcomes, a fact that provide a possible
explanation to the benefit of collaboration. Researchers in small group research also found that
social interactions can make the teamwork more effective (Harrison, 2006). Another possible
explanation is that people have higher confidence in the quality of their search outcomes in the
collaborative search (Morris, 2008).
The low recall in the collaborative search also implies a potential cost of the collaboration
– it takes time and effort. A piece of evidence from the HMM results is that the percentage of
search related hidden states is significantly lower in collaborative search than that in individual
search. The participants in the individual search only need to concentrate on the search activities
while the participants in the collaborative search need to allocate part of their time and effort on
the collaboration. As a consequence, the participants in the collaborative search end up with the
lower recall given the same amount time. The analysis on the relationships between
communication content and the search outcomes confirms this finding – the time spent on task
134

coordination, task content and non-task related communications have negative correlations with
the search outcomes. However, the low recall doesn’t imply that collaboration has no value to
the search outcome. The measurements used in this study might not capture all the aspects of
search outcome quality. Other measurements such as passage-level evaluation of the search
outcome can demonstrate the benefit of collaboration. The 30 minutes time limit for each search
task is another factor. The benefits of collaboration on search outcome might be reflected in a
much longer search session since the individuals may run out of ideas for exploration while team
users can keep on generating new ideas for the explorative search. In addition, if the task
involves more brain storming, complex problem-solving and requires domain expertise,
collaboration might be more effective.
The above benefit and cost of collaboration reveals that the social-oriented
communications are beneficial to the search outcomes of collaborative search whereas the taskoriented communications may have placed extra burden on the users. The previous research
recognized two types of communication styles: 1) the task-oriented communication which
focuses on fulfilling the responsibilities; and 2) the social-oriented communication which focuses
on satisfying the emotional needs of interpersonal relationships (Bass, 1990). In my study, it is
possible that the social-oriented communications contribute to the search outcome by increasing
the user engagement to the search task. My study does not imply that the task-oriented
communications are not important in the collaborative search. However, it seems that
communications through chat messages may not be the best way to attain collaboration on
fulfilling task responsibilities in the collaborative search. This might be an opportunity for
collaborative search systems to step in and facilitate the collaboration.

135

Another benefit of collaboration is that the participants in the collaborative search were
able to employ wider range of vocabularies for the queries and the queries between team
members were more diverse than two artificially combined individuals. This finding is consistent
with previous studies on the collaborative search (Joho et al., 2008; Shah & González-Ibáñez,
2011). Previous research (Furnas, Landauer, Gomez, & Dumais, 1987) highlight that human-tohuman communication may serve as cognitive aids during search which can help users to
transform concepts into query keywords. Through an analysis on the relationship between the
communications and the query behaviors, I indeed found a positive correlation between the total
chat time and the query vocabulary richness. However, breaking down chats into three stages
didn’t provide more insight on which parts of communications contributing to the rich
vocabulary.
Collaboration also affects the patterns of query reformulations, the benefit or cost of
which is unclear. The participants in the collaborative search often split the search takes into
subtopics and each person takes charge of parts of the subtopics, resulting in a higher percentage
of New and Specialization query reformulation patterns. In contrast, there is higher percentage of
Reconstruction query reformulation pattern in the individual search. In the collaborative search,
the participants were able to explore the spited subtopics in depth while the participant in the
individual search owns the entire search topic and the coverage maybe the first priority. A study
on social search (Evans et al., 2010) reported that the searching in large databases contributes to
the scope of the search while a social interaction contributes to the depth of the search. My study
suggests similar findings - the information exploration in the collaborative search focuses on
depth while the exploration in the individual search focuses on scope. The effects of the different
information exploration styles were not captured by the search outcome measurements used in

136

this study. Further studies are needed to gain insights on the influences of query reformulation
patterns to the search outcomes.

7.1.4 Effects of the Task Type

My study demonstrated that task type can greatly affect users’ search processes and search
outcomes. I chose two representative exploratory search tasks to use this study: the informationgathering task and decision-making task. I found that the participants indeed exhibit very
different behaviors during the search process and achieved different search outcomes for the two
tasks.
During the search process, the participants showed more sense-making activities in the
decision-making task than that in the information-gathering task, and their search activities are
more tightly coupled to the sense-making activities in the decision-making task. This suggests
that the decision-making task requires the team members to be more engaged with each other
during the search process. Particularly, the participants need to consider the utility problem in the
decision-making task, i.e. the constraints on price for the travel planning, which may require
communications between team members on the negotiation and achievement for agreements.
With regards to the search outcomes, the participants achieved a significantly higher
precision in the decision-making task while their query successful rate is significantly higher in
the information-gathering task. The HMM outputs are consistent with the query successful rate
finding, which showed that the transition from HV to HS is significantly lower in the decisionmaking task than in the information gathering task. This reflects an important impact of the task
type. Participants are more selective on what information to save in the decision-making task,
resulting in a low query successful rate and high precision. For the information-gathering task,
137

the relevance criteria are objective while that in the decision-making task are more subjective.
The team members may need to make agreement on the relevance of the information obtained in
the decision-making task. This can be supported by the fact that the transition from HV to HC is
much higher in the decision-making task. I also found that the participants’ cognitive loads are
significantly higher in the information-gathering task than that in the decision-making task. This
may be caused by two reasons: 1) the topic of the information-gathering task is academic while
the topic for the decision-making task is leisure and the participants may feel more stressed for
the academic topic; 2) the participants may feel more overhead cognitive loads for the
information-gathering task because it’s recall-oriented.

IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

7.2.1 For Researchers in Collaborative Search

Researchers who are interested in the collaborative search should be able to draw research
questions from the findings in my study for their own work in the collaborative search. The
methodologies including data analysis methods and measurements can also be applied to other
studies in the collaborative search.
First, researchers can study the relationship between search activates and sense-making
activities in the collaborative search. My results highlight different types of sense-making states
and how each of them is connected to the different search states. This provides researchers a
method on investigating the interactive influences of search and sense-making in the
collaborative search process. For example, my analysis of search state transition indicates that
138

the probability of transition from viewing or saving a Webpage to chat is higher in the decisionmaking task than that in the information-gathering task. Researchers can examine the reason that
viewing and saving activities trigger communication and whether the content of the web pages
plays a role for eliciting the communication.
Second, researchers can study the implicit communications involved in the collaborative
search process. Although my analysis in this study mainly focuses on the explicit
communications, the search state analysis through HMM implies the important role of implicit
communications (e.g., the activity of checking the shared team workspace) in collaborative
search process. Researchers may look into the different roles of explicit and implicit
communications in the collaborative search. In addition, researchers studying asynchronous
collaborative search can benefit from the results on implicit communications and how they are
connected to the search activities. My study provides the patterns of implicit communications in
the synchronous collaborative search. Other researchers can conduct a comparison study to
examine the differences of implicit communication in the synchronous and asynchronous
collaborative search.
Third, an important taken-away message from this study is that the studies of
collaborative search should not just concentrate on the effectiveness of search, but also on the
users’ perception of their search experiences, particularly their satisfaction and cognitive load.
My results suggest that the search performance measured by precision and recall are not
consistent with users’ perception of the search performance and their search experiences.
Therefore, if I only look at the traditional search effectiveness measures such as precision and
recall, I may not be able to find any benefit of the collaboration. Furthermore, researchers should

139

explore other measurements that can be used to examine the social benefits introduced by
collaboration to the information searching.
Fourth, the results of this study also suggest that the wider vocabulary in collaborative
search did not necessarily lead to a more effective search outcome. Researchers have similar
findings in evaluating different query expansion techniques (Harman, 1992). The findings in that
study indicate that although different query expansion algorithms were able to suggest different
sets of query terms, these terms lead to similar set of documents in the results. Linking this to my
study, the wider range of vocabulary used for queries in collaborative search may not necessarily
lead to very different search results. We know that human-to-human communications can aid the
users to specify their information needs into query keywords. How to best utilize this potential
benefit and transform it to more effective search outcomes is a question that well-worth
investigation for the collaborative search community. Furthermore, researchers may also take
into account of the query reformulation patterns in collaborative search and find out the
connections between query reformulation and search outcomes.
Finally, my findings suggest that researchers may study how the factors related to team
members could affect the collaborative search process. I found that the communication styles and
collaboration strategies are quite different across all the teams in my study. Factors such as
personality composition in a team, collaboration skills of team members, relationships between
team members all could have impact on their collaborations in the search task. These are
interesting research questions for the collaborative search community.

140

7.2.2 For Designers of Collaborative Search system

The findings of this study have several implications for how to design collaborative search
systems to better support team users. There are two different ways of implementing support for
collaboration in the search system: the interface-mediated and the algorithm-mediated
(Golovchinsky et al., 2011b). This study provides implications for the collaborative search
system design in both ways.
First, it’s important to design interface-mediated support for the coordination among team
members as the coordination through communication is costly. Team members in the
collaborative search often need to make a division of labor on topics, the system should be able
to provide support for them to divide the topics in the search task and take ownerships of subtopics. Also, the team members need to be aware of the progress on the sub-topics so that they
can make adjustments to the coordination as the search is going on. The system should provide
support for such awareness and the mechanism for adjustment. It may be helpful for the system
to visualize the information space that has been explored by the team members so that they can
evaluate the status of the search task.
Second, the system should have a good mechanism for organizing saved items, which can
help the team members to make assessment on the information obtained. In the information
gathering task, team members need to decide which parts of the search topic have been explored
thoroughly and which parts still need further exploration based on the information obtained. In
the decision-making task, team members usually need to pay attention to the constrains in the
search tasks. It’s very important for the system to highlight constrains. For example, the price is
a constrain in the travel-planning task. The system should allow users to specify their

141

requirement on the price, organizing their saved items using the price and make the price on the
each saved item easily noticeable to all the team members to facilitate the decision-making.
Third, the collaborative search system can provide targeted algorithm-mediated query
suggestions based on my findings of how users reformulate queries in the collaborative search.
The low successful query rate in the collaborative search indicates a need for query assistance.
Team members in the collaborative search tend to use New and Specialization more often
because they coordinate the search on subtopics. Adaptive query suggestions can be generated
based on the coordination strategies of the team members. It is also worth investigating whether
providing query suggestions in collaborative search can help to increase the successful query
reformulation rate. In addition, providing support for search history awareness along with query
suggestions might help team users to select from the suggested queries. In this case, users are
able to evaluate the current search status based on the search history and then make a decision on
the direction of the following search.
Fourth, another way of algorithm-mediated collaboration support is to automatically
filtering and re-ranking the search results based on the information shared among team members.
For example, the system could provide different search results for users in the same team based
on their different roles in the search (Pickens et al., 2008). My study suggests that the role-based
collaboration is not commonly used among the participants in this user study. However, future
work can look into other user groups or other search tasks to see how the role-based
collaboration is employed by team users. Furthermore, teams with more than two team members
may be very different from teams with only two team members. It is possible that team members
are more likely to take different roles in a team with three or more members.

142

Finally, an important lesson learned from this study is that designers need to make a
balance between the support for fulfilling the search task and the support for social interactions
among team members. Many efforts have been dedicated to increase the search effectiveness and
efficiency of collaboration through intelligent and automatic mediation of the collaborative
search system (Diriye & Golovchinsky, 2012; Morris & Horvitz, 2007). However, my study
suggests that the key for success in collaborative search might be the interpersonal social
interactions among the team members, which provide social support and increase team members’
engagement to the search. Therefore, the collaborative search system should not take over all the
collaboration mediation which results in removing the personal interactions among team
members. Instead, the collaborative search system should design for opportunities supporting
team members to provide social support for each other.

7.2.3 For Researchers in other Fields

Researchers from other fields can also benefit from the methodologies and findings from this
study.
Researchers who need to analyze user log data may find the HMM method useful. I
demonstrated that HMM is a valid method for model users’ intent or hidden search tactics
without input from a theoretical model or manual label. Collaborative search is one scenario for
applying HMM because collaborative search tactics have not been well-defined in literature.
Researchers can also apply HMM to other scenarios of log analysis. I recommend researchers to
try HMM in their studies if they are analyzing complex interactive process in a time sequence,
particularly when there is not a theoretical model for them to generate a pre-define data analysis
framework. The researchers may also try HMM if they want to get a quick examination of the
143

patterns in their data before applying time-consuming qualitative annotation. HMM method can
be extremely useful if the researchers are interested in the hidden strategies or tactics underneath
the observable user interactions. The important procedures I identified for applying HMM are
also benefit to other researchers. Categorizing user actions and conducting model selection are
two important components in HMM. My approach of categorizing user interactions using three
dimensions: method, object and source can be applied to other studies. Future applications of
HMM can follow the rules and methods I provided.
The findings from this study are based on the collaboration in exploratory search tasks.
However, the findings can also be generalized to collaboration tasks in other settings.
Researchers in CSCW and CSCL can get some insights from this work for their own studies. For
example, sense-making may be a common activity that exists in many collaborative works.
Researchers should consider how the sense-making activities are intertwined with the activities
that directly aim for fulfilling the task requirements. Another insight is that when evaluating the
team effectiveness, it is important to not only measure the objective outcomes, but also consider
the social gain and emotional support. The different task types studied in this dissertation:
information-gathering and decision-making may also exist in other types of collaboration work.
Researchers can learn from the findings of the differences between these two types of
collaborative tasks.

7.3

LIMITATIONS

There are several limitations of this study. First, the search topics used in this study were predefined and assigned to the participants. It may be different for the participants to bring their
144

own information needs from their daily life. Second, this study only considered a team with two
team members, and both of the team members were experienced searchers. The dynamics among
the team members is likely to change for different sizes and different roles of team members.
Third, the sample size in this study is relatively small and the participants were limited to the
population of students. Fourth, the measurements for search effectiveness in this study on were at
document level whereas a passage level relevance may be a more true reflection of users’ efforts
on the information exploration. Finally, my study only employed two exploratory search tasks,
one for each type (information-gathering and decision-making). In my study, the topic for the
information-gathering task is literature research while the topic for the decision-making task is
travel planning. It’s unknown whether changing the topics of the search task still give us the
same findings.

7.4

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Given the complex nature of the information needs, exploratory searches may require the
collaboration among multiple people who share the same search goal. Therefore there are
demands for collaborative search systems that could support this new format of search (Morris,
2013). Despite the recognized importance of understanding search process for designing
successful search system (Bates, 1990; M. Hearst, 2009), it is particularly difficult to study
collaborative search process because of the complex interactions involved. In this dissertation, I
propose and demonstrate a framework of investigating search processes in collaborative
exploratory search. I designed a laboratory-based user study to collect the data, compared two
search conditions: individual search and collaborative search as well as two task types through
145

the study. I first applied a novel Hidden Markov Model approach to analyze the search states in
the collaborative search process, the results of which provide a holistic picture of the
collaborative search process. I then investigated two important components in the search process
– query behaviors and communications. The findings suggest that there are differences between
individual search and collaborative search, and reveal the characteristics of communications in
the collaborative search. The results of this study not only provide implications for designing
effective collaborative search systems, but also show valuable research directions and
methodologies for other researchers.
I plan to conduct future studies in the following two directions. The first one is to study
the supports for collaborative search process, which include implementing and evaluating
interface-mediated or algorithm-mediated supports for collaborative search. For example, I want
to investigate whether or not providing the awareness of search history along with query
suggestion can increase the effectiveness of query suggestion. I also want to examine how
personalized search can be achieved by extracting information from what are shared by the team
members.
The second direction of the future work is to study the factors that affect the collaboration
styles within teams; particularly I am interested in the factors such as the collaboration skills of
team members, personality composition of the team and relationships among team members.
Future studies are needed to fully understand the effects of such factors on the collaborative
search processes and outcomes.
In conclusion, I conducted a comprehensive investigation on the collaborative search
processes and discovered differences between the individual search and the collaborative search.
The study of the collaborative search is a joint effort of multiple communities, including

146

information retrieval (IR), computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer
interaction (HCI). I hope that my study provides some contributions to a more holistic
understanding of collaborative search.
