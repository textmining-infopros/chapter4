ABSTRACT
In the last five years, Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) store has flourished,
allowing entrepreneurs and authors to upload their works for sale to Amazon’s worldwide
audience. The self-published works that dominate the KDP store are fiction, but local
histories and memoirs have also found their way to Amazon. Many of these books are
non-traditional histories; they are amateur works on community and family stories,
memoirs, and life writing. This new and egalitarian historical production has considerable
implications for public historians, librarians, and archivists. How it will impact or change
the creation of the historical record and influence the field of history remains to be seen.
This research project and its accompanying dissertation will situate some of these
histories in their greater historiographical field by conducting a close reading of each, and
it will utilize microhistorical methodology and standpoint theory to analyze their
significance. While there have been some initial quantitative analyses of self-publishing
(Dilevko and Dali, 2006; Bradley et al, 2011), no studies have conducted close readings
of these texts or explored their content and subject matter in an in-depth way. This study
will ultimately argue that many of these self-published works have a place in the public
sphere as useful pieces of intimate, personal, and sometimes firsthand knowledge of past
events, and that they should be studied as important and new styles of historical
production. As records of a uniquely 21st century outlook, they offer future generations
insight into American experiences from ordinary people who were previously unable to
publish their thoughts, stories, and ideas without considerable financial cost to
themselves, and who have now taken advantage of new technological products and
publication formats to share the histories they deemed important enough to write. Further,
these new technologies and KDP have facilitated a kind of “People’s” expression that has
and will continue to change the History of the Book.

12
CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION
Traditional Publishing and Self-Publishing at the Beginning of the 21st Century
Publishing has been irrevocably altered by the advent of online communication
and the Internet. It has brought about the rise of ebooks, and the very notion of what a
book is has been changed forever (Kaufman, 2009). Since the widespread adoption of
personal computers, self-publishing has grown exponentially in popularity. This change
has been widely noted by industry insiders and observers: Publishers Weekly now
reviews self-published titles, Salon has led the mainstream discussion of the “content
deluge,” and Library Journal’s subdivision “The Digital Shift” offers regular commentary
on the changes brought about by mainstream ebooks and self-published ebooks in
libraries (Miller, 2011).
These changes represent a marked change in the publishing industry compared to
the rest of the 20th century; in their December 2010 Publishers Weekly article, Milliot and
Coffey said, “Writing, printing, and disseminating your own work has a varied past… It
endured a long period of indignity, branded as ‘vanity publishing’ –that is, selfpublishing as a last resort for works not viable in the marketplace” (para. 1). Selfpublished works, in the past, were considered inadequate for traditional mainstream
publication; for whatever reason, they were regarded as subordinate in terms of writing,
storyline, or through any other traditional indicators of quality (Laquintano, 2013).
Further, vanity presses were often derided by librarians and viewed with suspicion;
Henderson (1984) has said that the “vanity press is deservedly held in disrepute [because]
it publishes anything for which an author will pay, usually at a loss for the author and a
nice profit for the publisher.”

13
For better or worse, book production has been democratized in a profound way in
the last 10 years, and the stigma attached to the self-published text has been lessened in
some avenues and removed completely in others. The presence of a new generation of
writers on the Internet, with the ability to instantly publish their writings and thoughts
online through blogs, livejournals, or update posts on Facebook and Twitter, coupled
with the growth of digital self-publishing companies like Lulu.com, Createspace.com, or
Amazon.com’s Kindle Direct may speak to this new development in the publishing
industry.
Since 2007, Amazon has led the charge of self-publishers to allow entrepreneurial
authors to upload their works to Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) store. In
exchange for circumventing the traditional vanity press model or the traditional
publishing house model, authors may upload their works to Amazon at no charge, sell
their ebooks for anywhere between $0.99 – $9.99 to Amazon Kindle customers, and may
keep up to 70% of their royalties (Kellogg, 2010). Amazon also allows KDP authors to
use Author Central, Amazon’s free service that gives authors the opportunity to develop
and edit a free profile page, get direct help from Amazon employees, and finally and
most significantly, gain real time access to sales information (Kellogg, 2010). KDP
authors can also track their month-to-date unit sales, prior six weeks’ royalties, and
monthly royalty statements for the previous year (Kellogg, 2010).
The ease and appeal of self-publication on Amazon has brought about several
notable changes in the publishing world. Fresh and diverse voices have sidestepped the
traditional gatekeepers, and publishing has been made accessible in new ways.
Innovative authors are finding audiences for their works when they might not have

14
experienced the same success with traditional publishing houses (Konrath, 2010). By
promoting themselves in social media outlets, and by utilizing freelance editors and cover
artists to create self-published books that are as stylish and polished as traditionally
published books, many authors have found a way to both reach their audiences and
legitimize their craft (Konrath, 2010). Spam and farmed content have also flooded
Amazon’s ebook marketplace; plagiarized books, public domain “newly-edited” editions,
and stolen web-based writing (blogs are particularly vulnerable) have been uploaded by
malicious self-publishers looking to make quick money before they are inevitably caught
(Barr, 2011; Miller, 2011). Finally, material that would otherwise be considered unpublishable (and in the opinion of many reviewers, unreadable) has found its way to
Amazon’s KDP store (Barlowe, 2009).
These changes reflect a major change in the kinds of barriers to publication and
the decline of editorial oversight as the critical obstruction of the path to publication and
distribution. Traditionally, the role of the editor at a publishing house, as Thompson has
said, is to acquire,
and, indeed, help to create the content that will be turned into the books that
comprise the publisher’s list. The publisher acts not just as a filter or gatekeeper
but in many cases plays an active role in creating or conceiving a project, or in
seeing the potential of something and helping the author bring it to fruition…
There is a real skill here that involves a blending together of intellectual creativity
and marketing nous… (19).
Editors add value to books, and they must see something valuable in the raw material
before they invest time and money into making it into both a finished product as well as a

15
marketable and sellable product. Editors and the publishing houses they represent are the
most significant gatekeepers on the pathway to publication; and throughout the 20th
century, their tastes have dictated what sort of content has been deemed publishable
(Thompson 2013, Schiffrin 2001).
These changes in the way the book and publishing industry distributes content
mark a new period in the history of publishing and bring a new kind of instability to those
involved in the manufacture, marketing, and sale of books. Russell Grandinetti, an
Amazon executive, said in an interview with the New York Times,
that the landscape [is] in some ways changing for the first time since Gutenberg
invented the modern book nearly 600 years ago… [and t]he only really necessary
people in the publishing process now are the writer and reader. Everyone who
stands between those two has both risk and opportunity (Streitfeld, 2011).
Instant downloadable “book” content that has bypassed traditional publishing house
models marks a new age for channels to markets, a new phase in the history of books,
and justifies a new subfield of academic research in the History of the Book (Rubin, 2003,
p. 555).
The history of books (or, as it is often called by its academics, the History of the
Book) is a critical field of study to librarians, archivists, and historians. To scholars such
as these, the “‘book’ is really shorthand for the full range of written communication”
(Rubin, 2003, p. 555). Their subject reveals a social, economic, and cultural history by
situating the tastes of readers, authors, publishers, and agents in an interconnected web
that includes everything from the technical aspects of book and manuscript production, to
book distribution, book analysis, literary criticism, communication, and the social

16
influence of texts. Such a wide field demands interdisciplinarity from its scholars.
Indeed, Robert Darnton, one of the foremost scholars of the history of books, when
describing the foundations of this field, has said that the subject,
…arose from the convergence of several disciplines on a common set of problems,
all of them having to do with the process of communication. Initially, the
problems took the form of concrete questions in unrelated branches of scholarship.
What were Shakespeare’s original texts? What caused the French Revolution?
What is the connection between culture and social stratification? In pursuing
those questions, scholars found themselves crossing paths in a no-man’s-land
located at the intersection of a half-dozen fields of study. They decided to
constitute of their own and to invite in historians, literary scholars, sociologists,
librarians, and anyone else who wanted to understand the book as a force in
history (Daedalus, 1982, p. 65).
The questions about the importance of books, first raised up by these “Young Turk”
scholars (Darnton, 1982, p. 65) still apply in this new period of downloadable, digital
books. Self-published books, by their very nature, avoid many of the traditional stopping
points in the communications circuit Darnton has described (Darnton, 1982, p. 68).
Downloadable, digital self-published books, at this moment in book history, offer
academics more questions than answers. While there have been some initial quantitative
analyses of self-publishing (Dilevko and Dali, 2006; Bradley et al, 2011), no studies have
conducted close readings of these texts or explored their content and subject matter in an
in-depth way.

17
A first glance at the KDP store would suggest that the works dominating the selfpublishing Amazon marketplace are fiction; noir mysteries, romantic comedies, and light
erotica are all highly visible. Beneath the layers of these fictional works, local histories
and memoirs have also found their way to Amazon. Many of these works are nontraditional histories. They are amateur works on community and family stories, tagged by
their authors as “history,” and they can be found by Amazon customers all across the
United States, and presumably, the world. This new and somewhat egalitarian history
production has considerable implications for historians and librarians, and how it will
impact or change the creation of the historical record and influence the field of history
remains to be seen. Both parties would benefit from further interdisciplinary research in
this area.
Many leaders in the history of books and in the history of library and information
science have called for their research to unite around recent communication and
information trends. Rose has complained bitterly that library science academia needs to
be broken out of its “scholarly ghetto” and must “enter the mainstream of academic
discourse… [to] become part of a larger intellectual project.” (Rose, Alternative Futures
for Library History, p. 50). The work of the Society for the History of Authorship,
Reading, and Publishing (SHARP), and their related journal, Book History, to Rose,
while useful, is simply not enough (p. 57). The best hope for this, he believes, is to ride
“the next wave in historiography,” which is an analysis of information culture, and to
“break into the historiographical mainstream [by] addressing the great debates that
engage professional historians” (p. 57).

18
Keen (2002), in describing the early years of the History of the Book as an
academic field, has said that the efforts of bringing historiographical focus to the history
of books was not limited to multidisciplinary engagement. Keen also suggested that
historians of the book were not only interested in
…redrawing the disciplinary map. Darnton insisted that on a more fundamental
level, rejecting ‘the great-man, great-book view of literary history’ as a
‘mystification’ would open up the possibility of rereading literary history. And if
studied in connection with the system for producing and diffusing the printed
word, [it] could force us to rethink our notion of literature itself (p. 153).
This challenge, to reject the “great-man, great-book” perspective and to foster a
diversified conversation about the power of printed and disseminated texts, is a natural
place for library/information scientists and historians to come together. Librarians have
long made an effort to create library collections that are inclusive of all community
members; indeed, diverse collections are a critical tenet of the first two amendments of
the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights (American Library
Association, 1996). Studying self-published books, particularly works that are selfdescribed as history and aim to tell a truth that accommodates people without great
political or economic power, is another way librarians and historians can meet. Their
aims are often very similar; library science academics often seek to accommodate readers
and voices that are situated outside the mainstream, and historians try to recover voices
whose stories have rarely been told or examined.
There is a great opportunity for scholars to foster the natural marriage of these
fields, and this dissertation aims to insert itself in this academic vacuum, and to explore

19
the important work of self-published authors, be they creators of memoirs or local history,
as they take advantage of the new trends in book production (particularly self-publishing
on Amazon, as it is so radically different from traditional publishing and book
dissemination). It means to consider the relationship that might develop between these
books and libraries. In order to understand the possibilities for such a thing, librarians
and book historians must study and analyze local history/memoir works for content, for
their potential relevance to local collections and archives, and determine where they fit
into a broader historiographical schema. This project, described in the next sections,
contributes to this developing relationship by critically analyzing some of the books, and
the new voices they represent, emerging in this exciting and new digital publication
marketplace. For book historians and librarians to observe the mass of self-published
books, and to only quantify and aggregate them without taking the opportunity to delve
into their stories, to mine their content, and to engage with the storytelling these new
authors are offering, is much too limiting; indeed, by choosing to not engage with the
texts themselves, studies of this kind do not actually legitimize these works or their
authors’ voices as valid cultural expressions worthy of scholarly inquiry. This new era of
authorship demands attention, and a detailed and intensive reading of self-published
ebooks gives credence and value to these unheard and understudied works.

Purpose Statement
This dissertation closely examines several of the Kindle ebooks amateur
historians and memoirists have published through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing
website. It has hand-selected four self-published books that are either self-identified as

20
works of history from Amazon’s advanced search function or self-identified by the author
as “biography/memoir” from Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing “Indie” store. These
books were selected for their content, particularly for their emphasis on local history or
personal story, and they have formed a markedly and purposefully heterogeneous
collection. They were chosen the way a public or an academic librarian might consider
purchasing a book for collection, by considering whether or not the book’s content has
potential relevance to the service population, and for readerly interest. Books were
selected rather than diaries, letters, or blogs, because although all of these aforementioned
formats are valid forms of cultural output and worthy of study in their own rights, books
and ebooks are still the format most significant to libraries and librarians, and they are, by
definition, the critical medium for the History of the Book. Books that have been
finalized for publication, whether that publishing entity is a commercial publishing house,
a self-publishing venture, or an academic press, represent a completed project from an
author, and each may be studied as a singular case.
These four books each have a single chapter of the dissertation dedicated to a
close reading, with a fifth chapter dedicated to a comparative analysis of the books’
indicators of quality, discoverability, and accessibility. By narrowing the focus on just a
few books, a fuller spectrum of the Communication Circuit that Darnton (1982) modeled
for Book Historians may be realized and understood for each work. This project, in the
vein of micro-analysis, does not simply challenge other “History of the Book” studies
that quantify and often generalize cultural creation and book production in broad strokes;
rather, it serves as a complementary inquiry to such studies (Gants, 2002).

21
These books, their content, and the way their authors have presented them on
Amazon have been analyzed and read according to a microhistorical methodology,
especially with emphasis on what Carlo Ginzburg calls clues and traces. Special
attention has been paid to the events these authors seek to describe and the style of
history they mean to tell. The output of this reading and study of these self-published
ebooks as they exist on their respective Amazon webpages is a narration of a section of
the communication circuit and provides an in-depth look at a selection of book history.
Additionally, a discussion follows these in-depth analyses that situates these ebooks in
their greater historical field and describes how it might be possible to successfully
include them in a collection that contextualizes them and makes them relevant to library
public(s). Ultimately, this study means to offer a respite from the endless march towards
quantification in the study of books and publication in the 20th and 21st centuries, and to
engage with texts in a more targeted and focused way.
Because these books offer their readers subjective, personal histories, they have
been analyzed with a historical methodology that characterizes itself on the close
readings of texts. This dissertation ultimately argues that many of these histories have a
place in the public sphere as valuable and useful pieces of subjective and sometimes
firsthand knowledge of past events. As intimate records of a uniquely late 20th – early
21st century perspective, they offer future generations insight into personal American
experiences from people who were previously unable to publish their thoughts, stories,
and ideas without considerable financial cost to themselves. These new historians have
taken advantage of new technological products and publication formats to share the
histories they deemed important enough to write. By conducting a close reading of self-

22
published authors’ content, this project engages with and analyzes this new style of
history publication and lays claim to understand some of the kinds of self-published
histories being created in this new marketplace. This work asserts that these new voices
matter, and these memoirs and histories deserve places in local library collections. While
the books analyzed here could conceivably find a home in an archive because they are
not widely reproduced, the archival premise – that collections are often made up of
singular and often unpublished materials, and often have restricted access – harms the
authors’ intention of distribution. The four authors studied here all distributed their work
on the largest possible platform available to them (Amazon), and relegating their work to
an archive would limit the inclusion of outsider voices into regularly maintained, actively
used, and publicly seen collections, as in libraries.

Research Questions
Overall, this project examines self-published texts from a historical perspective.
This work offers rich descriptions of some of the newly self-published texts of local
history, family history, or biography/memoir. To engage these topics, it focuses on the
following specific research questions:
•

What do these four self-published histories/works of memoir study, seek to
understand, or otherwise make plain to readers? What vision of the past are they
trying to present to their audience? The answer to this research question has been
provided in the following chapters by reading four self-published, self-described
works of history, life story, or memoir, and by conducting a close reading and

23
analysis of these works and their respective Amazon websites for their content
and presentation.
•

How can historians of books and book culture situate these self-published
histories in the greater historical project (that is, canvassing the human experience
through the creation of subjective narratives)? How might these works be defined
in relation to the greater historical saga?

•

Are there any common characteristics of self-published books? What kind of
editorial quality do they convey to readers?

•

Are these books widely available, or potentially known to broader audiences?
What kind of presence do these works have in local public or academic libraries?
What value might they have, or might they contribute to a library collection and
its users? Is there a usefulness in establishing a presence for these materials
(particularly local histories/local memoirs) in local libraries?

The Self-Publishing Phenomenon and Self-Published Books in Libraries
Studies of self-published books and their placement in libraries were few and far
between in the late 20th century. Commentary on self-published books and the scam of
vanity presses certainly exists in LIS academic literature; Morris (1974) has not only
derided the practice of self-publishing, but openly mocked self-publishing authors, going
so far as to say that they are “too dense to realize what [they are] getting into” (p. 422)
and that “vanity publishers can hardly be faulted for taking advantage of an obvious
demand” even if their “ego-driven clients” are “too dumb to know what they’re getting
into and cry later” (p. 422). The overwhelming commentary in LIS pieces and in

24
newspapers addressing publishing in the 20th century (Morris, 1974; McDowell, 1982;
Appelbaum, 1998; Woliver, 2001) is that self-publishing is an industry characterized by
fraudulent practices and managed by charlatans.
Dilevko and Dali of the University of Toronto began charting the transitional
period of self-publishing in the early 2000s. Their 2006 study considered the rise of selfpublishing in the United States from 1960 to 2004, and some of their findings were of
scholarly import. Dilevko and Dali argued that, as mainstream publishing corporatized in
that time period, self-publishing became one of the last bulwarks of independent
publishing. They noted that self-publishing began to satisfy “ ‘micro-niches that are so
small that publishers would not be interested in publishing them in the traditional way’ …
[and asserted that] micro-niche titles may represent the new face of self-publishing.”
Dilevko and Dali were the first in this new digital age to argue that librarians should,
…reevaluate their negative preconceptions about self-publishers, especially
AuthorHouse, iUniverse, and Xlibris, because catering to segmented, niche, and
individualized markets has been shown, in influential marketing textbooks such as
Principles of Marketing (Kotler & Armstrong, 2003), to be an effective way to
generate demand for a given product or service. In blunter terms, collection
development librarians in public and academic libraries should make a conscious
effort not to exclude self-published titles from their field of vision because the
stigma traditionally associated with self-publishing is quickly disappearing. (p.
233).
While Dilevko and Dali’s study was groundbreaking for its focus on self-publishing
books in the late 20th century, it was limited by its focus on Print-On-Demand books and

25
the publishers who specialize in these works (particularly AuthorHouse, iUniverse, and
Xlibris).
In 2006, a team of researchers at the University of Arizona first began to
investigate the growing phenomenon of these new models of book publishing, which they
termed “non-traditional” (Bradley, Fulton, Helm & Pittner, 2011). They noted that nontraditional book publishing accounted “for over eight times the output of traditional
publishing,” and predicted that “evolving social uses of … technologies” and “shifting
economic patterns” would shape the development of new publishing formats (Bradley, et
al, 2011, Abstract section, para. 1; Conclusion section, para. 1). While the publishing
industry was surely in a state of turmoil and flux (Schiffrin, 2001; Thompson, 2005),
some publishing houses envisioned the future and made the move to accommodate
authors who would prefer to self-publish, or at least to play with new and alternative
formatting. Author Solutions, a new member affiliate of the Penguin Group, began to
offer publishing assistance in the form of editing, distribution, and publicity services for a
fee to authors, and HarperCollins created new digital-only imprints (e.g., Hydra)
specifically to ease the transition for writers to published authors (Bradley, Fulton, Helm
& Pittner, 2011). Changes were taking place in the publishing world, and new kinds of
books were emerging in this fold.
In order to understand the kinds of works being produced in these alternative
channels-to-markets, Bradley’s Non-Traditional Publishing Research Group (RG-NTP)
purchased 348 titles for an in-depth study as an empirical “snapshot” of self-published
books. This random sample had a wide range of authors and publishers, and their topics
were as varied as the sections in any chain bookstore. To draw out and study potential

26
trends within this sample, it became important to establish who was self-publishing, and,
if possible, to determine why they avoided traditional publishing modes. Further, the
RG-NTP wanted to know the subjects these amateur authors were addressing.
By the end of the decade, many publishing industry leaders were asking
themselves the same question and interrogating shifts in the publishing marketplace. In
December 2010, when commenting on this new trend in publishing, the editorial board of
Publishers Weekly said:
What kinds of people telling what kinds of stories are out there, investing their
own time and money to be heard? There are professionals – whether in medicine,
education, finance, fitness, or nutrition – sharing what they have learned. There
are advocates for those victimized by financial turnarounds, spiritual crises,
addictions, or just mainstream mores who are intent on empowering the troubled
or downtrodden. There are people with memories of family to record and relate,
or paeans to forgotten innovators they wish to record for posterity and wider
consumption. There are novelists and poets working in favored genres and styles,
where you can sense that the author is that enthusiast who believes he or she can
tell a good story, too, or turn a line with the best of them. All those things – the
desire to help others, to instruct, to enlighten, to entertain, to express – are what
have forever driven publishing at whatever level (Publishers Weekly, 2010, para.
4).
The Bradley RG-NTP study, initially described in First Monday (Bradley, Fulton, Helm
& Pittner, 2011) and revisited in Library Quarterly (Bradley, Fulton & Helm, 2012),
confirmed Publishers Weekly’s assertions. Bradley’s research group found that the

27
authors of self-published works discussed a variety of topics, including their spirituality,
personal accounts, and family stories. In addition, these writers offered nonfiction advice
– on everything from raising teenage girls, teaching math, or building a home – and they
wrote gay haiku, post-apocalyptic fiction, and Western short stories. RG-NTP researcher
Bruce Fulton also explored how value and content may be added to such works by online
reviews and social gatekeeping in his dissertation, Social Gatekeeping, The Serendipitous
Tie and Discovery: Authors Connecting Readers to Books Through Social Media
Outreach (2013).
Although the RG-NTP has put forth useful studies on self-publishing, both as a
research team and with each member acting in individual scholarly capacities, no one has
done more scholarly research on self-published authorship in the last decade than
Laquintano. In his work, Mass Authorship and the Rise of Self-Publishing (2016),
Laquintano interviews more than eighty self-published authors and tries to understand
how they navigate the new digital marketplace. Helpfully, Laquintano urges readers to
consider a nuanced vision of the self-publishing marketplace – one that moves beyond
the simplistic notion that traditional publishing networks are the only entities responsible
for adding value and professional polish to books. In Mass Authorship and the Rise of
Self-Publishing (2016), and his article, “The Legacy of the Vanity Press and Digital
Transitions” (2013), Laquintano problematizes the conflation of self-publishing with
vanity publishing, and explores the stigma of vanity publishing and its impact on new
models of self-publishing. To date, the existing literature on self-published books and the
new models of publishing have not engaged directly with the texts in any in-depth way.
Most investigations have been focused on quantifiable data that would shed some light on

28
the general state of the publishing industry, or that consider the authorial perspective in
the new self-publishing model. Further, there have been no studies that designate selfpublished ebooks a new place in the history of books. To reiterate, this study fills this
gap by conducting a close reading from a historical perspective, and it is guided by the
methodology of microhistory and standpoint theory, which are both discussed next.

29
CHAPTER 2 – BACKGROUND, THEORY, AND METHODOLOGICAL
APPROACHES
This project, as a marriage of the fields of Library and Information Science and
History, considers a new angle of book history by studying self-published histories and
memoirs under a focused lens. As such, this work combines and utilizes several
methodological approaches and information theories to accommodate this
interdisciplinary topic. The project employs microhistory as the primary methodology,
and standpoint theory as a supplemental influence.

The History of the Book
Although mentioned previously, the History of the Book is a little known field, at
the intersection of the fields of Library Science and History, and understanding the
trajectory of this field is critical to this work. The field of book history developed out of
western European studies in the late 20th century, but in the last two decades it has been
expanding to include new regional cultures and technological practices. Febvre and
Martin first introduced the idea of the book as a point of study in The Coming of the
Book: 1450 – 1800 (first published in 1958; translated to English in 1976). Febvre, as
one of the foundational members of the French Annales school (and its primary
figurehead after Marc Bloch was murdered while serving the French resistance in World
War II), considered book history through the lens of the longue durée. A methodology
characteristic of Annales, the longue durée emphasizes historical research that covers
great swaths of history without emphasis on a single person or political and diplomatic
action. Annales historians (who include book historian Chartier and Le Roy Ladurie)

30
stressed the examination of climate and agriculture, sea changes in commerce and
economics, and demographics and social groups, all over slow and long periods. While
the Annales school fell out of favor with many historians by the 1970s and 1980s, their
work has fundamentally influenced the early years of the History of the Book as a new
field of study with The Coming of the Book.
Although Annales historians were the first to consider the book as a locus for
historical investigation, it was Eisenstein who fostered the development of the History of
the Book as a new field with her seminal 1979 study, The Printing Press as an Agent of
Change: Communications and Cultural Transformations in Early Modern Europe. Her
work advanced the thesis that European history was fundamentally shaped by this new
technology, and from the moment of publication, The Printing Press as an Agent of
Change provoked a firestorm. Because Eisenstein rested the great advancements in
Western civilization — the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the Age of
Exploration, and much of Renaissance thought — all at the feet of Gutenberg, her critics
said she negated the efforts of other influencers and oversimplified the
period. Regardless of criticism, the fundamental point that Eisenstein made, and the one
that she has restated again and again (1983, 1986, 2010), is that an unacknowledged
revolution took place. Her work marked a turning point in the history of communication
technologies because it situated the technology of the book in the traditional histories of
early modern Europe, and she herself has been called an “Agent of Change” as a key
figure in the History of Books (Baron et al, 2006).
Those who would follow in Eisenstein’s footsteps – namely, Darnton and Chartier
– have experimented with new models of understanding written and print culture, from its

31
history as an economic enterprise to the cultural impact of the dissemination of literature.
Dorothea Kraus (1999), perfectly summarizing Chartier’s impression on the field of book
history, has said that his work centers on four “poles” of study, namely authors, books,
texts, and readers. In his pivotal, The Order of Books: Readers, Authors, and Libraries in
Europe Between the 14th and 18th Centuries (1994), Chartier succeeded not only in
tracing the changing methods of state regulation over book production, but also in
examining the evolving relationship of readers to the texts they consumed. Creating such
a web – and indeed, seeing all of the working parts of this cultural interaction – is often
the aim of modern history, and book history can often situate the social, cultural, and
personal ideas of historical figures within broader economic forces and trends sometimes
better than other subfields.
In the late 1970s, Darnton began to explore the print culture of pre-Revolutionary
France, and his body of work on the libelliste pamphleteer culture of the late 18th century
revealed a deep thread of anti-monarchical sentiment throughout the urban artisanal
classes of Paris in the Ancien Regime. In his own discussion of the publication circuit,
Darnton has suggested that book history often focuses on just one part of the publication
system – be it distribution, printing, sales, marketing, reception, or readership – but they
rarely take in a picture of a book that looks beyond these materials. Darnton’s own work
succeeded and offered so much to Historians of the Book because it was a close analysis
of the printed materials (pamphlets and their illustrations), and its methodology was
primarily informed by the latest wave in cultural historiography of the 1980s – the “New
Cultural History.” This style of historical analysis emphasized the culture of everyday

32
people, and explored the milieu of their values, attitudes, and mentalities by considering
the various manifestations of their intellectual output.
Advocacy for a history that offers insight to the experiences of everyday people,
as Darnton has made, is not limited to historians of the book. For decades, biographers,
memoir analysts, and life historians have been clamoring for a change to the “great-man,
great-book” (A. Keen, 2007) perspective of reading literary history. Problematically, as
Freeman and Krantz (1980) explained in “The Unfulfilled Promise of Life Histories,”
Historically, social scientists have viewed life histories in one of two ways: First,
those who reject them have seen them as interesting stories, sometimes possibly
of literary value, but, because of observer and narrator bias, having no
generalizability and thus no real value for the social sciences. Second, those who
accept them have seen them as data that might have some scientific value if
presented in an "objective" analysis. This approach has usually involved two
procedures: (a) minimizing or explaining away observerable bias as far as
possible, as people such as Allport recommended (1942), (b) using the data of life
histories to illuminate general principles or concepts in the social sciences. This
involves selecting portions of the enormous data of a life history, and discarding
those portions that are irrelevant for the stated purposes of the study. In this view,
the life history has little or no importance in and of itself; it is only a symptom of
the concept of generalization. We do not doubt that social scientists using this
approach can mine life histories to reach significant conclusions… [t]he question
we raise is whether such a use of life histories demonstrates their unique value (p.
2-3).

33
Bringing memoirs and life histories into the fray of the larger History of the Book
enterprise would serve the broader academic goal of bringing alternative voices to the
forefront of historical emphasis and study, and because book history methodology is
principally founded on art and humanities academic work, it would circumvent these
typical dismissals of life histories by social scientists. Self-published histories and
memoirs, like those studied here, give book historians a remarkable opportunity to let
people speak for themselves; White Jr., in “The Temple of Jupiter Revisited” defended
the building of a public history around the unknown and unheard, by saying that it is the
only way to “discover the history of mankind, and not merely the history of the very thin
and friable upper crust of mankind” (as cited in Biography, 1980). Analyzing these
works, letting them speak for themselves, and otherwise engaging with these texts in a
way that critically analyzes them but does not seek generalizable or quantifiable
information would both respect their content and provide book historians and librarians
with a glimpse into the cultural creation of self-published authors.
While the foundational premise of book history is Febvre’s Annales style
methodology, this dissertation and other studies of modern publishing would not benefit
from such a course of action. This dissertation is a zoomed-in snapshot of a few selfpublished works; a long form history would miss many details of the rapidly changing
online and digital publishing world. The ideal methodology to inform a History of the
Book that considers self-published histories, life histories, or memoir self-published
ebooks in their own terms is microhistory and micro-analysis. Indeed, when speaking of
microhistory, Annales historian Chartier said that it is only on the reduced scale that
academics can understand social affiliations, systems of belief, values, and

34
representations without any kind of deterministic reduction (Quoted in Ginzburg,
Threads and Traces: True False Fictive, 2012, Kindle Locations 4322-4325). This study
adds another branch to the history of books and helps, as Darnton insisted, the field to
move away from the great-man, great-book view of literary history. This is another step
– lighting another candle in the dark – towards a cultural history that includes voices
outside of approved cultural parameters. These self-published books are not selected for
publication by trendsetting book editors seeking profits in the capitalist marketplace; they
do not reflect the good taste of literary agents or publishers. They will, likely, never
make very much money for the authors (Brantley, 2012). These books exist outside of a
pattern of book creation and consumption that has dominated the marketplace for the last
40 years, namely, the increasing corporatization of publishing houses and their constant
need for bestsellers (particularly as described in Thompson’s 2010 work, Merchants of
Culture). This dissertation delves into several aspects of book history; as publication
process, historical narrative and local history creation, and is informed by both History
and LIS perspectives to understand these books as the small-scale histories that they are,
and as they exist in the changing context of self-publishing.

Microhistory and its Place in this Project
As a methodology, microhistory emerged in the 1970s as a kind of response to
socialist and Marxist histories. It was a part of the so-called “New Cultural History”
(Hunt, 1989) that meant to seek out voices that had not been included in traditional
histories, particularly the working classes, women, and the colonized. This New Cultural
History also sought to avoid describing these previously unstudied historical figures

35
solely by their relationship to economic enterprises or the means of production, as
Marxist or Annales historians had in the decades prior. While works like The Peasants of
Languedoc (Le Roy Ladurie, 1966) and The Making of the English Working Class (E.P.
Thompson, 1966) were lauded for their vision of history that was not informed by
political events and the lifestyles of elite historical figures, their alternative histories still
failed to include the stories of average, working people. Their histories, despite having
been informed and shaped by Marxist thought, did not capture the expression or
sentiments of working class peoples in a way that satisfied all historians.
New cultural historians often tried to understand the experiences of historical
figures by analyzing their creation of cultural objects and cultural productions.
Innovative historians like Hunt (2004), Ozouf (1991), and Landes (2003) led the way and
imagined the French revolution by studying “low culture,” that is, parades, crowds,
Phrygian caps, cockades, and festivals. These historians all sought to situate cultural
objects and cultural creations in their historical milieu in order to attain a more fully
realized vision of past experiences previously untold, particularly a culture created by
“common” people (Ginzburg, 1980).
Situated in this New Cultural History, the microhistorical premise rests on the
close reading of cultural objects. Carlo Ginzburg, who is arguably the father of the
microhistorical method, has advocated for the inclusion of small-form histories in the
historical canon because of the way they elevate the experience of the individual. The
individual is not meant to be representative of all others (indeed, as one looks at
individuals under the magnifying glass, more differences rather than similarities emerge),
but the emphasis on a small historical moment forces the reader to view, relate to, and

36
empathize with the minutia of the human experience. Furthermore, and because
Ginzburg has so successfully lifted the seemingly inconsequential historical vignette to
the forefront of critical historiographical conversations (particularly in his
groundbreaking 1980 volume, The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a SixteenthCentury Miller), his methodology seems most pertinent to the analysis of these artisanal
narratives. All historical moments – recorded and maintained through narratives that are
subjective, flawed, and imperfect, but rooted in evidence (whether those pieces of
evidence are court documents, journals/letters that record events, memoirs, etc.) –
deserve consideration and add something to the historical project. Individual experiences
are paramount.
Ginzburg’s fundamental methodology for reading texts and constructing a
narrative analysis out of them rests on the accumulation of clues. In his methodological
treatise, Clues, Myth, and the Historical Method (1986), Ginzburg codifies his primary
aim, to advocate for history production that focuses on "a close reading of a relatively
small number of texts, related to a possibly circumscribed belief, [that] can be more
rewarding than the massive accumulation of repetitive evidence" (p. 164).
In his introduction of the concept of clues, Ginzburg centers his focus on two
individuals: Giovanni Morrelli and Sigmund Freud. Morelli made a name for himself in
the 1870s as an art historian who could determine the original creator of an unsourced or
otherwise unattributed painting by paying close attention to details that would not have
been influenced by an artist’s school or training. Morelli was lambasted by his peers in
the art world for not understanding the art itself; his focus on details that were considered
inconsequential to the greater picture seemed irrelevant to other art critics and historians.

37
The throwaways that Morelli chose to study were intrinsically related to the artist’s
personal touch or indicative of their natural style, like similar ear shapes, hands, or
fingernails. Ginzburg relates this attention to detail to Freud’s ability to hone in on
seemingly insignificant minutiae of patients’ thoughts or dreams to understand their
broader psychological problems; indeed, Freud in his ‘“preanalytic” phase’ commented
on Morelli in his 1914 essay, “The Moses of Michelangelo.” (1986, p. 98). Freud said
that Morelli’s “method of inquiry is closely related to the technique of psycho-analysis.
It, too, is accustomed to divine secret and concealed things from unconsidered or
unnoticed details, from the rubbish heap, as it were, of our observations.” (Freud as cited
in Ginzburg, 1986, p. 99).
Both of these forms of inquiry and study are, to Ginzburg (1986), borne out of an
artisanal human skill that “is characterized by the ability to construct from apparently
insignificant experimental data a complex reality that could not be experienced directly”
(p. 103). Ginzburg compares this skill to those of early Western doctors, (he notes that
both Freud and Morelli had a background in medicine before their work in their
respective fields) who weighed several symptoms and then offered diagnostic analysis, or
even hunters and trackers, whose knowledge of animal lore allowed them reconstruct a
sequential narrative out of tracks, broken branches, and shed hair. In all cases,
“conjectural” knowledge is used to create a narrative that explains observed details, and
Ginzburg believes this style suits history creation and analysis.
Many scholars have argued about whether or not this “particular, local, intuitive
gathering of knowledge that is mostly closely bound up with everyday experience”
(During, 1997 p. 34) is a science or can follow a scientific process for other scholars to

38
use as a guide. Shepherd, informed by Medawar, has said that detail-oriented studies
(like Freudian psychoanalysis) cannot be termed sciences because they are “rarely
susceptible to experimental examination” (Shepherd as cited in During, p. 34). Rather
than science, clue-oriented studies,
may be myth, myth in a basically positive, creative, useful sense, the sense in
which the realm of myth protects its own special breed of knowledge, not a
knowledge of facts or logical truths, but an intuitive, empathetic, metaphorical
knowledge, a “mythod” rather than a method (Shepherd as cited in During, p. 34).
During (1997), in a discussion of Clues and Intimations, has grappled with Shepard’s
consideration of Freud, and has said that this “‘mythod’ should not have to apologize for
its defections from scientific propriety… [rather it] is a model for that kind of knowledge
which helps us get beyond the ‘sterile contrasting of explication and interpretation’” (p.
34).
A clue-based methodology for the reading of narrative texts should be based on
what During (1997) has called “good reading,” the opposite of modern or
deconstructionist reading; rather it is “faithful [reading] in the old-fashioned sense,”
indicative of “the kind of sympathy – between the researcher and object here… of the
good reader who respects what his text is trying to say” (p. 32). By nature, such a
reading of textual clues is “amphibious” … (During, p. 34) and the conjectural
knowledge that results is most “serviceable to the doctor, the historian, and the detective,
[although it] resists codification and systematization” (p. 49). Such a reading gives equal
measure of study and emphasis on those “throwaway details,” as to the bigger arc of the

39
book, and in the case of this dissertation, considers all elements of the self-published
book.
Flexibility is the key to such a study and method of analysis. Bloch (1964)
advocated for the preservation of the “broadest interpretation of the word ‘history’ … [a
word that] places no a priori prohibitions in the path of inquiry [and] comprises in itself
no credo; it commits us, according to its original meaning, to nothing other than inquiry”
(p. 20). Clue-based, microhistorical methodology is extremely open-ended, and useful to
book historians. Book historians may interact with a variety of different texts, clues, and
materials, and the very best works of book history succeed because they consider so
many avenues of approach to the understanding of textual materials throughout time.
Besides striking out on new paths, historians of the book have tried to accommodate the
New Cultural historian’s problem – the inclusion of peoples who exist outside of cultural
mainstreams by looking at “low” culture – by studying pamphlets, broadsides, and
inexpensive print material. Studying print culture in the 20th century is an easier process
because of the rise of literacy rates across classes, and even easier in the 21st century
because of the democratization of digital publication technologies.
This clue-based, microhistorical methodology of analysis suits the New Cultural
History and the advocacy for cross-class inclusion because the analysis is not rooted in
academic science or social science. This gathering of clues, Ginzburg (1986) notes, is
rooted in a kind of “low intuition” that,
…can be found throughout the entire world, with no limits of geography, history,
ethnicity, sex, or class – and thus, it is far removed from higher forms of

40
knowledge which are the privileged property of an elite few. It is the property…
of hunters; of sailors; of women (p. 125).
Utilizing a methodology that has been studied by the academy but is not borne of the
academy increases the chances of understanding self-published works in their own right
and upon their own merits.
Ginzburg understands the impulse of those who would quantify, parse, and
otherwise systematically code and dissect text; he believes that this desire is borne out of
the long tendency towards abstraction of the text that is rooted in Book History itself
(1986, p. 107). The decline of gesture, intonation, calligraphy, and orality, which he
relates to the progressive dematerialization of texts fostered by the inventions of writing
and then printing, forced those who would study texts to trace authenticity and accuracy
(Ginzburg relates this to the formation of the field of philology) to study texts in a
methodological way. And so, as text became an abstraction, the analysis of it, “even
while retaining to a large extent its divinatory qualities, had the potential to develop in a
rigorously scientific direction” (Ginzburg, 1986, p. 107).
The reading of texts should be on a case-by-case basis, because, as Ginzburg says,
“Even if the historian is sometimes obliged to refer back, explicitly or implicitly, to a
sequence of comparable phenomena, the cognitive strategy, as well as the codes by which
he expresses himself, remain intrinsically individualizing” (1986, p. 106). Whatever
shared characteristics exist between these self-published histories, they are not treated as
though they belong to a group together, and indeed, they are considered here as a part of
the historical body they mean to take part in. Although some comparisons are made in

41
the chapter on library presence and indicators of quality, the texts and storylines of these
works are considered on a standalone basis in this dissertation.
Building a narrative out of the consumption and reading of a digital, selfpublished ebook lends itself to the belief, Ginzburg’s (1986) and During’s (1997), that
“[ultimately], historical knowledge is indirect, presumptive, conjectural” even if history
is “forever tied to the concrete” (Ginzburg, 1986, p. 106). In Threads and Traces: True
False Fictive, Ginzburg (2012) advocates for the construction of historical narratives as a
fundamental art of history, regardless of new fashions, and says,
In the second half of the 1960s the climate began to change. Some time later it
was announced with great fanfare that historians write. I remember at first
remaining indifferent to the hyperconstructionist (and, in fact, skeptical)
implications of that revelation. It shows up in a passage of my essay “Spie”
(1979), which considers the connection between deciphering traces and narration
without mentioning any eventual skeptical objections. The turning point came for
me only when, thanks to an essay of Arnaldo Momigliano’s, I realized the moral
and political (as well as cognitive) implications of the thesis that basically
canceled the distinction between historical and fictional narrations (Kindle
Locations 106-109).
One of the primary characteristics of a microhistorical narrative is the frank discussion of
a cultural object and the analyst’s intimate understanding of it. Microhistorians promote
the close reading of texts; they try to understand what the primary author was attempting
to convey and the image they were trying to construct. In so doing, microhistorians
explain their interaction with the text and describe their individual process as an analyst

42
of the object or original text. Occasionally, they may go so far as to describe this process
in the first person (Iggers, 2012, Kindle Edition Location 1784), and as Ginzburg says,
“the [historian’s] hypotheses, the doubts, the uncertainties [become] part of the narration”
(Ginzburg, 1993, p. 24). By choosing to avoid adherence to any one set of guidelines for
study, they may encounter the original text, unencumbered by any boundaries that might
have been set by a previously determined analytical framework.
A microhistorical methodology, by emphasizing this small-scale sourcework and
the creation of narrative, is the best and most accommodating methodology for analyzing
these particular local histories and memoirs. Many large-scale historiographical
approaches (e.g., Marxist, Annales) argue for the study of comprehensive social,
environmental, class, or economic transformations (Thompson, 1966). In the same
fashion, structuralist socio-historical approaches also tend to diminish the experiences of
individuals and their conceptions of the “field” as they interact with it or observe it in real
time (e.g., Bourdieu’s contributions to historical theory, particularly as considered by
Gorski (2013)). The social history theorists affiliated with these broader historical
narratives and structuralist sociological methodologies often describe the cultural
products of late capitalism and the mass-produced objects created on a scale for broad
consumption, and as a result, they have been regularly criticized for distorting or
misrepresenting the values, actions, desires, and beliefs of the very people they mean to
study. This dissertation provides a close, microhistorical analysis of the new, Kindle selfpublished histories, explores them as primary source examples of a new kind of amateur
history production, situates them in a suitable historiography, and explores how each
piece might be relevant or useful to a library’s or public historian’s collection.

43
This problem of overarching social histories has been considered by many
microhistorians, but perhaps best summarized by Magnússon, the chair of the Center of
Microhistorical Research at the Reykjavik Academy, who has said these broader social
histories ultimately failed to achieve their “main purpose, namely, to make ordinary
people the subject of history on their own terms” (2003, p. 701). While these selfpublished histories are made available on Amazon.com, a company self-described as
“Earth’s Biggest Bookstore” and a beacon of 21st century capitalism, they represent a
multiplicity of individual voices and a new kind of “People’s” history. These writers, in
many cases, are surely writing for small and niche audiences or even simply for
themselves. Furthermore, they present a useful challenge to professional histories, for, as
Wallach has said in her 2008 work on the value of memoir,
Individual experiences almost always complicate broad historical generalizations.
Therefore, there is a certain amount of tension between historical monographs,
which claim to describe a particular time period objectively, and autobiographies,
which can only meaningfully claim to document the peculiarities of one life. In
order to explore the conflict we sense between these quite different attempts to
chronicle the past, we must look at the issues of objectivity and subjectivity in
historical interpretation (p. 13).
As such, these self-published books deserve individualized attention – the kind that
microhistory necessarily emphasizes – before any kind of meta-narrative that describes
this self-publishing historical phenomenon can emerge.
Like other cultural histories, microhistories are often narratives of the
marginalized. Historical figures who have been lost in the archive (or who, due to the

44
exclusive nature of archives, exist outside of it) can sometimes be recovered, and a close
lens offers insight to their lives and daily experiences. The writers of these self-published
histories, while surely indicative of a measure of wealth and education (that is, they are
literate enough to write a book, upload it to Amazon’s KDP store, and have access to and
understanding of the technologies that would allow them to do so), would not have
necessarily had the ability to write and distribute such a work to a broad audience fifteen
years ago. Life writing, journal making, diary entries, and family histories and
genealogies are nothing new, but the processes involved with creating and sharing these
works certainly are.
Self-published histories/memoirs also raise questions for history writing in
general. Because these self-published works often focus on the personal experiences of
family and community, they are particularly ripe for a broader discussion of the
significance of subjectivity in the history-crafting process, particularly at the local level,
when personal relationships may inform the creation of a small-scale. As Ginzburg has
said, “[h]istorical narratives speak to us less about reality than they do about whoever has
constructed them,” so too should these self-published narratives invite analysis by
historians and librarians (2012, Kindle Edition Location 119). Upon considering the
individual’s self-published historical narrative or memoir, the reader may understand the
reality and context of that narrative, and perhaps even the writer’s socio-cultural context.
All histories have bias and baggage; such a problem is unavoidable. Historians cannot
escape personal sensibilities, perspectives, or shed their worldview in the writing process.
However, these biases render the author ‘human’ in a way that academic histories may
not, and because these self-published local histories/memoirs may be so heavy with

45
personal perspective, they exist on an unusual place on the history spectrum, far away
from social sciences and much closer to the arts and humanities, and in all of the messy
spaces where witness testimony and first hand accounts and personal subjectivities are
sutured on to narratives and memoirs.
While microhistory first emerged as an important genre among Italian scholars, it
has also taken root in the United States, no more so than with Davis. Davis, most widely
known for her 1983 book, The Return of Martin Guerre, won the 2012 Humanities award
from the National Endowment for the Humanities for her work as a microhistorian. She
has taken great pains to promote new methodologies amongst burgeoning historians,
particularly those that focus on the cultural output of common people. In her 1992 article
for The American Historical Review, “Toward Mixtures and Margins,” Davis argued that
authentic folk culture does not need to be local, oral, or face-to-face, and, alternatively,
that pop culture does not require a great distance between the creator and the consumer.
Further, she asserted that a case could be made for paying attention to unpopular books as
they may reveal a greater multiplicity of voices. Both of these ideas lend authority to this
project, which utilizes sources that are accessed at a distance from the web on an
enormously popular website, but are still by definition outside the mainstream.
Microhistory, she has suggested, by studying this less-recognized cultural output of
individuals, may accommodate a greater degree of diversity.
Additionally, because the self-publishing historian is responsible for uploading
their content to Amazon and tagging and categorizing their own work, the situational
presence of the book in Amazon’s increasingly sprawling website also deserves
consideration. Microhistorians, as they describe the content they choose to study, often

46
detail how it was found or came to be analyzed. In a similar vein, determining where this
book exists, describing its metadata, and noting the reviews, links, and additional content
furthers an understanding of the ways self-publishing authors are trying to present
themselves and their work to the greater world. Self-publishing authors take pains to
convey their expertise on a variety of topics, and how they present their book in the KDP
store speaks to that practice. Descriptive analysis of these facets of authorship and
content creation in the Amazon marketplace surely contextualizes these works a great
deal.

The Publishing Industry and Standpoint Theory
Standpoint theory offers another useful perspective for analysis of these selfpublished histories and their location in the Amazon KDP store. Standpoint theory
suggests that certain knowers and knowledge producers are better situated to provide
expertise and to explain historical events, social relationships, and cultural objects. A
person’s relationship to a past or current event lends them a unique perspective to
understand and describe said event. Born out of feminist epistemology, standpoint theory
emerged as a means to incorporate ways of knowing that previously had not been
discussed or allowed to participate in academic conversations. Feminist scholars, notably
Haraway and Longino, also intended to problematize the idea of “objectivity” in all
avenues of academic inquiry. Haraway’s (1988) article, argued that the real work of
scientists and scientific inquiry did not necessarily uphold “objectivity and [the] scientific
method” but rather could be characterized by a “[privileged] insider’s perspective” (p.
576). Longino’s (1990) work was a particularly important stepping stone toward a new

47
conversation about the underpinning values of scientists and the predispositions that
shape scientific research. Both philosophers and feminist scholars have argued that a
situational awareness should precede any kind of academic inquiry, and that a
consideration of alternative ways of knowing foster better analysis of any scientific
quandary. Standpoint theory also suggests that accepted, mainstream, or normalized
views elsewhere do not necessarily offer the best or most definitive perspective.
Traditionally, the establishment of authority, gravitas, or expertise in the
publishing world has come from the class of editors and agents who could be relied upon
to sort through the slush pile, and to find hidden gems in heaps of rubbish. Their good
taste and literary authority could determine what was publishable, and what was not.
Indeed, many historians of the book publishing industry have argued that, more than
money, publishing industry leaders, agents, editors, and even booksellers saw themselves
as tastemakers rather than crass capitalists (Miller, 2006; J. Thompson, 2010). They
believed that their personal curatorial decision-making should inform the public on good
writing and good literary style, and many sets of eyes prevented many kinds of writers
from publication.
The mechanisms for academic publication are and have been equally (if not more)
stringent than mainstream publishing. In addition to the traditional requirements that
professional historians hold advanced graduate degrees in their fields and maintain
professorships at research universities, historians must undergo strict and lengthy
revisions processes, led by peers in their fields. Many high hurdles must be overcome on
the path to publication, and in this way, disciplinary authority is constructed. In either

48
case, a series of checkpoints exists in order to prove that the content of the work in
question is valid, respected, true, or otherwise of value and quality.
These new, self-published histories exist outside of both of these publishing
realms. Amateur historians neither have the credentials to write professional histories,
nor have they undergone the vetting processes by editors or literary agents. In many
cases, these works lack the traditional indicators of quality readers have come to expect
from other published books (Bradley, Fulton, Helm, & Pittner, 2011) or other histories.
On the other hand, self-publishing authors are in a unique position to offer the reader a
close perspective on the events described. Because these authors often detail a history
that is personal or somehow dear to them (e.g., their life or their family story), they may
offer readers a different insight, and their viewpoint has an alternative credibility that a
distant, clinical, or otherwise academic history may not have. Authors interact with the
past, describe it in their own terms, and as a result tell their audiences about their vision
of history as well as their own socio-cultural vantage point.
Naturally, this lack of distance between author and subject in these self-published
works might foster a sense of hesitation in the reader. The professionalization of history
writing has encouraged distance between author and subject – distance invites skepticism,
and thusly (as has been presumed by thinkers like van Ranke) an opportunity to engage
with sources in an empirical and critical way. This long-held belief, that historians could
hold primary sources at an arm’s length and analyze and interpret them with neutrality,
buoyed the work of professional historians for decades. Eventually these notions became
frayed in the twentieth century when scholars from many different fields (as different and
disparate from one another as Benjamin and Scott) argued that the historian’s work is

49
always influenced by their own language, time period, personal experiences, and
academic interests. Professional historians cannot help but be colored by their
perspective and even their taste, and no work of history is truly an unmediated endeavor.
The four works studied here do not aim to create a top-down history. They are
not large scale. Two of them, Tails of the Prairie and Reflections of an Octogenarian,
are both memoir and history, and the authors both feature as the primary autobiographical
character. The other two, GROWING UP ON A WISCONSIN FARM IN THE 1920’S
AND 1930’S [sic] and History of New Mexico High School Football explore past events
on a limited scale, but both feature information about the author’s relationship to the
subject. In all cases, it is clear that the author has a vested interest in the presentation of
the past. Standpoint theory confirms that voices like these – that do not try to force a
clinical distance between author and historical subject – matter; indeed, the authors’
closeness to their subjects lends them more credibility and expertise because of that
closeness.
An editor at a publishing house, academic or otherwise, might suggest that this
lack of objectivity makes the books seem amateur, but standpoint theory insists that there
is no such thing as a neutral account, and furthermore, no such thing as neutrality in
analysis. Feminist historians and feminist theory have spearheaded the inclusion of
alternative accounts and histories into the canon. As DuPlessis and Snitow have said in
their work, The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices from Women’s Liberation,
Critics have asked us why we chose to collect first person accounts. Why do we
place so much stock in witness testimony? Where, for example, is the context,
the critical distance, the theory to make these materials intelligible? What is the

50
status of these memoirs as documentation of the past? Did we editors have the
proper skepticism about the truth claims implied in all firsthand reporting? One
cannot simply, innocently ‘see,’ then transparently ‘tell.’ Instead, we are shaped
by the languages and metaphors we use, and we all see through lenses that are a
shared property of our times; whenever we tell what we see, that telling is
influenced by ways of seeing that past struggles over interpretation have
established. We enter this discursive space as actors, shapers of language, and
potential interpreters ourselves, but the very idea of an experiencing self is
constantly changing, and subjectivity is a piece of history constantly in the
making. … [We must] change how we read such reports, the questions we ask of
them, the authority we grant to them, and our idea of what they can and cannot
give us. [First hand accounts], like all other texts, require critical reading; they
are not mere collections of information… [and the results are works] that can be
seen as both primary and secondary source material (p. xxii-xxiii).
A more useful approach to analysis of these particular self-published works would be to
accept that impartial accounts do not exist, to celebrate author closeness, and read them
with a careful eye. By pairing the theses of standpoint theorists with the methodology of
microhistory, this dissertation seeks to understand how self-published authors assert their
authority over their given subjects and examine the ways in which they promote and
declare their own expertise.

Collection and Analysis
The Problems of Studying Amazon

51
Traditional mechanisms for book discovery (for librarians or other interested
parties) are not necessarily useful to the Kindle-user/Amazon ebook consumer. To the
uninformed browsing public that visit Amazon’s website, the metadata of self-published
books can be very misleading or confusing. Bowker Books in Print only necessarily
charts and catalogs books with assigned ISBNs. Authors who upload their ebooks to
Amazon may opt to purchase an ISBN for their title, but they are not necessarily required
to do so. These titles, without ISBNS, are organized by Amazon’s ASINs (Amazon
Standard Identification Number). ASINs are “are unique blocks of 10 letters and/or
numbers that identify items” (Amazon.com: Help: What are UPCs, EANs, ISBNs, and
ASINs?, para. 6). They are proprietary product identifiers; they are not searchable on
other databases and can only be discovered through Amazon. ASINs are assigned to
“almost every product” on Amazon, not only books, and if a self-publishing author
chooses to purchase an ISBN, his book’s ASIN will be “the same as the ISBN number”
(Amazon.com: Help: What are UPCs, EANs, ISBNs, and ASINs?, para. 6).
Furthermore, Amazon complicates easy discovery of self-published works by
allowing authors to choose their own publishing house titles. When an author uploads
their book to the Amazon website, they must choose the name of a publisher. Because
these authors are not affiliated with any mainstream publishing house, they often make up
names of nonexistent publishing houses, use their own name, or may simply type in
“Amazon” with the perspective that Amazon.com is indeed the agency making their book
available to the broader public. Some prolific self-publishing authors have created their
own familiar imprint for their customers’ ease, and publishing “houses” that specialize in
the promotion of certain genre authors or public domain reprints (or both, in the case of

52
Doma Publishing) have created their own Amazon pages (Amazon, Doma publishing
house, 2013). Determining reprint titles or their new publishers can be difficult to the
unfamiliar reader, and a handy neologism to describe this messy digital marketplace is
the “reprint jungle” (Bradley, Fulton, Helm, & Pittner, 2011). The public cannot
necessarily know what the name of any of these selected publishing houses means; a
publishing house name on a Kindle book’s copyright page can represent a single author
publishing their sole work, but it can also represent a small organization of editors, reprinters, and authors creating a business in Amazon’s Kindle store.
In the event that Amazon customers seeking self-published histories know and
understand the difficulties of discoverability on the website, they must still address the
issue of finding self-published books in Amazon’s search engine, particularly when the
books appear at a very low ranking on the pages. Self-published books, because they
exist outside of the traditional agency-publishing house model, are not filtered into the
traditional reviewing systems. This can be a real problem for discovery for readers (and,
naturally, for authors). Ted Heller, in a recent piece for Salon titled, “The future is no
fun: Self-publishing is the worst,” explained that while he was unhappy with the
traditional publishing model, trying to convince a professional reviewer to read his selfpublished book was impossible. Although Heller was a traditionally published author
prior to his foray into self-publishing, and he had good reviews on his previous works, he
could not find a way to break into the traditional reviewing system. He complained,
I have no idea what’s worse: writing books that don’t ever get published, or
writing books that get published but don’t ever get read, or writing emails that

53
don’t ever get read to people about books that don’t ever get published and won’t
ever get read (Heller, 2013, Salon, para. 19).
Like so much of other Internet content, the lack of reviewers and connective tissue (in the
form of links or browsing category diversity) can prevent Amazon users from finding this
material due to its low ranking on Amazon’s search pages.

Finding Self-Published Histories
This work circumvents the problems of discovery of self-published books in two
ways. It utilizes the Amazon Indie store, and it studies the names of the publishing
houses to ensure their status as self-published works. The Amazon Indie store exists to
promote self-published titles that have been uploaded to the KDP store. Amazon
explains on its website, “ ‘Indie’ is hard to define, but anything cool, creative, and
different is ‘indie’… [and the] Kindle Indie Bookstore is a unique experience in the
literary world, a place to discover the next great authors and their books” (Amazon, 2013,
Kindle Indie Books, para. 1). These books are not widely reviewed the way a
mainstream book would be highlighted and reviewed in the press, and although their
presence in the indie store promotes them to another tier of publicity than others, they
typically have fewer than 20 user-generated reviews.
Additionally, the Amazon advanced search function allows users to find books
according to publisher. In many cases, self-publishing authors will list “Amazon” or
“Amazon.com” as their publisher, acting on the belief that Amazon (understandably) is
the agent responsible for getting their content to market. Determining self-published
books after using Amazon’s advanced search function is not difficult; their pages are

54
often missing metadata that would be found on other traditionally published works and
they have very few reviews (as Heller has indeed complained). Self-published author
pages are often not polished or clearly defined, and cover art may be missing or
amateurish. Searching for “memoir,” “history,” or “local history,” in Amazon’s
advanced search with “Amazon” or “Amazon.com” listed as the publisher, yields many
self-published results.

Analysis and Output
The following chapters commit to a close reading of just four texts, with one
chapter dedicated to each individual book, followed by a single comparative chapter that
considers each work’s editorial quality, discoverability, and accessibility. In this
dissertation I argue that such a small sample is necessary for the truest and fullest
comprehension of these materials. Also, and in line with a microhistorical methodology,
it does not aggregate data on self-published histories and does not study those that are
created on other self-publishing websites (like Lulu.com) or outside the country
(including Amazon.uk, Amazon.ca, etc.). Not that such an aggregation should not be
attempted or that a wider net should not be cast in later research, but an idiographic focus
is appropriate for this current study given that microhistorical analysis in the style of
Ginzburg (1980, 1986, 1993, 2012) or Davis (1983, 1992) would satisfy a gap in the
literature and represent the first study of its kind on this topic. Microhistory complicates,
complements, and helps aggregate studies of this kind by raising new questions and
refining points of analysis for future work.

55
The sources for analysis are limited to family/personal histories or memoirs and
local histories, and the works that are explored through close reading in this dissertation
have been hand selected in order to ensure variety. The books considered here are Tails
of the Prairie: My Life as a Small Town Veterinarian in Wyoming by Robert Baldwin,
Reflections of an Octogenarian by Betty Brown Hayes, The History of New Mexico High
School Football Volume I: The First 100 Years 1892-1992 by Dan Ford, and GROWING
UP ON A WISCONSIN FARM IN THE 1920’S AND 1930’S [sic] by Donna Hutter.
These sources were selected in the Amazon Kindle store for variety and readerly interest,
and to accommodate Ginzburg’s belief that historians necessarily follow lines of thought
and discover sources that interest them (2012, Threads and Traces: True False Fictive,
Kindle Location 4622).
Two of the works are memoirs, namely, Tails of the Prairie: My Life as a Small
Town Veterinarian in Wyoming and Reflections of an Octogenarian, but Reflections has a
particularly autobiographical bent, and covers most of one woman’s life story at
Wellesley college and in urban New York, whereas Tails of the Prairie focuses on one
man’s remembrances of his work as a veterinarian (and relationship to his community in
that role) only in the 1950s and 1960s in rural northeast Wyoming. While both works
place the author/narrator at the center of the storylines, one features and highlights the
narrator’s interactions with the greater community and region, and the other follows a
much more internalized line of thought, and reads more like the truth-telling of one
person’s private life story.
The other two works are works of history; GROWING UP ON A WISCONSIN
FARM IN THE 1920’S AND 1930’S [sic], hereafter referred to as Growing up on a

56
Wisconsin Farm, is Donna Hutter’s family history, created from oral history and the
retelling of family stories, and The History of New Mexico High School Football, Volume
I: The First 100 Years, 1892 – 1992 (hereafter referred to as The History of New Mexico
High School Football), a sports enthusiast’s in-depth local history of high school football
at public and Indian schools in the state. Both works have greater distance between the
author and subject than Tails of the Prairie and Reflections of an Octogenarian, but
Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm is an intimate portrait of a family living in
hardscrabble times in a rural place, and The History of New Mexico High School Football
is an amateur historian’s attempt at a dutifully curated local sports history, and is
expressly written with the intention of serving a broad community of readers.
The four books explored here all deserve close analysis and clue-based reading;
such a methodology is the only way to reveal the interesting new threads they add to the
historical tapestry. Certainly other methods of analysis should follow this small-scale
investigation, and many clues (notably those related to publication and production) have
not been pursued in this work. Because the process of searching for materials and
determining publishing house/authorship can be haphazard and relay contradictory or
confusing metadata, it follows that creating a large-scale summary analysis of this new
field would also be very confusing and difficult to create, and it will not be attempted
here. Le Roy Ladurie famously said that historians often fall into two camps:
parachutists and truffle hunters. This work will be an exercise in truffle hunting and thus
filling a gap in the field. Indeed, rich descriptions of self-published historical writings are
badly needed and cannot be offered by scholars working in aggregate numbers,
maintaining nomothetic approaches, and dropping from those proverbial ‘parachutes.’

57
Through an in-depth analysis of historical self-publications, a clearer image of the
contemporary publishing landscape can be gleaned, an image that will benefit readers,
collectors, archivists, and librarians across disciplines. The following chapters thus offer
an in-depth analysis of four self-published works, the first of which addresses the
contribution of personal storytelling and memoir to offer depth and understanding to local
history.

58
CHAPTER 3 – TAILS OF THE PRAIRIE

Figure 1. Digital Cover of Tails of the Prairie: My Life as a Small-Town Veterinarian in
Wyoming.

Synopsis and Overview
Tails of the Prairie: My Life as a Small-Town Veterinarian in Wyoming is a
collection of anecdotes by Robert A. Baldwin that are dated between 1949 and 1964 and
refer to events in Sundance and Gillette, Wyoming. Baldwin, in his “About the Author”
section at the end of the book, explains that he studied veterinarian medicine at Michigan
State College after his service in the Pacific theater, and in 1964 left Wyoming for
Colorado and eventually settled on the east coast. Baldwin’s memoir, besides being a
collection of professional stories separated by chapters (most chapters are quite short;
they focus on one storyline each) conveys a history of small town life in rural Wyoming
and fosters in the reader a sense of time and place that would be missed by professional
historians and current historiographical trends.

59
32 of these stories are centered in Sundance, the hometown of Harriet Baldwin,
Robert’s wife. Robert explains that they decided to purchase a drugstore in town (of
which there were only two) and to enter into a veterinary practice and partnership with
his brother-in-law and his wife who both already lived there. The Baldwins stayed in
Sundance for four and a half years, and according to Robert Baldwin, during that stint
Sundance was home to only 800 people (Kindle Location 120). Although Sundance has
only swelled to more than 1100 people since Baldwin’s stay there, the center of the town
has not shifted with time or to accommodate growth or change; it is still the county seat
of Crook County, situated at the foot of Sundance mountain near the edge of the Black
Hills.
Gillette is the focus of 22 of Baldwin’s chapters, and these individual stories all
describe a Gillette that predates the 1970s boom when uranium, oil, and coal mining
brought a relatively large influx of settlers to the region. The Gillette of Baldwin’s
stories predates this migration, and had only 5,000 people, and Baldwin described it as
“basically a ‘cow town,’” but today the city has nearly 30,000 citizens, and in his
introduction to his Gillette stories, even Baldwin noted the “tremendous changes
[coming] a few years down the road” (Kindle Locations 3627-3628). Baldwin moved to
Gillette in 1955 and settled on a ten-acre farm outside of town for more than nine years
before he and his family left Wyoming for good.
Stylistically, Baldwin’s memoirs are not original. The sweet, small-scale, and
otherwise “cozy” episodic memoir of a country veterinarian has had great success with
the reading public. In 1972, James Herriot (the pen name of James Alfred Wight)
published All Creatures Great and Small, the first of several in a series based on the early

60
years of his work as a country veterinary surgeon in Yorkshire, a rural agricultural
community in Northern England. His books have sold over 80 million copies, influenced
the creation of a popular community center in Yorkshire, and led to the creation of both a
movie starring Anthony Hopkins and a BBC television show of the same name as his
flagship work (“World of James Herriot,” 2015”). Herriot’s stories are short and episodic
and they read similarly to Baldwin’s work; All Creatures Great and Small is comparable
to Tails of the Prairie in length, and it has 65 chapters compared to Baldwin’s 52. Like
Baldwin’s work, the stories of All Creatures Great and Small often convey Herriot’s two
typical reactions to his patients’ owners: frustration with constant second-guessing from
local farmers with their own brand of frontier-style medicine, and pleasure at having
determined a solution to a problem.
Although Baldwin’s work reads like a memoir, it is, in fact, a very useful
contribution to the history of veterinary medicine in the United States. Scholars like
Boyd have lamented that the history of American veterinary medicine has been largely
mistreated and poorly assembled by veterinary libraries (Boyd, 2011), and because many
“veterinary schools are no longer in existence and veterinary associations… are defunct,”
a great deal of literature about the realities of early veterinary practice has gone missing
or is otherwise inaccessible (p. 8). Even memoirs that are colored by Baldwin’s own
personal life and human perspective fill a gap in an incomplete literature.
Local color, personal and professional relationships, and Baldwin’s own family
story are carefully woven into the fabric of each story. This volume is a unique text
because while it is perhaps not dissimilar from other memoirs in the medical or veterinary
profession (with a focus on unusual cases or episodes), the underlying theme is the

61
hardship of living and conducting a veterinary practice in rural Northeast Wyoming. The
unique or recognizable elements of the region and its people set it apart.
Additionally, as a veterinarian, Baldwin offers an unusual perspective as a
memoirist and an amateur historian of this region. While he serves the ranching
community and their animals, he is an outsider to their profession and often notes the
idiosyncrasies of their character. Local characters are often described humorously, but
sometimes disdainfully, and whether it is Baldwin’s education or his outsider status
(while his wife, Harriet was from Wyoming and is the reason for their time in Gillette
and Sundance, Baldwin himself is from the area in and around Fitchburg, Massachusetts)
that sets him apart is unclear. Regardless, Baldwin often describes his patients’ owners
as “Westerners” and often takes care to talk about unifying character traits, like their
“‘funny’ sense of humor—some funnier than others” (Kindle Location 4359). To
Baldwin, the “Western sense of humor” livens up everyday experiences, and, as he
describes it, “Westerners” are quick to laugh at themselves and each other, goodnaturedly.
Much of Baldwin’s stories arc around a veterinary problem that would be
encountered by such a doctor in a rural setting; stories about troubles with livestock like
difficult calving (similar to Herriot) and vaccination for herds are typical. Baldwin’s
expertise is conveyed regularly but casually; he explains to the reader what sleeping
sickness or pine needle abortion is simply and in a straightforward matter so that they
may understand the full sense of emergency or veterinary procedure. The style of writing
conveys a sense that Baldwin assumes his audience will be made up of laypeople. For
example, while describing an episode of bloat (a very common affliction that strikes

62
cattle and sheep) in a flock of sheep he treated, Baldwin takes an aside from his story to
explain:
Bloat is an excessive accumulation of gas in the first compartment of a ruminant’s
stomach. Unlike humans and most other animals, which have simple or onecompartment stomachs, ruminants, such as sheep and cattle, have stomachs with
four compartments. They are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and
abomasum. In its most devastating form, bloat can occur as a result of sheep or
cattle grazing on legumes, such as clover or alfalfa. If these forages are eaten
when wet, the incidence of bloat is higher than if they are eaten dry. Among other
changes, gas accumulates until there is enough pressure on the lungs to suffocate
an animal. Bloat, therefore, is always an emergency (Kindle Location 365).
The story arcs that Baldwin takes care to describe often focus on such a problem, and
explanatory asides like this one appear regularly. In this particular chapter, “Grown Men
Can Cry,” Baldwin’s critical point is that bloat, when it takes hold of much of a flock or
herd, can be financially devastating to a small-scale rancher. The anecdote still focuses
on the veterinary episode, but the aside informs the reader of Baldwin’s expertise, lets the
reader understand the full implications of the emergency, and feel how worrisome and
problematic it is for the people involved. In this way, Baldwin gives the reader the sense
of immediacy of the issue, relays his mastery of his field, and causes the reader to
sympathize with both the discomfort of the animal and the livelihood of the rancher.
It is this connection to time and place, and to the people who lived and made up
the communities in and around Gillette and Sundance, that makes Tails of the Prairie so
significant as a local history. Baldwin shares his vision of rural Wyoming in the 1950s

63
and 1960s with readers who might not understand how far behind that region lagged in
infrastructure and technology. He conveys how isolated people, particularly women,
might have been, and gives the reader many opportunities to consider a full range of
hardships that must have come with such remoteness. Baldwin’s perspective – as
educated outsider – colors his understanding of events, and as such, highlights the
differences between him and his patients’ owners. As standpoint theory suggests,
Baldwin’s position and point of view offer a vision of the past that lend his history a
richness and detail that other histories could not. Ultimately, Tails of the Prairie sets a
scene that highlights social interactions and everyday experiences in Gillette and
Sundance, all of which would be lost without Baldwin’s unique angle, and would
contribute to any collection on the region’s history. A close, microhistorical reading,
reveals the difficulties of daily life, Baldwin’s sense of the social fabric of the region, and
uncovers themes of women’s hardships and family labor.

Rural Hardships in Wyoming in the Mid-Century
Capturing the shared hardships of rural living in the 1950s and 1960s in Wyoming
is a critical tenant of Baldwin’s histories. The lack of technology, lack of infrastructure,
and extreme difficulties associated with the weather and climate frame a great deal of the
stories throughout the book, and Baldwin takes great pains to situate Gillette and
Sundance’s developmental history in a larger American context. By highlighting the
unsophisticated infrastructure, Baldwin not only establishes the scene, he also so forces
the reader to sympathize with the difficulties of communication that today would be

64
relatively effortless. Indeed, in the introductory chapter of the book, Baldwin urges the
reader to,
…keep in mind the primitive nature of the roads and services at that time. Private
telephone lines, kept up by ranchers and ranch hands, terminated at a central
manually operated switchboard, owned and operated by a private individual.
Connections to Mountain Bell, some thirty miles away, was also through the
operator. Two-way radios or radio telephones were just being tried out in 1951.
The only people who could afford them had sources of high, steady income. REA,
or rural electrification, was just coming into the area. Before it was completed,
most ranch homes used a variety of mechanisms to generate electric power,
ranging from diesel and gasoline powered generators to the lowly wind charger,
which stored in batteries the electricity they produced. Those who were unable to
afford these luxuries went to bed early, or used lamps, lanterns or flashlights. I did
more than a few cesareans on heifers under the glare of my pickup’s headlights or
while someone held a lantern over the animal’s back (Kindle Location 135).
Baldwin clearly hopes that these signposts of technological advancement, and their slow
reach into his area, will further indicate to the reader the isolation of the region from the
rest of the country and the day-to-day realities of communication between locals.
Difficulties communicating on the phone certainly emphasize the rudimentary technology
of the area, but they also speak to the sense of remote detachment locals might have felt.
Although Gillette received a telephone exchange in 1910 and electricity in 1915, the rest
of Campbell County remained far behind the advances in Cheyenne and Laramie County
(Hein, “Campbell County”).

65
Further, and immediately in the introduction, Baldwin makes sure to describe the
lack of basic infrastructure (particularly paved roads) in Sundance. With the on-call
demands of his work, and his satellite clinic in Weston County, daily road travel was
required, and with the weather and topsoil native to the area, this could bring quite a lot
of difficulties. He explains that he had to carefully select trucks for purchase because
only they could be depended on for use on the poor dirt roads or in “gumbo” – a kind of
silt that is native to Western prairies that becomes nonporous and adhesive in the rain.
Ultimately, like other locals, Baldwin eventually gave in to alternative modes of
transportation, and he would hire pilots, ride horseback, walk, or take sleighs pulled by
teams of horses to reach his patients and their owners.
Reaching out the reader in this way, telling him or her to “keep in mind” the slow
march of change and transformation, and by highlighting his difficulties from this period
again and again, Baldwin fosters a comparative connection with the reader. The reader
will necessarily think that Baldwin’s reality was a far cry from today’s increasingly
interconnected world. Baldwin means to speak about a pre-industrial, pre-mining Gillette,
to give a historical sense to what is still an otherwise sparsely populated place, without
many who would note or document such a time period.

Baldwin as Outsider and Observer
While the focus on shared hardships color these stories, Baldwin makes it clear
throughout that he sees himself as an outsider and otherwise apart from the community he
serves. This outsider status is stated and repeatedly reinforced throughout the book in
two important and recurring ways: through Baldwin’s assertion of advanced medical

66
veterinary knowledge over the ranchers he serves (and corresponding disdain for folksy
and/or backwards remedies), and by his humility as a greenhorn/tenderfoot in the area.
While Baldwin often takes pains to prove to the reader that he has the expertise on the
subject of animals and animal wellness, Gillette and Sundance locals do often know
better with regards to travel, weather, and local conditions. Baldwin’s shock regarding
the volatility of the weather conditions (and the compounding problems that occur with
lack of infrastructure in such conditions) appears frequently throughout the book, and the
book has a key theme of his ineptitude for anticipating or understanding those conditions.
The most important examples that Baldwin brings up to describe his naive
tenderfoot status are two chapters simply titled “Gumbo: Episode 1” and Gumbo:
Episode 2.” Gumbo is often utilized as a catch-all term for porous clay soil, sometimes
likened to bentonite, and it can be found all throughout the Missouri river basin region
but notably in Eastern Montana and Northern Wyoming. Gumbo becomes extremely
sticky when wet and bonds firmly as it dries (particularly to boots, tires, or anything else
traveling across it). Baldwin introduces the chapter by explaining that gumbo is a
“substance of onerous properties, the likes of which this Easterner had never encountered.
It took one car engine and one four-wheel-drive Jeep clutch assembly to give me a real
understanding of gumbo’s power and might” (Kindle Locations 496-497).
On one particularly far road trip to Bayhorse, Montana, Baldwin was prompted by
his patients’ owners to stay for the night rather than travel on the recently rained on soil.
At the time, Baldwin had only a two-wheel drive, six-cylinder Studebaker, and he was
fresh out of graduate school. Although he noted that the people he had visited all had
four-wheel drive vehicles of some kinds, particularly Jeeps, he thought that he could

67
make it across the ranch and then out to the blacktop, and he was worried about getting
home late at night, as the drive was 120 miles. Although the ranchers’ pressing concern
for his drive startled him, Baldwin would not be dismayed, and his response was to
question their advice: “I looked at him quizzically. It hadn’t rained that much and the
ground was drying out rapidly. I did notice with some wonder, however, a couple of other
heads nodding agreement to the rancher’s statement” (Kindle Location 511).
To this point in Gumbo: Episode 1, Baldwin has framed the chapter with an air of
foreboding, and made it very clear that he was in the wrong to question the good advice
of locals. Indeed, early in this particular storyline, Baldwin refers to himself as a
“greenhorn right out of school,” as if to highlight his naiveté (Kindle Location 504). As
he leaves the rancher’s home, he noted that,
the road was kind of greasy or slippery in places for the first ten miles or so, but
otherwise it seemed okay. ‘Drying out real good,’ I said to myself. ‘Wonder what
those folks at the dinner table were worried about?’ (Kindle Locations 521-528).
The disaster that predictably follows catches Baldwin only 10 miles away, with
his tires and fenders locked with gumbo buildup. After stopping and starting every mile
or so to dislodge the caked-on mud, he eventually realized he was trapped, and he waited
in his car for a time until he thought the weather would permit. The entire ordeal made
him feel nervous that he was stranded, covered in gumbo himself, and underprepared for
driving in that rural area. His wife, the local, upon hearing him enter the house, scolded
him for his late return that made her worry, but the moment she saw him filthy and
exhausted, she knew that he had been caught in the gumbo. The story arc, which began
with the locals’ warning, ended with a local’s sympathy and understanding.

68
The next chapter, which fast-forwards two years into the future, finds Baldwin
stymied while at a patient’s owner’s ranch. In the middle of calving season, when
Baldwin would occasionally work from the early morning until after midnight out on
house calls, he found himself trapped while the gumbo “was rolling” twenty miles away
from a blacktopped highway. While he says that he knew better than to travel in such
conditions (and he had already replaced his old sedan with a Jeep at that point), he still
put chains on and attempted to go out, fearful that delay would mean troubled deliveries
with his other patients (Kindle Location 584). Baldwin put chains on his tires, hoping
that this would improve his chances, but eventually he got stuck again, destroyed his
clutch, and had to hitchhike back to town (Kindle Location 611). Like the previous
chapter, Baldwin acquiesces to the locals’ knowledge in the end, and he closes with the
following: “Old-timers and homesteaders in the West have a saying about gumbo: ‘If you
will stick to the gumbo when it’s dry, it will stick to you when it’s wet’ ” (Kindle
Locations 632-633).
Two stories (indeed, whole chapters) dedicated to mud could certainly seem to be
overkill, and could weary a familiar, or even a familial, reader. Being receptive to this
plight may make or break the reader’s empathy – there is a threshold of what a reader is
willing to finish. While these episodes of car trouble in rural Wyoming in the 1950s and
1960s are, at face value, banal, they serve two powerful purposes in the greater memoir:
they drive home Baldwin’s earlier message of everyday hardship, and they speak to a
base of home-grown knowledge, one that rests on an intimacy with the landscape specific
only to locals; a situational awareness. If local history is meant to foster a connection to a
unique place and time, then wading through Baldwin’s chapters of inexperience achieves

69
just that. The contrast of Baldwin’s tenderfoot inexperience helps the reader understand
how vital that local knowledge was to functioning in daily life in rural Wyoming, and the
everyday problems give the reader a greater sense of place than any unusual anecdote that
might be worth telling for its exceptionalness.

Figure 2. Baldwin includes this photograph of himself in Western wear and captions it by
saying that “It is true that if I were practicing in my home state of Massachusetts, I would
be dressed differently” (Kindle Location 4026). Whether Baldwin sees himself as an
outsider or not, he does admit here to dressing like a local.

The owners of his patients are often the focal point of Baldwin’s stories, and
getting at a uniformity of character that is separate or distinct from his own personality is
an important part of understanding Baldwin himself; Baldwin creates and openly fosters
an “Othering” comparison throughout the work. Baldwin’s sense of outsider status is
mirrored back to him and performed in the “locals only” attitude he regularly encounters
in his practice, and this sentiment that is repeated often can vary from mildly suspicious
to openly hostile. While Baldwin does set himself as apart by showing his lack of local
environmental knowledge (and acknowledges the advanced knowledge of others in this
regard), he also takes great pains to describe himself as an academically educated

70
outsider. In this way, Baldwin establishes a scene of competing principles, values, and
ideologies in the small community he means to describe.
The easiest and most straightforward path to establishing oneself as an outsider in
an artistic or literary sense is to explain the mistreatment and suspicion and derision with
which one has been treated by locals. Indeed, Baldwin notes,
[w]hen we first arrived in Sundance, old and grizzled ranchers were afraid I
wouldn’t be able to do them much good at calving time ‘because you have to have
a long arm to reach inside an old cow and get the calf out.’ ” None of them
minded saying so either (Kindle Locations 1197-1207).
This rejection – of Baldwin’s education, his expertise, of himself – is not uncommon in
medical or veterinary memoirs. Indeed, All Creatures Great and Small opens with a
chapter that describes such a person, an “Uncle Dinsdale,” who scoffs at Herriot’s
knowledge (“...you can ‘ave your book learning. Give me experience every time.”), his
youth, and his outsider status, and after two hours of watching Herriot struggle with
delivering a calf, even says, “You’re about beat, young man” (p. 5).
In his own stories, Baldwin is often the victim of what he calls the “Wyoming
Stare.” This literal local gaze – one that in these stories can be defined as distrustful of
Baldwin’s moves, decisions, and beliefs as a young veterinarian from back East – made
Baldwin feel sized up, segregated, or otherwise apart and distinct from his community.
Indeed, early in one story about Baldwin’s treatment of a cow, he described a feeling of
being measured at face value by John Lambeth, a patients’ owner, upon their first
meeting:

71
As he got closer, I extended my hand, expecting him to do the same. Instead, he
stopped, looked me up and down in a manner I used to call the Wyoming Stare
and said, ‘Are you the vet?’ Then after a second or two, still staring, ‘You don’t
look old enough to know anything.’ … So I laughed a little and asked, ‘What
seems to be the problem. If I don’t think I can help, I’ll tell you.’ I really thought
that was fair enough, without directly responding to his observation. Not to be
distracted so easily he went on, ‘I came over here to see Dr. Port, but your wife
tells me he’ll be gone for another day. I know he’d know what to do.’ My
patience began to wear thin. We were standing there in the hot sun, and this guy
was not backing off a bit (Kindle Locations 1197-1207).
While Herriot’s similar story in All Creatures Great and Small has a relatively happy
ending – the calf survives, Uncle Dinsdale is rightfully put in his place for his hours of
public schadenfreude – Baldwin’s tale does not end with a great success or his
vindication. Baldwin tended to John Lambeth’s bull, which was suffering from an acute
form of anaplasmosis and the severe anemia that results from it. In order to provide the
bull with desperately needed supplementary blood, Baldwin had to catch and draw a
gallon from an untamed range cow, something he confesses took about an hour of
chasing and led to him being dragged in the hot sun by a rope. While he admitted that
doing this kind of work meant that he
was not the picture of the clean and well manicured veterinarian you see in
advertisements… [i]t was fun at the time. Real emergency veterinary medicine—
saving an animal’s life like I was trained to do, even though it was not in a nice
clean clinic. Neat! (Baldwin, Kindle Locations 1290-1292).

72
After tending to Lambeth’s bull and saving its life, Baldwin received no payment for his
efforts, and indeed, sent months of unanswered bills to John Lambeth. Inevitably,
Lambeth returned to town and saw Baldwin again, where he confronted Baldwin very
publicly and with great hostility. Lambeth explained that several other cows had
exhibited the same symptoms as the bull, and six weeks after the transfusion the cow that
had given blood did not do well. Baldwin explained to Lambeth that anaplasmosis can
infect herds swiftly and can cause great devastation, but Lambeth would not hear
Baldwin or acquiesce to his veterinary expertise. Lambeth eventually said,
The bull’s all right, but the cow died. Don’t know why I should pay you. I …
reckon that taking that blood and all that wrassling around had something to do
with her dying, so I’m not going to pay you, and you can quit sending any more
bills (Kindle Locations 1322-1323).
Interestingly, Baldwin does not press upon his dislike of this man or any kind of
contempt for him throughout the end of the chapter. He notes, very matter-of-factly, at
the end of the chapter “[w]e finally took the fifty dollars [owed from the procedure] off
our income tax. I believe we made all of $8,000 that year.” (Kindle Location 1314). He
notes several times throughout the chapter that Lambeth had a new Cadillac Deville
rather than a truck, a horse, or hired hands – and in so doing seems to imply that his
money would be better spent doing something else – but he never explicitly criticizes
Lambeth for this. If anything, Baldwin seems to highlight the incongruence of Lambeth’s
toney Cadillac with his dirty overalls, weakened (as if to say hungry) stature, and filthy
beard.

73
This is not to say that Baldwin does not employ disdain throughout the work.
While Baldwin is often the victim of dislike in his own stories, and he notes the wariness
with which locals treat him, he describes them with little touches of contempt throughout
the work in return. Baldwin does not take great pains to describe a Western way of
speaking, accent, or tongue, but he does note that most locals or those he would describe
as Westerners mispronounce his title, calling his work “vetinary” medicine or referring to
him as a “vetinarian” – a note of illiteracy Baldwin repeatedly highlights. Stressing this
ignorance is indicative of Baldwin’s desire to point out the obvious difference between
himself and his patients’ owners.
That the Westerners Baldwin encountered were wary of his veterinary expertise
and more accustomed to relying on their own folk medicine techniques may speak to a
larger trend toward the professionalization of veterinary medicine in the 20th century.
Jones’ work, Valuing Animals: Veterinarians and Their Patients in Modern America,
tracks the history of the veterinary profession in the United States, and in the work, Jones
notes that early “veterinarians” developed from stable work positions, like farriers,
farmhands, and horse grooms. She notes that,
many individuals who doctored animals professionally obtained their training
through experience or apprenticeship, as did physicians and lawyers. Hanging
one’s shingle out as a “veterinarian” required no legal sanction, merely an ability
to persuade potential customers that one’s services were worth the price (p. 11).
These early practitioners were often suspect, and Jones notes that there were many
stereotypes about these individuals as “duplicitous,” “vulgar,” and drunk (p. 11).

74
As veterinary medicine and science became a professional field, with colleges,
journals, and professional associations, and as the field became increasingly tied to
livestock health and food safety regulations during the early twentieth century, these
certified and educated veterinarians often faced pushback from ranchers. Jones explains
that, “livestock producers who were their clients did not always welcome the scrutiny and
restrictive laws that the veterinarian represented,” and she gives many examples of
ranchers who were quick to announce their sentiments. Jones notes one New Jersey
dairyman in particular who said, ‘We know just as well as a veterinarian whether our
cattle are sick or not… [and I] do not want to see the New Jersey cattle in the hands of the
veterinaries’ (p. 63).
Baldwin recalled such an incident outside of Sundance in February 1952. He had
been tending to a Brown Swiss milk cow belonging to Ned Smiley and his son Paul, and
he explains (and to some degree, justifies), Ned Smiley’s suspicion over utilizing
veterinarian medicine for his farm animals after a poor experience with a former
practitioner. Ned Smiley, in his nervousness over losing this costly registered animal,
spoke endlessly to Baldwin about how he did not need a veterinarian for the longest time,
and that he had been able to
…do all this kind of ‘vetinary work,’ but since he got the ‘arthereetus’ he couldn’t
work inside a cow like he used to. ‘Besides, when you got your hand and arm
inside and they strain, the pain and numbness finally make it so you can’t stand it
anymore,’ he volunteered. ‘You fellows give them a shot in the tail so they can’t
strain. That’s a big advantage.’ I didn’t say anything to his observations (Kindle
Location 1356).

75
As Ned continued to discuss how veterinary work had been done when he was a young
man, “before REA or telephone or anything like that,” (Kindle Location 1356) his son,
Paul, began to defend Baldwin by teasing his dad mildly, asking if girls were the same
way back when too. This diffused the tension somewhat – Ned Smiley was able to halt
his pointed language long enough to laugh at himself – and then Baldwin explained that
he had given caesarean sections to milk cows in places without electricity as if to satisfy
Ned, but then he moved on to describe the procedure.
Stylistically, Baldwin repeats this subtle discrediting of antagonistic locals (or, at
least, what he perceived and then later described as antagonistic locals) many times
throughout the book. Their antagonism of Baldwin while he is at work – their
questioning of his expertise with their own folk knowledge – seems to irk Baldwin. He
brings up so many instances of this that it becomes an important characteristic to the
work. As Baldwin represents a new generation of certified and educated veterinarians,
separate and distinct from the farriers and cowleeches of earlier days (Jones; Mulder), his
story also fits into a greater arc about the change of his own profession.

The Resilient Character of Western Women
Another important theme in Tails of the Prairie – particularly in Baldwin’s
analysis of the “Western” character he chips away at – is the role of women in this rural
part of the United States. At no point does Baldwin say that it is his intention to
understand women in Wyoming or to define their everyday lives for the reader, but in
individual chapters that frame around a woman character (always an owner of a patient,
or sometimes with mention of his own wife’s relationship to those clients), he often gets

76
at or reveals a unifying experience shared by women in the region that is born out of a
hardscrabble landscape, intrinsic poverty, and long periods of isolation. Women
characters (ranchers or wives of ranchers) regularly assist Baldwin in barnyard surgeries
or wrangling animals. There is a hardiness that Baldwin highlights and celebrates,
whether this is an intentional thematic element or not.
Admiration is at the forefront of Baldwin’s description of women residents in
Northeast Wyoming. In his first year of practice in Wyoming, Baldwin noticed that
pregnant cattle that ate needles from local pine trees could experience spontaneous
abortions, and this could lead to disastrous effects for a herd and financial devastation for
ranchers. While this was an astute observation from Baldwin, the owner of the cattle
with the first case of spontaneous pine needle abortion was an integral part of Baldwin’s
early assessment of what he calls “Western women.” Rene Fromm, a rancher with a very
small operation, noticed that many of her pregnant cows had calved prematurely, and at
her ranch just eight miles outside of town, was having some difficulty understanding its
cause. Led by Fromm, Baldwin rode horseback through feet of snow to uncover
discarded placenta and dead calves, and then he watched Fromm and her hired farmhand
gather cows into chutes for blood testing. After gathering samples and specimens,
Baldwin urged Fromm to keep her eye on the cattle, and he asked if there was a locale
from which to keep a vantage point. He pressed,
‘What about an old homestead shack or something?’ I went on. ‘I’m living in
what was the homestead shack,’ came Rene’s lighthearted reply, ‘ and if this
keeps up, it’ll be as vacant as some of these others around the country.’ I smiled

77
to myself and thought: these Western women can sure handle adversity (Kindle
Location 1508).
Women ranching on their own has been studied in frontier and post-statehood
Wyoming, most notably in Garceau’s The Important Things of Life: Women, Work, and
Family in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, 1880-1929. Garceau notes in the work that the
terms “ranching” and “homesteading” were often used interchangeably, and proving up
on a claim often meant the management of animal herds. Women often ranched sheep
(beef cattle ranching was typically a male sphere), and they were often assisted in a larger
family network. There were only a very few examples of women filing a land claim and
working that claim independently, without the help of a father, brothers, or husband’s
family (Garceau, 1997).
Independent women, those managing their own ranches (however small and
economically insignificant), like Fromm were rare, to hear Baldwin tell of it; isolation
appeared to be the greatest dilemma facing the women he encountered, and he noted
often how regularly women inquired after one another, with Robert Baldwin acting as the
middleman. While Harriet Baldwin was often the “face” of their veterinary practice at
their storefront (sometimes serving in roles as diverse as surgeon’s assistant to animal
wrangler to administrative assistant), she did not accompany Robert Baldwin out on
house calls. However, Robert often noted that she tried to keep touch with the women on
the periphery of town, and that she tried to nurture a social circle that was tenuous and
distant. Winter appeared to be a great hindrance to most social connections, and when
those who lived far away came to town for whatever needs they may have, relationships
had to be sustained or even reintroduced.

78
For example, upon seeing Silas McGovern, an old acquaintance, enter their
pharmacy storefront in the spring of their second year of practice, Harriet Baldwin did
not recognize the man, and after doing a “double-take,” she said,
‘Oh! Yes, I remember you now,” she said. “How is your wife?” Womenfolk out
there had a tendency to inquire about wives and kids, when there were any... Silas
had walked closer to them before he answered. “Oh, she wintered good,” came
the reply through his heavy beard. “We’ve had a lot of snow out there this winter.
This is the first time she’s been out since last fall. She’s downtown doing some
shopping (Kindle Locations 4163-4169).
Even in the ideal family situation, and even with the right supplies and materials,
isolation such as this in a rural place could be dispiriting or problematic for many
reasons. The female pioneer experience of the nineteenth century has been widely touted
as harsh and lonely (Armitage, 1987; Jameson, 1984; G. R. Davis, 1987; Cordier, 1997;
Myres, 1982; Patterson-Black, 1976; Stoeltje, 1975) in women’s studies and history, but
the experiences of women in the rural west in the mid-twentieth century is a field of
academic research that has been left fallow. Information that Baldwin can offer here –
even in asides such as these – is valuable to anyone interested in these daily life
experiences.
Baldwin does confirm that the isolation women faced could be a very brutal
hardship, and shares that in a story of Edgar and Mary Leadbetter who lived “on a kind of
poor man’s ranch… the place was just big enough to starve to death on” (5480). Their
fighting was notorious in Gillette, and Baldwin shares town gossip that Mary had been a
schoolteacher from “Back East” and (perhaps) was even a mail-order bride (Kindle

79
Location 5482). While Baldwin says that he cannot confirm that this was true, he does
say that he was witness to many fights between the two of them while he serviced their
animals, and that kind of fighting would be sure to raise suspicions amongst the
townspeople. On a trip to their farm to vaccinate some calves, he discovered that Mary
Leadbetter had been locked in their henhouse after an altercation with her husband, and
Baldwin released her after hearing her screaming from inside (Kindle Location 5495). In
another patient visit, Mary and Edgar brought their pet Boxer with a broken leg to
Baldwin’s offices. As they fought over the financial burden of setting the dog’s leg,
Baldwin had to separate them from physically fighting one another in the storefront, and
explained,“[about] the time he was ready to hit her, I said in no uncertain terms, ‘You’ll
have to settle this argument someplace else. It’s getting late and there’s going to be a lot
of work to get that leg set!’” (Kindle Location 5509). Eventually, Edgar Leadbetter
agreed to pay for the dog’s treatment in kind (with eggs), and Baldwin’s interactions with
this couple end there.
Although Baldwin does not tell of other first-hand incidents involving the
Leadbetters, he does share an interesting aside with information he had from another
medical practitioner in Gillette:
As for Edgar and Mary, I understood from our good friend, the optometrist, that
his family was supplied with eggs for service nearly the year round, for no sooner
had the payment for repair of Mary’s glasses been completed than they were
broken again—usually accompanied by a black eye. That went on for all the years
we lived there. Some folks thought it was comical at the time. Now we call it the

80
‘battered wife syndrome,’ and there are houses, other than chicken houses, for the
Marys of the country (Kindle Locations 5551-5555).
The story of the Leadbetters, and Baldwin’s recount of the small town chatter that
surrounded them, is framed with gossip and hearsay. Baldwin, rather than casting
judgment – by shaming Edgar, or offering support for women sufferers of abuse – seems
removed in his tone. Bringing the optometrist into this tale, and slipping in the aside at
the end of a sentence about Mary’s repeated black eyes, keeps a degree of distance from
this ugly story. Further, at the end of the chapter, he talks about the national situation and
the changed perception of domestic abuse, and taking this wider view pulls back from the
Leadbetter story even more. Why Baldwin might introduce a sensationalist story and
then pull away from it so definitively at the end is unclear, but he does confirm to the
reader that the isolation of rural Wyoming could prove to be perilous, and that sympathy
from other locals could be minimal or even nonexistent.

Situating Baldwin in his Perceived Social Sphere
The chapter on the Leadbetters, while primarily concerned with the spousal abuse
that Baldwin encountered and the complicated relationships he had with patients’ owners,
does speak to the background conversations he has with other medical professionals in
and around Northeast Wyoming. Asides like the details from the optometrist litter
Baldwin’s stories, and they provide necessary information about Baldwin’s own
occupancy/role in the particular social space he describes. Early on in Tails of the Prairie,
Baldwin makes it clear that he does see himself as a peer to other medical personnel in
the area. In his introduction, Baldwin explains that, “Medically, we were one big happy

81
family” (Kindle Location 191), and mutual support was often necessary with limited
medical experts in the area and limited material. Exchanges of material were common,
Baldwin explains:
Our practice would not afford the luxury of an X-ray machine because the times I
needed one were few and far between. When I did need one, Dr. Baughman (a
local general practitioner/family doctor) happily loaned his for use on small
animals and the county hospital had a large portable X-ray, which I used on
horses at the delivery platform at the hospital (Kindle Locations 191-195).
Baldwin’s relationship with Baughman was noted throughout the work – impromptu
lunches at the local diner counter peppered with conversation (and gossip) about shared
acquaintances were common – and it could certainly be described as a friendship of
equals. Baldwin never explicitly speaks to a comparable level of education between
these county MDs and his own veterinary license, nor does he ever state that higher
education differentiates social strata or class in the region, but any common reader would
infer such a theme.
Besides highlighting Baldwin’s own perceived social role and social circle in the
Gillette and Sundance area, his description of the relationship he had with other
physicians serves to clarify the need for their constant communication. The locals’ close
contact with animals often necessitated regular interaction and consultation among the
variety of health practitioners in the area. Ranchers often found themselves susceptible to
the diseases that their animals caught, and cooperation between practitioners prevented
outbreaks or other potentially widespread problems. Reliance on the expertise of others
was common, and teamwork viewed as a shared community good. Indeed, Baldwin

82
explains that occasionally medical doctors directly referred their patients to him for
disease identification:
… one of the MDs sent a patient of his to have me look at a lesion on her hand.
He wanted to confirm what he suspected, and I did. It was cowpox. In fact, she
caught the condition from her cow for which I had dispensed medication (Kindle
Locations 191-195).
Working in tandem clearly prevented the spread of viruses such as these and fostered a
hyperawareness of problems that could be community-wide. That it was so easy speaks
to the relative ease between practitioners, the education of local MDs to animal-related
illness, and the prevalence of zoonotic diseases in predominantly ranching communities
like those in Northeast Wyoming.
Understanding Baldwin’s perceived peer group and recognizing his desire to
separate himself from the ranchers he served in the work helps the reader see his vantage
point for this history. Tails of the Prairie, not unlike an oral history or memoir, also
indulges Baldwin’s desire to cement his legacy of self in Gillette and Sundance in the
1950s and 1960s. This is most clear in his description of his community service and in
interactions with the children of ranchers he served and their interest in his work.

Family Units and Family Labor in Tails of the Prairie
Baldwin notes that large families were common in the ranching communities he
served; children worked on their parents’ ranches and typically had regular interactions
with the animals they maintained on their land. As Baldwin provided most veterinary
care to animals in their home barns, children proved to be effective helpers, catching or

83
holding animals down, carrying hot water, fetching towels, or even preparing the work
area for surgery. Like women’s labor, children’s labor (often neglected in other histories)
has been described throughout Tails of the Prairie, and although it is not necessarily the
focus of any one storyline or chapter, its presence in the work, as an element of
understanding rural life, is critical. Children, as laborers on family ranches and farms,
were common throughout the 19th century, but as economies of scale reshaped
agribusiness in the 20th century, those unofficial/unpaid roles in the domestic economy
became fewer and farther between. By noting their presence in his work, and
highlighting how necessary they were to the functionality of these small-scale ranches,
Baldwin clues the reader in on this transitional period in Wyoming’s social and economic
history.
Small children were often enamored with Baldwin’s profession and his skill set; in
one storyline, a young girl from a large family who watched him perform surgery on a
cow with a tumor said that he was “just like a real doctor,” and he often noted siblings
whispering back and forth while they were witnesses to surgeries or vaccinations (Kindle
Locations 4978-4979). Their curiosity at Baldwin’s knowledge often meant that they
peppered him with questions while he worked. Baldwin, because he often stayed long
hours at patients’ owners’ homes, was regularly invited to eat a meal with the family, and
children could easily take that opportunity to ask him questions about his field, or the
problems with their animals. To Baldwin,
…it was truly a compliment when, over the years, Harriet and I witnessed a
procession of clients’ sons or daughters become part of the veterinary profession.

84
Somehow, we felt we were part of the reason for their making that choice (Kindle
Locations 5014-5016).
Baldwin’s work, ultimately, speaks to his desire to remember his time in Wyoming
and to provide readers with a snapshot of what life was like in that particular period and
region. That Baldwin’s work carefully relates the way people interacted with their
animals provides an additional prism for viewing this history; their worry and fretfulness
about the creatures they cared for extended beyond a concern over their livelihood. This
attachment, Baldwin clarifies, was best viewed in the house calls he made, and as
families saw his work to save their animals, they became invested in Baldwin as well. As
he says,
Years later, after leaving rural practice, I missed these kinds of calls. Now I know
why. In very personal, stressful situations, a special kind of bond was established
between the family members and me as the veterinarian. This can occur in the
office setting, also, but somehow not to the same degree as sitting at a man’s table
with his wife and kids. There you get the whole load [of worry…] the eyes, the
changed facial expressions, the shuffling of the feet, the reprimand of a kid who
really hasn’t done anything wrong, the sudden passing of the meat and the bread
and potatoes, even though it is obvious no one wants more. All those things
happen over and over again in a country practice, and you become a real part of
that family for years to come. You’re no longer just the vet. You have a stake in
that family’s life, and they have a piece of yours! (Baldwin, Kindle Locations
2201-2203).

85
Conclusion
Tails of the Prairie fits into a unique spot in the historiography of 20th century
Wyoming and the rural West. 19th century, frontier Wyoming loomed large in the
American imagination as a place of raw and beautiful landscapes unique to the West, and
as such, a great deal of historical writing has been dedicated to understanding that place
and its peoples. Much has been made of homesteading and pioneer life (Moulton, 2006;
Garceau-Hagen, 1997), U.S. military conflicts with Native Americans (Greene, 2003;
Lindmier, 2002), boom-and-bust lumber and coal mining towns (Gardner and Flores,
1989; Laurie, 1990), and cattle ranching and cowboy culture (Frink, 1954; Rollins, 1989;
Rollinson, 1948), but all of these histories tend to conclude at or before the period of
WWII. Scholars have been particularly mum regarding 20th century Wyoming history.
By comparison, the representative literature on the people and socio-cultural atmosphere
of the region in the 20th century seems lacking.
Tails of the Prairie reveals to its audience that small-town Wyoming, as late as the
1950s and 1960s, lacked a great many modern technologies and conveniences, and while
many rural hardships had abated across the United States, they still existed for Robert
Baldwin and his clientele. The owners of Baldwin’s patients had poor telephone
connections, unpaved roads, and many did not have electricity to their homes. They were
often isolated from one another during long winters, and as such, social networks and
relationships outside of families could be difficult to create and maintain. Family
members all had to contribute labor in order to manage functioning ranches. In this
regard, Baldwin creates a scene of rural Wyoming life in the mid-20th century that has
been largely invisible to the scholarly community.

86
That Baldwin paints such a detailed scene for his readers – covering everything
from community members’ attitudes toward spousal abuse to the weather – is what
makes Tails of the Prairie a valuable addition to the local history of the area. Further,
Baldwin’s role in that community, and his firsthand sense of time and place, gives him
unique authority to describe it. As Beckett says, in his work Writing Local History,
“ …the university historian studying states and nations may go no further than the
relative comfort of the national archives of this or other countries around the globe, the
local historian must come to terms with the importance of place, with understanding the
landscape, the street pattern, the buildings – from medieval churches to modern estate
housing – and the names” (John Beckett, Writing Local History, p. 3). As standpoint
theory confirms, it is because of Baldwin’s firsthand knowledge of the setting, time
period, and people, not in spite of it, that makes Tails of the Prairie such a valuable work.

CHAPTER 4 – REFLECTIONS OF AN OCTOGENARIAN
Synopsis and Overview
Betty Brown Hayes’ book, Reflections of an Octogenarian, is at times a memoir,
a feminist look at Wellesley College between 1946-1950, a frank discussion of mental
health care and awareness in New York City in the 1960s, and the work touches on
everything from opportunity for women on Wall Street to co-educational colleges to
domestic violence. This book, more than any of the other self-published works addressed
here, leans away from local history and towards the memoir end of the history spectrum,
and as a result it lends powerful insights to particular places, times, and social mores and
values, and was chosen as an identifiable memoir in this systematic and historiographic
work. Whereas Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm, explored in Chapter Six, is a history
of woman’s work in rural, impoverished America, this is a history of a woman’s work as
a caregiver as well as financial provider in Manhattan. The abundant contrasts in the
work – namely in the opportunities that appear with wealth and privilege juxtaposed
against the restraints of social and legal rules of separation, family trauma, and divorce in
the 1960s – create a vivid snapshot of the scene and setting for any reader. Hayes’
particular point of view captures these contrasts in a powerful way, and as standpoint
theory suggests, offers an unparalleled account of this period, and a microhistorical
reading of the work explores its themes of the taboo of mental illness, the problems of
maternal oversight, and the difficulties working women faced in the 1960s and 1970s in
Manhattan.
Hayes is extraordinarily forthright about her reasoning behind the creation of such
a book, and makes it clear about her source of encouragement:

88
“I wrote this book as I was inspired by the challenge of Stephen Colbert who
wrote I Am America (and so can you). I’ve decided not to take the family secrets
to my grave, but to share them while I’m alive. Stephen said on TV that if we
write one book that’s ‘good enough,’ we don’t have to write another. That’s good
to hear because I don’t think I have that much time on earth to write another. For
the same reason, I shall stick to ‘truthiness’ because I heard once that ‘truth is
stranger than fiction,’ and there are parts of my life that I couldn’t make up if I
tried (Hayes, Kindle Locations 98-103).
These chapters are episodes – smaller vignettes within larger periods of her life – and
some of them have been published independently of the book and at different dates.
Hayes explains that the work is a “collection of essays” that she has treated with a “‘light
touch’ where possible, to counter some of the heavy subjects treated there-in, suicide,
domestic violence, mental illness, etc.” (Kindle Location 112).
Twenty-four chapters of vignettes follow this introductory forward, and they are
as follows: Chapter 1: Overview, Chapter 2: Peer Pressure, Chapter 3: Why I Came to
New York Alone, Chapter 4: How I Met My Future Husband, Chapter 5: My Wedding,
Chapter 6: I Fight to Save My Marriage, Chapter 7: A New York Marriage circa the
1960’s [sic], Chapter 8: Second Round, I Fight to Save My Marriage, Chapter 9: A
Christening Party, Chapter 10: The Ladies’ Man, Chapter 11: Beaux Arts, Chapter 12: A
Moveable Feast, Chapter 13: The Case of Mother’s Face, Chapter 14: Bye Bye Aunt
Ellen, Chapter 15: “You’ll Never Get Away with That!”, Chapter 16: A Manic Flight,
Chapter 17: A Peace Order, Chapter 18: Masks, Chapter 19: Should Wellesley Go Coed?,
Chapter 20: Mental Illness, Chapter 21: Mental Health – Past Abuses and Reforms,

89
Chapter 22: Mental Health –Suggestions for the Caregiver, Chapter 23: Letter to my
Sister-in-Law, and Chapter 24: A Farewell to Grief. These chapter titles are telling and
indicative of the theme of each essay, and they are generally chronological to Hayes’ own
lifetime. Chapters 2 and 15 were originally published by Wellesley College (in
Wellesley College Magazine’s 125th Anniversary edition, Fall 2000, and “Our World,” a
publication by the Wellesley Class of 1950 in 2007, respectively) and Chapter 7 uniquely
has a copyright with date attached to it (1999), as if it too were published elsewhere
before its addition to this larger work.
While the Kindle book is not paginated, the text has internal pages buried within
the text, and the chapters suggest that the physical book would not have been more than
73 pages. The “Product Details” information on the Amazon page for the book suggests
that the print version of the book is 143 pages, and so it is very possible that the original
print version of the book was larger than the standard sizing Amazon assumes for Kindle
book pagination and length; such a difference in size would account for the vast
discrepancy in page numbers (“Amazon.com: Reflections,” 2015). The book, while
covering a range of topics, is not particularly long, nor does it offer any supplementary
content in the way of photographs, appendices, or references. The print version of the
work may have these – indeed, at Kindle Location 1097, Hayes leaves a great deal of
blank space, and has a simple request in the middle of that section: “Please place pictures
here,” as if to prompt an editor to complete such a task (Kindle Location 1097).
The greater arc in the storyline is Hayes’ own adult lifetime; her work begins as
she nears college graduation, and it closes by tying up loose ends Hayes had hoped to see
finalized before her death. Very little information about her childhood or early days

90
appears in the work; rather, Hayes has purposefully made these omissions in order to
focus on the larger themes, namely, coping with mental illness in her family in the middle
of the twentieth century, navigating a discriminatory workspace, and her feelings of
discomfort in and among wealthier and more privileged college peers. These themes
touch on powerful cultural insecurities and speak to broader social restrictions that
certainly hemmed in many working women, and Hayes clearly hopes that they speak to
other women. In her introduction, Hayes notes that her work may seem self-centered:
“In rereading these Chapters, I realize that my world was very small during those
years, (1950-1992). The emphasis was on me, me, me. During this time, the
Korean War was waged (June 25, 1950-July 27, 1953); the Vietnam War dragged
on (1959-April 30, 1975); the Cold War (mid 1940’s-early 1990’s [sic]); there
was the Bay of Pigs (April 1961); the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 15-28,
1962); President John F. Kennedy was assassinated (November 22, 1963); Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated (April 4, 1968)… and other U.S. and
world-wide events took place. Someone may suggest to me that this Octogenarian
should purchase new glasses so that she can see beyond the tip of her nose”
(Kindle Locations 126-132).
She continues on to say that this foray into the deeply personal elements of her life’s
story is meant to serve a larger purpose, namely to aid other people who have
experienced similar crises and trauma. Hayes admits that writing the work was cathartic
– a method for her to release some of the grief she had accumulated – but ultimately, she
hoped to connect to her readers who needed help, and in so doing, opening up a greater
discussion about the difficulties, exhaustion, and despair of managing the care of family

91
members with mental illness (Kindle Location 134). In such a way, by discussing her
experiences with this in the 1960s and 1970s – a time when such topics had greater
stigma attached to them – she frees readers to reflect on their own traumas if they have
them, and to recognize that they are not alone.
Because so much of Reflections of an Octogenarian is wrapped up in Hayes’ life,
a close reading of the work necessarily demands the creation of a timeline. Hayes
explains in her introduction that she did not get married until she was 32 years old and
her husband was 30, and that at the time of publication, they had been married for 38
years (Kindle Location 157). Her senior college breakfast (held a couple of days before
her final graduation from Wellesley), took place in June 1950 (Kindle Location 193), and
before the summer was over she presumably left her hometown of Boston for New York.
At the start of Chapter 16, (“YOU’LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THAT!”) Hayes says
that she was married in 1961 and that she,
…was 32 years old at the time of my marriage and had been working for 11 years
in Wall Street for the Merrill Lynch research department in a professional job, as
both a security analyst and as a portfolio analyst (Kindle Location 1098).
Hayes notes here (and in other parts throughout the book) that she waited quite a long
time to become pregnant, and often recalls the taboo of such a concept. She explains,
… my late son was born in 1969, and my company let me get away with having
one child, but when my daughter Juliet, my only surviving child was born, my
supervisor decided that I was not serious about my career, and she fired me on
March 30, 1973, because she felt that child raising would interfere with my career
(Kindle Locations 1108-1109).

92
As Hayes did not leave college until 1950, and she said once she left home to look for
work in New York City, she “had three jobs in three months, each better than the last,”
there must have been some delay in her employment at Merrill Lynch, but not a lengthy
one. Hayes’ college life, her marriage troubles, and her employment and subsequent
lawsuit make up most of the body of this work, and finding the overlap of these critical
periods is imperative to understanding the book.

Coping Privately with the Taboo of Mental Illness
The most significant storyline in Reflections of an Octogenarian is Hayes’
relationship with her husband, his mental illness, and his verbal and physical abuse of her
during his manic and/or schizophrenic episodes. While Hayes says very clearly in the
book that she would not have gotten married if she’d had any way of anticipating the
problems she would face, it is clear to the reader that Hayes loved and, in many ways,
admired, her husband, Vinson. Throughout the book she explains that she thought he
was “a beautiful man” (Kindle Location 155), and often she often recounts how
impressive his achievements (like graduating from Rutgers, studying law at NYU, and
passing the bar) were considering his mental illness. All the same, Vinson Hayes appears
to have been the greatest source of chaos, disruption, and trauma in Hayes’ life, and her
need to dedicate most of her book to this story – as well as the truth about the secretive,
taboo, and stigmatized realities of mental illness in the 1960s and 1970s – speaks to its
impact on her.
Early in the book, Hayes takes pains to note that she is treating her story and the
family tragedy surrounding her husband as a kind of truth-telling; she announces to her

93
sister-in-law on the first page of the foreword that she apologizes “for relating some of
the family secrets…” but that “[s]omeone ought to get some satisfaction out of ‘all that
jazz’ while they are still alive” (Kindle Location 97). That her husband’s mental illness
was necessarily considered a secret, and that her writing in Reflections of an
Octogenarian should somehow betray a family confidence, relates to the reader that
Hayes’ experienced much of this chaos at a time when these matters were not spoken of,
and certainly not aired publicly. Later in the first chapter, she wonders to herself if it is
“a mistake to elaborate” further on her husband’s illness (Kindle Location 172), but she
has hope for the future and believes that the “answers” to the big questions relating to
mental illness and caregiving “will be found in the new millennium” (Kindle Location
184).
Hayes’ life and time with her husband sound difficult to say the least. At the
outset of the book she explains that her husband had “[perhaps 100] episodes of mental
illness. He [had] been variously diagnosed, but they finally settled on ‘schizoaffective
disorder’ which is a combination of schizophrenia paranoia (a thinking disorder) and
manic depression (a mood disorder)” (Kindle Locations 162-164). While she explains
that these diagnoses are difficult to come by, she is very clear on how these problems
manifested in her husband and in her home. Vinson Hayes spent his (and Betty’s money)
until near-ruin, often abandoned her and their children on manic flights, and occasionally
in heightened states, physically destroyed the furniture in their home, and beat Betty or
dragged her by her hair until it was pulled out.
Hayes’ husband often spent money on lavish parties for his “Beaux Arts” club – a
“social group… [that] comprised his fantasy world” (Kindle Location 939). Although

94
Hayes was “always opposed to it because it took money away from the family, money
that could have been used for ‘enrichment’ such as private schools for the children and
family trips to Europe and other exotic places,” her husband “won out because he needed
‘something to do’ while I worked during the day to support the family” (Kindle Location
939). The Beaux Arts club hosted parties – costume balls, Christmas dances, an annual
Valentine’s Day Dance, and “‘a Spring Fling’, [sic] an outing in our cottage in the
Hamptons…” (Kindle Location 943). Vinson often paid for these events with money
cobbled together from friends or loan sharks, and Hayes would only find out about the
true costs until the interest on the loan skyrocketed, and she would “pay it, not only to
stop the interest, but also possibly to save him from bodily harm” (Kindle Location 952).
While Hayes presumably kept her own financial interests separate as best she
could (she notes that she made sure to have her name on their properties as well, so that
Vinson could not sell off any major assets in order to secretly pay off his debts), she often
stepped in to help him when situations became dire, to prove her love for him, or simply
because he demanded access to her own wealth. Hayes often notes that she was the
breadwinner for the family as a portfolio analyst on Wall Street, and while Vinson had
long had an allowance from his father before he married her, he was cut off not long after
their wedding. Early in their marriage, Hayes received a $1000 Christmas bonus, and she
dedicates much of a chapter to her willingness to give it all to her husband, to “save her
marriage” and to make him see that he needed her in his life (Kindle Locations 527-554).
She laments that such a plan did not work (and it was in the middle of this period that she
received the greatest physical abuse of her marriage), but she regularly conveys her

95
willingness to share her wealth with him in order to show support, to protect him, or even
to protect herself when he insisted on using her money.
Why Hayes received so little protection from police forces or was so rarely
consulted by Vinson’s doctors is unclear. Hayes herself suggests that police were unable
or unwilling to protect her because they were too busy, and doctors often dismissed her
protestations. She recounts the following conversation that she had with a police officer
upon visiting the station to show the black eyes Vinson gave her:
‘Lady, I don’t want to seem unkind, but this happens a thousand times a day in
New York City. Do you have a place where you can stay?’ I said no. ‘Well, you
owe it to yourself to protect yourself.’ ‘Oh, I thought that was your job’ (Kindle
Location 598).
She goes on to note that Vinton was an impossible patient for his doctors, and that any
time he was hospitalized, he would receive medication and half a day’s rest, and then,
…would look so normal they would let him go. Furthermore, they hated to see
him come to that hospital anyway. He was a lawyer with three university degrees,
and he knew his ‘writ of habeas corpus’ by heart. He could recite it in his sleep.
He created his own particular kind of mayhem, since he had great organizing
ability among the patients and usually had a number of the patients on the ward
writing their own ‘writs of habeas corpus’ while he was there. This was very
disturbing to the hospital staff (Kindle Locations 660-663).
Perhaps the Hayes were quickly discharged by these institutions designed to support and
protect them because of these aforementioned difficulties. Hayes herself seems to suggest
as much; she makes it clear that her husband’s legal expertise often interfered or

96
diminished his opportunities to remain in psychiatric care when he needed it. She
laments that he would check himself out (all the while threatening legal action), and
could easily return to their home to attack her again within 24 hours. She notes that one
of the few times that she successfully convinced the doctors to keep him in their ward
was to bring in a “large envelope” stuffed full with the hair she had lost in clumps from
her husband ripping it out the night before – a plan she described as both dramatic and
effective (Kindle Location 682). That such a bold action was required in order for Hayes
to protect herself speaks to the sexism and mistrust of a woman’s experience intrinsic in
such a system.
Quick discharge from hospitals was certainly common in the 1960s and 1970s,
and while Vinson’s outbursts and legal know-how likely accelerated his ejection from
these facilities, many other mentally ill patients could expect such treatment. Towards
the end of the 1950s, a federal Joint Commission on Mental Health gathered data across
the nation, and in 1961 formally recommended that the nation reduce mental hospital
sizes by supplying community alternatives, and during the Kennedy and later Johnson
administrations, de-institutionalization was achieved, albeit by “a series of for-profit
‘board-and-care’ homes, often situated in abandoned apartment buildings or motels in
inner-city areas” (Hinshaw, p. 80). Funding that was passed for the improvement of such
community centers during liberal administrations (Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter) was
often slashed by conservative administrations that followed (Nixon, Reagan) (Hinshaw, p.
80). By the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s, hospitalization was often not a
long-term solution, and for-profit homes (the very sort that Vinson could easily leave)
were offered to mentally ill patients instead.

97
Vinson would also go on “manic flights,” disappearing for weeks on end, using
family credit cards without any oversight (Kindle Location 1180). He had a “nervous
breakdown” at the time of Hayes’ labor with their first child, and he fled their home and
did not call or reach out to Hayes for “two months” (Kindle Location 1200). Hayes, very
ill at home following a complicated labor and delivery, regularly received calls from their
credit card companies, searching for “‘a very disturbed individual in Los Angeles who is
using your husband’s credit card.’” (Kindle Location 1210). While Hayes was
concerned about their budget as they had a newborn to care for, she had no way of
reaching him, and only heard later that Vinson had gone to Los Angeles to study the
mystery of Marilyn Monroe’s death. Vinson eventually returned, but Hayes was unable
to cancel their credit cards and could only confirm to agents that he was indeed spending
their money on the West Coast. Her inability to manage their accounts, and to protect
herself from her husband’s reckless spending, speaks to the financial powerlessness she
experienced as their household manager.
Ultimately, Hayes’ story illustrates the bind married women faced. Hayes notes
that she had tried to find out what her rights were according to New York State divorce
and annulment laws, but she was disheartened to find that “[t]here was only one ground
for divorce in New York State in the early 1960’s, [sic] adultery” (Kindle Location 571).
When her husband began demanding a divorce, she eventually contacted a lawyer to
pursue the separation, only to hear that no one would see the case of an abused woman.
She notes that one lawyer told her outright that he would not represent a client with “a
gun to her head” (Kindle Location 603). Hayes never suggests that she wanted to divorce,
although, as time progressed and divorce laws offered flexibility, she very well could

98
have opted for a no-fault divorce, or even gone to trial seeking a fault divorce, citing
abandonment, cruelty, or abuse. That Hayes never pursued this action may seem unclear,
but she often alludes to a belief that divorce would have been too taboo and emotionally
painful for her. Old-fashioned notions and social mores regarding divorce, and the
stigma of marriage failure, very likely carried over from her parents’ beliefs and ideas,
and as Hayes was often subjected to bullying treatment from her mother (and later, her
mother-in-law), it seems likely that she internalized their values and took them on as her
own.

Overcoming the Maternal Instincts of an Older Generation
While Hayes would certainly agree that spousal abuse and mental illness both
play major roles in her book, one of the critical but less-illuminated themes in Hayes’
work is the lack of maternal support or misguided maternal support. Hayes’ memories
are dotted with small cruelties from her mother and direct and open antagonism from her
mother-in-law. She has no kind words for either woman and makes no apologies for their
perspectives and actions; to her, they are not simply indicative of their generations’
attitudes or mindsets, and their beliefs cannot be so easily forgiven. For the reader, and
perhaps more than anything, this disconnect between Hayes and the attitudes of her
mother and mother-in-law on topics as diverse as the value of women’s work to mental
illness throws the transitioning values and mores of Americans into sharp relief.
Hayes’ mother – a brief and unnamed character in Reflections of an Octogenarian
– seems to want the best for Hayes, although she often conveys this in dismissive and
unkind suggestions for Hayes. Hayes’ mother often urges Hayes to make decisions that

99
would secure her future, and these include finding the right job, settling down in the right
place, joining the right types of social circles, and attracting the right sort of husband.
Her mother’s tendency to criticize, strong-arm, and otherwise bully Hayes into making
the “right” decisions for her life seem to come from a place of concern and maternal
worry, however cruel her tone and methods may have been.
Hayes’ mother first appears in Chapter 1: Overview of my Life. Hayes, after
introducing the trauma related to her husband’s mental illness and laments that her life
would have been much easier,
…had I married my MIT engineer boyfriend whom I met at the Freshman mixer
and dated during my first 3 years at Wellesley. He was a returning veteran from
World War II and was 13 years older than I and divorced after a brief marriage
before the war (no children, no alimony since his first wife had left him to marry
another). And he truly cared for me. My mother was horrified (Kindle Locations
156-158).
Why her mother disliked this man – whether it was his prior relationship, or his age
difference – is unclear. Hayes relays later that her mother simply did not like him; his
name was Raymond Blair, “and she called him ‘Mr. Blah,’ and talked negatively about
him to my relatives” (Kindle Location 309). While Hayes never says this explicitly, it is
clear that she knows that her life with this man would have likely been much easier, and
she blames her mother for pushing Raymond Blair away and urging Hayes to find
another suitor. She goes so far as to say that she dated Blair for “three years because I
didn’t think I would meet anybody else (and I didn’t),” and lamented about this her senior
year at Wellesley as her “classmates were planning their weddings, and I could have been

100
doing so too, had I not been shamed and kidded out of my boyfriend of three years”
(Kindle Locations 345, 266). In so few words, Hayes clearly blames her mother for
marrying someone who ultimately was a source of great trauma in Hayes’ own life.
Finding the right man and living situation for Hayes was clearly a part of her
mother’s larger mission, and the reader hears the most from her mother on this subject.
Besides her apparent dislike of Raymond Brown, Hayes’ mother had a great deal of
advice for Hayes as she navigated her romantic life, and it was often at great expense to
Hayes’ own ideas for her future and sense of identity. Besides shaming Hayes out of her
relationship with Raymond Blair, Hayes’ mother also derided her daughter for leaving
home to find work and to build a life in New York City. Hayes explains that her mother
believed that “no decent man would marry me unless I was living with my parents” and
“they would think I was a ‘bad woman’” (Kindle Location 308).
On the night that Hayes met her future husband, Vinson (an evening she describes
and beautiful and romantic – one such evening she had long hoped for), Hayes wore an
elegant red strapless ball gown to a dinner party. She was so pleased with her appearance,
and the photographs taken of her to celebrate the occasion, she sent some of them to her
mother in the mail. She explained, “I thought she would be as thrilled as I was. She told
me ‘You looked drunk in the pictures’” (Kindle Location 427), clearly with the intention
of diminishing any happiness Hayes felt over the evening.
While her mother urged her to stay in Boston, Hayes suggests that her mother
may have had multiple motives for such a living situation. Hayes explains that, her
mother “wanted me to ‘get a little job’ in Boston, ‘not too important a job, you
understand.’ And she wanted me to make an easy old age for her” (Kindle Location 266).

101
At location 266, it is unclear whether or not Hayes’ mother hoped that she would remain
single in order to care for her, but at location 360, Hayes clarifies further, by saying
“[m]y mother observed that I always did well in school and she thought I would ‘get a
little job’ in Boston, and make her senior years easier, by living with my parents and
supporting them” (Kindle Location 360).
This assertion makes it difficult for the reader to discern Hayes’ mother’s true
motives. Was she overwhelmingly negative about Hayes’ romantic life and romantic
prospects because she was unimpressed with Hayes’ prospects, or did she simply hope
that Hayes would remain single, and dutifully care for her parents in their old age?
Hayes never expresses her disappointment with her mother, and she never explicitly
labels her mother as a cruel or unkind person, rather, she merely says that she lived for a
long time “under her influence” (Kindle Location 262). Hayes’ own judgments are
reserved, and readers are left to make up their own mind on such a character.
While Hayes was able to escape her mother’s browbeating, she seemingly traded
one negative mother for another upon her marriage to Vinson: her mother-in-law,
Roberta. Hayes dedicates a great deal of Reflections of an Octogenarian to a discussion
of her mother-in-law’s cruelty and disregard for her and for Vinson. Several vignettes in
the book focus on her mother-in-law’s actions against Hayes and her marriage into the
family, but most notably, she describes Roberta’s push for marriage annulment, her overinvolvement in Hayes’ pregnancy, and her distaste for Hayes’ career choices. While
tension between in-laws is not a particularly new or novel topic in family dramas
(fictional, in memoirs, or otherwise), their relationship seems particularly touched by

102
generational conflicts on the social propriety of discussing mental illness and women’s
role in the home and workplace.
Hayes makes it clear that Roberta was not accepting of her marriage to Vinson
early on in the work. In the chapter detailing her wedding day, she notes that, “[d]uring
my marriage, my husband had said casually that his father liked me, and I later found out
that he was probably the only person in the family who did” (Kindle Location 473).
When Hayes’ father-in-law died shortly after Hayes’ wedding to Vinson, her mother-inlaw moved in “on lower Fifth Avenue, right around the corner from us,” (Kindle
Location 482) and insisted that Vinson move in with her for a time. While Roberta took
every action she could to keep Vinson with her and to separate him from Hayes
(including introducing him to another woman, and telling this other woman that he was
separated from his wife and pending annulment), she was ultimately unable to compel
them to divorce.
The most compelling elements of the Roberta storyline in Reflections of an
Octogenarian relate to her involvement with Vinson’s and Hayes’ doctors. Modern
restrictions regarding patient-doctor confidentiality inform none of Roberta’s thoughts
and actions, and as such, they seem shocking to the modern reader. According to Hayes,
Roberta set up appointments for Hayes to visit with a psychiatric social worker regarding
Vinson and his outbursts, and she often called that person later to ask what Hayes had
said in their private interviews. Hayes suggests that she was lucky that this person did
not dispel her private conversations, but she makes it very clear later in the book that
Roberta was able to convince doctors that she knew best for Hayes and Hayes’ family
later on.

103
In Chapter 23, “LETTER TO MY SISTER IN LAW,” (Mary Ellen), Hayes
relates the previously untold story of her son’s birth and Roberta’s intrusion in Hayes’
birth plan:
I do not know if I ever told you how your mother almost killed me when my late
son was born. She went behind my back to my doctor and told him she did not
want me to have a caesarean section… In my family there is a history of badly
damaged children resulting from the women not opting for this delivery… Of
course I did not tell your mother these details, because she was delighted to throw
any defects on my side of the family back in my face. Since I had no idea your
mother had ordered the doctor not to give me a caesarean section, I saw no need
to tell him of our family history, because the operation was already scheduled to
happen. I had also arranged to have a nurse, a woman who was living with and
looking after your mother, take care of my son after he was born, but your mother
fired her and threw her out, leaving me with no one… [Your] mother went to my
doctor behind my back and indicated she might sue him if he gave me a
caesarean… [and as] a result of your mother’s intervention, I was in labor for
more than 24 hours… My complications included a near-fatal pulmonary
embolism, and my stitches broke (Kindle Locations 1822-1849).
That Hayes’ birth plan was disrupted so catastrophically (she does take pains to describe
the trauma and aftermath of her recovery) by her mother-in-law seems completely
contradictory to the rules and statues that dictate modern medical practice. Hayes does
not ever specify if she gave someone in her family medical power of attorney rights, and
the reader cannot know how much Roberta altered or otherwise affected the doctor’s

104
intentions for Hayes’ delivery. While the reader cannot know the doctor’s mind and
intentions during Hayes’ delivery, and the reader has no way of confirming that Roberta
“indicated she might sue [the doctor] if he gave [Hayes] a caesarean,” Hayes has made it
clear that she felt as though her wishes were cast aside while she was in a vulnerable state,
and as such, she was left in a worse condition than she otherwise might have been
(Kindle Location 1831).
Roberta’s criticism of Hayes and Hayes’ choices was certainly not limited to
decisions about her health. Throughout the book, Hayes makes clear how important her
professional success was to her self-identity, and Roberta often took Hayes to task for
pursuing a full-time job after her marriage to Vinson. Roberta would lament publicly,
and ask Hayes’ friends and family, “ ‘[w]hy won’t Betty let Vinson be a man?’ ” with
reference to Hayes’ career on Wall Street (Kindle Location 498). Hayes’ income was
critical to her family’s well being, and she notes that while Vinson served as a legal
editor with Prentice Hall, his position did not last long, and his mental illness often
interfered with any professional pursuits he may have had. Hayes suggests that Roberta’s
criticism of her work stemmed from Roberta’s need to control them both; Hayes’ position
at Merrill Lynch “supported us and enabled us to be independent of her,” (Kindle
Location 500) and Hayes was unwilling to acquiesce to Roberta’s desire for influence.
Hayes’ powerful desire to remain independent of her husband’s family was likely
motivated by her need to isolate herself from otherwise toxic relationships, and she
suggests that regularly throughout the work, but her mother-in-law’s complaints about
her independence are couched in dated language and old-fashioned mores about gender
roles in nuclear families. As Hayes supposes, it was very likely that her mother-in-law

105
only disliked her professional life because she wanted to keep Hayes and her husband
close, but her words and public actions suggest another reason as well. Roberta regularly
complained that Hayes would not allow Vinson to “be a man,” and indicated that
working outside the home was a direct attack on Vinson’s masculinity. Hayes says that
Roberta believed that Hayes had a role to play in Vinson’s professional life, but only as a
supporter rather than an equal partner, and in the book’s final chapter, Hayes mentioned
that Roberta had told her to “give up my professional job on Wall Street that I had been
pursuing for 11 years and join a lot of ladies’ clubs and promote Vinson’s law practice
(read Beaux Arts) among the members of these clubs” (Kindle Locations 1799-1801).
This position – supplemental and deferential to her husband’s career, albeit a career
shaped and stunted by difficulties with mental illness – speaks to the conservative beliefs
that Roberta may have had about the nature of work and marriage roles. Whatever her
real reason, Roberta used traditional gender mores and values to criticize Hayes’
professional path, and this issue is another critical theme in Hayes’ work.

Women in the Workforce: Hayes’ Personal and Professional Experiences
Early in her introduction, Hayes notes that her memoirs have been written
episodically, and as such, each chapter functions somewhat as a standalone essay. Indeed,
some of these chapters were written as essays in service to Wellesley College. “Chapter
1: Overview of my Life” was “Prepared for 50th Wellesley Class Reunion Record”
(Kindle Location 145), “Chapter 2: TRADITIONS! TRADITIONS! PEER PRESSURE:
WELLESLEY SENIOR BREAKFAST – JUNE 1950,” was “reprinted in the Wellesley
Magazine [Fall 2000 edition], the issue that celebrated the 125th Anniversary of the

106
College” (Kindle Location 112), and “Chapter 15: “YOU’LL NEVER GET AWAY
WITH THAT! WOMEN’S RIGHTS LITIGATION” was written for and “printed
originally in ‘Our World,’ (2007) a publication of the Wellesley Class of 1950” (Kindle
Location 1164). These pre-printed or otherwise pre-published chapters and essays were
clearly meant to shed light on a transitional period in American history – a time when
women entered the workforce and encountered environments that could be either difficult
to navigate or even openly hostile – and to speak to modern readers about the kinds of
workplace experiences Wellesley alumnae faced during and after college.
Hayes does not mince her words when she discusses the way Wellesley prepared
her for the working world. While she does note the effectiveness of her education there,
she openly derides a college culture that was antagonistic to its students entering the
workforce. She explains that the pervasive attitude of the day urged,
…the women of my generation [to do nothing] but stay home with their husbands
and children. Most did not have careers outside the home, and they viewed those
who took to the ‘paying’ workplace as ‘losers’ who were too ugly or too stupid to
find a man to support them (Kindle Locations 1309-1310).
Despite its place as an incubator for women’s education, Wellesley in Hayes’ day seemed
to accommodate this perspective rather than empower women to cast it aside. She notes,
Our college motto was ‘Non ministratri, sed ministrare,’ literally meaning not to
be ministered to, but to minister. It could also have meant not to be a loser but a
winner; not to be a follower but a leader; not to be a victim but a victor. It was
considered OK, indeed admirable, for a woman college graduate to work her head
off, as long as she didn’t get paid for it! It would appear that some of the ‘old

107
maids’ who ran that school in the dim past decided to interpret the college motto
as applying to volunteer work, since it was probably thought that in the volunteer
area we could do the least harm and might actually do some good. It would have
upset the establishment in a big way to have let loose a large group of highly
educated, intelligent women on the ‘paid’ work force with high expectations of
success. It could have started a revolution, and it did for a later generation, but not
in our time. ‘The Women’s Movement’ was not even thought of, at that time. I
guess we considered ourselves lucky to have won the vote in national elections
(Kindle Locations 1312-1321).
Hayes’ tone here is patently acerbic; that women were told they should work, and can
work to great effect, as long as it was in a non-competitive arena, was a value at a
women’s college certainly seems contradictory to current prevailing attitudes about
women’s labor and role in the professional world, and it would certainly seem suspect
coming from any women’s college.
Hearing Hayes’ personal opinion about her time at Wellesley is valuable; many
alumnae have argued publicly that popular depictions of the college are misinformed, and
otherwise fraught with distortions. Most famously, the film Mona Lisa Smile, a popular
movie featuring Julia Roberts as an enlightened teacher exposing her stuffy, sheltered
students to shocking modern art, brought 1950s Wellesley into the spotlight of American
popular culture. In the film, students are prompted to postpone marriage and to pursue
careers, thereby rejecting the conservative social undercurrents at the college. In order to
counter this depiction of Wellesley, Marian Burros and other alumnae chimed in for the
New York Times, saying that the movie was a “caricature,” and that Wellesley in the

108
1950s offered “glimmers of the revolution that was to come” (2003). She went on to
argue that the college’s students were not sheltered or repressed, and they did not need
rescuing from an enlightened faculty member as in the movie (Burros, 2003). While
Wellesley students may have tackled controversial subjects in school, Burros does note
that “most students married shortly after graduating” and that “some wit had translated
the college motto… to ‘not to be a minister, but to be a minister’s wife,’ ” seemingly
confirming Hayes’ ideas about non-competitive work for women (2003).
Hayes does explain that Wellesley seemed to offer contingency plans for women
who were without independent family wealth (those who, in her words, “went to public
school” (Kindle Location 1357) or who did not expect to find a husband. Hayes explains
that students such as these were,
…supposed to just get our education and then get a little job… just enough to
support ourselves, pay off our student loans and help our impoverished families
so that we wouldn’t be a burden to society. In fact the advice from the Placement
Office at the time was that those of us who planned to go to work after graduating
from Wellesley should study typing and shorthand and become accomplished
stenographers (Kindle Locations 1357-1363).
That Wellesley – a college now associated with women’s empowerment and intellectual
autonomy – would have fostered such attitudes and perspectives in its students seems
shocking to modern readers. Hayes also spends some time in this chapter lamenting that
she had very few opportunities to meet other young men her age while at Wellesley, and
this regret may stem from the unhappy marriage she dedicates so much of her book to,

109
and she suggests that a co-educational college may have suited her better (Kindle
Location 1374).
Despite the misgivings Wellesley advisors may have had regarding Hayes
entering the workforce, Hayes pursued a degree in economics and found employment
almost immediately. Indeed, Hayes’ skills were so sought after by employers that she
easily moved from Newton Center, Massachusetts to New York City, and paid off her
$1500 student loan with her first Christmas bonus from a brokerage firm’s research
department (Kindle Locations 331-333). Hayes could afford to be selective with regards
to her position and employment, and she felt free to disregard offers from companies that
did not suit her principles:
I even turned down a job at Equitable Life where they would have trained me to
become an actuary, because I thought the company was too paternalistic. They
had a company cottage in the Catskills near a lake, where the girls were supposed
to take their vacations and save money. I preferred to think I had the freedom to
take a trip to Bermuda (or elsewhere at my choice) after working for a year
(which I did) (Kindle Locations 190-194).
That Hayes had such luxury of choice equipped her for a degree of privilege and freedom
unknown to many other women in this period. In this way, her personal story about
navigating the workplace reflects the opportunities she was able to negotiate and use to
her advantage. Hayes’ prestigious education and her choice of economics degree without
question gave her the additional tools to avoid professional situations she deemed to be
“paternalistic” (Kindle Location 194).

110
The 15th chapter of Reflections of an Octogenarian, “YOU’LL NEVER GET
AWAY WITH THAT! WOMEN’S RIGHTS LITIGATION” (Kindle Location 1098),
was originally written as an essay for “Our World,” a publication of and presumably for
the Wellesley Class of 1950 (Kindle Location 1172), and it features the story of Hayes’
successful civil rights lawsuit against Merrill Lynch for the discriminatory dismissal from
her position. Hayes’ case centered on her pregnancy and decision to work while pregnant,
and the forced maternity leave and eventual firing from the company she had served for
over a decade. In the chapter, Hayes tries to contextualize her experience for readers in
broader American culture by discussing both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the
changing corporate culture of companies publicly traded on the NYSE.
Early in the chapter, Hayes takes pains to justify her decision to have a child. She
immediately clarifies for the reader that she was in an unusual position in her field
because very few women were qualified to be security or portfolio analysts, and as such
most of her co-workers and peers were men, but she believed that she had put in enough
time to establish her presence at the company before taking the necessary time to have a
child. She had her first child in 1969, after she had worked for more than 11 years with
Merrill Lynch, and as she said,
“my company let me get away with having one child, but when my daughter
Juliet…was born, my supervisor decided that I was not serious about my career,
and she fired me on March 30, 1973, because she felt that child raising would
interfere with my career… [s]he said that ‘I was not that big a fish that I could
both work and raise children.’ She also forced me to take maternity leave earlier
than I had anticipated. She said she “could not afford to have a blemish on her

111
department,” the blemish being me in a pregnant condition (Kindle Locations
1108-1112).
Interestingly, Hayes’ supervisor – a woman that Hayes never names or describes – was
also able to find a position in a traditionally male-oriented workplace. This supervisor,
Hayes believes, acted out against Hayes with envy; Hayes argues that her supervisor was
jealous of Hayes’ growing family because she was ‘a single career woman’ (Kindle
Location 1108). That Hayes’ supervisor might have internalized a sexist paradigm, and
truly believed that Hayes’ pregnancy was inappropriate in the workplace, or if she simply
resented Hayes’ family situation, is impossible for the reader to know or confirm. Either
way, Hayes’ dismissal led to a three-and-a-half year absence from Merrill Lynch, and a
major lawsuit against the company.
Hayes also believed that the changing corporate culture of Merrill Lynch after it
went public on the NYSE prompted her dismissal, or, at the very least, facilitated it. In
1969, when Hayes had her first child, Merrill Lynch was privately held, and as Hayes
says,
long-term employees were treated like ‘family,’ albeit distant cousins. Loyalty to
the firm was important… [and t]he CEO’s [sic] came from the leading families
that had merged into our company, and many were pleasant statesmen who valued
their long term [sic] employees (Kindle Location 1130).
As Hayes had already worked for Merrill Lynch for several years before she had her first
child, she presumably believed that she was valued in this company culture.
Hayes would not be making any great leap in her assumption about her value to
the company here. The familial nature of working life at Merrill Lynch has been

112
confirmed by other parties, particularly in traditionally published memoirs about working
life at that company. In Catching Lightning in a Bottle: How Merrill Lynch
Revolutionized the Financial World, Winthrop H. Smith Jr., a 28-year employee of
Merrill Lynch and the son of one of the early partners of the company, describes the
company culture as doting and invested in its employees. He explains that, in the
postwar economy, the company realized that most young people interested in banking did
not pursue the stock market, as it was seen as a “seedy” enterprise, and at blame for the
Great Depression (Smith, p. 182). In order to attract new talent, Merrill Lynch began to
give all new employees continuing education and on-the-job training: a massive and
costly experiment in a field not without risk. This policy became ‘the experience that
binds one Merrill Lynch man to the same culture as the next Merrill Lynch man,” and
many relished a company culture that invested in, and even doted on, its employees
(Smith, p. 184). Indeed, this policy was often colloquially referred to as “Mother Merrill”
– employees were to be fostered and nurtured and professionally developed by the
company, and in return the company received their loyal (and often lifetime) service
(Smith, p. 184; 289).
Merrill Lynch went public in 1971, and Hayes explains that this family-oriented
culture was drastically changed, and even valued, long-term employees “all at once…
were interchangeable units in the work force” (Kindle Location 1134). In his own work,
Smith confirms this change in by saying that “going public… had other consequences
that were not so positive. For one thing, maintaining a long-term view became far more
difficult as quarterly earnings were scrutinized by analysts and ownership was
increasingly transferred into the ands of institutions” (p. 286). Hayes laments this change,

113
and explains that when she had her second child in 1973, she found no such safety net as
before.
In order to see the case through, Hayes had to file a complaint with the New York
State Division of Human Rights and attend a public hearing, and then a judge had to
determine probable cause (a process, that Hayes explains, took months) (Kindle Location
1132). Throughout this period, Hayes says that, “[t]here were several times when the
case could have been settled, and at one point I won some back pay for being forced to
take a maternity leave earlier than I had planned,” but as she was seeking reinstatement
rather than simple financial restitution, she followed her case through to the federal level
(Kindle Location 1135). Hayes explains to her readers that,
It was necessary to exhaust my administrative remedies at the State and Federal
level before I could file in Federal Court, where there was a better chance of
winning the case. I sought advice from the National Organization for Women, and
they told me to pursue my administrative remedies and quietly lose (both with
New York State and with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,) and
then file in Federal Court. The trouble was that I kept winning small victories in
these early administrative proceedings, i.e. some back pay, and the company
being found liable for “probable cause” of discrimination, and that is why my
litigation took 3 ½ years. (Kindle Locations 1139-1143).
These “small victories” were simply not enough for Hayes; she did not want to be bought
off and cast aside after years of service and a fulfilling job, and furthermore, as she was
the sole breadwinner for her family throughout her husband’s illness, she needed to
remain employed in her field.

114
Throughout the chapter on her litigation against her employer, Hayes makes it
quite clear that her own degree of privilege and means, as well as valuable personal
contacts, led to a successful suit against Merrill Lynch – not her own wherewithal or
some other personal fortitude to see justice done. During the three-and-a-half year
interim that Hayes did not work for Merrill Lynch, she was able to find work with the
New York Wellesley Club. Sara Butte, a former classmate and neighbor in Gramercy
Park, “gave” Hayes this job (Kindle Location 1145) as a kindness, and Hayes was then
“the Club Administrator, the one paid employee of the Club” (Kindle Location 1150).
Hayes was able to leverage this position into another position with a watchdog
organization that “evaluated non-profit agencies, as to how they spent the money they
raised from the public, how much for program, for overhead, and for fund-raising”
(Kindle Location 1150). Her Wellesley contacts helped Hayes get her foot in the door
with non-profit work, and in the event that Hayes did not win her case, she had the
opportunity to rebuild her career in this new field.
Additionally, Vinson Hayes’ expertise as a lawyer, and his personal contacts with
other lawyers, facilitated Hayes’ victory in her lawsuit. She explains that this case was in
many ways the highlight of her husband’s career, and his “lawyer friends” regularly came
to the Hayes’ aid whenever they required additional support (Kindle Location 1156).
Hayes appeared at every court hearing, every meeting, with at least three lawyers
alongside her, and this entourage lent weight, credibility, and authority to her case. In
fact, Hayes makes it very explicit to her readers that her powerful reinforcements gave
her the opportunity to pursue her case to such a degree and for such a long time. In her
own candid words, she says, “I never would have had the courage to stand up for my

115
rights if my husband hadn’t been a lawyer” (Kindle Location 1160). In this way, Hayes
makes it clear that she understands that her own privilege, circumstances, and opportunity
made her pursuit of the case possible, and conveys to her readers that she could easily
imagine other similar cases that might have failed when plaintiffs did not have such
resources at their disposal.
Ultimately, Hayes saw her victory over Merrill Lynch and her reinstatement at the
company in 1976 in both personal and universal terms. In August of that year, Justice
Charles Brieant decided the case in Federal Court in New York City, and by October 18
she was back at work at Merrill Lynch. Hayes remained at Merrill Lynch for 13
additional years after, until she “turned 62 and was eligible for a pension and social
security” (Kindle Location 1157). Her legal victory lifted a great weight from her
shoulders and her husbands’, and she says that, “[w]hen I was reinstated in my work, my
husband and I were ecstatic. We would be able to live the way we always had, and raise
the children. We heaved sighs of relief” (Kindle Locations 1169-1171).
While Hayes’ success had real and immediate effects on her daily living situation,
she also took the time to compare her lawsuit to other similar cases and to situate her
example in a broader context of civil rights actions regarding women in the workplace.
In fact, Hayes, at the close of her chapter, she mentioned a workplace lawsuit featuring a
fellow Wellesley alumna against Merrill Lynch. Unlike Hayes, Helen Bohen O’Bannon
accepted a monetary settlement after arguing that she had been discriminated against in
the hiring process for a position as security salesman. O’Bannon had
…maintained that she was better qualified than the men who were hired for these
positions, since she had co-authored a textbook on Economics… and at the time

116
of her death on October 19, 1988, she was Treasurer of the University of
Pennsylvania, having previously served as Commissioner of Public Utilities for
Pennsylvania and then Secretary of Welfare for Pennsylvania (Kindle Locations
1165-1166).
Hayes offers no additional critical commentary after this mention of O’Bannon; she does
not suggest that she and O’Bannon were subjected to difficulties by the same patriarchal
institutions or even sexist milieu. Hayes explains that it was “interesting” that such a
case should be made by another Wellesley graduate in the same time and under similar
circumstances, and she leaves it to the readers of her work to form their own conclusions
about the prejudiced environment both women encountered.

Conclusion
Reflections of an Octogenarian is one woman’s account of her past, and just one
story of millions that center in New York City. As such, it is not a work of history that
encompasses events in the city, or at Wellesley, and indeed, Hayes herself says in her
introduction that “[s]omeone may suggest to me that this Octogenarian should purchase
new glasses so that she can see beyond the tip of her nose” (Kindle Location 132). Hayes
is, of course, a unique and singular case: in a time when women were not necessarily
encouraged to go to school for the specific reason of furthering their careers, she attended
a prestigious, private liberal arts college, went to work in what was (and by many
accounts, still is) a male-dominated field, and became the primary breadwinner for
herself and her family of four. Her education, career, and wealth gave her opportunities

117
denied to most, and as such, the difficulties she faced in her life (namely, her husband’s
mental illness) were certainly cushioned by her privilege.
The work succeeds as a historical memoir because of its power as a situational
snapshot. Feminist historians have long noted that women’s history is found in the
details, in the personal stories, and as such, they have looked to memoir and personal
story to find new truths and to achieve an understanding of the ways women interacted
with their world. Understandably, Hayes cannot and does not speak for every woman
mistreated in the workplace in the businesses of Manhattan in the 1970s. However, in
telling her own story, and by revealing how easy it was for her employer to dismiss her,
she allows the reader to imagine the milieu in which such dismissals were possible.
Furthermore, Hayes’ own acceptance of her privilege and focus on that privilege forces
the reader to consider all of the situations in which women were afforded no chances to
air grievances or seek redress from the companies they worked for. In many ways, it is
what Hayes does not say or does not have to say that make this book significant; she
often implies that her situation was special, that she had access to better care and more
help than most, and she leaves the reader to consider all of the situations in which this
may not have been possible.
This is not to say that Hayes does not attempt to find commonalities with other
women and other women’s stories. Throughout Reflections of an Octogenarian, Hayes
regularly tries to add a degree of generalizability to her stories. As she discussed her
workplace dismissal, she tied in a mention of another Wellesley alumna who suffered a
similar fate. In her chapters on her experiences with domestic abuse, she often
highlighted the reactions of lawyers, doctors, and the police, all the while noting the

118
social values underpinning their reactions. Hayes described, in great detail, the dismissal
of doctors and the callousness of police officers regarding her precarious home life, and
readers could easily anticipate how such public servants might treat other women facing
the same problems. Indeed, by introducing her own privilege and putting it at the
forefront of her memoirs, the reader may easily imagine that Hayes was probably treated
better than most.
Ultimately, Hayes’ memoirs foster in the reader a sense of time and place that a
top-down history would not and could not be able to achieve on its own, and this is the
critical value that Reflections of an Octogenarian adds to the historical canon. By
studying the nuances of a conversation with her mother-in-law, or by hearing Hayes
lament the inflexibility of her working life, the reader can imagine how similar scenarios
were playing out across the country in the same time period. Her story makes the setting
and scene tangible and real for the reader, and complements any top-down history of
women’s rights and women’s issues in the middle of the 20th century. Analyzing
Reflections of an Octogenarian is an empathetic process for the reader and necessarily
facilitates the readers’ grasp of the setting, period, and social climate in ways that global,
traditional, patriarchal, or political histories might not. Inclusion of a work such as this,
in a public or academic library collection, and lifting it up for study, gives credence to the
voice and memory of a woman who was a student, and then caregiver, mother, and
financial analyst in Manhattan.

CHAPTER 5 – THE HISTORY OF NEW MEXICO HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
Synopsis and Overview
Dan Ford’s The History of New Mexico High School Football, Volume I: The first
100 years: 1892 – 1992 is an exhaustive treatment of the history of high school football –
covering everything from game statistics to injuries to the development of conferences
and divisions – in New Mexico from the end of the nineteenth century to the end of the
twentieth. The work is divided into seven chapters, namely “Chapter One: ‘An
Interesting Game is Anticipated;’ Chapter Two: Development Years; Chapter Three:
Working Toward a True Champion; Chapter Four: The Playoffs; Chapter Five: Artesia,
Carrizozo & The Hornets; Chapter Six: New Names, More Teams, Chapter Seven: Clovis,
Animas and 6-Man Football,” all of which follow a Dedication, Forward, and an About
the Author aside (Kindle Location 110). A collection of 93 photographs adds a great deal
of visual backstory to the work, and while the book lacks citations, the photographs are
credited when possible. While the Kindle edition of the book is not paginated, the record
of the book (accessed in WorldCat and discussed in Chapter Seven) describes the book as
being of a considerable size and length: 25cm and 206 pages. The webpage for the
Kindle book estimates that the book is 467 pages (although what standard size pages
Kindle publishing utilizes for reference is difficult to say).
Although the book has multiple chapters, the real dividing line (stylistically and
categorically) in the book is between the section that studies and analyzes the history of
football in New Mexico before 1950, and the section that studies and analyzes the history
of football in New Mexico after 1950. Dan Ford often says throughout the work that
there is a critical difference between early football and football in the “modern era” – and

120
this can be demarcated by the implementation of a modern playoff system, and the
economic growth of the 1950s that allowed high schools to improve facilities for such
athletic competition. As the book follows a chronological timeline, it begins in the 1890s
and ends in the late twentieth century; chapters 1-3 roughly address the period before
1950, and chapters 4-7 handle the period after. Chapters 4-7, at many times, read like a
stats enthusiast’s guidebook; every year is delineated and a short discussion of wins,
prominent players, and adept coaches are noted briefly. Because fewer reference points
exist for the early years, and because the newspapers Ford utilizes do not offer modern
play-by-play information that he will lean on later, Ford was forced to cobble together a
narrative and build a storyline about the period before 1950. As such, the style of the
work diverges sharply at the halfway point, and reads like different volumes of a
multivolume set.
Compared to the other self-published works analyzed here, The History of New
Mexico High School Football contains the most distance between the author and its
subject. Tails of the Prairie and Reflections of an Octogenarian are both personal,
autobiographical memoirs, and Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm is a family history.
Dan Ford, a local football enthusiast and former player from the area, has written a book
on a subject that concerns him but is not primarily about him, and for that reason it differs
a great deal from the other books considered here. A close reading informed by a
microhistorical methodology reveals important themes about the history of New Mexico
high school football in the broader history of education in the state, and the inclusion of
Indian Schools in game play.

121
Dan Ford’s Intentions for The History of New Mexico High School Football and
his Personal Attachment to the Work
Ford is extraordinarily forthright with his reasoning for the need for such a book.
His forward reads a great deal like a mission statement; he notes that there is a serious
gap in the literature on the history of New Mexico since the year of statehood, and he
means for his book to fill some of the void he encountered. He explains,
[t]here are hundreds of books and thesis [sic] in our libraries concerning the
history of New Mexico. Most deal with the romantic Kit Carson, William Bonney,
or Mexican War eras. Some reflect the history of the atomic age in the state. But I
could find literally no books on the history of education, much less school
athletics, in New Mexico until I visited the special collection section of the UNM
Library (Ford, Kindle Location 20).
Ford makes it clear that he was searching for community histories here too; any content
on the era after statehood, whether it was subject specific (e.g., history of education) or
region specific (e.g., history of Albuquerque) was explored if and when possible, and a
great deal of his research took place in the period before the ease of modern digital
searching (particularly in and around 1981). The original high schools in the state and
the New Mexico Activities Association were all consulted on the project, and Ford
intimates that many people he contacted wanted to help him but simply did not have the
information he required. As such, Ford was left to mine the UNM library and its special
collections in order to assemble a history that would be usable and workable for anyone
with similar interests.

122
That is not to say Ford sees himself as a professional historian, or that this project
did not satisfy a personal goal of his. He very carefully asserts that he does not “profess
to be a professional writer by any means,” but that he did take pains to present the
material “in an unbiased way” (Kindle Location 57). Correcting inaccuracies was critical
to this tack; he believes many facts about New Mexico high school football have been
distorted over the years, and his role as a fan and sometime announcer for the Bayfield,
Colorado Wolverines (a short drive away from his hometown of Aztec, NM) may have
something to do this with this, as he had been listening to other broadcasters rattle off
facts from the booth. Digging in newspaper reels led him to discover that many rivalries
pre-dated the lore often touted between schools, and that he often had to construct his
own timeline by compiling information from disparate and disconnected sources. This
could be difficult, because “…community newspapers did well at covering their town
high school but seldom published scores of other schools,” and connecting these games
and teams could be a lot of work (Kindle Location 54). Community newspapers, Ford
estimates, inform 80% of his work.
While Ford means to overturn inaccurate ideas about the early period of high
school football in New Mexico and fill a gap in the literature, there are certainly private
motivations for this work. He explains in his forward,
I grew up in Aztec where I played football for a school rich in football tradition.
After being out of the state for eight years, I returned to Albuquerque in 1977. To
discover what I had missed as far as my old school was concerned; I found a well
of information on microfilm at the libraries in Albuquerque. I went back to the
year of 1965 when I played for the worst football team Aztec ever produced. My

123
curiosity took me back even further and I discovered that our losses to Socorro,
Grants, Bloomfield and Los Lunas were the first ever by the Aztec Tigers. The
immediate questions were ‘Why was I not told of this in 1965? Would it have
made any difference to me and my teammates if I had known about the Tiger
heritage?’ (Kindle Locations 23-27).
This personal anecdote informs the basis of the book (indeed, it is on the opening page)
and it urges the reader to consider the value of knowing one’s own history or legacy.
Presumably, Ford means that if he had known about the Tigers’ winning seasons in the
past, he and his 1965 teammates might have worked harder to uphold a winning tradition.
It would have informed their willingness to put forth effort into their team and into
victories. Ford believes that “our heritage is responsible for our sense of pride and
values,” that the past determines the direction of the future, and for that “reason I am
submitting this information in hopes it that it will become a source of pride to those
young athletes that are not aware of the rich tradition of their school colors” (Kindle
Location 34). Regardless, in his “About the Author” section at the start of the book, Ford
explains that he was born in Roswell, and lived in Aztec, Hagerman, and Albuquerque,
and besides playing quarterback for Aztec, also played at the junior college level in
Roswell (Location 80). As such, his identification and ties to football in the region are
strong, and inspired his thorough research. That background informs Ford’s perspective
on the need to write such a history, and confirms that his perspective lends value to the
work itself, as standpoint theory testifies.
Ford touches on value of heritage and relates it to the production of historical
research in his introduction. To him, the historical memory is of utmost importance; and

124
he asks the reader to “imagine how our history would have suffered if no one bothered to
write down the thoughts of Thomas Jefferson or if no one could positively remember who
it was that freed the slaves or won the battles?” (Kindle Location 40). Ford never equates
his own writing with this kind of traditionalist, large-scale, or political history (rather, he
addresses the importance of his book in very humble terms), but he does assert that the
gap he has encountered in the literature on small-scale community history or educational
history in New Mexico encouraged him to contribute to the historical enterprise for the
sake of future players and coaches.
There is an element of regional pride to Ford’s work, and this is best described in
his desire to overcorrect for a lack of regional history in New Mexico and in his
comparisons of the West to the Eastern United States. As he says early on in his book,
there is no shortage of works on the frontier period and the so-called “Old West,” but the
rest of the region’s history is lacking, and to his mind, this is a great slight to the “Land of
Enchantment” (Kindle Location 22). Ford’s work seems to reflect a slight inferiority
complex with the East; the first sentence of chapter one illustrates the newness of
education to the region – he begins by noting that
[i]n 1830 with Yale, Harvard, and other eastern universities well past their
centennial year, a traveler to Santa Fe wrote, ‘New Mexico’s educational system
is non-existent. If there ever was a place on the globe doing less toward educating
children, I could not name that place, and that for decades the “rich sent their
children to St. Louis or other ‘civilized’ cities” (Kindle Location 127).
The East was the font of education; indeed, Ford notes that the beginning of the school
system in New Mexico came along with the railways and “the easterners with their

125
educated ways,” and at times he seems to echo Frederick Jackson Turner’s Frontier
Thesis, that the West was a place to escape the ruling interests in the East and the sway of
established institutions of higher education (Kindle Location 153; Turner, 1920). Ford
goes so far as to lament: “No wonder those ‘easterners’ think we are not a part of the
United States. No one has bothered to record our twentieth century history for
information” (Kindle Location 45). By working so hard to capture this early period,
Ford’s complaint may be satisfied.
Finally, Ford acknowledges that he was encouraged in this task by other
sportswriters, coaches, and fans to produce this compendium of history and statistics, and
more than anything else, this admission clarifies his relationship to other local sports
enthusiasts and newswriters, as well as his heritage in the area. Many coaches (often
unnamed) provided photographs to accompany and clarify events, games, and storylines.
Although Ford (as he explains in his biography) has been a banker since 1969, and
works as the Chairman of the Board at Pine River Valley Bank in Bayfield… [h]is
passion has always been history and a love for high school sports. He is the selfproclaimed ‘Voice of the Wolverines” in Bayfield and can be found at the gym or
on the field anytime that games are being played (Kindle Locations 98-100).
As Bayfield, Colorado is a short bus ride away from the New Mexico border, it is highly
possible that many of the teams Ford studied played his Wolverines. The overlap of
relationships – to other broadcasters, followers, and fans – is clearly laid out for readers.
While most professional historians would happily argue that there is no such thing
as an “unbiased” history, Ford notes here that he has taken great pains to present this
book with an air of impartiality (Kindle Location 57). His focus was on the winners and

126
“near-winners,” as well as those who made valuable contributions to the development of
the sport in the region. He explains that he
…tried to relate the sometimes-colorful stories that happened off the field but
affected the course of football history anyway… [but] purposely avoided the
tragic issues of the infighting of politics that affects all phases of our society.
There are no efforts to place blame for any eligibility violations, coach’s
dismissals, or racial problems (Kindle Location 61).

Rooting The History of New Mexico High School Football in the History of
Education in the State of New Mexico
While a great deal of Ford’s work reads like a sports statistician enthusiast’s love
and appreciation for scores and sacks made and first downs, the most enthralling portions
of the book are the early chapters that focus on New Mexico before 1950. Ford
complains early on that he was unable to find a comprehensive overview of education in
the region before this period, and as a result, he has had to contextualize and build a
narrative from scratch. It is in these chapters that he is not simply reciting factoids or
setting a scene for a game; rather, he is illuminating to the readers how schools formed,
adopted the sport for their students, and initiated gameplay with one another.
Like many historians of the American West before him, Ford begins a history of
education in the region with the colonial experience and sets the stage with the colonial
enterprise. Although he takes great pains to include American Indian teams in this early
history, he does not describe or contextualize the history of football in Jicarilla Apache,
Navajo, or Pueblo-dwelling peoples’ education, or even their sports and games. It is very

127
likely that Ford took this perspective – lending the colonial process additional weight and
authority by giving it the start date – without any ill-intention; traditional histories of the
United States often begin with Columbian contact, and Ford was likely drawing on
sources already familiar to him. As Ford makes no mention of higher training, and as he
attended school in the 1960s, it is very likely that he experienced an introduction to the
field long before, as Geoff Eley describes it, “interdisciplinarity had yet to haunt the
corridors of history departments” (Eley, p. 1). Ford, who certainly means to overturn and
right some wrongs with this work (particularly regarding the slights and indignities
suffered by student-athletes of color), would likely have altered his beginning or restated
it if he had the opportunity to even consider such a progressive perspective.
Regardless of the problematic nature of his starting point, in Ford’s work, the
history of education in New Mexico begins with Spanish missionary efforts, and as
American interests in the region grew and eventually asserted political authority, contract
Indian schools formed and were authorized by congress. According to Ford, as railways
advanced across the state, public education followed in their wake, and prep schools
formed, as did Indian schools. Four public high schools were founded in 1891 in
Albuquerque, East Las Vegas, Raton, and Silver City. In 1886, the government took over
the Indian School in Albuquerque that had formerly been run by the Presbyterian Church
Mission Board (according to Ford, some sources claim 1884), and by 1893, the
Albuquerque Indian School and Albuquerque High were both fielding football teams, and
both regularly played against the University of New Mexico. By 1914, the New Mexico
Journal of Education noted that there were 40 high schools serving the public, but these
did not include the Albuquerque Indian School or the Santa Fe Indian School. Indeed, by

128
building a narrative that includes these other high schools, Ford presents readers with an
enriched view of education in New Mexico.

Indian School Rivalries and Football in Albuquerque and Santa Fe
For the outsider to New Mexico high school football, and to anyone reading this
work with the intention of placing it in a broader history of the state, the great and untold
story that Dan Ford has carved out of his newspaper sources is that of the Indian Schools
and their involvement in competitive sports. The history of Indian Schools in the United
States has, to this point, largely been a tragedy. Indian Schools, born out of a supposed
need to assimilate American Indians to the white, Anglo culture of the United States, tell
a history of the Protestant assertion of power and authority over formerly Catholiccontrolled areas (Prucha,1979), and the widescale abuse of children at the hands of
school administrators and teachers (Adams, 1995; Giago, 2006; Lomawaima, 2000), all
of which has resulted in what Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart and Lemyra M. Debruyn
have called “historical unresolved grief” (1998).
Ford’s inclusion of Indian Schools in the history of education and student
athleticism in the area is not wholly unique (indeed, much has been made of American
Indians involvement in sport and the ramifications of that in John Bloom’s To Show What
an Indian Can Do: Sports at Native American Boarding Schools, 2005), but discussing
these teams seamlessly with other public schools’ athletics lends a fresh kind of
egalitarianism to their history. American Indian involvement in sport is often divorced
from the history of public schools, and Ford discusses both in the same breath. This is
not to say that there are not slights and disservices that students at the Indian Schools

129
faced – there are many, and Ford has taken pains to note them in The History of New
Mexico High School Football – but his approach – to recount their statistics, to note their
wins and losses, to describe their great players in the same way and in the same breath as
any other public school team – is an unusual one.
According to Ford’s research, the Albuquerque Indian School “fielded its first
team and played the University of New Mexico on December 1, 1893” (Kindle Location
213). Many high schools did not have the financial wherewithal to support football
teams, so it was difficult to find other teams to play against, and in the early years these
schools supplemented sparse schedules by playing colleges or universities. In an edition
of The Weekly Citizen, a Bernalillo newspaper, Ford discovered a full account of the
game, and reproduced the entire thing in the book. This is the only fully copied narrative
of a game in Ford’s work, important for the outcome it addresses (the victory of the
Albuquerque Indian School’s football team over the University of New Mexico’s football
team), for the detailed narrative about the game and the reception of the Indian School
student athletes by the University fans, and the decision from the Indian School’s
superintendent to weigh both teams before the game.
The Weekly Citizen’s report of the game was unusual; Ford explains that there
was no rundown of plays, no highlights of significant sacks or tackles, and no reference
as to those who scored points. They provided a full list of players and their respective
positions from both teams, and in the case of the Indian School, they noted tribal
affiliation for each member: “[t]he victorious eleven of the Indian school were: Oliver
Walington, captain, Howard Sandison, Wm Stevens, John Thomas, Sam Randall, Wm
Percy, all Pima Indians: Ramon Johnson, a Papago; Ross Londen, Jose Yuma, Andrew

130
Rendon, Acomas, and Purley from Laguna” (Kindle Location 236). No mention is made
of any specific players, from either team, in any other part of the article.
The Albuquerque Indian School experienced quite a bit of ribbing and jeers from
its opponents’ fans, but if they were subject to racial remarks or hostility in that regard,
The Weekly Citizen did not report it. Rather, it noted that,
[a]s soon as the people began to assemble the Indian boys were accosted with
such statements as 'You are beaten today!' 'You won't be in it at all', 'The
Universities are coming for blood!' and other similar expressions. These
expressions had a tendency to intimidate the Indians to some extent, but as soon
as Superintendent Creager was appraised of the fact he went to his boys and
enthused them as much as he could by telling them they were well made, strong
and athletic. At this they took courage and assured him they would win if they
could. (Kindle Location 240).
While not a stellar display of sportsmanship from the University’s fans, it does not seem
terribly dissimilar from anything one might overhear at any high school football game in
the present (if that was indeed all the Albuquerque Indian School team heard).
The Weekly Citizen did take pains to romanticize and build an arc to the story of
the Indian School overcoming obstacles and intimidation to win the game, but it seems
that Superintendent Creager (who is mentioned more in the article than any player or
coach from either team) served as a kind of hype man for the team: boosting their energy
when they were down, emphasizing their strengths and talents, and even creatively (albeit,
unsuccessfully) trying to find a way to highlight their equal status with the university
team. As the newspaper recounted:

131
‘When the University team was driven onto the grounds with their friends singing
'Rah, rah, rah for the Universities' another wave of discouragement swept over the
faces of the Indians. Superintendent Creager at once noticed this and thought to
remove it by having the teams weighed. He and his Indian boys felt sure of
victory, if the University team was not more than 90 pounds heavier than the
Indian team. On weighing the teams it was found that the Universities weighed
140 pounds more than the Indians. The Indian boys walked silently onto the
grounds feeling that 140 pounds and the sympathy of the visitors against them
were great odds to overcome’ (Kindle Location 244).
How exactly Creager got both teams to submit to a weigh-in before the game, or how
both teams’ respective weights were established, is unclear. It is possible that a largescale industrial machine existed on the premise, and a whole team weighed in at once, or
each player was asked to weigh himself at a time, and the total weight of both teams was
simply added together (surely a painstaking process if repeated 22 times, and one that
would allow warmed-up players to grow cold). Either way, Creager’s bet that the weight
difference was not so dissimilar proved to be incorrect, and as the paper explains, hurt
rather than helped the team’s pre-game frame of mind.
All of this build-up to the game – the rallying of the University fans, the
demoralized perspective of the Albuquerque Indian School players – makes the Indian
School’s victory all the more thrilling. While they beat the University team 10-4, the
paper explains that the margin should have been even greater, that the “umpires” misread
a play and gave the University opportunities for additional plays when they should not
have (Kindle Location 235). Further, the paper notes that the Indian School not only won

132
the day, but even won over the other team’s fans, saying that “[a]t intervals applause
went up, the Indian boys getting a full share” and the University’s team treated them with
great respect and “gentlemanly” attitudes (Kindle Location 242). At the end of the writeup, the newspaper writer also emphasized the discrepancy in ages between the two
groups of players, as if to further highlight the great feat and achievement from the
Albuquerque Indian School, saying that “[t]he average age of the Indian boys as shown
by the records is 17. Three are only 15 years of age” (Kindle Location 244).
In this case, younger Albuquerque Indian School players were likely at a
disadvantage for size and strength, but age was not nearly as regulated and managed in
high school sports in the private and public spheres in the first half of the twentieth
century as the present. Capstone age restrictions were certainly loose in the early years,
especially in the Indian Schools, as Ford explains,
[c]oncerning the provision of age, it is important to understand the makeup of
schools, particularly private schools, during that period. Albuquerque Indian
School, for instance, had students only through the 10th grade until its first
graduating class of 1927. However, before 1915 they had players as old as 24
years old. This may explain why those schools were so competitive with the
colleges of the period. The NMHSAA [New Mexico High School Athletic
Association] was so informal during its infancy that even today the founding is
considered to have been 1921. And, although its age rule seemed firm, schools
like AIS still played young adults even as late as 1935 (Kindle Locations 490494).

133
Knowing the informality of such age restrictions, and the particularly lax rules the
Albuquerque Indian School had about cobbling teams together out of players of all ages
may speak to the reasoning why the Albuquerque Indian School would be slighted so
many times in the future – rebuffed from other playing opportunities by rival teams – but
that is never mentioned.
Notably, by the 1930s, the Albuquerque Indian School (AIS) had established an
ongoing and competitive rivalry with Albuquerque High. The Albuquerque Indian
School regularly played games against teams as far away as Chilocco, Oklahoma, the
Phoenix Indian School, and even El Paso High, and went undefeated in New Mexico in
1934 (Kindle Location 1417). Unfortunately, their strong winning streak in 1935 led to
hostility between AIS and Albuquerque High. That year, Albuquerque High School
experienced a catastrophic loss to the Indian School (50-0), and “Albuquerque High was
so enraged by the slaughter that they refused to play AIS in football for four years”
(Kindle Location 1492). While Albuquerque High School finished the season “unbeaten
and untied,” and had victories against Dawson, St. Mikes, Gallup, Wingate, Menaul,
Belen, and St. Mary’s, the Albuquerque Indian School was not able to maintain that
winning legacy in the years ahead when schools like Albuquerque High refused to play
them. Being unable to prove themselves repeatedly would certainly have frustrated the
student athletes of Albuquerque Indian School.

Football and captioned: “Coin toss for the last Albuquerque Indian School against
Menaul in 1979, before AIS was consolidated with Santa Fe Indian School” (Kindle
Locations 519-521).

Unfortunately, this was not the first of many slights that the Albuquerque Indian
School would receive from other competitors or even the NMHSAA. By the mid-1960s,
The school had lost enrollment like Menaul and St. Marys [sic] as the city grew
and built more high schools. It still included students over the eligible, athletic,
competing age. Even though those students could not compete for the school, they
were counted in the average daily attendance that determined to what conference
the school belonged. AIS was relegated to Class A through its ADA but opted for
an independent schedule more suited to its brand of football. In 1966, AIS
petitioned the governing body to have the ineligible students excluded from the
ADA so they might drop back into Class B. Without published explanation, that

135
seemingly reasonable request was denied leaving AIS without a league (Kindle
Location 5126-5131).
Ford calls this decision “curious,” (Kindle Location 5125) but offers no judgment on it,
or even conjecture about what might have happened. In this regard, he tries to stay
removed – to foster the kind of impartiality that he said he would attempt in the
introduction – but some guidance, insight, suggestion or contextualization for such a
slight would have been helpful to the reader in this passage. Indeed, many academic
historians often try to do this to understand the reasoning behind a decision or an event’s
outcome, with some aside that it is impossible to know one way or another. Perhaps Ford
did not think it would be valuable to pursue that line of thought without disregarding his
previous claim to be as “unbiased” as possible (Kindle Location 55). Ford’s inability or
unwillingness to offer suggestion, to justify, or to attempt clarification, leaves the book
with more questions than answers, and gives the book clear limitations on the breadth of
Ford’s work.
Ultimately, it is unfortunate that Ford stays silent here. An understanding of the
ways Indian Schools adopted and played against other public schools is critical to a vastly
understudied area of American history: masculinity and white or “civilized” identity
performance by Native Americans through competitive sports in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. In his article, “Playing White Men: American Football and
Manhood at the Carlisle Indian School, 1893—1904,” Bentley explains:
Manhood and its links with sport and assimilation within the Native boarding
school system have received little scholarly examination. Although the wider
educational movement is treated more thoroughly, scholars who have examined

136
gender in the boarding school system have focused their attention on women. As
such, their studies leave a significant gap in current understanding of Native
education in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Just as the
inculcation of ‘femininity’ in female students was a powerful tool of assimilation,
so too was the introduction of white notions of manhood… The role of manhood
within Native assimilation efforts is a subject still demanding academic
investigation (p. 188).
Bentley’s studies of Carlisle, an Indian School in Pennsylvania, discover that Native
American young men were prompted to play football in order to demonstrate their
adoption of “white values,” namely clean sportsmanship in the face of victory or defeat.
Native American students were prompted to express their masculinity by winning on the
field; and “[t]hrough victory… the players demonstrated their readiness for social
inclusion in white society” (Bentley, 191). Bentley notes that the spectacle that football
offered to the broader community solidified that public commitment to the school’s goal
of civilizing Native Americans. Carlisle football “ …persuaded policymakers and other
patrons of the need for continued funding. Football was a financial lifeline for the school,
in ticket sales and charitable income as well as funding” (191). That football fostered
the Carlisle school’s greater mission – the project of “civilizing” Native Americans to
prevent their extinction – is a fundamental tenet to a modern understanding of the sport’s
significance in Indian schools.
Ford’s work does not offer even a breath of suggestion about Native American or
white identity performance, and indeed, such a subject would likely be out of Ford’s own
area of expertise and may therefore be something he would not feel comfortable offering

137
commentary upon. All the same, Ford has laid a foundation for other scholars like
Bentley to explore such topics; his considerable assessment of local newspapers is a feat
in and of themselves, and any scholar wishing to utilize Bentley’s subject of masculine
identity performance in Indian schools through sport in a New Mexico context would
find Ford’s work quite valuable.

Conclusion
The History of New Mexico High School is a rich history and likely the first of its
kind on that subject and in that region. Unlike the other self-published works studied
here, Ford has written a history that does not prominently feature himself or his family.
Although Ford played high school football in the region, he is not a critical character in
the storyline of his work, and he clearly asserts that he has tried to maintain a style of
professional distance from his subject by staying as impartial as possible. This was a
brave act; as Beckett says in Writing Local History, “[l]ocal historians have often been
intimidated by this professional view from among those practicing what they choose to
call ‘proper’, or national history,” (p. 3) and that intimidation often led to silence.
However,
…as W.G. Hoskins pointed out in the 1950s, the in-depth study of a local
community was likely to uncover an entirely new theme or issue. It is not the size
or composition of the unit of study, whether the parish, the town, the county, the
region, or even the nation, which is the issue, so much as the ends in view and the
methods used. Local history, in other words, needed to justify itself by its results
not its claims. History is the result of rigorous analysis the sources, thoughtful

138
assessment of the methods, and clear presentation of properly assessed findings.
Local and national history are both history, and both need to be treated and
studied under the same rigorous conditions, whether by university academics for
their doctoral theses, or interested amateurs examining their house, street, or
parish (Beckett, p. 3).
In line with Beckett’s assertion that local history justifies itself with its methods
and results, and not by subject, Ford’s greatest contribution to history in the region is his
adamancy on the inclusion of Indian schools in what is otherwise a history of football in
the public school system. His history explores the relations between these schools, their
rivalries, and the way they built teams and made records. This method results in an
unusually integrated kind of history and taps into a new conception of American
masculinity in the middle of the twentieth century.
Further, as an exploration of the subject of regional high school football, Ford has
also contested the basic premises of representations of the American past. High school
football is a potent symbol of American masculinity, and that masculinity is often
wrapped up in a predominantly white and middle-class heritage, with great focus on the
problems of integration at mid-century (Kemper, 2009). The inclusion of Indian Schools
in The History of New Mexico High School Football Volume I results in a history that
offers a clarified vision of that past, one that includes additional parties and their
relationships and dynamics, and that questions prevailing notions of 20th century
masculinity conveyed through sport.
Ultimately, the light that Ford’s research casts reveals a multidimensional image
of the history of football in New Mexico. By focusing on a single theme for study, and

139
by only exploring high school football history as it could be retrieved through newspaper
records, Ford has created a cohesive storyline when these schools and communities
would have otherwise been separated and distinct from one another. In this way, a more
nuanced vision of high school football history in the United States appears, and a history
of Indian Schools in the United States is set in a fresh and novel context of sports history
in New Mexico.

CHAPTER 6 – GROWING UP ON A WISCONSIN FARM
Synopsis and Overview
Donna Hutter's GROWING UP ON A WISCONSIN FARM IN THE 1920’S AND
1930'S [sic] Prior to Electricity (hereafter referred to as Growing up on a Wisconsin
Farm) is a very brief collection of anecdotes and photographs that are presumably a
family story of white, Catholic, German-Americans living in and around Sauk County,
Wisconsin. The work itself is extremely brief, akin to a photo book; the Amazon
description page for the work estimates that there are only approximately 29 pages of
anecdotes, and these are accompanied by and complemented by 19 pictures (Amazon,
“Growing up,” 2014). Every photograph except for one is black and white, and most
identify members of one particular family. Only two photographs are of rural settings
without people; they are of two farms, both presumably owned by the family. On the first
page of the work, Hutter, who does not explain herself or her relation or reason for
interest in the individuals described, does note that the work was "[b]ased on Interviews
with 90 and 94 year old [sic] Children of the Farm September 1, 2010" (Hutter, Kindle
Edition Locations 2-11).
While Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm is clearly a labor of love from a devoted
family member, the book succeeds as an honest look at the hardscrabble life of farmers in
rural Wisconsin during the years in and around the Great Depression. As such, it fits into
an already established literature of memoirs of the upper Midwest, but differentiates itself
from other traditional published works with its steadfast detailing of rural women’s work,
and of the impact of new technology on Wisconsinites’ social lives and circles. The
experience of reading the book is necessarily a process in empathy; one cannot examine

141
the book without considering how difficult work in that region and time period must have
been, and this process satisfies Hutter’s great aim – to tell the story of her family’s
workaday life. A microhistorical reading of the text reveals Hutter’s themes, namely, her
exploration of women’s work, and social interaction with technology during the 1920s
and 1930s.
Hutter does not designate chapters in the book, but there are multiple sections as
well as an unmarked introduction. She separates these subjects with bold headers,
although the content often bleeds over from one section to the next, and they include the
following: Food, Cooking, Chores, Clothing, Washing and Drying Clothes, Washing
Dishes, Going to School, The Telephone, Taking a bath, Illness, Religion, Friday Night
Parties, Christmas, Dances, and Togetherness. Understandably, a section dedicated to
“Food” will necessarily segue and blend with “Cooking,” as “Clothing” and “Washing
and Drying Clothes” certainly overlap. “Chores” could conceivably encompass most of
these sections, although it really only discusses the work of children and the family
distribution of household labor. These subject sections are not unique to Hutter’s book;
indeed, When Horses Pulled the Plow, Olaf Larson’s 2011 memoirs of his boyhood in
Southern Wisconsin in the 1910s and 1920s, is broken into chapters which include
similar titles like, “Family, Farm, and Locality,” “The Farmstead and Farmhouse,”
“Patterns of Work and Farm Life,” “Transportation and Communication,” “Country
School and High School” and “Playtime, Pets, and Projects” (Larson, p. v-vi). While
Hutter’s interviewees certainly have their own unique life stories, her approach to
understanding their history is not necessarily novel, even to memoirs of Southern
Wisconsin in the early 20th century.

142
A clue-based, microhistorical methodology is highly appropriate for analyzing
this work because Hutter’s book does not appear to have been written for an external
audience, despite the fact that it was clearly made available for sale and public
distribution. Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm is packed with a family history that would
be difficult and confusing for a general or unrelated reader; family trees have to be
written out and parsed in order to be understood, pulled from dropped hints and named
relatives (e.g., “Uncle Carl”), but even so, relationships between the identified persons
can be unclear.
While a family tree can only be identified by piecing together clues Hutter has left
behind, there is no missing the focus of the work. Hutter begins the book by introducing
Carl Volk (although she does not describe her relationship to him), and he seems to be
the central figure in this extended family. The book opens and closes with stories related
to him, and he is the link between the two central families described here: Joseph Volk
and Theresa Kirschbaum and their children (of which Carl is one), and Carl Volk and
Sadie Mears and their children.
Other memoirs of early twentieth century farm life in the upper Midwest take a
similar approach. Works like Larson’s When Horses Pulled the Plow, Mary Logue’s
Halfway Home: A Granddaughter’s Biography, Marjorie M. Douglas’ Eggs in the Coffee,
Sheep in the Corn: My 17 Years as a Farm Wife, and Sara De Luca’s Dancing the Cows
Home: A Wisconsin Girlhood focus on the routines and, often, the hardships of daily
existence. Hutter’s attentions to her relatives and their lives in rural Wisconsin are not
unique; indeed, all of the works listed above are affiliated with book series that
emphasize and celebrate those experiences. The Wisconsin Land and Life series,

143
associated with the University of Wisconsin Press, has published multiple works
(including When Horses Pulled the Plow) detailing the memories of everyday citizens of
the upper Midwest, as does the Midwest Reflections series (which includes all of the
other aforementioned titles) from the Minnesota Historical Society Press. While
Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm means to tell the unique story of Carl Volk and his
extended family, Hutter has created a book that situates nicely into a literary milieu that
has already been established.
Hutter’s work opens on Carl and his sister Molly Volk, children of Joseph Volk
and Theresa Kirschbaum, who lived in a rented farm and were members of St. Patrick’s
church in Loreto, Wisconsin. They occupied this rented farm, “near highway 23”
presumably in the years before 1909, at which point the brother and sister both were
married and began running independent households. Although they presumably lived
alone before they were married, Carl and Molly had several other siblings from their
parents, and it is unclear why they chose to live together without any of the other children
joining them in this family household.

clues in Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm.
Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm seems to suggest that St. Patrick’s was the hub
of the family’s social sphere. Their rented farm, near highway 23, was not far from the
church and where a cemetery affiliated with St. Patrick’s church still stands. Molly and
Carl both met their future spouses at St. Patrick’s, and at the church on May 5, 1909, “a
double wedding occurred between Carl Volk and Sadie Mears and Molly Volk and Frank
Miese” (Kindle Location 17). Although there was no honeymoon for either couple
(Hutter seems to suggest that this may have been a financial issue), the double-wedding
meant quite a party; and “[t]he reception was at the farm of Joseph and Theresa Volk
with a great meal and dancing. The brothers built a ‘bowry’ [sic] or dance floor of wood”
(Kindle Locations 27-28).

145

Figure 5. As Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm is just as much a photo book as memoir,
images like the one above are common. Hutter has noted that this is an image of “Albert,
Otto, Pauline, Mary, Carl’s Mother Theresa and Sadie [sic] It looks like they’ve been
digging potatoes” (Kindle Location 274).

After a discussion of the wedding, Carl’s life with Sadie and their household
becomes the focal point of the remainder of the book; Molly’s storyline is not pursued to
any degree afterwards. Carl and Sadie bought their own home, still close to St. Patrick’s
church, and for a few years after moved around a bit – owning a general store and post
office in Billytown, then partaking in a small trucking venture in Viola – but eventually
they permanently settled on a 240-acre farm with a run-down, four-bedroom house,
“bought… from Frank Carson,” someone for whom Hutter offers no insight or
explanation (Kindle Locations 48-54). While Hutter does not give any clear indication of
the location of this farm, it is clear that the life experience of the family living on this
particular farm is the central line to her storytelling mission.

146
Clearing the farm was a family affair; “it was tough looking… [with] dried mud
right up to the house door and… a partition in the kitchen around the slop barrel where
the former owners put scraps of food, etc. to feed the pigs” (Kindle Locations 48-54), but
with the help and hard work of Carl’s siblings, Carl and Sadie made the home livable
with fresh wall paper and paint, and a great deal of cleaning. The farm – a working one –
had 40 acres of woods, as well hogs, chickens, milk cows, crops for sale, a vegetable
garden, and a strawberry patch, and the maintenance of such a space must have been
considerable.
This household, eventually full with Carl and Sadie’s seven children: Jim, Martin,
Joe, Teresa, Helen, Mary, and Veronica, who was called Bonnie, also regularly hosted
“guests” who may or may not have been relatives, acquaintances, or simply people in
need. While Hutter never explicitly says that the economic downturn that crippled the
United States in the 1920s and 1930s had a role to play in the size of the Volk household,
she does hint at this:
At various times, so many people were living with them that there was very little
privacy. Uncle Jim Mears and Aunt Lizzie Quinn lived there and other people
who shouldn’t have been there. Carl and Sadie would never turn anyone away and
always shared what they had with these people. When Wayne courted Helen, he
said he didn’t see any of these extra people putting anything on the table and
expressed his thought as ‘Carl Volk’s Boarding House’. These people lived there
but they didn’t work as hired hands. They would go out in the woods and help get
up the wood but Carl and Sadie were the providers (Kindle Locations 76-80).

147
Why or how these individuals (or possibly whole family units) found the Volk’s home is
unclear; no mention is ever made of their homes, whether or not they were members of a
transient population, or if they were friendly to the Volks through external associations
like the church. Hutter offers no comment or criticism beyond the above paragraph, and
relates only that some witnesses knew that “these people” were outsiders who “shouldn’t
have been there” or otherwise did not belong to this particular nuclear-family household.
The hardships of the depression and the migratory status of many rural
farmworkers are touched on in other works on the social history of the upper Midwest.
In When Horses Pulled the Plow, Larson notes that hired workers serving his father’s
farm were often unattached men without families, and as such, they were able to move
freely from job to job as harvesting cycles demanded. These men were not strangers to
adversity, and Larson alludes that many of them turned to alcohol in times of despair and
suffered addiction as a result (p. 88).
However they arrived, the work of caring for this great multitude of people in the
Volk’s 4-bedroom farmhouse was considerable, and this discussion makes up a great deal
of the rest of the book. After the description of the Volk’s permanent farm and the
people who lived there, Hutter breaks out into the following sections: “Food,” “Cooking,”
“Chores,” “Clothing,” “Washing and Drying Clothes,” “Washing Dishes,” “Going to
School,” “The Telephone,” “Taking a bath,” “Illness,” “Religion,” “Friday Night Parties,”
“Christmas,” “Dances,” and “Togetherness.” It is in these paragraphs that Hutter renders
a clearer depiction of rural life in the upper Mid-West during the Great Depression, and
the poverty that bled into every element of daily life is a thematic element in every
section.

148

Women’s Work
While Hutter’s book never explicitly states that it intentionally focuses on
women’s work or child household labor situated in the management and running of a
farm, it would be extremely clear to any reader or layperson that this is the book’s
greatest service to local history. Hutter’s mission, indeed, her aim noted even in the title,
is to understand and to convey the way things were, but any understanding of the time
period and region, or the lifestyle of those she wants to remember, must be rooted in the
actual daily private events. The sections Food, Cooking, Chores, Clothing, Washing and
Drying Clothes, and Washing Dishes all center and focus on Sadie Volk and her
household labor. Although Carl Volk’s daily work was surely considerable too, Hutter
takes no great pains to discuss it, and while Sadie herself is not discussed or described to
any great length, her daily labor is. Sadie’s dedication to finding what Eleanor Roosevelt
called the “endless little economies” (Roosevelt 1933, p. 8) certainly kept her family
going in the impoverished times. Hutter’s lengthy service to a woman’s daily labor in her
work is a feminist action; it orients the book to a perspective that values women’s efforts
and places them at the forefront of a family history.
Sadie’s involvement in feeding the many people who lived at her house was
considerable; according to Hutter, she
…made 40 loaves of bread a week… [and] baked every day but Sunday. Sadie
also always made desserts—pies, cakes, pudding from scratch… Besides bread,
they would eat mashed or fried potatoes, sauerkraut, lettuce, pork and chicken…
[and t]here was a big garden and Sadie would worry about the weather so they

149
had a good crop. They preserved the food by salting it and canning it and putting
it in the cellar to stay cool, especially potatoes. They had to put stuff away quickly
after it was ripe. Sadie canned some pickles. Potatoes and sauerkraut were
mainstays in the diet (Kindle Location 83).
Food preservation, in and of itself a time consuming and difficult task even with modern
household equipment, requires correct temperatures for sealing and sterilized canning,
and this would have been extremely difficult to manage with Sadie Volk’s rudimentary,
wood-burning stove. While Hutter does not describe the way these necessary measures
were ensured by Sadie, she must have kept a watchful eye on this process to ensure safe
eating in the future, and Hutter never notes if anyone ever became ill with botulism or
any other canning-related disease later.
Hutter has put quite a lot of effort into emphasizing the preparation and cleanup
that every cleaning procedure required. For example, she describes the work of washing
clothes as painstaking and difficult and arduous, and certainly any layperson who has
studied frontier life even in the most straightforward way would understand this, but she
also takes care to describe the work necessary that preceded the washing and drying
process:
[First t]he copper boiler had to be filled with water and placed on the wood stove
to heat. It took a lot of pumping before the water started to flow out of the spout.
The children took turns pumping because one person would get too tired. Rinse
water also had to be prepared. At first, they used just a scrub board to get the
clothes clean and put the clothes in hot water in the boiler to get the whites white.
Then they were rinsed and hung with wooden clothes pins outside to dry. There

150
was no "wrinkle free setting" then. Metal flat irons were set on the stove to heat
up, used until cool to iron clothes, set back on the stove and another already hot
iron was used to continue ironing. The washing was often more than a one day
job, depending on the amount of clothes. The overalls often had to be washed
another day. You just couldn't scrub on the board all day long. Your back would
get too sore. The table in the middle of the kitchen had to be moved to the side
and the washing machine had to be brought into the house. Everything had to be
filled with water. When you were done washing, the water had to all be thrown
outside and the floor had to be mopped because there would be water that dripped
while moving the clothes. It was a lot of work (Kindle Location 125).
These details get at the "how" of so many of these chores; Hutter highlights the ways
little efficiencies were managed into a weekly routine; two irons were in use
simultaneously – one heating on the stove, the other being used until no longer workable
– in order to save time, and multiple hands and substitutes at the pump needed to be
involved in order to make the process feasible and effective. Often, the realities of rural
or frontier life and work are described by authors and historians as difficult, and chores
are usually listed in a painstaking but simplistic way. Hutter’s book fills a void and
benefits the reader because it either assumes that the reader knows very little about what
the laundry process would have entailed, or it means to doggedly detail every element of
hard labor that Sadie Volk put in to the regular maintenance of a household in service and
memory to her.
Additionally, as so many chores had to be completed, many were done
simultaneously. For example, bread dough rose in the background of all this labor; Sadie

151
"made 6 or 7 loaves a day," and that regularly meant halting whatever other task she was
involved in to dedicate time to punching or kneading dough, or to shifting loaves on or
off of heat sources (to bake, or to rise), to continuously check the status of a baking loaf,
and finally to remove loaves from pans at the right time to avoid sticking or hardening.
On top of constant baking, hot water was constantly being kept up on the kettle to wash
dishes or to start meals, or even to keep a steam kettle going (although it was unclear why
this humidifier was necessary or what exact purpose it served), and this meant the
constant maintenance of a fire, and therefore the constant maintenance of a woodpile,
from timber chopped down on their own land and acreage.
Hutter notes the ways technology altered Sadie’s working lifestyle over time.
Eventually, Sadie had a non-electric washing machine with a manual turn-crank that
agitated laundry (still a labor intensive device, but certainly easier than a washboard and
a bar of Fels Naptha soap). Although the agitator was helpful, Sadie still had to heat and
fill two tubs with water (the tub for washing/agitating laundry, and the other for rinsing),
and the preparatory work required to start the laundry and the wringing, hanging, and
finally, mopping the floors afterwards did not necessarily change.
The process of washing dishes by hand was largely similar to doing the laundry.
While the manual work of scrubbing was certainly the critical element of both procedures,
they both had necessary before-and-after work of pumping and hauling water, heating
that water, setting up washing and rinsing basins, and finally hauling that water out
afterwards. This set up and then disassembling of the cleaning station would have been a
considerable part of that labor. Hutter explains that the same soap was used in both
processes, and this was certainly problematic; the use of Fels Naptha, a laundry soap

152
dating back to the 1890s, for the washing of dishes, suggests either a lack of access to a
variety of soaps for consumer use or insufficient cash for conveniences such as these.
Because Fels Naptha does not remove grease the way other dish detergent soaps typically
do, rinse water and wash water all had to be markedly hotter than laundry water (Kindle
Locations 160-163), requiring more prep time.
The history of women – particularly women whose lives have intersected with
lower class, rural poverty – is often tied up to the preparation of food for household
consumption. The history of food has become en vogue in the field in the last decade
(e.g., Salt: A World History, Kurlansky; An Edible History of Humanity, Standage;
Banana: The fate of the fruit that changed the world, Koeppel; Spice, The History of a
Temptation, Turner; Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How it
Transformed our World, Pendergrast), and feminist scholars have urged on the need for
female inclusion in this story (particularly in works like Who cooked the last supper?
Miles; A Thousand Years Over a Hot Stove, Schenone; From Betty Crocker to Feminist
Food Studies: Critical Perspectives, Avakian). Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm, with
Hutter’s dogged attention to detailing workday tasks, a picture emerges of Sadie Volk as
a woman who was knowledgeable in animal husbandry, capable of creating palatable
meals with inexpensive and calorically and nutritionally enriching elements, and willing
to dedicate a great amount of time to long-term food preparation. A story of household
cooking is not just that; it is also a story of one woman’s creative solutions to the difficult
problem of feeding a large and extended family in lean times.
The description of the Volk’s diet and the creation of food staples; while set
decidedly in the 20th century, still speak to a pre-industrial time. Their diet contained

153
very few industrially produced products. Potatoes were stored and set aside, fresh
vegetables were pickled or canned, cabbages were shredded and set aside in sauerkraut
crocks. As eggs were a critical food source, baby chicks were raised inside year round,
and carefully doted on in the winter. Chicken was an important food source too, and a
lay reader would easily assume that the fostering of cockerels or the eating of nonproducing hens allowed for this addition to the diet. Cabbage, in its raw and pickled
forms, often touted a humble peasant food, often retained the kind of nutrients (e.g.,
Vitamin C) needed when “fruit was scarce,” as it often was for the Volk family (Kindle
Location 172). Pigs were occasionally slaughtered and pork was scalded and butchered
down by Carl Volk, but this seems to have been a special occasion. Given that meat was
relatively rare (beef, in particular, made for a special event), it was often supplemented in
dishes that extended the fat and flavor of meat into starch fillers and roux, like meatloaf,
stews, and gravies. While a great many benefits of modern technology would come to
the Volk family in this period, their diet, in this regard, seems decidedly pre-industrial,
and meat was a unique treat rather than a daily consumable.
Electricity brought a marked change and improvement in lifestyle for the Volk
family. Hutter lays this squarely at the feet of Franklin Roosevelt in the middle of the
section on “Washing and Drying Clothes,”
Then, Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, was elected and they got electricity.
They were then in heaven because they no longer had the lamps to take care of,
the washing was much easier, although water still had to be pumped and hauled
for the house, and you could have refrigeration. They did have water pumped by
motor in the barn for the cows. They never did get an electric stove. Sadie

154
continued to cook with the wood burning stove because they had plenty of wood
on the farm. It was very hard work for Carl and his helpers to cut down the trees
and saw the wood. Wood burning stoves were nice to let stuff simmer all day long,
including the tea kettle (Kindle Locations 150-155).
Situating the daily work experience of the Volks in the greater background of Roosevelt
recovery and improvement roots a specific experience into a broader national scene, and
further still, allows the reader a glimpse at the way rural Americans like the Volks might
have reacted and responded to New Deal electrification projects and perceived the
president as a result of those policies. Economizing during the Depression may have
been easier for rural farming families; many scholars have suggested that farm families
(not those impacted by the Dust Bowl) often lacked access to consumer goods and did
not regularly partake in a cash economy, and they were able to enhance their household
economic situation by working on their farm and maximizing that production, without
concern over layoffs, unemployment, or cut wages (Cravens, 2009). The Volks’ daily
hardships were still considerable, and any opportunity to lessen their enormous workload
or to take part in leisure activities would certainly improve their quality of life.

Technology and Social Interaction
The electrification and extension of telephone lines to rural Wisconsin, in addition
to shortening the workload for daily household chores, also created and fostered new
opportunities for entertainment and socialization. Social gatherings, particularly parties
centered around music and dancing, were nothing new to the people of Wisconsin in the
1920s, but advanced technologies certainly facilitated these events, as Hutter makes clear.

155
This could mean improved music, or superior communication for the arrangement of
dates for parties, or even fresh opportunities for subversive neighborly nosiness. The
period of time that Hutter means to capture – the 1920s and 1930s – certainly witnessed
powerful technological change all across the United States, and other memoirs addressing
this period note this too. Larson, in his work When Horses Pulled the Plow, says,
I grew up when inventions, new ways of doing things, were appearing. We got
our first automobile in 1926; before that we went by horse-drawn vehicle – buggy,
wagon, cutter, bobsled. The first tractor in the area was a curiosity. Listening to
the radio was something new. Few farms had electricity; we did not. The sound
and sight of an airplane was so unusual that we would stop work in the field to
watch (p. xxiv).
Hutter takes a different tack by addressing the ways these technologies shaped the daily
lives of those who likely had the most meager access to it, and as such, is insightful for
anyone trying to understand rural Wisconsin in such a time.
In her section on “The Telephone,” Hutter explains that individual lines were
impossible in the early days of telephone infrastructure; multiple neighbors had to share a
line and the local operator filtered calls to the correct household as necessary. For the
Volks, “each household had its own ring but the neighbors would all hear the ring and
know who was being called,” and the Volks could recognize their “two long, two short”
ring tone that had been designated to them by the operator. Problematically, this party
line system did not prevent outside households from listening in on personal calls; Hutter
notes that in order to eavesdrop on their neighbors, “You would wait until it stopped
ringing and lift the receiver quietly so you could hear what was being said. This was

156
known as ‘rubbering or rubber necking’ [sic]” (Kindle Location 180). The opportunity to
snoop on neighbors’ conversations was apparently a great draw to every household, and
although Hutter never goes into greater detail, one may assume that every household
listened in on the others from time to time.
This shared line also had its benefits; it meant that multiple households could be
alerted to something at once, and in this way, it fostered an unusual kind of connection
between neighbors, because “[i]f the phone rang and it was 4 short rings, you knew
something had happened in the neighborhood and everyone got on the line to hear.” A
different kind of situational awareness – one that offered security in the knowledge that
neighbors could be alerted to one another’s emergencies – would surely have emerged.
Instantaneous information and instantaneous response, particularly in a rural and
disconnected area, would have reoriented the social fabric away from isolation; it would
lend a comfort that an operator could connect you to someone you knew who was
(relatively) nearby. The ability to share news in an instantaneous way would have been
both a novel addition to daily life as well as a helpful tool in the event of emergencies.
The party line also invited unusual group participation in entertaining activities
when physical visits and parties (i.e., as a result of snow) would not have been possible.
Hutter explains that the Volks, particularly James, Martin, and Aunt Liz, “would have the
operator ring 4 short rings at noon and then they would play music on their instruments
for all the neighbors to listen. People didn’t have radios so the three of them would play
fox trots, jigs and waltzes for everyone on the phone line” (Kindle Location 180). This
kind of friendly, casual performance would have been supplemental to the Friday night
parties the Volks were already famous for hosting, in which a large meal would be served,

157
the living room cleared, and dances held regularly. The offering of musical
entertainment from the Volk household would have been a natural extension of the kind
of lifestyle they already maintained.
The Volk family’s musicianship was certainly developed as a result of modern
technology. Later on in the book, Hutter explains that Jim (presumably James; Hutter
seems to use this nickname interchangeably), Martin, and Aunt Liz(zie) all could play the
“violin, mandalin [sic] guitar, and banjo” (Kindle Location 210). They had no formal
training; they had learned to play by ear and “from listening to the records they played on
their Victorola [sic]” (Kindle Location 210). Their record choices were limited by
availability and whatever cash they had on hand for Christmas presents, paid for with
“egg money,” presumably small amounts earned by selling eggs to neighbors or other
community members whenever possible (Kindle Location 221). Although the purchase
of this media was certainly at a very small scale, it does convey the way a homogeneous
resource (uniform print runs of records) could influence the creation of spontaneous live
music, shared over nationally instated phone wires; folk music born, fostered, and shared,
all clearly products of the industrial early 20th century.
Ultimately, Hutter’s book is steeped in the mundane and the everyday; this is its
greatest strength, certainly, as it gets to the daily reality of the way people lived their lives,
but it can leave important defining elements out. For example, even the brief section on
religion says nothing about the family’s beliefs; rather, it relates the story of two of Carl
and Sadie’s daughters taking first communion together although one of them was quite
young for such a milestone, and another story in which Sadie gave their local priest
permission to discipline her sons while they were studying catechism with him. In

158
Hutter’s quotation of Sadie: “ ‘When they are at home, I am the boss. When they are with
you, you are the boss. Don’t be sending them home to me if they do something wrong.
Take care of it while they are with you’ ” (Kindle Locations 215-216). Hutter provides
no greater understanding of their faith, nor does she illuminate how often the family went
to church or how they were active within the church community. These two anecdotes
are the only things mentioned in an entire section on religion; there is no exposition, no
summary, and no endnote. Either Hutter has assumed that the reader has a body of
knowledge about the Catholic faith and church identity as it existed in the Volk’s
community, and can easily contextualize on their own, or Hutter has written this book
specifically for a familiar or familial audience.
All things considered, there is no overarching summary of how the Volk’s
storyline can be situated into the greater county experience. Hutter’s work is a personal
history in the most profound sense; it does not ever take a bird’s-eye view of the Volks as
they lived and worked in rural Wisconsin, nor does it definitively explain who the Volks
were and their relationships to one another and to the author. The book reads very much
like it was written for a known audience; that anyone opening this book would
necessarily know who “Aunt Josie and Uncle Art” were without introduction (without
some creative mapping and tracking on the part of the reader), and would not need Hutter
to situate the Volks in a greater social web in order to make sense of the book.

Conclusion
More than any other self-published work analyzed here, Growing up on a
Wisconsin Farm is a memoir for a closed audience. Although Hutter has made her work

159
available to anyone with access to Amazon, the work does not suit such a broad
consumer base. An uninformed reader, trying to imagine the place, people, and time
Hutter describes in the book would likely suffer confusion about the cast of characters,
their relationship to one another, and the presence they had in their community. In spite
of these indicators of a lack of quality in a published book, Hutter has achieved
something else wholly important to understanding the history of the region: she has
situated one woman’s daily labor in the center of the story of a family and rural
household. While other voices have emerged in the history of published memoir in the
upper Midwest, they have not fixated on the hardships of the everyday the way Hutter’s
work has. Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm, messy and flawed though it is, is no less
worthy than a traditionally published memoir like When Horses Pulled the Plow or Eggs
in the Coffee, Sheep in the Corn; indeed, Hutter’s memoir spends more persistent focus
on the daily life of a farming woman than other works that mean to study the same rural
existence. By so doing, Hutter gives credence and authority to a notion that Sadie Volk’s
labor, ingenuity, and care – whether it was for her immediate family, distant relatives,
and even transient, out-of-work people during the Great Depression – mattered. Growing
up on a Wisconsin Farm excels at placing a woman’s life and the household labor that is
so often unnamed, unmentioned, and unseen, at the center of a family story.
Additionally, and because Hutter’s focus is so narrow, and so focused on the
minutiae of the everyday, it provides readers with a truly detailed vision of the changing
impact of technology on the lives of rural Wisconsinites. A bird’s eye view, top-down
history might include a throwaway sentence about the scale of rural electrification in
Wisconsin and the adoption of the telephone into citizens’ households, but Hutter shows

160
her readers, more explicitly than a traditional history ever would, how individuals used
these phones, to what end and for what purpose, and then directly relates how their use
impacted their social lives and networks. It is her connection to this place, and to the
people who populate this history, that gives Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm such spirit
and value. As standpoint theory suggests, Hutter is able to give credence and credibility
to her research because of her intimacy with its subject.
The power of Hutter’s book lies in its ability to force readers into a state of
empathy with the Kirschbaum-Volk family. By providing her audience with the intimate
details of daily life, Hutter’s readers consider the work of pumping water, kneading
dough, ironing clothes, and hauling wood. The reader can see and imagine the live music
coming in over the telephone and the familiarity those performances fostered between
neighbors. Hutter has given her audience the opportunity to consider the history of poor,
rural Wisconsinites by providing that audience with a history as close as possible to a felt
experience. The work does not pretend to achieve any kind of historical distance or to
provide objective analysis. Hutter has written an unmediated family history; she has
summarized the accounts of her relatives, included her own testimony when appropriate,
and made no claim about the creation of an objective history. The result is a book that is
both a primary and a secondary source for others to view and consider, but a book that
must be read critically for its closeness to the subject and characters. The detailing of the
lives of rural Wisconsinites in the 1920s and 1930s lends a fresh, rich and thoughtful
perspective to another branch of an already established body of local history.

CHAPTER 7: INDICATORS OF QUALITY, DISCOVERABILITY, AND
ACCESSIBILITY
Tails of the Prairie, Reflections of an Octogenarian, The History of New Mexico
High School Football, and Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm vary widely from one
another in subject matter and style, but as books that have been sold in Amazon’s
propriety Kindle format and distributed in Amazon’s Kindle store, they have certain
limitations and certain freedoms of format and style. Whether or not these books are
available in libraries, that they are discoverable and accessible, or discussed by audiences
online, speaks to their potential for distribution in this particular format.
Additionally, a close reading of these works, as detailed in the previous four
chapters, reveals several important insights regarding their respective audiences, their
purposes, and the indicators of their quality. The way a book is marketed and sold – from
the image that is selected for its cover, to the description of the author – suggests who the
real or perceived audience may be, and the investment in the editorial process and
distribution (e.g., hiring an external editor, distributing print versions of the work to
libraries) are all important clues for understanding the author’s intentions for the work.
While the books studied here all have value, they all suffer from some editorial
problems. Value, naturally, is a relative term that a reader may use when considering a
book. In First Monday (2011), Bradley et al explained that,
[a] book has value, we suggest, when it is worthwhile, useful, important,
enjoyable, or entertaining to a reader or group of readers. Books can provide value
in spite of deficiencies in traditional quality. Value is a personal judgment, based
on personality, time, circumstance or any number of other variables. Books may

162
have value based on their strengths, perhaps in spite of their weaknesses. For
example, a compelling plot or storyline can push readers through to the end,
despite some perceived writing weaknesses.
Perceived weaknesses may include writing problems like grammar errors, odd turns-ofphrase, and incorrect syntax, but other issues like odd formatting and/or pagination that
make the text difficult to read, and poor (or nonexistent) cover art may contribute to the
perceived weakness of the final product.
Indicators such as these act as red flags to librarians and others who might consider
purchasing these books; as librarians are curators and custodians of academic or public
library collections, they are tasked with utilizing their budgets to provide the most value
to the greatest number of patrons. As such, self-published works, that have not
undergone a vetting and editing process by a publishing house, are often ignored by
librarians for collection inclusion. Selection of books for purchase is often done very
carefully, and for “librarians, avoiding vanity presses [which have traditionally been
equated with any and all self-published books] was mostly common sense” (Laquintano,
2013, para. 1). The lasting stigma of the fraudulence of the vanity press and selfpublishing industry (Morris, 1974; McDowell, 1982; Appelbaum, 1998; Woliver, 2001,
Freedman, 2012), coupled with some of these indicators of a lack of quality from these
self-published books, may do enough to convince librarians that such books are not worth
consideration for a collection. Unfortunately, first glances do not necessarily reveal the
value of the self-published books studied here, and librarians may not have the time or
the human resources to invest in learning more about their value.

163
The level of authorial and editorial investment into a work to make it clear, easy to
understand, approachable, and, frankly, readable, offers some insight as to the author’s
intentions. If an author chose to write a book for an external audience, and meant for the
work to be received by a broader public, then it necessarily follows that this author would
likely invest time to make sure that the book’s message can be easily understood by an
that audience. If an author wrote a book for an internal or otherwise known audience
(e.g., their family), then that author might not need to introduce familiar subjects,
characters, locations, and so forth. Additionally, exploring the prevalence of these selfpublished work in libraries and in discussion online may lend some clues as to the
author’s intentions for the audience of the work.
Comparing the works studied here by their indicators of quality, and by how
accessible and discoverable they may or may not be, paints a clearer picture of author
intentions. Further, a book-by-book comparison of each work, which follows here,
creates a spectrum of the editorial quality, discoverability, and accessibility of some selfpublished works that exist in the Amazon Kindle store.

Tails of the Prairie
Discoverability and Accessibility
Baldwin's work, while available from early 2013 until late 2014 in Amazon's
Kindle Bookstore, was published at an earlier date through iUniverse, a print-on-demand
self-publishing operation. iUniverse, founded in October 1999, purports to publish more
than 5,000 new titles annually, and the organization also claims that they have worked
with more than 30,000 authors (iUniverse, 2015, About Us). Tails of the Prairie was first

164
copyrighted through iUniverse in 2007, and it is still available as a softcover book from
the iUniverse website (see Figure 2) (iUniverse, 2015, Tails of the Prairie).

Figure 6. Tails of the Prairie: My Life as a Small-Town Veterinarian in Wyoming appears
on the iUniverse website as a softcover book, as seen in this screen shot.

iUniverse self-publishers may purchase ISBN packages; Baldwin purchased two
ISBNs for Tails of the Prairie, a paperback ISBN (978-0-595-47637) and an ebook ISBN
(978-0-595-9101-7). While an ISBN is not necessary for publication in the Amazon
Kindle store, as all Amazon products are assigned an ASIN, it does enhance
discoverability for librarians or library users. An ISBN number, for all intents and
purposes, guarantees a book’s appearance in Bowker Books in Print, or OCLC’s
WorldCat and/or its accompanying Connexion Client, where many public and academic
librarians would be able to encounter it. A search in WorldCat (worldcat.org) lists 12
libraries with access to Tails of the Prairie, as follows: Iowa State University Parks

165
Library in Ames, IA; Bellevue Public Library in Bellevue, Nebraska; James Madison
University Libraries in Harrison, Virginia; Laramie County Library System in Cheyenne,
Wyoming; Crook County Library in Sundance, Wyoming; University of Wyoming
William R. Coe Library in Laramie, Wyoming; Wright Branch Library in Wright,
Wyoming; Campbell County Public Library in Gillette, Wyoming; Henry A. Malley
Memorial Library in Broadus, Montana; Kaycee Branch Library in Kaycee, Wyoming;
Johnson County Library in Buffalo, Wyoming; and Dubois Branch Library in Dubois,
Wyoming. Quite understandably, most of these are located in the state of Wyoming,
where local interest would inform such a purchase.
A search in OCLC’s Connexion Client, where many public or academic librarians
would likely find the necessary information to make a copy of the work’s record, pulls up
a fairly spare record (Figure 4); it lacks a great deal of information that a publishercreated record would likely have, including lengthier or greater topical subject specificity
(620 fields) and one or even multiple summary fields (520).

166

How Tails of the Prairie came to find a home in so many Wyoming libraries is
unclear. Judging from the metadata in the work’s records, it is highly possible that a
local librarian who first encountered this work added an introductory record, and it was
copied and shared among other libraries. The record, spartan as it is, would still be
highly functional for a work that would likely have low turnover, and any librarian
encountering a book without a record could very likely anticipate such a thing.

Promotion and Reviews
Of the four self-published works analyzed here, Tails of the Prairie is by far the
most reviewed. 31 reviews exist on the Amazon page for the paperback edition of the
book, and the reviews suggest that the pages for the Kindle edition and the paperback
edition have merged (reviewers suggest as much). Most incredibly, Tails of the Prairie
has 9 ratings, 4 reviews, and has been marked “to-read” on 452 independent users’
shelves on Goodreads (an Amazon-owned company that started as a social network
oriented on user-reviews of books website) (“Goodreads: Tails of the Prairie,” 2015).
How knowledge of this book has spread is unclear. Perfunctory Google searches
do not reveal any promotional strategy launched by either Baldwin or his editor Kevin
Quirk; and while Publisher’s Weekly does mention the physical edition book as a “New”
self-published title in November of 2015 (although the print edition of the book was in
fact published in 2007), most of the users tagging Tails of the Prairie as a book “to-read”
did so in October of 2015 (Publishers Weekly, “New Titles from Self-Publishers,”
November 2015). It is very possible that Goodreads friends simply shared the title with

167
one another and interest grew that way, or a Goodreads algorithm suggested the book to
users after users read another title with thematic similarities (like Herriot’s All Creatures
Great and Small). Tracing the spread of knowledge about Tails of the Prairie on
Goodreads is impossible for a standard Goodreads user.

Figure 8. A screenshot of the review page for Tails of the Prairie features a review (at the
bottom of the image) from a relative featured as a minor character in one of Baldwin’s
stories.

28 reviews of the Kindle edition and three of the paperback edition of Tails of the
Prairie appear on Amazon, and these lend a great deal of insight as to the kind of reader
of the work. Most readers confess to enjoying the book for its cozy and episodic style;
they refer to the work as “warm,” “quiet,” and “easy reading,” and they suggest that
reading the book is like visiting with an “old friend” (“Customer Reviews, Tails of the
Prairie,” 2015). Many other readers explicitly state that they are interested in the nature
of veterinary work, and four readers openly compare Baldwin to James Herriot, one

168
going so far as to refer to say that Tails of the Prairie is the Western version of All
Creatures Great and Small (“Customer Reviews, Tails of the Prairie,” 2015).
One Amazon review suggests (but certainly does not confirm) that news about the
book’s publication likely spread by word-of-mouth in and around the community
members of Gillette and Sundance (see previous figure). On March 1, 2016, an Amazon
Customer who claimed to have read the paperback edition of the work said, “I thoroughly
enjoyed this book. I am the son of Harold Breen, one of the characters in the chapter
titled BLUE TONGUE. As a result of this book, I have gained a better appreciation of the
life and times of both Dr. Baldwin and my father. Aaron Breen” (“Customer Reviews,
Tails of the Prairie,” 2015). Harold Breen, one of the veterinarians who visited Baldwin
from the state diagnostic laboratory during a bluetongue outbreak, assisted Baldwin in
diagnosing the sheep of the area. It is unclear from the review how Aaron Breen
discovered the work, but his review does note that he made a verified purchase from
Amazon, and it seems highly possible that he heard about the publication of the book
through friends or family members who knew of Tails of the Prairie.
Goodreads reviews of Tails of the Prairie generally take the same tack as Amazon
reviews. The book is well received, and users found were interested both in the “vet
business,” and “books about animals” as well as the time period (which some erroneously
described as the “40’s [sic]” (Goodreads, “Tails of the Prairie,” 2015). No users make
the leap to compare Baldwin or his book to James Herriot or All Creatures Great and
Small, but one user, “LA,” explains that they “mentally ‘heard’ it read in the voice of Dr.
Pol from the TV show. I really enjoyed it” (Goodreads, “LA’s Reviews: Tails of the
Prairie,” 2015). While Jan Pol is a reality TV star, his series “The Incredible Dr. Pol” has

169
many stylistic similarities to All Creatures Great and Small and Tails of the Prairie; all
episodes center on a particular veterinary quandary and patient’s storyline. (National
Geographic, “About Incredible Dr. Pol,” 2015).
Critical reviews of the book note dissatisfaction with Baldwin’s writing style. As
mentioned before, two chapters in one book devoted to problems arising from
transportation issues with mud could exhaust even a dedicated reader, and Amazon
reviewers are no exception. One reader in particular, “Ravcon 1974,” criticizes the
Kindle edition as “dull” and laments that there is “[t]oo much about his traveling…
during bad weather” (Amazon.com “Ravcon 1974’s review of Tails,” 2015). Another
notes that Baldwin did not spend much of the work delving into his own personal life,
and seems to suggest that this was sorely missed from the text (Amazon.com “Marghe’s
review of Tails,” 2015). Although five reviews are considered to be “critical,” three of
them all openly state that they liked (or even loved) the book and enjoyed Baldwin’s
storytelling style.

Indicators of Quality
Besides the issue of sparse metadata associated with the book, the work itself has
other indicators of low quality. A librarian trying to summarize or categorize Tails of the
Prairie would certainly acknowledge the grammar issues, style inconsistencies, typos,
and odd turns of phrase. Throughout the book there are many simple typos – “Were I
screwed up” when Baldwin intended to say “Where” (Kindle Location 1077), “thing”
instead of “think,” and “brotherin-law” rather than “brother-in-law” are just a few
examples. In a moment of great irony, particularly because he mocked “Westerners” for

170
their confused pronunciation so many times, Baldwin misspells veterinarian. These are
the sorts of mistakes any reader with an editorial eye could easily spot, but there are more
deep-seated problems throughout the book: problems that would take quite a lot of
editorial expertise to correct.
As Baldwin is telling his own stories, and a central tenant of his job is to interact
with nonverbal, animal patients, his internal dialogue is often critical to the storyline.
Baldwin is wildly inconsistent with the demarcation of his unspoken thoughts.
Occasionally he notes his internal voice with parenthetical asides, or with italics, or
sometimes even with quotations, even when it is clear to the reader that he in fact was not
speaking. A consistent approach would make the work read in a clearer way, and
Baldwin’s audience would not have to suffer confusion from time to time. An editorial
eye would have caught such incidental variations and helped Baldwin stick with one
particular style.
Word choice, references, and style do take some odd turns in Tails of the Prairie,
and these can sometimes make for a puzzling read. Baldwin, several times throughout the
work, discusses his wife Harriet’s return to her home state of Wyoming. He uses the
phrase “Return of the Native” more than a few times in reference to her (capitalized as if
clearly referring to the book), although it is unclear what he means when he invokes
Thomas Hardy. Additionally, Baldwin does attempt to add style to his prose throughout
the work, but sometimes this can seem funnily inappropriate or ill-suited to the
description he means to give. For example, in a storyline involving a herd of grossly
underfed and malnourished sheep, Baldwin took great pains to describe the sheep’s eyes:
“Their eyes – those beautiful eyes of a normal sheep that always remind me of the eyes of

171
a girl in love for the first time – were dull and lifeless, sunk back in their sockets” (Kindle
Location 2443).
While clumsy turns of phrase like these may seem like a problem doomed to all
writers without editors, the point of fact is that Baldwin had an editor. At the start of
Tails of the Prairie, Baldwin acknowledges and thanks Kevin Quirk, who “guided me
through the throes of “birthing” Tails of the Prairie. It had been in ‘rough draft’ for
several years, but a fortuitous event led me to his website, memoirsforlife.com. Without
his suggestions, encouragement, and expertise it would still be as he found it” (Kindle
Locations 112-115). Following the clue that Baldwin leaves for the reader (indeed, less a
clue so much as a genial advertisement for Quirk’s services) and visiting
memoirsforlife.com, now redirects the reader to http://www.lifeisabook.com/kevinquirk/.
This is a commercial homepage for self-described “author & ghostwriter” Kevin Quirk,
and its menu leads visitors to “services,” “Kevin Quirk,” “Tips,” “Contact,” and “Blog”
(Quirk, “Life is a Book,” 2015). An additional standalone page is linked on Quirk’s
homepage – www.yourbookghostwriter.com (2013) and it gives greater detail on the
process of working with Quirk as an editor and/or ghostwriter. Quirk, who details his
history as a writer as beginning in the 1980s as a journalism student at Boston University
and then as a sports writer for The Charlotte Observer, says that he took a turn to creative
writing after completing an MFA at the University of New Hampshire and then another
Master’s in spiritual psychology in the late 1990s (Quirk, “Kevin Quirk,” 2015). While
Quirk has written multiple works on his own (namely, and most prominent, Brace for
Impact: Miracle on the Hudson Survivor Share Their Stories of Near Death and Hope for
New Life, a work of nonfiction that interviewed multiple survivors of the US Airways

172
Flight 1549 crash), he does describe himself as a facilitator of publication (Quirk, “Kevin
Quirk,” 2015).
The homepage itself breaks out to Quirk’s “Services” page even refers to a success
story regarding a “Bob Baldwin,” who Quirk served as an editor/publisher:
The day after I was interviewed on an NPR station in Virginia about how I help
people write their autobiography, a gentleman in his 80s contacted me. “I’ve
written dozens of stories about my years as a veterinarian in Wyoming,” Bob
Baldwin told me. “But I don’t know how to put them together. Can you help me?”
Within months I had edited Bob’s wonderful stories, and Tails of the Prairie
became a published memoir. I can edit your book at any stage. Maybe you’ve
completed your book, but you don’t know a thing about how to publish it. The
good news is that there are lots of choices, but navigating your way through them
can be daunting. I’ll help you choose the best way for you to publish your memoir
or autobiography (Quirk, “Services,” 2015).
Quirk’s involvement in getting the work to iUniverse, or making the work available on
Amazon.com is unclear. It is very possible that he prompted Baldwin to edit and finalize
his writing for submission to iUniverse, and then, years later, Baldwin worked alone to
make his work available on Amazon. It is also possible that Quirk followed up with
Baldwin years later and inquired if Baldwin would be interested in having his work
uploaded to the Amazon store for an additional fee to Quirk if he would oversee the
process. A casual audience of readers cannot ascertain the editorial process and Quirk’s
involvement in the procedure of bringing the book to market.

Reflections of an Octogenarian
Discoverability and Accessibility
The Kindle digital edition of Reflections of an Octogenarian was published by
“Amazon.com and The Hayes Press” and has been sold online by Amazon Digital
Services since May 21, 2010 (“Amazon.com: Reflections,” 2015). As Amazon allows
authors the opportunity to name their own publishing company upon creating and
uploading their book, it is safe to assume that “The Hayes Press” is named by Betty
Hayes for herself. The work is also available in paperback, and its product details note
that it was published by the CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, with a release
date of May 22, 2010 (only one day after the Kindle version). This paperback version
has an ISBN-10 and an ISBN-13, and according to the OCLC Connexion Client, it is this
physical version that is available in the OCLC network. No ISBN is affiliated with the
Kindle edition; rather, the Kindle edition only has an ASIN.
The sole copy available in WorldCat appears to be located at Hayes’ own alma
mater, Wellesley. Whether it was donated by the author or purchased by the college is
unknown. The record is quite minimal, and contains no summary information about the
book.

174

in OCLC’s Connexion Client.

A visit to the Wellesley library system’s digital catalog confirms that the Clapp Library
does have a copy available for checkout, and while the OCLC record is minimal, the
Wellesley library’s record of the work includes summary information about the book.

Library. Summary information appears here that is left out of the OCLC record.

175

The Kindle edition of Reflections of an Octogenarian is available for $9.99 and
the paperback edition is available new from Amazon for $19.95 (“Amazon.com:
Reflections,” 2015). 10 other used and new copies are also available from independent
sellers, and the prices range from $15.90 to $18.29 (“Amazon.com: Reflections,” 2015).
Of the seven independent booksellers that offer Reflections of an Octogenarian, one
(“Books for Dogs”) touts that their available copy has been signed by the author, and all
book proceeds go to a no-kill animal shelter, but this bookseller provides no other
information about the copy or how that particular storefront came to have such a copy
(“Amazon.com: Books for Dogs Storefront, 2015).
Besides Amazon and Amazon-affiliated independent booksellers, the paperback
edition of the book is available on Barnes & Noble. The Barnes & Noble website and the
Wellesley catalog contain identical descriptor information about the book, and the
Wellesley catalog notes that this information is provided by Syndetics, a service provided
by Bowker (“Wellesley College Library: Reflections, 2015). This information is very
similar to the summary information on the Amazon page for Reflections of an
Octogenarian, but is a bit lengthier and much more formal. Stylistically, both summaries
are written in the third person, and contain biographical information about the author, but
they both contain the exclamatory remark, “Happy reading!” at the end, as if the reader
were being urged by the writer herself to enjoy the book (“Amazon.com: Reflections,”
2015), just as she did in the book’s own foreword (Kindle Location 106).

176
Promotion and Reviews
While Hayes makes it clear in the introductory pages of her work that her book is
for anyone, and is meant to help other readers experiencing similar life crises, most
promotion of the work appears to have been within the Wellesley and Wellesley alumnae
community. Hayes regularly discusses her relationship to Wellesley and its impact on
her life, and it makes great sense that she would share her work with the college’s
community.
Mention of the publication of Reflection of an Octogenarian is made in the
alumnae association’s college magazine, Wellesley, in the Fall 2010 edition (Volume 93,
Issue 1). The magazine’s policy is to “present interesting, thought-provoking material,
even though it may be controversial,” but it provides a great deal of contact information
on the masthead, noting how alumnae may reach out to the editors (Wellesley, 2010).
The magazine has a section titled “FreshInk,” with a list of alumnae or otherwise collegeaffiliated authors (such as faculty), their year of graduation if applicable, and some basic
bibliographic information about the book, including the work’s title, publisher, and city
of origin (as seen in Figure 8).

177

Figure 11. A screenshot of Reflections of an Octogenarian’s mention in the Fall 2010
edition of Wellesley.

In the FreshInk section of Wellesley, Hayes’ book appears alongside other scholarly
publications (e.g., “Wild Unrest: Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Making of The
Yellow Wallpaper”) (Wellesley, 2010).
It is unclear how Reflections of an Octogenarian came to be mentioned in
FreshInk. With so much contact information available to alumnae in the Wellesley
magazine masthead, it seems highly probable that Hayes herself submitted information
about her book to the editors for mention. Reflections of an Octogenarian emphasizes
the value Hayes placed on her education and time at Wellesley, and it would be no great
leap for a reader to assume that Hayes would want her fellow alumnae to know of her
works.

178
If reviews exist for Reflections of an Octogenarian, then they are not affiliated
with any sites where the book is sold. While the book is written for a broad readership,
and according to her own words, for “might be useful to other people who are struggling
with [mental] illness” in their families (Kindle Location 125), it has not necessarily been
marketed to or received by such audiences. The only promotion appears to have been
within the Wellesley alumnae magazine, and as such, would only be visible to a highly
specific audience of educated, upper class women and Hayes’ own peers. If Hayes was
able to find a reception in this community, it is not visible to outside viewers, and does
not appear to be discussed in this community online.

Indicators of Quality
Reflections of an Octogenarian suffers from two critical issues: lack of editorial
oversight, and formatting conversion support (paperback to kindle format). While Hayes
makes it clear to her readers that her education is a key part of her identity, like most
writers, her work would have benefitted from an extra set of eyes. The book contains
grammar and style issues that occasionally make the work difficult to read and follow,
and formatting problems suggest that Hayes meant for an outside reader to make some
changes to the text, but for whatever reason, these changes could not or would not be
made.
Hayes notes in the foreword that her book was written episodically, and that each
chapter could be read without reference to the others, but as such, she repeats herself and
parts of her story again and again. Multiple chapters reintroduce the players in Hayes’
life: her overbearing mother, her mentally ill husband, her cruel mother-in-law, and this

179
can disorient the reader as to whether or not they have accidentally read the same pages
again. Careful editorial oversight could have made the book a cohesive whole with
standalone chapters, but as it is, the repetition of key events and reintroduction of
characters can be quite confusing for a reader.
Additionally, Hayes’ turn of phrase, grammar, and style can occasionally be
difficult for the reader to follow. While she has taken pains to utilize a conversational,
familiar, and generally casual approach (e.g., writing in the second person, casually
beginning sentences with “And,” telling jokes throughout), the work suffers from some
messy mistakes that detract from Hayes’ vision. Small problems like parenthetical asides
that are left open-ended, misuse of apostrophes, overuse of capital letters, and awkward
phrasing can all distract the reader from Hayes’ greater points. Hayes makes no
reference in the introductory pages or foreword to an editor or reader, and the book reads
as if it lacked another set of eye that might have caught some smaller problems.
Finally, formatting issues plague Reflections of an Octogenarian. Like many
Kindle books, the work has “Locations” rather than pages, and in Reflections of an
Octogenarian, there are 2132 locations in total. Rather than delete the internal page
numbers in the body of the book’s text upon submission, Hayes opted to include the page
numbers she utilized while writing the book. Now, centered page numbers seem to float
within chunks of text, and because Kindle books and their locations can be adjusted for
the reader (e.g., a different text size selection for the reader’s vision and comfort may
shift location), the inclusion of these odd numbers throughout the book seem particularly
disorienting and confusing for the reader:

180

Figure 12. A screenshot of Reflections of an Octogenarian’s odd pagination embedded
within the text.

Why Hayes was prompted to embed page numbers within the text is unclear. The two
editions of Reflections of an Octogenarian were published almost simultaneously (with
publication dates of May 22, 2010 for paperback and May 21, 2010 for Kindle), but the
submission process of the text to CreateSpace and Amazon (respectively) may have been
different. Using these publication dates as a clue, and estimating the different format
requirements of submission for the two different editions, it would stand to reason that
Hayes’ submitted the text for the Amazon Kindle book by simply resubmitting the text
she used for the print edition, and the print edition required page numbers when the
Kindle edition did not. On the other hand, Hayes may have simply included page
numbers in the document that she originally created, and did not take the time to remove
them at the later date and upon publication. Either way, the presence of these numbers
confuses the reader, and the editorial oversight necessary to successfully transition a book
intended for print to the digital realm would have been helpful.

181
While a reader may suspect that Hayes lacked an editor for Reflections of an
Octogenarian, there is one critical clue that suggests an outside reader, editor, or even
company liaison from CreateSpace or the Amazon Kindle store offered help or support to
Hayes. At the end of Chapter 14, at Kindle Location 1097, there is a long blank gap after
the text, with a single sentence in the middle, followed by another long blank gap before
the start of the next chapter. This short sentence reads, “Please place pictures here,”
although the person taking this direction and following this request is unknown to the
reader.

Figure 13. A screenshot of Hayes’ request at the end of chapter 14, as well as the long
blank space following.

It seems quite likely that Hayes curated a collection of photographs to be included in her
work, and in the process of creating her book, outsourced the work of inserting those

182
images to someone else. It may have been a request to a reader with more technical
abilities, such as a family member or friend viewing the book before it was sent off for
submission, or perhaps it was a request to a professional, like an Amazon or CreateSpace
employee. It is an unfortunate discovery for the reader to realize that the book is missing
images; after hearing so much about Hayes’ parents, husband, and in-laws, any reader
would be surely curious to see a snapshot or two of this cast of characters.
Finally, Reflections of an Octogenarian has an unusual cover image. The left half
of the image is simple enough; it appears to contain two silhouettes of the same image of
a seated person with glasses, both superimposed (albeit at different angles) over a
waterscape with a blue sky. Although the two silhouettes do not line up with one another,
it would appear to be a literal “reflection” and a nod to the book’s title. Any reader
would probably assume that this is a seated profile of Hayes herself, although this cannot
be confirmed anywhere in the book. While the image is credited to Jose Henriquez
(Kindle Location 18), it is impossible to know his relationship to the author or to find out
additional information about him from the book alone. The image is not referred to
anywhere else in the body of the work.
Most problematic, the Kindle book cover contains a large white block to the left
of this image, and it is visible on the Kindle, Kindle app, and on the Amazon page for the
book:

183

Figure 14. A screenshot of the cover image for Reflections of an Octogenarian; note the
blank space to the right of the image of the seated woman.

This white block appears to be some kind of error, and it may stem from Hayes’
submission of the text to two different companies (Amazon Kindle Store, CreateSpace)
and rendering errors upon submission. Unlike the cover for the Kindle version of the
book, the paperback edition of Reflections of an Octogenarian only contains the blue
page with the title, author name, and image. How this mistake was made is unclear.
Hayes may have added a blank page after the cover in order to differentiate the cover
image from the table of contents or the rest of the text in the body of the work. Printed
books often contain blank pages before or after the title page due to book signatures (i.e.,
the number of pages required to successfully fold and cut a bound book), and perhaps
Hayes meant to mimic this practice. Hayes may have merely made a stylistic choice and
liked the appearance of an additional blank page. Either way, this blank page ended up as

184
part of her cover image for the Kindle edition of the book, and it is an unfortunate layout
error.
While Hayes’ book does not suffer from excessive typos or grammar mistakes
that hallmark some other self-published works, the layout and publication problems
overwhelm the reader. Reflections of an Octogenarian is blemished with odd formatting
and rendering mistakes that make the book seem amateurish and sparse, with long blank
spaces and mismarked pages. These problems, more than any other issues that may
plague a self-published writer, point out to the reader that this book was produced
without professional editorial oversight.

The History of New Mexico High School Football
Discoverability and Accessibility
This second digital edition of Ford's work was published and has been sold by
Amazon Digital Services since December 29, 2010, but it is difficult to find any records
of a first edition (digital or in print) of this work. An in-print, CreateSpace edition of the
work has existed since 2011 (and it is this version of the work that is available to libraries
in OCLC’s WorldCat, but whether or not this version of the text predates the digital
version is unclear. When Ford first published The History of New Mexico High School
Football: Volume I – The First 100 Years through CreateSpace in 2011, he opted for an
ISBN number as well as a print run of the work. Besides Amazon’s sale of the digital
text, the work can be purchased for $13.62 as a paperback from Barnes & Noble or for
$17.10 (Used) and $19.71 (New) at Better World Books (Barnes and Noble, 2015; Better
World Books, 2015).

185
According to WorldCat, The History of New Mexico High School Football:
Volume I – The First 100 Years is available at New Mexico State University in Las
Cruces in print and nowhere else. It is impossible to know whether or not this book was
a donation to the library or one purchased outright, and the digital version of the book is
not described in WorldCat and does not exist for checkout or library digital download as
far as can be determined in the Connexion Client. The book exists on Goodreads, but no
one has reviewed it or rated it.

Promotion and Reviews
Ford’s work has been promoted and reviewed by two external bodies, namely the
New Mexico Activities Association (NMAA) and the Rio Rancho Observer, a “…locally
owned and operated community newspaper” (Rio Rancho Observer Online, 2015).
Ford’s relationship to the Observer is unclear, but his affiliation to the NMAA – a body
he discusses again and again in The History of New Mexico High School Football – is
pronounced in their own internally produced published documents by their foundation
(New Mexico Athletics Association, “About the NMAA,” 2012). Indeed, their
foundation openly promotes the sale of his book to their interested parties in flyer form
(New Mexico Athletics Association Foundation, “The History,” 2012).

186

Figure 15. This promotional flyer for Ford’s work can be found on the NMAA’s official
website.

Dan Ford, for all intents and purposes, is the official historian of New Mexico High
School Football, according to the NMAA and its accompanying foundation. Their
professional relationship has been clearly established here; indeed, the NMAA once sold
Ford’s books (including his follow-up volume to the work studied here, The History of
New Mexico High School Football, Volume II – The Records 1953 – 2010) on his behalf,
although this link has expired and the book is no longer available on this website.

The Rio Rancho Observer, a newspaper “…dedicated to serving the city of Rio
Rancho and Southern Sandoval County through the highest professional business and
journalistic standards… published twice-weekly on Sundays and Wednesdays, including
holidays – and online at rrobserver.com” (Rio Rancho Observer, 2015) serves the
communities northwest of Albuquerque. Gary Herron, a columnist and sports editor,
reviewed The History of New Mexico High School Football Volume I in 2011 (Rio
Rancho Observer Staff Directory, 2015), and gave it high marks for its detailed research,
but he also revealed the working relationship he has had with Dan Ford (Herron, 2015).
Towards the end of the article, Herron explains that Ford
began his research on the book about 30 years ago and, oddly, when I was at the
Valencia County News-Bulletin back in 1979, I often relied on the year-by-year

188
records he'd supplied me for Belen and Los Lunas high schools, the teams I
covered (Herron, 2015).
This review could have been a favor between friends, or a formalized request between
two colleagues. Either way, for local entities – sports journalists, regional athletic
associations – Ford is definitively an expert on high school football in the region; he is a
person to be consulted on older records and up-to-date news. Endorsements like these
speak to Ford’s authority on his subject and lend credence to his work.
Ford has created a website to promote and sell his books,
http://www.danfordsports.net/, and it is there rather than WorldCat or Amazon that an
interested reader might find a list of his complete works (Ford, “Dan Ford Sports,” 2015).
According to Ford, in an update from December 3, 2014, there are three books available
for purchase: The History of New Mexico High School Football Volume I – The First 100
Years (1892 – 1991), The History of New Mexico High School Football Volume V – 1950
– 2013, and The History of New Mexico High School Football Volume VI – (1950 –
2014). It is unclear where Volumes II – IV are, or if they were ever published. As
Volume V follows the years 1950 – 2013, and Volume VI follows the years 1950 – 2014,
it is conceivable that Volumes II – IV covered the years 1950 – 2010, 1950 – 2011, 1950
– 2012, respectively, with new successive volumes only reflecting the latest season of
updates, and these volumes are simply out of print. While Goodreads has no reviews,
ratings, or active readers of the book, Volumes II, III and IV exist on the site, complete
with cover images and metadata, and they each confirm that the successive volumes were
each created to update for the new years’ records (Goodreads, Dan Ford, 2015).

189
Ford’s homepage, powered by a free Weebly account, contains quite a lot of
information about the books and author, and it appears to be created by Ford himself, as it
is written in the first person (Ford, “Dan Ford Sports,” 2015). The homepage has three
subpages, namely a contact portal, a link to New Mexico Team Records, and NMAA
Official Records. The contact portal provides readers with the opportunity to submit
questions and contact information. The NMAA records, downloadable as a Microsoft
Word document, include the information that Ford has compiled in his books, and the
following:
The New Mexico Activities Association keeps and updates its football records
periodically. The attached file is the NMAA records as of 12/8/2014. In order to
have your record in their official book an applicant must meet submission
requirements which will include the signature of a school administrator (AD or
Principal) and some accompanying documentation. That record is then
authenticated by an independent source before it is put into the record book. I
have been a part of that authentication process in recent years. This does not
include every single record possible but comes close to matching the national
record book in records that are followed. I assist the NMAA in authenticating the
records. consequently, [sic] the record book is updated frequently after the
season. The most current records are on the NMAA website (www.nmact.org)
(Ford, “NMAA Official Records,” 2015).
This process of authentication speaks to Ford’s embeddedness in the procedure of record
affirmation and publication, and further lends credibility to his authorship.

190
The other pages of Ford’s website provide much of the same information that can
be found in The History of New Mexico High School Football Volume I. The New
Mexico Team Records pages note the sets of records that can be found in each book, and
there are links to the books for purchase, at Amazon for Kindle download and
CreateSpace for printed copy. The homepage offers biographical information on Ford
himself, but contains nothing new or distinct from the information in the books.

Indicators of Quality
As Ford’s work is meant to be distributed to a wider audience – namely, those
with time and money invested in the New Mexico Athletics Association, and followers
and supporters of local high school football teams in the greater Albuquerque area – he
has clearly taken great pains to produce a distributable and professional work. The book
has many color images and enough interesting anecdotes as to intrigue a layperson with
no prior interest in high school football in the region.
In the introduction of his work, and on his website, Ford never names an editor or
indicates that his work was proofread in any way. While the CreateSpace-printed
versions of Ford’s book(s) might appear perfectly readable, the Kindle edition of The
History of New Mexico High School Football Volume I often has jumps and large gaps in
the text, and this can make the book difficult to read. Additionally, the book’s table of
contents lists page numbers for acknowledgements, individual chapters, and the index,
but the Kindle edition does not have pagination or internal links, and so the reader must
guess the Kindle locations. These are minor oversights for an editor, but they are

191
noticeable problems for a reader, and they would have been caught by an editor with
ebook familiarity.
Stylistically, the book has some indicators of lesser quality and would have
benefitted from a professional eye. There are some minor grammar errors throughout the
work, and incorrect diction occasionally (e.g., “thesis” for “theses”) (Ford, Kindle
Location 37), but it never overwhelms the reader or distracts from the greater point of the
book.
While Ford certainly does not claim to be a professional historian, he does
repeatedly explain that he meant to produce a history that was “unbiased” (Kindle
Location 56). The greatest signifier that his work is not a professional history, and
certainly the most problematic element of his work, is that none of his sources are cited.
Ford’s work was researched in a thorough and painstaking way, but there is no way to
confirm many of his accounts. Ford noted The History of New Mexico High School
Football Volume I has drawn heavily upon scans of old newspapers, but which
newspapers were accessed is unclear, and perhaps was lost to time, for as Ford notes in
his introduction, “90% of this book was written and researched from 1977 to 1981”
(Kindle Location 68). Ford has cited and credited photographs and their sources at the
end of his work in an extensive chart, but additional information about the newspapers he
cited would have been helpful for any researcher attempting to recreate his narrative or to
examine his topic further.

192
Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm
Discoverability and Accessibility
According to the Amazon page for Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm, Hutter’s
work was published on December 1, 2010. For all intents and purposes, the book appears
to have been distributed to no other location than the Amazon Kindle Store, and it may
have never been produced or distributed in any other physical venue. Hutter never
purchased an ISBN number for the work, and more than anything else, this seems to have
limited discoverability for the book outside of Amazon. The only numerical indicator
affiliated with Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm is its Amazon ASIN, and the metadata
available on the Amazon page for the work is quite spare. The work does not appear in
either Bowker Books in Print or OCLC’s WorldCat or Connexion Client. Finding the
work in any other location or through any other ebook downloadable service is difficult
and it may be impossible. Because the work is not available in WorldCat or the OCLC

Figure 17. Screenshot of Amazon page for Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm. Note the
lack of cover image for the book.

193
Connexion Client, it is difficult to determine whether or not it is available for download
in external libraries.
The book is available for $2.99 or for free to users with access to the Kindle
Unlimited service. Kindle Unlimited, a service first unveiled in July 2014, purports to
give Amazon users access to “Unlimited Reading. Unlimited Listening. Any Device…
[on] over 800,000 titles and thousands of audiobooks...” (Amazon, 2015, Kindle
Unlimited, para. 1). Given that all reviews of the book date to before 2014, it is difficult
to ascertain as to whether or not the Unlimited service has increased the number of
downloads of the work. The work is described as only having a single edition, and has
been sold by Amazon Digital Services, Inc. (Amazon, 2014, Donna Hutter).
The content on the Amazon page for Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm reveals a
great deal of contextual information for the lay reader. While the book itself does next to
nothing to explain the relationships between the family members, the description of the
book on Amazon’s site both contextualizes the work and defines its intentions:
Based on interviews with women who were children of the farm, the book
describes their recollections of conditions, customs, family connections, mores
and remembrances of the time. These women were 90 and 94 years old at the time
of the interview in 2010. The book provides the reader with a warm, informative
glance at the vast differences between growing up today and in the 1920's and
1930's. These women were born before cars, electricity, refrigeration, washing
machines and dryers, radios, and airplanes. Electricity made a huge difference in
the quality of their lives because it reduced physical labor and provided small

194
comforts never before experienced. Everyone can learn from the life experiences
of these two women (Amazon, 2014, Donna Hutter).
This description is an important reveal for the reader; it lets the reader take an educated
guess about the source material for the work. Two women were interviewed for Growing
up on a Wisconsin Farm (presumably by Donna Hutter, at a specific date set in 2010),
and they apparently were affiliated with and lived on one of the Volk family farms
mentioned in the book. The introductory page of the book explained that the work was
based on interviews with 90- and 94-year-old “Children of the Farm” (Kindle Locations
10-13), but as Sadie and Carl had many children, it was difficult to ascertain which of the
seven children would have been interviewed. Knowing that two women were
interviewed narrows down the possibilities; they may have been Teresa, Helen, Mary, or
Veronica (Bonnie).
Additionally, because the two interviewees were women, it is very possible that
this work, which in many ways is a women’s history, was necessarily skewed to uncover
Sadie Volk’s working life because her daughters were invested in telling their own stories
(purposefully or not). Indeed, Hutter differentiates male from female tasks in the section
on chores, and as the two women would understandably be able to speak with greater
authority about their childhood labor “[helping] in the house,” they likely focused on
Sadie Mears’ labor because they probably shared a great deal of it (Kindle Location 103).

Promotion and Reviews
For a self-published book with no ISBN, Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm has a
surprising number of reviews on Amazon and Goodreads (Goodreads, “Growing up on a

195
Wisconsin Farm,” 2015). Goodreads, has three five-star ratings (out of a possible five
stars) and one written review that was added on January 15, 2012 (before Amazon
purchased Goodreads), and two notes by users “to-read” Growing up on a Wisconsin
Farm (see Figure 18 for details). The single written review by user “Cathy Douglas”
explains that the book highlights the kind of life that her parents led, but it is clear from
her profile that she is not related to Hutter, and was speaking figuratively rather than
literally (Goodreads, “Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm,” 2015).
On Amazon, there are two five-star ratings (out of a possible five stars), both
accompanied by reviews. Notably, none of these reviewers seem to be connected to one
another or to Hutter herself; they do not identify themselves as friends or family, and
their respective profiles do nothing to suggest as much. “Cal” and “Wisconsin-grown,”
the two reviewers on Amazon, both argue that the book lends some understanding to a
simpler time, and it could be useful for students or “those who are fascinated with the
idea of country or farm life” (Amazon, 2014, Donna Hutter).

196

Although this book was made available to the greater public on Amazon, there are
not many reasons to account for the book’s relatively abundant reviews. The number of
reviews on Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm does not seem to be related to any online
social networking from Hutter; if she has an online presence that markets her work(s),
then it is very difficult to find and does not appear to be connected to the Amazon or
Goodreads profiles for her book. There does not seem to be any kind of self-promotion
of her work on her part; and web searches for Donna Hutter – as author, as Wisconsinite,
as person affiliated with Carl Volk or the name Volk – return nothing of in the way of
definitive details about Hutter’s life and connection to the area in and around Sauk,
Wisconsin. The book itself makes no reference to external contact information, an editor
or editorial service, and there is no way to find conclusive information about Hutter’s life
beyond the book.

Indicators of Quality
Additionally, the book has many other indicators of a lack of quality that might
deter a reader away. It has no cover art – no imagery or photographs – that might draw
the reader in, and it is set at a markedly low price-point ($2.99 or free to Unlimited
users); one that would make any common Amazon ebook reader suppose that it was not a
traditionally published work, as those are always set at $9.99 or higher. While Hutter has
provided some content for the Amazon web page, the details in the synopsis are slim in
comparison with a traditionally published history or memoir.

197
More than anything else, readers would be discouraged from viewing this book
because of the confusing storyline and the many spelling and grammar issues that plague
the work. The book’s title appears to shout at the reader in all-caps, and contains two
incorrect apostrophe uses (1920’s rather than 1920s) that are echoed on the cover, title
page, and webpage. If the reader makes it beyond the website, title page, and Kindle
preview, they will find run-on sentences, misspelled words, and disconnects from first to
third person (even within sections). While the Amazon webpage for Hutter’s work does
note that the book is based on interviews, Hutter never specifies when she jumps from
interviewing one person or the other. The use of words like “Dad,” “Aunt” and “We” are
never defined enough or in such a way that an outside reader would be able to make
sense of the speaker/author. Building family trees certainly aids in the reader’s process,
but this requires quite a lot of effort, and a casual consumer would be unlikely to
undertake such a task.

Conclusion
The level of editorial quality of self-published books certainly runs the gamut, and
nowhere is that more plain than in a comparative analysis of Tails of the Prairie,
Reflections of an Octogenarian, The History of New Mexico High School Football, and
Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm. Both Tails of the Prairie and The History of New
Mexico High School Football are both of relatively high quality; they have some
sentence-level structural problems, and but their books have a cohesive message and
vision. They both are also written for external audiences, and both have a relatively

198
higher online presence than Reflections of an Octogenarian and Growing up on a
Wisconsin Farm.
That the books most carefully edited, discussed most frequently online, and made
most widely available to consumers were those clearly written for external audiences is
significant for librarians and historians of the book to consider. If this new era of
publication is marked by a rise of non-traditional book publishing formats, then it stands
to reason that those formats would be utilized for different intentions of outreach. If an
author meant to self-publish a book and to distribute it as widely as possible, then that
author would very likely invest in editing and a high-quality cover image, promotion, and
then proceed to make that work available in as many different formats (print, digital) as
possible. If an author only meant for a small, niche audience to read the book – like close
friends and family – then such legwork might not be necessary. Growing up on a
Wisconsin Farm does not seem to be produced for such a great audience, and it is
certainly the work with the greatest editorial problems, and would be the most difficult
for an external audience to read and understand.
Tellingly, the only books made available in libraries were those that had been
printed into a physical book format. Works only available as Amazon Kindle ebooks
could not be found in OCLC’s WorldCat or the Connexion Client, and therefore not in
any additional libraries. This may speak to Amazon’s OverDrive package deals for
libraries; libraries may not have the option to purchase Amazon Kindle Indie or selfpublished ebooks, or they may not be able to afford those packages. Future quantifiable
studies of self-published ebooks should explore library presence of such titles, because
whether or not these books will be available in the Amazon Kindle store in perpetuity

199
remains to be seen. If these books are not easily made available to libraries, then it stands
to reason that Amazon may eventually lose interest in keeping up hosting costs for such
titles and these works may be gone forever. The presence and availability of works like
these may be fleeting, and that is why the study of these works, and the inclusion of them
into library collections, is such a pressing concern.

200
CHAPTER 8: CLOSING THOUGHTS AND CONCLUSIONS
One Self-Published Author’s Public Reading
At 1pm on June 22, 2015, a stiflingly hot and humid day in Canton, Missouri,
local self-published author Kate Van Gilder Hunt gave a book talk on her work, Tales
from the Dark Side of the Laundry Basket. A small gathering of community members
circled around her in the commons of the Carl Johann Memorial Library at CulverStockton College, including members of Hunt’s church and her priest, as well as the
parents of her children’s friends, and the library staff, and they listened to Hunt read a
short chapter from her book. Tales from the Dark Side of the Laundry Basket is a memoir
of sorts, culled together in short chapter entries, containing stories of a dark period of
Hunt’s life, in which her very young husband died suddenly and unexpectedly of a brain
aneurism, leaving her to raise their four children, all under the age of 10, alone. She
explained that it was very easy to become complacent in life; that one may not always
“recognize the good times when you’re in them” (Hunt, “Book talk on Tales from the
Dark Side of the Laundry Basket, 2015). Hunt built the book out of a deeply personal
blog that she began during this difficult time in her life, self-published it on the
CreateSpace platform in May 2015, and eventually made it available as a Kindle book on
Amazon.
By the end of the reading, there was not a dry eye in the room. The library staff
quietly passed around boxes of tissues to the audience members, and the question and
answer session that followed the reading proceeded in fits and starts; the author and her
readers were often too choked up to speak. Everyone present in the audience appeared to
know about Hunt’s blog and active online writing profile, and it was clear to anyone

201
watching the audience react to Hunt’s reading that her stories were not necessarily new to
them. These listeners had heard these stories before.

Figure 19. Screenshot of Tales from the Dark Side of the Laundry Basket, for sale on
Amazon.

This reading was not pre-empted with press releases or social media blasts or any
kind of promotional strategy, but all the same, Hunt knew her audience that day too. Not
in the way a best-selling author might know her target demographic; rather, Hunt knew
them because these people had welcomed her and her children into their homes,
community organizations, and churches. Hunt’s audience was one of friends and
neighbors, and as such, Hunt’s story was their own story. Her readers knew her
personally, they knew her children, and many of them had clearly known her husband.
Hunt’s book had value to them because it told a story they already knew; Tales from the
Dark Side of the Laundry Basket was a felt experience for Hunt’s readers because they
had, at least partly, lived that story with her.

202
After speaking frankly about her husband and the transformation of Hunt’s family
life after his death, the audience began to ask questions about Hunt’s writing and
publishing process. Many audience members wanted to hear about how she came to
write and what drove her to make the transition to book format. One audience member
spoke of the transition as an important one, as though blogging was accessible, and a
pastime for anyone, but becoming an author of a published book was a loftier
achievement. Hunt was not convinced that this was the case; she asserted that the editors
of her book were merely friends and family, and she said that her book had its
imperfections, including had a “typo” that drove her crazy. Smiling through still-red eyes,
Hunt explained, “We’re all authors. You’ve just got to write it down” (Hunt, “Book talk
on Tales from the Dark Side of the Laundry Basket,” 2015).
This is a powerfully democratic statement, and an important one in the history of
books and publishing. In the middle of the twentieth century, Marxist and other New
Left historians began arguing that the working classes – the People – had been left out of
history, and during the end of the twentieth century, the New Cultural Historians tried to
elevate the voices of common people so that they became a part of the canon. In both
cases, professional historians took it upon themselves to speak for common people. In
this new century, equipped with Internet access, and all the low-cost tools of selfpublishing, it seems as though the “People” may finally be able to speak for themselves.

The Publishing Industry as Gatekeeping and the Value of Outsiders
In the history of books, printing, and publishing, particularly in the 20th century,
publication has implied a level of cachet. Authors are vetted and credentialed, and their

203
words are pored over by editors and reviewers. Publication necessarily suggests status
and prestige; published authors’ books have been selected by someone affiliated at a
publishing house, or a literary agent, and chosen out of a slush pile. At its core, this
means a professionally well-read, educated person saw something valuable in the work,
and was willing to invest time and money and editorial manpower into that work in order
to have it reach an audience. Those kinds of investments assure the reader/buyer a kind
of quality control, for it implies that surely someone has checked this book for typos and
provided a professional sheen before distributing it out into the marketplace.
Self-published authors, however, represent raw voices that are untouched and
unfettered by this traditional editorial process. The way these authors choose to convey
the past has not been filtered through external parties that are accountable to shareholders,
and their words are not subject to the demand for profits. The self-published authors
analyzed here had no such editorial oversight, and as such, they are to be celebrated for
their unencumbered nature; they may write at length on the topic of their choosing,
without any insistence from editorial staff that they limit the time spent on one subject, or
keep to a particular number of words, or adhere to a message that the public would most
likely prefer.
This is not to say that there are not drawbacks to this style; self-published authors’
books often convey their inexperience with formalized writing and publication. Their
style is often unpolished, and their works may feature many different types of mistakes,
everything from the mundane, like typos, poor word choice, or misspellings, to larger
problems, like odd and confusing storylines, or an inability to convey a clear message to

204
the reader. Their books may have shoddy cover art, or no cover art, and lack the
metadata critical to libraries for finding these titles and adding them to their collections.
While these self-published works are unedited and unmediated, they offer readers
the value of outsider perspectives. As the authors here might exist outside of the
traditional publication circuit, so their visions of the past lend a fullness that might be
missing from an academic history. Furthermore, they problematize the work of academic
history, and its fundamental premise; as Wallach says in Closer to the Truth than any
Fact,
[w]hen we have access to the recorded experiences of individual historical agents,
our historical understanding is certainly richer, but we also become more aware of
how necessarily incomplete our understanding of history is and of how many
voices from the past remain unheard. To think of history as multiperspectival,
with each individual experience at variance with the experiences of others, makes
the historians’ task of re-creating the past even more daunting (p. 15-16).
Not only do these voices challenge accepted visions of the past, so too do they challenge
the possibility of creating a fully realized vision of the past in the first place.
Voices like those from the authors Robert Baldwin, Betty Brown Hayes, Dan
Ford, and Donna Hutter provide an intimacy that other academic histories, particularly
those with great distance between author and subject, simply cannot have. Historians
certainly acknowledge that true distance – calculated objectivity – is impossible; like
anyone else, historians are certainly shaped by their own point of view, by their interests,
by their culture and values, and by their language, but nonetheless, they often do not
share autobiographical elements with their subjects. By crafting a book, whether that

205
book is memoir/autobiographical like Baldwin’s or simply a small-scale, local history
like Ford’s, these authors have taken the stance that these histories deserve telling and
inclusion.
Ultimately, there is power in the production of history: Trouillot tells us so
(Silencing the Past, 1995). While these new self-published voices do not necessarily
speak of slave revolts and holocaust denial and the mixed historiographical approaches to
the events at the Alamo, 21st century historians and librarians know better than to only
look for history in the political arena. The work of these self-published authors prevents
objectifying or generalization by other historians with greater distance from the subject,
and their small-scale focus renders their stories highly relatable for readers.
Embracing works like these, and making the decision to include them in libraries,
supports the promise of a multidimensional, “multiperspectival” history (Wallach, 16),
and further still, supports the idea of creating an inventory of these many, small-scale
perspectives. In his seminal article, “Microhistory: One or two things I know about it,”
Ginzburg (1993) likens the work of microhistorians to cubist paintings, particularly
Umberto Boccioni’s 1911 works The Street Enters the House and Simultaneous Visions.
He explains that visions like these embrace a “porous” vision of the self, and “the exterior
invades the interior;” that is to say, as the intimate portrait becomes universal and larger,
the boundaries of subject(s) fade and are overlap (Ginzburg, 1993, p. 34). These messy
boundaries need order, organization, and contouring, and many theorists and historians
have addressed how fruitful that sort of work is. Edward Said, in an interview and while
giving commentary on Antonio Gramsci’s influential Prison Notebooks, has said,

206
History deposits in us – our own history, our family’s history, our nation’s history,
our traditions’ history – which has left in us an infinity of traces, all kinds of
marks… through heredity, through collective experience, through individual
experience, through family experience, through relations between one individual
and another, a whole book if you like, a series of, an infinity of traces, but there’s
no inventory; there’s no orderly guide to it… [s]o Gramsci says, therefore the task
at the outset is to try to compile an inventory, in other words, to try and make
sense of it, and this seems to me… to be the most interesting sort of human task.
It’s the task of interpretation, it’s the task of giving history some shape and
sense… to understand my history in terms of other people’s history, in other
words to try to understand… one’s own individual experience to understand the
experience of others. And I think, I think the great goal is in fact to become
someone else... to transform itself from a unitary identity to an identity that
includes the Other without suppressing the difference. That he says is the great
goal. And for me, I think, that would be the case, you know, and that would be the
notion of writing an inventory, a historical inventory, not only to understand
oneself, but to understand oneself in relation to others, and to understand others as
if you would understand yourself (Said, 1998).
Incorporating these works into a collection – supporting their inclusion and celebrating
their difference from works traditionally produced by the academy or through traditional
publishing models – is a radical notion and one that encourages a reading audience to
identify with the autobiographer/memoirist on a palpable level, to “see” their history and
relate to it, and finally, as Ginzburg and Said encourage, to provide opportunities for the

207
reader to the understand the self in context of the other, and in context of another’s vision
of the past.
Radical librarianship has always sought inclusion, and invited outsider voices to
populate the canon, collection, and library, and so it necessarily follows that the work of
building a multiperspective inventory utilizing self-published texts should fall to
librarians. Finding these works in the Amazon self-published store is difficult, and
finding them in other sources like Bowker is impossible for books that lack ISBNs.
Additionally, coming up with strategies to include them in the library may present a
major challenge too; some public libraries offer access to popular titles for download on
Kindle or in the Kindle app through Amazon’s OverDrive service, but whether or not
Indie titles or other self-published titles are available through OverDrive to libraries is
unclear. As Ava Seave, Forbes contributor on media business, famously commented,
“You’ll need a PhD to make sense of the pricing schemes publishers impose on libraries,”
and many librarians have lamented that situation, noting that more and more users want
eBook access but that their libraries are over a barrel with OverDrive and Amazon’s
pricing models and structuring (2013). Ultimately, this work is difficult, and messy, but
not impossible, and certainly, too important to ignore.

Self-Published Works and Their Contributions to the Canon
The works considered here prove the value of self-published voices, and the
contributions that they would make to a local library collection are multifaceted. At first
glance, Robert Baldwin’s Tails of the Prairie seems to be one man remembering his
youth, and the dawn of his professional life as a veterinarian. A closer look, and a close

208
reading, reveals a complex rendering of the social fabric of Gillette and Sundance,
Wyoming in the 1950s and 1960s. Hardscrabble ranchers with limited technology
labored in remote settings, and Baldwin, with his unique, educated outsider’s perspective,
looked into their homes and their families, and described their family relationships, their
household economies, and their attitudes about everything ranging from proper animal
husbandry to spousal abuse.
Baldwin’s work offers his readers the very best of what memoirs have to offer
readers, namely, the rendering of a historical time and place paired with the complexity
of adept social portraiture. As Wallach has said,
Skillful autobiographers are uniquely equipped to describe the entire universe as it
appeared from an acknowledged perspective... [and can] portray the complicated
interplay between the thoughts and emotions of a historical actor. Furthermore,
autobiographers intermingle historical data about what actually happened with
reflections on what the author wishes had happened or imagines had happened. A
full-fledged understanding of a particular historical moment must capture the
complexities of the cognitive and the affective, the factual and the imaginary,
perceptions and misperceptions. These elements are constitutive of a complex
historical reality, which exists from the perspectives of the people who inhabited a
past social world. The thoughts and feelings of historical agents are not responses
to a preexisting social reality. Rather, they are reality. If we are to come to a deep
understanding of a historical moment, we must endeavor to understand the
individual experiences that constituted it (p. 4).

Tails of the Prairie creates the “deep understanding” Wallach refers to here. Throughout
the book, Baldwin asserts to the reader that he is an outside observer of the people of
Sundance and Gillett; he is educated, he is an Easterner, and the local citizens of
Northwest Wyoming treat him as such. His internal monologue perpetually highlights
that Otherness, serves to reproduce this social scene for his readers, and paints a vivid
social reality that no other local history could. Baldwin’s readers know his wishes, his
lamentations, and his regrets about how certain events might have unfolded. This
knowledge deepens the reader’s understanding of the historical time and place by
allowing the reader to understand the social dynamics of the community and the lived
situation for the many households, farms, and ranches that Baldwin had the opportunity
to visit. Memoirs and autobiographies – lived histories – foster a sense of empathy in the
reader that might not otherwise be possible in a more formal, traditionally written
academic history.
Like Tails, Reflections of an Octogenarian stirs a powerful sense of empathy in
the reader; it would be extremely difficult to analyze the work without internalizing Betty
Brown Hayes’ struggles, and experiencing some degree of sympathy for her. As Hayes
describes and defines some deeply personal, and what would have traditionally been
private, experiences, she also contextualizes her experiences by framing them in the
sociocultural milieu of the time. While many historians have noted the challenges
professional women faced in the 1960s and 1970s in finance in New York, and others
still have documented the problems facing those with mental illness in the same period,
her lived experiences give some shape and sense to that time. John Inscoe, in his work,
Writing the South Through the Self: Exploration in Southern Autobiography, has said that

210
“autobiography and memoir comprise what I believe are among the most moving and
vividly expressed forms of historical documentation” (Inscoe, p. 1). Memoirs and
personal histories like Reflections of an Octogenarian offer the reader that kind of vivid
expression, and go further by inviting the reader to share in an intimate retelling of the
author’s past, and give the reader opportunity to celebrate that past as it would have
otherwise been untold.
Celebrating works that would not be published, and seeing the value in histories
that otherwise would not have been told, is a simple and straightforward process after
reading and reviewing Dan Ford’s The History of New Mexico High School Football.
Ford’s work – unquestionably a labor of love, and a book that represents countless hours
poring over microfilm newsreels in academic libraries – seems at first glance to be a
sports statistician’s realized dream. It carefully and doggedly notes wins and losses,
delineates the rise of certain teams and their dynasties, and compiles a cohesive historical
narrative out of a loose collection of disparate and disconnected regional newspapers.
While this content is valuable in and of itself, and there is no question that Ford wrote it
because he believed that such a work was sorely needed, Ford also wrote an extremely
inclusive history, and one that (without perhaps intending such a thing) also told the story
of football in Indian Schools, and the rivalries and relationships that these schools
established with other public schools in the area.
Ford, early in his work, confesses that he is not a professional historian, and that
he tried to write in such a way that was impartial and fair. The real value in Ford’s work,
as an amateur historian, is not simply that he has tried and succeeded at the creation of a
history of local high school football, but rather, that he has inadvertently created an richly

211
diverse history by seamlessly including the histories of New Mexico Indian Schools with
all other New Mexico public high schools. His tenacious attention to detail, and almost
certainly the quality that makes him a successful local announcer and sports statistician,
is his willingness to tease out and to highlight the mundane details with equal veracity for
every team that participated in the sport; the result of which is a dynamic and
unprejudiced history.
A history that celebrates and includes people – even the unspectacular and the
everyday – is the central mission of Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm. Donna Hutter’s
contribution to regional histories of rural Wisconsin may not be unique insofar as setting
and time period; indeed, there are many other published books that address the ordinary
lives of Wisconsinites and their relationship to the agricultural economy during the Interwar period and the Great Depression. Hutter, the author-curator of her family’s history,
has rendered a vision of the past that places a centralized focus on women’s work and
labor, and its contribution to the household economy. The lived experience of the
Kirschbaum-Volk and Volk-Mears families as it is portrayed in Growing up on a
Wisconsin Farm is palpable and refreshing. For all of the book’s problems and flaws –
the sort of issues that a publishing house editor might correct or disapprove of – the daily
reality of one woman’s endless labor (and the necessary physicality for such work) is
realized and rendered beautifully.
Capturing the way history felt to the people who lived it is something that
academic historians have been calling for in recent years. In their 1998 work, The
Emotional History of the United States, Peter Stearns and Jan Lewis have urged that
“[a]ll human experience has a history” – even that which is as evanescent and

212
unknowable as a person’s emotional state – and that the task of reconstructing lived
experiences like these is worthwhile work for historians (p. 1). The process of depicting
all the minor details that make up a person’s working life, understanding how a person
made do in difficult, spartan, or otherwise austere times, and making that story feel
tangible and real to an audience of readers, is a somewhat easier task. Growing up on a
Wisconsin Farm particularly fosters empathy for Sadie Volk – the central character of
Hutter’s family memoirs – and gives readers insight to the labor of woman in rural
Wisconsin in the early 20th century.
If nothing else, the works considered here all prove that Americans believe that
they have stories to tell and historical truths to uncover; their families have trajectories
that deserve charting, or their paths reveal truths that are similar or shared with others
from the same regions or periods, or they are equipped more than others to excavate a
historical work on one particular subject. Further, these works indicate that their authors
all see their work as a contribution to a broader historical project; Hayes’ Reflections of
an Octogenarian speaks directly to her reading audience by saying that she has written a
self-centered history, but perhaps one that will be helpful to others who experienced with
similar traumas and hardships in the same period, when such sharing was taboo. Ford
admits in The History of New Mexico High School Football that he is no professional
historian, but he knows that a work like the one he has written is needed in the local
histories of the region, and he not only fulfills the void of a history of a sport, but also of
New Mexico education and the role of Indian schools in that history. Baldwin’s Tails of
the Prairie captures a little-known community history and also happens to chart the slow
process of technological advancement and the development of infrastructure in the

213
American West at midcentury. Not just a family history, Growing up on a Wisconsin
Farm is also a feminist work that painstakingly itemizes the backbreaking labor of one
woman, managing a household in impoverished times. All of these self-published books
had a larger vision for their work, and a close reading of all of them revealed that they
often had multiple stories to tell, and were certainly richer than any perfunctory glance
might suggest.

Conclusion: The Future of Self-Published Works and Paths for Future Research
The transition to digital books, electronic reading devices, and alternative
publishing forms has been so rapid that many academics, publishing industry
commentators, and librarians have struggled to keep up. New formats will surely offer
new methods for authors and writers to find audiences around the world. In the period in
which this dissertation was completed, some references and publication models became
dated and obsolete – an issue that prevails in studies within and about this contemporary
information age. However, and in spite of the reliance on fleeting digital data, exploring
this new category of cultural production is worthwhile because it is so accessible to so
many and is reflective of changing internet culture. In the last 15 years, social media and
the Internet has shifted to allow all users to create content, to collaborate, and to express
themselves with greater freedom than ever before (Shirky, 2008; A. Keen, 2007; Tapscott
and Williams, 2006). While some of the technical mechanisms may change regarding
this new style of self-publishing, the emphasis on user participation and broader public
contribution will likely evolve at a significantly slower rate.

214
Additional work on the relationship that could emerge between small and regional
historical societies and these craft historians would develop this topic further. These
histories may lend a “People’s” truth to the historical record that is new, fresh, and as yet
unknown. Down the road it would be helpful for local public historians or museum
curators to assemble these new histories, and this dissertation may serve as a steppingstone to describe and discuss how and why these histories may or may not work in local
collections. Some historians are beginning to pay attention to non-traditional sources of
historical material; Boston University Historical Society’s theme for their May/June 2012
Columbia, South Carolina conference was “Popularizing Historical Knowledge: Practice,
Prospects, and Perils,” and members advocated for participants to consider the
ramifications of popularizing history and popular history production. As more historians
seek out new ways to draw in the public, they must find ways to include public forms and
public productions of history.
While historians contest, embrace, discuss, and challenge the role of such books
in the canon, librarians seem particularly poised to advance the pathway to inclusion for
self-published works. The value of outsider perspectives has long been clear to
librarians; they understand that a true repository of the world’s knowledge must include
those voices that are not typically allowed to speak, or have traditionally been publishable.
Libraries, more than any other place, can and should invite in the content that is not
necessarily commercially viable, and cannot be found in any and every mainstream
bookstore. Such steps encourage diverse voices and foster diverse audiences.
In the case of Tales from the Dark Side of the Laundry Basket, Kate Van Gilder
Hunt’s book has found a home in the Carl Johann Memorial Library at Culver-Stockton

215
College. As Hunt explained in her book talk, the work is a telling of some extremely
private truths. In the book, she speaks at length about crying to herself at night, audibly
asking her dead husband why he is no longer with her or their children, angry and
heartbroken, and then laughing to herself upon realizing that if her husband were still
alive, he would, “look at my puffy, tear drenched eyes… smile at [me,] give me a hug
and say, ‘[y]ou know, you look like shit, go to bed’” (Kindle Location 1107). Intimate
details like this would surely render sympathy in any reader. However, and as made clear
by the audience turnout for Hunt’s book talk, her story is a story of Canton, Missouri, too,
and not only a private tale for a private audience. In the book, she notes that she is
grateful for such a community, one where her children can run into friends at the local
pizza parlor, or where they can rely on support from their church community. Reading
the work, any of Canton’s residents would understand that she is necessarily referring to
Primo’s Pizza and Ice Cream, or St. Joseph’s Catholic Church. The work is littered with
these nods to local institutions and the people who support and define them, and in such a
way, Hunt’s story is Canton’s story as well. Such a work would necessarily be at home
in the Canton Public Library and the Culver-Stockton College Library, where community
members would find and appreciate these signposts of their shared past.
Self-published works such as these cannot and should not be dismissed, by
historians, historians of the book, or librarians. If they continue to be largely ignored,
then librarians and historians have made a shallow mistake by using professional polish
as the only criterion for collection and inclusion. Self-published historians and
memoirists have already circumvented the gatekeepers of publishing and found a way to
express themselves – in Amazon’s Indie Kindle store, certainly, but in many other venues

216
as well – and their works reveal a history that would otherwise have been cast aside by
publishers. This, in and of itself, speaks to a new era of book history worthy of study: the
democratization of publishing and the rise of the amateur. As Said defined it in his Reith
Lecture on the representations of the intellectual, amateurism is something to be
celebrated, because it comes from
…the desire to be moved not by profit or reward but by love for and
unquenchable interest in the larger picture, in making connections across lines and
barriers, in refusing to be tied down to a specialty, in caring for ideas and values
despite the restrictions of a profession (1993).
Devotion to subject of this kind is nowhere clearer than in Tails of the Prairie,
Reflections of an Octogenarian, The History of New Mexico High School Football, and
Growing up on a Wisconsin Farm.
