Onderzoek en innovatie in West-Afrika: een informetrische
analyse in het kader van het Triple Helix-model
Samenvatting
Dit proefschrift ontwikkelt een m ethode om te evalueren welke bijdrage onderzoek
aan innovatie levert en dus aan economische groei in het aigemeen en de
kenniseconomie in het bijzonder. Het is gebaseerd op het Triple Helix-model van
innovatie en is geografisch beperkt to t de vijftien West-Afrikaanse landen, die
allemaal lid zijn van de Economische Gemeenschap van W est-Afrikaanse Landen
(ECOWAS), het grootste regionale samenwerkingsverband in dit deel van Afrika.
De Triple Helix is een variant van het niet-lineaire model van innovatie, w at stelt dat
innovatie

het

resultaat

is van

wisselwerkingen

tussen

Universiteit,

Industrie,

Overheid en hun omgeving. Volgens het Triple Helix-model zorgen de relaties tussen
de drie actoren voor een kennisinfrastructuur die kennis genereert. De verspreiding
hiervan leidt to t innovatie. Het model verklaart en benadrukt het belang van
kennisproductie en -deling in economische groei. Het is, m et andere w oorden, in
overeenstem m ing m et het concept van de op kennis gebaseerde economie.
De relaties tussen universiteit, industrie en overheid vormen een complex systeem

in de Triple Helix-analyse gebruikt om aan te geven hoe centraal gestuurd een

gebaseerd is.
Het doctoraatsproefschrift bestudeert het complexe systeem van de Triple Helix van
U niversiteit-lndustrie-O verheid relaties vanuit inform atietheoretisch oogpunt. W e
beschouwen de U-l-G relaties als een inform atiebron en tonen aan dat zo'n bron m et

kan

normalisatie van de wederzijdse inform atie voorgesteld die w e transmissievermogen

Het transmissievermogen m eet de efficientie van de wederzijdse inform atie. Het
geeft het stuk deelbare inform atie aan dat effectief in een innovatiesysteem gedeeld
w ordt. Anders gezegd, het is de sterkte van de uitwisseling van inform atie en kennis
tussen variabelen. De berekening van het transmissievermogen kan plaatsvinden op
het

niveau

van

een

regio

(lokaal),

op

het

niveau

van

innovatieactoren

in

partnerlanden (buitenlands), of beide (globaal). Dit onderscheid is nodig om het
7

effect te berekenen van internationale samenwerking op kennisstromen binnen het
innovatiesysteem van een regio.
Dit theoretisch kader w ordt toegepast op de regio van W est-Afrika.
W e beschrijven eerst het kader van wetenschappelijke publicaties in de W estAfrikaanse regio door de kenmerken te bestuderen van de publicaties uit de regio die
in W eb o f Science zijn ge hdexeerd: de jaarlijkse output, de taal en het type van de
productie, het gebied van de productie, de patronen van co-auteurschap, de m ate
van

internationale

samenwerking,

de

belangrijkste

partnerlanden,

citeerbare

docum enten en de h-index. W e vergelijken het wetenschappelijke profiel van de
W est-Afrikaanse regio m et dat van Brazilie, India, China en Zuid-Afrika over een
periode van tien jaar (2001-2010). Hoewel de jaarproductie van West-Afrika in een
opwaartse trend zit, blijft ze te laag in vergelijking m et de wereldproductie. De
belangrijkste Afrikaanse partnerlanden zijn Zuid-Afrika (in Zuidelijk Afrika), Kameroen
(in Centraal-Afrika),

Kenia en Tanzania (in Oost-Afrika). De belangrijkste niet-

Afrikaanse partnerlanden zijn Frankrijk, de VS en het Verenigd Koninkrijk, die samen
hebben bijgedragen to t m eer dan 63% van de papers m et een niet-West-Afrikaans
adres, w at illustreert hoezeer de regionale wetenschapsbeoefening naar buiten is
gericht.

In W est-Afrika is de universiteit de grootste producent van kennis, gevolgd door
overheid en Industrie. Het aantal industriele publicaties is verwaarloosbaar; sommige
landen hebben er zelfs geen. Bijgevolg is de samenwerking tussen de universiteit en
de overheid beter zichtbaar. Op het niveau van de afzonderlijke landen hebben alle
15 lidstaten gegevens over samenwerking tussen universiteiten en de overheid, maar
alleen in Nigeria en Ghana heeft het bedrijfsleven samenwerkingen m et overheid of
universiteit. Deze tw ee landen zijn de grootste producenten van inform atie binnen
de regio. Enkel in Nigeria was er samenwerking tussen de drie Triple Helix-actoren.
De wederzijdse inform atie tussen universiteit, bedrijfsleven en overheid is zwak
zowel op regionaal als nationaal niveau, w at w ordt aangetoond door het lage niveau
van synergie tussen de actoren in de regio.
De

wederzijdse

inform atie

en

het transmissievermogen

worden

gebruikt

als

indicatoren van de kenniscirculatie tussen West-Afrikaanse innovatie-actoren. Ze
tonen aan dat m inder dan 10% van de kennis geproduceerd binnen het W estAfrikaanse innovatiesysteem w ordt gedeeld tussen innovatie-actoren. Vervolgens
zoeken w e een correlatie tussen het transmissievermogen en andere indicatoren om
de kenniseconomie te m eten. Voor de gevalstudie selecteren we zes OESO-landen
(de VS, Canada, Frankrijk, Duitsland, Japan en Zuid-Korea) en zes indicatoren: de
bruto-uitgaven voor onderzoek en ontwikkeling (GERD) als percentage van het bruto
binnenlands product (BBP), het aantal onderzoekers, de groei van het bruto
binnenlands product (BBP), het bruto binnenlands product per hoofd van de
8

bevolking (BBP per hoofd van de bevolking), Human Developm ent Index (HDI) en
Total Factor Productiviteit (TFP). Japan en Zuid-Korea vertonen een sterke positieve
correlatie

tussen

transmissievermogen

en

de

GERD

enerzijds

en

tussen

transmissievermogen en het aantal onderzoekers anderzijds. Beide landen hebben
hetzelfde patroon betreffende het transmissievermogen en elk van de geselecteerde
indicatoren; andere landen laten geen vergelijkbaar patroon zien. De analyse leidt to t
de conclusie dat het transmissievermogen berekend op enkel het nationaal niveau
niet volstaat om te m eten in welke m ate een economie een kenniseconomie is,
om dat

het geen

rekening

houdt

m et

de

synergie

en

de

kennisbijdrage

op

internationaal niveau d o o rd e innovatieactoren uit het land.
Om het effect te bestuderen van internationale samenwerking op de synergie en de
creatie en circulatie van kennis in een innovatiesysteem, werden drie niveaus van
analyse onderscheiden: het binnenlandse niveau dat de innovatie-actoren van het
land o f het studiegebied groepeert, het buitenlandse niveau dat institutionele
partners groepeert en het w ereldw ijde niveau dat de innovatie-actoren van zowel
binnenlandse als buitenlandse niveaus samenvoegt. W e postuleren dat de kennis die
circuleert

in

een

innovatiesysteem

w ordt

bepaald

door

het

w ereldw ijde

transmissievermogen om dat het de kennisinbreng uit internationale samenwerking
integreert. Het w ereldw ijde transmissievermogen is daarom

beter geschikt om

landen te vergelijken.
Uit de wederzijdse inform atie en het transmissievermogen berekend voor de drie
niveaus voor Zuid-Korea en West-Afrika

is gebleken

dat het West-Afrikaanse

innovatiesysteem m inder ge htegreerd is dan zijn institutionele partners, terw ijl het
Zuid-Koreaanse innovatiesysteem op zichzelf m eer is ge ntegreerd. Het binnenlandse
transmissievermogen varieert van 3 to t 7% in Afrika en schommelt rond 20% in ZuidKorea. Dit betekent dat in W est-Afrika 3 to t 7% van de uitwisselbare inform atie en
kennis circuleert onder innovatie-actoren (tegenover 20% in Z u id -K o rea). Algemeen
heeft

W est-Afrika

to t

100%

aan

kennisuitwisseling

bij gekregen

binnen

zijn

innovatiesysteem als gevolg van internationale samenwerking en Zuid-Korea 20%. De
grote afhankelijkheid van de W est-Afrikaanse regio van internationale samenwerking
(50% tegenover 20% voor Zuid-Korea) verklaart dit effect op het inform atie- en
kennisverkeer binnen het West-Afrikaanse regionale innovatiesysteem.

Research and innovation in West Africa: an informetric
analysis within the framework of the Triple Helix model
Abstract
This doctoral dissertation provides a method to evaluate the contribution o f research
to innovation and, hence, to economic growth in general and the knowledge-based
economy in particular. It is based on the Triple Helix model of innovation and has as
geographical fram ew ork the fifteen W est African countries, all members of the
Economic Com m unity of the W est African States (ECOWAS), the largest regional
integration space in this part of Africa.
The Triple Helix is a variant of the nonlinear model of innovation, which postulates
th a t innovation results from interactions betw een University, Industry, Governm ent
and their environm ent. According to the Triple Helix model, the relationships
betw een these three actors maintain a knowledge infrastructure that generates
knowledge whose distribution leads to innovation. The model explains and stresses
the im portance o f knowledge production and sharing in economic growth; in other
words, it is compliant w ith the concept of the knowledge-based economy.
The University-lndustry-Government relationships constitute a complex system th at
can be studied with tools and techniques from different disciplines, e.g. information
theory, social netw ork analysis and game theory. Originally, the m utual information
borrowed from Shannon's inform ation theory measures the quantity o f information
common to tw o variables in a netw ork communication. It is based on the notion of
entropy, which measures the quantity o f information contained within a variable.
The mutual inform ation is introduced in the Triple Helix relationship analysis to
indicate the synergy within an innovation system or determ ine how centrally
controlled an innovation system is. It also indicates the extent to which an economy
is knowledge-based.
The doctoral thesis studies the complex system o f the Triple Helix of Universitylndustry-Governm ent relationships from the information theory point of view. It
considers the University-lndustry-Government relationships as an inform ation source
and dem onstrates th at such a source with n random variables can be split into 2" or
2n - 1 "states". Therefore, the maximum entropy o f the source can be com puted. The
upper and low er bounds to the m utual information are determ ined; then, the
normalisation o f the mutual information is proposed under the name transmission
power, as an indicator o f the Triple

Helix of University-lndustry-Government

relationships.
The transmission power measures the efficiency o f the m utual inform ation. It
indicates the part of the sharable information th at is really shared within an
innovation system; in other words, it denotes the strength of the circulation of
inform ation and knowledge betw een variables. The transmission power can be
11

calculated at either the area level (domestic) or the partner countries' innovation
actor level (foreign) or both (global). This distinction is needed to compute the effect
o f international collaboration on knowledge flow within an area's innovation system.
This theoretical fram ew ork is applied to the W est African region.
W e first describe the landscape of scientific publishing in the W est African region by
studying the characteristics o f the W eb of Science-indexed publications produced by
the region: annual output, language and type o f production, fields of production, coÂ­
authorship patterns, international collaboration rate, main partner countries, citable
documents and h-index. W e compare the scientific profile of the W est African region
to th at of Brazil, India, China and South Africa over a ten-year period (2001-2010).
Even though the annual output of W est Africa is trending upward, it remains too low
w hen compared to the global output. The main African partner countries are South
Africa (Southern Africa), Cameroon (Central Africa), Kenya and Tanzania (Eastern
Africa). The main non-African partner countries are France, USA and the United
Kingdom, which on their own contributed to over 63% of the papers with a non-West
African address, illustrating the extraversion of the regional science. Individual
countries have higher international collaboration rates, except for Nigeria. W est
African countries cooperated less with each other and less with African and
developing countries than they did with developed ones.
In W est Africa, University is the biggest science producer followed by Government
and Industry. However, the num ber o f industrial publications is negligible, with some
countries even having no industrial output at all. Consequently, collaboration
betw een University and Governm ent is more visible. At the level of individual
countries, all 15 m em ber states have data on joint University /

Government

collaborations, whereas publishing collaborations between Industry and Government
or University are only found in Nigeria and Ghana, the tw o biggest information
producers within the region. Collaborations between the three Triple Helix actors
occurred only in Nigeria. The mutual information betw een University, Industry and
G overnm ent at both regional and national levels is weak, illustrating the low level of
synergy among the actors in the region as far as scientific publishing is concerned.
M utual inform ation and transmission power are used as indicators o f knowledge
circulation betw een W est African innovation actors. The results reveal that less than
10% o f the knowledge produced within the W est African innovation system is shared
betw een the innovation actors. Subsequently, we investigated possible correlations
betw een the transmission power and a number of indicators used to measure the
knowledge-based economy. For the case study, we selected six OECD countries (USA,
Canada,

France, Germany, Japan and South Korea) and six indicators: Gross

Expenditure for Research and Development as a percentage of Gross Domestic
Product (GERD), num ber of researchers, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate,
Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP per capita), Human Development Index
(HDI) and Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Japan and South Korea exhibit a positive
strong correlation between transmission power and GERD on the one hand and
12

transmission pow er and num ber of researchers on the other hand. These tw o
countries display similar patterns regarding transmission pow er and each o f the
selected indicators; other countries do not show any comparable patterns. The
analysis allows us to conclude th at i) the transmission pow er computed at national
level only is not sufficient to measure the extent to which an economy is knowledgebased, because it does not take into account the synergy and the knowledge
contributed at international level by the innovation actors of a nation and ii) the
transmission power captures a dynamic th at is not present in other indicators.
In order to study the effect of international collaboration on the synergy and
knowledge creation and circulation in an innovation system, three levels of analysis
w ere distinguished: the domestic level pooling the innovation actors operational in
the country or th e area under study, the foreign level grouping the institutional
partners and the global level merging the innovation actors from both domestic and
foreign levels. W e postulated that the knowledge th at circulates within an innovation
system is determ ined by the global transmission power because it integrates the
knowledge contributed due to international collaboration. The global transmission
pow er is therefore a more suitable indicator fo r comparison betw een countries.
The m utual inform ation and transmission pow er computed at the three levels for
South Korea and W est Africa revealed th at the W est African innovation system is less
integrated than its institutional partner -e v e n though the latter come from different
horizons- whereas the South Korean innovation system is more integrated by itself.
The domestic transmission pow er varies from 3 to 7% in Africa and am ounts to ~ 20%
in South Korea, i.e., in W est Africa, 3 to 7% (against 20% in South Korea) o f the
sharable

inform ation

and

knowledge

circulates among the

innovation

actors.

Globally, W est Africa has gained up to 100% in knowledge flow within its innovation
system

due

to

international

collaboration

and

South

Korea

20%.

The

high

dependence o f the W est African region on international collaboration (50% against
20% for South Korea) explains this effect on inform ation and knowledge circulation
within the innovation system o f the W est African region.

1. Introduction
1.1.

Bibliometrics and the measurement of science

Nowadays,

in

the

scientific

literature,

several

term s

such

as

bibliometrics,

scientometrics, webom etrics, informetrics, technometrics and, recently, altmetrics,
are used to designate the application of mathem atical and statistical techniques and
m ethods to documents or inform ation. Even though all of them share m athem atical
and statistical techniques and methods, they do not all apply to the same type of
resource or inform ation source.
According to Pritchard (1969), the term statistical bibliography had been used to
describe the process of illuminating the history o f science and technology by
counting

documents

until

he

proposed

the

term

bibliometrics.

He

defined

bibliometrics as the application o f m athematical and statistical methods to books and
o th er m edia. However, Rousseau (2009, 2014) recalled th at Paul O tlet had yet
appealed fo r a new discipline he named bibliom etrie1 in his Traite de documentation
(1934). The term bibliometrics was used in the W est whereas at the same tim e the
word scientometrics was in the East (Brookes, 1988, p. 29; Egghe & Rousseau, 1990b,
p. 2). Coined in Russia by Vassili V. Nalimov (Braun, 2001, p. 101),2 the term
"Naukom etriya" - translated into English as scientometrics - is defined as the study
o f the m easurem ent o f scientific and technological progress.
Informetrics first proposed by Nacke (1979) was adopted by the form er Soviet AllUnion Institute for Scientific and Technical Inform ation (VINITI) as a generic term to
em brace both bibliometrics and scientometrics (Brookes, 1990, p. 42). Its objectives
are, according to VINITI, the provision o f reliable data for research and developm ent,
for policy-making and planning, and for the m anagem ent of institutions, projects,
programmes, and activities. Tague-Sutcliffe (1992) defined informetrics as "the study
o f the quantitative aspects o f information

in any form , not just records or

bibliographies, and in any social group, not just scientists. Thus it looks at the
quantitative aspects o f informal or spoken communication, as well as recorded, and
of inform ation needs and uses o f the disadvantaged, not just the intellectual elite".
According to Egghe and Rousseau (1990b, p. 3), informetrics, including bibliometrics,
scientometrics, citation analysis and theoretical aspect o f inform ation retrieval,
"borrows tools (techniques, models, analogies) from mathematics, physics, com puter
science and others metrics and applied to library m anagement, sociology o f science,
history o f science, science policy and information retrieval". A literature review o f the
history o f the three term s (bibliometrics, scientometrics and informetrics) is given by
Hood and Wilson (2001).

o f Vassily Vassilievich Nalim ov.

V

Besides these 'traditional term s', several other -m etrics term s flourished, mainly at
the advent and the popularization of the internet; they are netometrics, webometry,
internetometrics, webometrics, cybermetrics, Web bibliometry (cf. Bjorneborn &
Ingwersen, 2004, p. 1217). They w ere intended to designate the application o f the
bibliometrics techniques to the new media resources. Each of them was proposed by
different

authors;

but

webometrics

and

cybermetrics

w ere

the

most

used

(Bjorneborn & Ingwersen, 2004); others have disappeared now.
W ebom etrics designates "the study of the quantitative aspects of the construction
and use of inform ation resources, structures and technologies on the W eb drawing
on bibliometrie and informetric approaches" (Bjorneborn & Ingwersen, 2004, p.
1217). The authors added th at this discipline covers "quantitative aspects of both the
construction side and the usage side of the W eb embracing four main areas of
present w ebom etric research: 1) W eb page content analysis; 2) W eb link structure
analysis; 3) W eb usage analysis (including log files of users' searching and browsing
behaviour); 4) W eb technology analysis (including search engine performance) Â» (p.
1217).
In the same fram ew ork, cybermetrics is defined as a generic term for "the study of
the quantitative aspects of the construction and use of information resources,
structures and technologies on the whole Internet drawing on bibliometrie and
inform etric approaches" (p. 1217). It encompasses statistical studies of discussion
groups, mailing lists, and other com puter mediated communication on the Internet
including the W eb. Besides covering all com puter-m ediated communication using
Internet applications, it also covers quantitative measures of the Internet backbone
technology, topology, and traffic (p. 1217). W ebom etrics is therefore, included into
cybermetrics. Bjorneborn and Ingwersen (2004, p. 1217) proposed Figure 1-1 to
illustrate the relations between the information science metrics subfields.

W ith the rise of social media, another metric term has emerged: altmetrics. It is
defined as "the creation and study o f new metrics based on the Social W eb for
analysing, and informing scholarship"; its vision is summarized in a manifesto (Priem,
Taraborelli, Groth, & Neylon, 2010). Altmetrics "refers to the use of social media,
particularly W eb 2.0 media, in assessing the influence of researchers on all type of
users" (Rousseau & Ye, 2013, p. 3288) so that Priem and Hemminger (2010) could
speak o f "scientometrics 2.0". In fact, the idea behind altmetrics is the same as the
one behind informetrics. Altmetrics is a new form of informetrics (Rousseau & Ye,
2013, p. 3289). M oreover, it is informetrics applied to the new inform ation sources
social media are. As such, it is included in informetrics. Because its sources are social
media th at are mainly web-based, altmetrics is part o f webometrics.
Patent is another source of inform ation bibliometrics techniques are applied to. The
term technometrics is then used. It serves in direct m easurem ent of technological
innovation (Archibugi & Sirilli, 2001).
In summary, based on Brookes's (1988, 1990) definition, Egghe and Rousseau
(1990b) agreed to use bibliometrics fo r docum entation and scientometrics for
sciences studies. Informetrics is the broader term that comprises all-metrics studies
related to inform ation science (Egghe, 2005, p. 1311; Rousseau & Ye, 2013, p. 3288).
Guns (2013) argued th at informetrics has three dimensions; i) the docum entary
dimension (documents), ii) the social dimension (people and groupings o f people),
and iii) the epistemic or cognitive dimension (topics and ideas). As Le Coadic (1994)
stated about inform ation science, informetrics has become a science for years
because it has an epistemology (a specific concept, models, methods, etc.), societies
(e.g. the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics), journals (e.g.
Scientometrics, Journal o f informetrics) and scientific events (e.g. the ISSI biannual
conferences of which the first tw o w ere held respectively in 1987 (Egghe & Rousseau,
1988) and 1989 (Egghe & Rousseau, 1990a)). Figure 1-2 presents the subjects and
research areas of informetrics as proposed by Stock and W eb er (2006, p. 385).
Informetrics therefore, works with "inform ation" w hatever the source or m edium is.
It is used, among others, to assess research output or research policy.
The challenge o f informetrics is to reveal the relation betw een scientific outputs and
the scientific, technological and economic developm ent; it faces this challenge
though models (Courtial, 1990, p. 11).

1.2.

Information and knowledge

The term inform ation has contents and meanings that vary across disciplines, so that
Le Coadic (1994, p. 8) w rote th at the concept "has been taking a chameleon form"
and Buckland (1991) affirm ed th at the term

bears an ambiguity. Fortunately,

w hatever the discipline is, the ultim ate objective of information is conveying
knowledge throughout messages (Bates, 2005). In information science, difference is
made betw een data, information and knowledge; even a hierarchy was introduced:
data is symbols with no meaning; information adds meaning to data, and knowledge
is inform ation processed, structured, and organized, or information ready to be
applied, to be put in action (Bates, 2005; Buckland, 1991). Knowledge is an
exclusively cognitive phenomenon. Information or knowledge is intangible; in other
words, "one cannot touch it or measure it in any direct way" (Buckland, 1991).
However, Shannon (1948) proposed an information theory fram ew ork to measure
the quantity of information contained in a message. In this theory, data is defined in
term s of therm odynam ic (physical) entropy, information in term s of Shannon
(symbol) entropy, and knowledge in term s of cognitive (context) entropy (Boisot &
Canals, 2014).

1.3.

Research and innovation

1.3.1. Defining research
Research related activities encompass all works that contribute to knowledge
creation. The Frascati Manual (OECD, 2002b, para. 63) states that research and
experim ental

developm ent

(R&D)

comprise

creative

w ork

undertaken

on

a

systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of
man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new
applications.

It

covers three

activities:

basic

research,

applied

research

and

experim ental developm ent. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work
undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge o f the underlying foundation of
phenomena and observable facts, w ithout any particular application or use in view.

32

Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new
knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or
objective. Experimental developm ent

is systematic work, drawing on existing

knowledge gained from research an d /o r practical experience, which is directed to
producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems
and services, or to improving substantially those already produced or installed. R&D
covers both form al R&D in R&D units and informal or occasional R&D in other units
(OECD, 2002b).

1.3.2. Defining innovation
The

Oslo

M anual

(OECD

&

EUROSTAT,

2005)

defines

innovation

as

Â«the

im plem entation o f a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or
process, a new m arketing m ethod, or a new organisational method in business
practices, workplace organisation or external relationsÂ». In other words, innovation
supposes new things, new ways of doing, creativity, added value (OECD & EUROSTAT,
2005, para. 146). The manual recognizes th at innovation may occur in any sector of
the economy, including governm ent services such as health or education (OECD &
EUROSTAT, 2005, para. 27). Four types of innovations are distinguished at the level of
the firm: product, process, organisational and marketing. Innovation improves
perform ance and quality; it makes firms competitive. Innovation involves the
utilization of new knowledge or a new use or combination of existing knowledge
(OECD & EUROSTAT, 2005, p. 35). Therefore there is a relation betw een innovation
th at "consumes knowledge" and research activities that also consume knowledge but
produce new one. Innovation has become synonym of m odernity (Frietsch, 2008, p.
1). It drives economic growth and social welfare.
Innovation can be measured. Several indicators are used to this end; they relate to
research and experim ental developm ent (such as num ber of publications, research
collaboration, research funding, research equipm ent, num ber of researchers, etc.),
num ber o f patents, acquisition o f external knowledge and technology, and intangible
assets (such as software, human capital and new organisational structures) (cf. OECD,
2010; OECD & EUROSTAT, 2005, pp. 9 2 -9 4 ): each measures only a particular aspect
of innovation, th at explains the complexity o f the task. The OECD and the EUROSTAT
(2005, pp. 3 3 -3 7 ) proposed a fram ew ork for the m easurem ent of innovation. Figure
1-3 depicts this fram ew ork from the perspective o f the firm . It shows the four types
o f innovation at the firm level, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the
interactions betw een the firm and other actors like other firms, education and
research

institutions,

innovations

policies,

consumers,

and

infrastructure

and

institutional fram ew ork. Models have also been proposed to explain how innovation
is generated and how it contributes to economic growth and social welfare.

1.3.3. Models o f innovation
Two types of models o f innovation w ere proposed up to now to explain the
functioning of an economy: the linear and the nonlinear models. Each explains how
grow th is generated. Both models have been criticized (Godin, 2005, 2006b, 2007)
and variants of them w ere proposed. The linear model postulated th a t "innovation
starts w ith basic research, is fo llow ed by applied research and d evelopm ent, and
ends w ith production and diffusion" (Godin, 2005, 2006b, 2014). The linear model
has developed over tim es upon criticisms from

researchers, industrialists and

economists. The m oderate criticisms were mainly on the steps towards innovation. If
all o f the criticisms agreed th at basic research is the root and commercial use the
final stage of innovation, the interm ediary steps were discussed. For example,
Maclaurin (1953) identified five steps: pure science, invention, innovation, finance,
acceptance (or diffusion).
M ajo r criticisms questioned the linearity of innovation and affirm ed that innovation
is not the result of a linear process (Kline, 1985) but rather a complex one between
several institutions. The nonlinear model, an alternative to the linear model,
introduced with the national innovation system concept "suggests that the research
system's ultim ate goal is innovation and that the system is a part o f a larger system
composed

of

sectors

like

Government,

University

and

Industry

and

their

environm ent. The system also emphasized the relations betw een the components or
sectors as the "cause" explaining the performance o f innovation systems" (Godin,
2007, p. 5).

34

The model first focused on the institutional fram ew ork and relations, but shifted
later to the process of knowledge creation and diffusion by the same institutions,
leading to one of its variants, the knowledge-based economy fram ew ork (Godin,
2007, p. 7). Gibbons et al. (1994) introduced the M ode 1 and the M ode 2 of
knowledge production. The M ode 1 is characterized by the absence o f interactions
betw een academia and the society; the M ode 2 weakens the role of university as
knowledge producer and the collapse o f the m odern university (cf. also Nowotny et
al.,

2003).

Conversely,

the

Triple

Helix

model

focuses

on

the

overlay

of

communications and expectations betw een University, Industry and Governm ent.
In the national innovation system model, analysis focuses on the flows of knowledge
betw een actors (OECD, 1997, p. 11).

1.4.

The Triple Helix model of innovation

The Triple Helix laid down by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995, 2000) is one o f the
variants o f the nonlinear model o f innovation (cf. Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 2000;
Leydesdorff, 2012b, p. 26; M eyer et al., 2014, p. 153). It postulates that the
interactions betw een University, Industry and Governm ent maintain a knowledge
infrastructure th at generates knowledge o f which circulation among innovation
actors leads to innovation (Leydesdorff & Etzkowitz, 2001). It differs from other
variants o f the innovation system by i) stressing the changing role of the actors, ii)
considering the

relations betw een

University,

Industry and Governm ent as a

com m unication system and, iii) focusing on the "overlay of communications and
expectation" th a t reshapes the institutional arrangem ents among actors (Etzkowitz &
Leydesdorff, 2000, p. 109). The Triple Helix model reduces the num ber of innovation
actors to the three main ones whereas the innovation system model adds others like
financial institutions.
According to the OECD (2002a, p. 15), the concept of interaction betw een innovators
includes three basic ideas: i) com petition, which is the interactive process w here the
actors are rivals and which creates the incentives for innovation, ii) transaction,
which is the process by which goods and services, including technology embodied
and tacit knowledge are traded betw een economic actors, and iii) networking, which
is the process by which knowledge is transferred through collaboration, co-operation
and long term netw ork arrangements. The Triple Helix model relies on collaboration
betw een innovation actors for knowledge creation, sharing and transform ation
purposes.
This thesis works on the m odel o f the Triple Helix because i) the model deals with
knowledge generation and circulation within innovation systems which is central to
our objective; ii) it relates to the new economy also called the knowledge-based
economy; indeed, through innovation, new knowledge is created and diffused,
expanding the economy's potential to develop new products and more productive
methods o f operation (OECD & EUROSTAT, 2005, p. 35); iii) its geographic audience is

35

very broad compared with th at of other variants like the M ode 2 (Shinn, 2002, p.
603), iv) it constitutes a serious research school w ith an empirical and conceptual
agenda (Shinn, 2002, p. 611), v) national and international research funding
institutions (like the

North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the

European

Union,

National Science Foundation (USA), the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique
(France), etc.) are interested, and vi) researchers from the Third W orld contribute to
the

developm ent and the

established

the

im plem entation

1.5.

Knowledge-based economy

In the post-industrial economy, innovation results mainly from creation, acquisition,
diffusion and use of knowledge and not from industrial production (OECD, 2010, p.
21). This change in the innovation process led to the term

knowledge-based

economy.
The

term

was

coined

by the

Organisation

for

Economic

Co-Operation

and

Developm ent (OECD) th at defined it as an economy which is "directly based on the
production, distribution and use o f knowledge and inform ation" (OECD, 1996, p. 7). It
implies th at

economic growth,

essentially through the

wealth

creation

and

em ploym ent

are

driven

production, distribution and use o f knowledge (APEC

Economic Com m ittee, 2000). It is not just the digital economy, which incorporates
the production and use o f computers and telecommunication equipm ent. It is not
quite the networked economy, which incorporates the telecommunication and
networking growth during the last decades and its impact on human progress (United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe, 2002, p. v). It describes trends in
advanced economies towards greater dependence on knowledge, information and
high skill levels, and the increasing need for ready access to all of these by the
business and public sectors (OECD & EUROSTAT, 2005, p. 28).
In fact, the economy has always been based on knowledge; indeed, even in the so
called industrial economy (or traditional economy) mankind had needed knowledge
in order to transform natural resource and contribute to economic growth, "because
everything we do depends on knowledge" (W orld Bank, 1999, p. 16).
The knowledge-based economy is a complex phenomenon. For example, there are as
yet no internationally accepted

indicators to

measure it.

Hence international

organisations use their own indicators that also vary from one year to another. For
example, i) the OECD published several reports related to the knowledge-based
economy (e.g. OECD, 1996, 1999, 2013); it used up to sixty indicators with variations
from one publication to another; ii) the W ord Bank established the Knowledge
Economy Framework (Chen & Dahlman, 2005) which built tw o indicators: the
Knowledge Economy Index (KEI) and the Knowledge Index (Kl); iii) the Asian-Pacific
Economic

Cooperation

defined

the

idealised

36

knowledge-based

economy

but

recognized th a t the given indicators are too idealistic and th at not all its members
could provide the statistics; iv) in 2010, the European Commission (2010b) published
the innovation scoreboard which used twenty-six statistics; more recently, it has set
up a composite index, the Summary Innovation Index -

which summarizes the

perform ance of a range o f 25 different indicators (European Commission, 2014, p. 8);
the objective is no longer a direct m easurem ent o f the knowledge based economy
but rather innovation performance; v) the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe (2002) defined a fram ew ork to measure the knowledge-based economy and
suggested the Global Knowledge-Based Economy Index (GKEI) as an indicator. On
th eir side, researchers at individual level also proposed indicators. Arvanitidis and

Objectives and research questions

1.6.1. Motivations
Developing countries' contribution to world advancem ent in general is marginal in all
domains. Particularly, in the domain of scientific research, Africa's share to the world
science is negligible (less than 1%, cf. Adams et al., 2010). M oreover, this part o f the
world is the poorest, in term s of wealth production; it is also facing the biggest
challenges: poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, governance, population growth, access
to education and health cares, etc.
Science in Africa, in general, and W est African countries in particular, depends
strongly on international collaboration (cf. Adams et al., 2014; Adams et al., 2010;
Megnigbeto, 2013a; Tijssen, 2007; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011) owing to the
weaknesses in both the institutional fram ew ork and science funding and equipm ent.
Consequently, research is done in the shade or the wake of developm ent projects
and programmes financed by donors (Bierschenk & Mongbo, 1995) meaning the
m ajority o f research these countries conduct is contributed to or initiated by foreign
countries. So, there is a need to understand the extent to which the knowledge
produced by West-Africa-based researchers helps the region in wealth creation.
M o re generally, the policy challenges th at policy makers face require a solid
understanding of the mechanisms th at may help to improve the current situation.

1.6.2. Objectives
Our research aims to measure how research contributes to innovation in W est Africa.
Particularly, it intends to study how innovation actors collaborate in knowledge
creation and sharing in order to contribute to the economic and social developm ent
of the region.
The specific objectives are to:

37

1.

describe the landscape of scientific publishing in W est Africa by analysing the
scientific output o f the region with respect to annual research output,
language and publication type, scientific fields and co-authorship.

2.

study the collaboration pattern in W est African scientific publishing by
determ ining the annual collaboration rates of the W est African countries and
the main partner countries of W est Africa in term s of country, region as well
as continent;

3.

determ ine the extent to which W est African innovation actors collaborate
towards knowledge creation and sharing both at country level and regional
level;

4.

propose a method to measure knowledge circulation among innovation
actors; and,

5.

measure the extent to which knowledge is created and shared between
innovation actors both at individual country level and regional level.

1.6.3. Research questions
The main research question is: How does research contribute to innovation and
hence to the knowledge-based economy in W est Africa? It includes the following:
1.

W hat are the characteristics of the scientific output in W est Africa?

2.

To which extent do W est African countries collaborate with each other or
with the rest o f the world regarding scientific publishing?

3.

How do innovation actors collaborate in scientific publishing in W est Africa?

4.

How can knowledge circulation among the innovation actors be measured?

5.

How

is knowledge

produced

and

circulated

within

the

W est African

innovation systems?
To answer these research questions, we collected bibliographic references of W est
African countries' scientific publications over a ten-year period (2001-2010) from the
W eb of Science, an international multidisciplinary database.

1.7.

Structure of the study

The dissertation is structured in ten chapters as follows:
-

Chapter 1 (this one) introduces the them e: bibliometrics, informetrics,
research, innovation and knowledge-based economy;

-

Chapter 2 presents the W est African region, its M em b er States, gives basic
data on individual countries, presents the regional integration institutions

38

and programmes, and the challenges the region is facing by the means of
basic statistics and information;
-

Chapter 3 deals with the scientific profile of the W est African region and
compares it w ith other regions or countries from Africa or th e world;

-

Chapter 4 relates to the international and intraregional collaboration in W est
African science publishing;

-

Chapter 5 focuses on research collaboration betw een University, Industry
and Governm ent, the main innovation actors;

-

Chapter 6 elaborates a the transmission power as an indicator o f knowledge
flow betw een innovation actors;

-

Chapter 7 applies the transmission power (as introduced in chapter 6) to
measure the knowledge flow within the W est African innovation systems;

-

Chapter 8 compares six OECD economies with regard to the transmission
pow er and tests w h eth er there is any correlation betw een this indicator and
those used to measure the knowledge-based economy; and finally,

-

Chapter 9 enlarges the notion o f inform ation flow to include the effect of
international collaboration,

-

Chapter 10 concludes by summarizing the main findings o f the thesis and its
limitations,

and

discusses suggestions for

future

research

and

policy

implications.
Each chapter (from 3 to 9) form ulates its own research question(s), builds its m ethod,
collects and treats its data. Each is w ritten to be read independently.

2.1.

Introduction

The African continent counts 55 countries, including the W estern Sahara recognized
as a state by the African Union, but not yet by the United Nations Organization.
Except Morocco which has left the Union for political reasons, 3 all the African
countries are m em ber o f the African Union.
The African Union has divided the African continent into five regions4 taking into
account historical, cultural and geographical criteria. They are the Northern (6
countries), the W estern (15 countries), the Central (9 countries), the Eastern (14
countries) and the Southern (10 countries) (cf. Table 2-1). The African Union also
established eight Regional Economic Communities (African Union Commission & New
Zealand M inistry o f Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2014, p. 118) to encourage regional
integration within Africa, increase the flow o f foreign investment into the continent
and assist with sustainable economic developm ent. They are: the Arab M aghreb
Union (A M U ), the Common M arket for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the
Com m unity o f Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD), the East African Community (EAC),
the

Economic

Com m unity

of

Central

African

States

(ECCAS),

the

Economic

Com munity of W est African States (ECOWAS), the Intergovernm ental Authority on
Developm ent (IGAD) and the Southern African Developm ent Community (SADC).

Geographical location

The W est African region M e m b er States are, in the alphabetic order: Benin, Burkina
Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, M ali,
Nigeria, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. The region is comprised within the
inter-tropical area betw een the Equator and the Tropic o f Cancer (5Â° South and 25Â°
North) on the one hand, and the 20Â° W est and 15Â° East on the other hand. It is
bordered by the Atlantic Ocean in the South and the W est, M auritania, Morocco,
Libya and Algeria in the North, and Chad and Cameroon in the East (Figure 2-1). The
Southern part o f the region, closer to the Equator, has a hot and humid climate with
an abundant rainfall; it is covered with forests. The Northern part, the Sahel, is
covered w ith savannahs and steppes. A large part o f Mali, Niger and Senegal surface
is covered by the Sahara desert; the climate is dry and the soils are arid.

Political history

Before colonialism, the W est African region was covered by several empires and
kingdoms. The largest and strongest include M ali, Songhai, W olof, Oyo, Ghana,
Benin, Danxome, etc. Apart from Liberia which was set up by form er enslaved
Africans returning back from the USA, all the fourteen W est African countries have
been colonies of European Countries, namely France, Great Britain, Portugal and
Germany. They all became independent around 1960 (and Cape Verde in 1975). They
all continue however, to utilize European languages, a legacy of colonialism, as
official language (Table 2-2) even though the region counts many local languages.
From th eir independence in the early 1960s to the end of the Cold W ar (end of
1980s), almost all the African States and hence all the W est African States w ere ruled
by single-party authoritarian regimes. Coups d'etat occurred regularly leading to
chronic political instability. The fall of the

Berlin W all in 1989

has changed

geopolitical strategies at the international level, mainly in W estern countries, and
most o f the developing countries in general and W est African, in particular, w ere
forced to switch over to democracy with a liberalized political and economic system.
Almost all the W est African countries adopted the

republican form o f State

governance w ith institutional architecture borrowed from the W estern Countries: a
president,

a governm ent,

a parliam ent and

other institutions.

However, the

frustrations following the bad m anagem ent of elections processes and litigations, the
opportunist revisions of the fundam ental laws, the non-respect of democracy rules,
in a nutshell the absence o f democratic culture and strengthened institutions,
engendered coups (e.g. Niger in 1 9 9 6 ,1 9 9 9 and 2010, Burkina Faso in 2015 ), armed
conflicts (e.g. Cote d'Ivoire over 2002-2011), social and economic instability (e.g.
Togo in 1991 onwards), or people's open insurrection that led to resignation (Burkina
Faso in 2014). Political exclusion and natural resources m anagem ent has fed armed
conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone for over a decade (1988-2000) and in M ali (1990
onwards).

2.4.

Regional integration in West Africa

Regional integration involves more than just economic matters. It goes beyond free
m ovem ent of goods, capitals and persons and encompasses several other aspects
like freedom o f establishing oneself, doing business or being employed, benefiting
from social services like education or health, insurance, etc. in any M em b er States as
if one was in ones' own native country. The overall objective o f a regional integration
process is to make citizens' everyday life easier, and make people be citizen of a
larger frontier-free space.
In order to achieve this goal, institutional and legal fram eworks are usually set up;
policies are conceived and applied both at national and regional levels. By engaging
into a regional integration process, a country accepts to abandon a part o f its
sovereignty to the supranational authorities. According to M ahbub ul Haq, States-

43

nation have become "too big for small things and too small for big things" (Horner,
1993, p. 5). Therefore, M em b er States of a regional integration community need to
join their efforts at the regional level to tackle common problems they are facing;
conversely, some problems didn't need supranational authorities' intervention
before being resolved. These tw o faces of the same coin are best summarized by the
principle o f subsidiarity developed in the European integration law according to
which the European Union must act where the objectives to be pursued can be
better attained at the Union level (Borchardt, 2010, p. 41). M ore specifically, the
principle o f subsidiarity states th at the supra-national level should only take care of
those issues th at cannot be dealt with at the national level. The principle of
subsidiarity points out the requirem ent for elaborating and applying policies both at
national and supra national levels to solve problems the comm unity is facing.

The regional integration process in W est Africa started even under the colonial
powers whose objectives w ere to gain maximal profit from the colonies. Just after
the

independence,

the

newly

created

states

have joined

different

regional

integration communities. The Conseil de I'Entente (Understanding Council) created in
1959 covers Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger and Togo. The Union M onetaire
Ouest-Africaine (W est African M onetary Union, W A M U ) created in 1962 has become
Union Economique et M onetaire Ouest Africaine (W est African Economic and
M onetary Union, W AEM U, more known under its French acronym UEMOA) in 1996;
it groups 8 countries : Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger,
Senegal and Togo. It has had targets of free internal trade and a common external
tariff, and in the longer term free m ovem ent of services, capital, and people, and

44

harmonisation

and

mutual

recognition

of technical

standards.

O ther regional

organisations w ere created around w ater resources managem ent. Examples are the
Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal (OMVS) grouping countries
around the Senegal7 river, the Autorite du Bassin Niger (ABN) grouping countries the
river Niger goes through8, or the M a n o River Union (M R U )9.
The

largest regional integration organization

in W est Africa

is the

Economic

Com m unity o f W est African States (ECOWAS); it encompasses all 15 states o f the
region. W hile W AEM U's M em ber States have a common currency,10 the remaining
seven other countries each has its own currency. The W AEM U is more integrated and
advanced through its successful adoption and im plem entation o f regional policies
but the ECOWAS has expertise in maintaining regional peace and security (Toure,
2014). These tw o regional integration areas have agreed on a joint strategy to speed
up the process of integration in W est Africa (GEA-African studies group, Garcia, &
Seron, 2014, p. 8). The ECOWAS is the one that has a recognized political leadership;
indeed,

it

is the

unique

Regional

Economic

Community

in W est

Africa

as

distinguished by the African Union; it is also the one which represents the region with
its international partners like the United Nations Organisation or the European
Union.

2.5.

ECOWAS, the regional integration area

The Economic Community of W est African States (ECOWAS) groups together all the
15 countries of the W est African region. In other words, the W est African region, as
defined by the African Union, and the ECOWAS coincide. It means th at any m em ber
of the African region is also m em ber of ECOWAS and vice-versa. If W est Africa is
often referred to from a political or geographic point of view, ECOWAS focuses on
the

regional integration

process.

In this thesis however, w e

utilize the tw o

designations interchangeably.

2.5.1. Creation and objectives
The ECOWAS was established with the Treaty of Lagos (ECOWAS, 1975) signed on
28th M ay 1975 in Lagos. The Treaty was revised in 1993 (ECOWAS Commission, 1993)
to enable the region to face new challenges. The organization aims at promoting
economic cooperation and integration and regional security th at should lead to an
economic and m onetary union through a complete integration of the economies of
M e m b e r States. The end o f these aims is to "raise the living standards o f its peoples,

7 There are Senegal, Gambia and M ali.
8 There are Benin, Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea
9 The m e m b e r states are Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea
10 The com m o n currency is th e W est A frican Franc o f w hich in in te rn a tio n a l code is XOF;

it has a fixed

45

and maintain and enhance economic stability, foster relations-among M em ber States
and contribute to the progress and developm ent of the African Continent" (Article 3
of the Revised Treaty). ECOWAS Headquarters are established in Abuja (Nigeria).
Later on, W est Africa integration institutions and M em ber States have recognized
democracy as a system th at sustains peace, stability, economic growth, social and
economic developm ent and a condition to regional integration; they are committed
to

"deepen

international

and

strengthen

standards"

with

the
an

democratic
"ECOWAS

of

institutions
people"

using

appropriate

as target

(ECOWAS

Commission, 2011b).

2.5.2. Institutional architecture
The organizational structure of the ECOWAS consists of the Authority of Heads of
State and Governm ent, the Council of Ministers, the Community Parliament, the
Economic and Social Council, the Community Court of Justice, the Commission, and
Specialized Technical Commissions (Article 6 of the Revised Treaty).
2.5.2.1. The A u th o rity o f Heads o f State and Government
The Conference of Heads of State and Government is composed o f Heads of State
an d /o r Government of M em b er States.

It is the

supreme institution o f the

Community. It is responsible for the general direction and control of the Community
and takes all measures to ensure its progressive development and the realization of
its objectives. The Authority meets at least once a year.
2.5.2.2. The Council o f Ministers
The Council comprises the M inister in charge of ECOWAS Affairs and any other
M inister o f each M em b er State. The Council is responsible for the functioning and
developm ent of the Community. To this end, unless otherwise provided in the Treaty
or a Protocol, The Council makes recommendations to the Authority on any action
aimed at attaining the objectives of the Community, and appoints all statutory
appointees other than the Commission. By the powers delegated to it by the
Authority, the Council issues directives on m atters concerning coordination and
harmonization of economic integration policies. It makes recommendations to the
Authority on the appointm ent o f the External Auditors, prepares and adopts its rules
o f procedure, and carries out all other functions assigned to it and exercise all powers
delegated to it by the Authority. The Council meets at least twice a year.
2.5.2.3. The Com m unity P a rlia m en t
The ECOWAS Parliament is essentially a consultative body. It provides advisory
opinion on issues covering a wide range of areas that are of crucial importance for
the integration process. These include respect for human rights, the interconnection
o f communication and telecommunication links, health, education, and revisions of

46

basic com m unity texts. The ECOWAS Parliament counts 115 seats distributed among
the 15 ECOWAS M e m b er States on the basis of th eir population (Table 2-3).

2 .5 2 .4 . The Economic and Social Council
The Economic and Social Council is also an advisory body. It includes representatives
of the various categories o f economic and social activity of the countries.
2.5.2.5. The Court o f Justice
The Court o f Justice addresses complaints from M em b er States and institutions of
ECOWAS, as well as issues relating to defaulting nations.
2.5.2.6. The Commission
The Commission, form erly Executive Secretary, is appointed by the Authority of
Heads of States and Governm ent for a four-year term , which may be renewed once
only. It is led by a President assisted by tw o Vice Presidents. The President of the
Commission directs the activities of the Commission; he is the legal representative of
the Institutions o f the Com m unity in their totality. His duties include i) execution of
decisions taken by the Authority and application of the regulations of the Council; ii)
prom otion

o f Comm unity developm ent

programmes and

projects as well

as

m ultinational enterprises o f the region; iii) convening as and when necessary
meetings o f sectoral Ministers to examine sectoral issues which prom ote the

47

achievem ent of the objectives of the Community; iv) d) preparation of draft budgets
and programmes of activity of the Community and supervision of th eir execution
upon th eir approval by Council; v) submission o f reports on Community activities to
all meetings o f the Authority and Council; vi) preparation of meetings of the
A uthority and Council as well as meetings of experts and technical commissions and
provision of necessary technical services; vii) recruitm ent o f staff of the Community
and appointm ent to posts other than statutory appointees in accordance with the
Staff Rules and Regulations; viii) submission of proposals and preparation of such
studies as may assist in the efficient and harmonious functioning and developm ent of
the Community; and ix) initiation of draft texts for adoption by the Authority or
Council.
The Commission is composed of 15 commissioners designated by the Authority of
Head o f States and Governm ent. It is headed by a President and a Vice-President.
2.5.2.7. Specialized institutions
The Technical Commissions are: i) Food and Agriculture; Industry, ii) Science and
Technology and Energy, iii) Environment and Natural Resources, iv) Transport, v)
Communications and Tourism, vi) Trade, Customs, Taxation, Statistics, M oney and
Payments, vii) Political, Judicial and Legal Affairs, Regional Security and Immigration,
vii) Human Resources, Inform ation, Social and Cultural Affairs, viii) Administration
and Finance Commission.
W ithin its field of competence, each Technical Commission prepares Community
projects and programmes and submits them for the consideration of Council through
the Commission, either on its own initiative or at the request of Council or the
Commission. It also ensures the harmonisation and co-ordination o f projects and
programmes o f the Community, monitors and facilitates the application o f the
provisions o f the treaty and related protocols pertaining to its area o f responsibility,
carries out any other functions assigned to it for the purpose o f ensuring the
im plem entation of the provisions of the Treaty.

2.5.3. Programmes and sectors
The ECOWAS prioritizes sectors th a t are energy, w ater, civil society, agriculture,
infrastructures, health and social affairs (including education), information and
communication

technologies,

telecommunications,

trade

and

political

affairs

(ECOWAS Commission, 2015b). The Community form ulated policies in the fields of
agriculture in 2005

(ECOWAS Commission, 2005),

industry in 2010

(ECOWAS

Commission, 2010a), and science, technology and innovation in 2012 (Commission de
la CEDEAO, 2012). It expressed its vision of an "ECOWAS o f people" by 2020
(ECOWAS Commission, 2011b) and established a Regional strategic plan for the
period

2001-2015

(ECOWAS

Commission,

2011a).

Six

strategic

pillars

were

articulated: (i) prom ote good governance and justice, (ii) strengthen mechanisms for
conflict

prevention,

m anagem ent

and

resolution;

48

(iii)

prom ote

infrastructure

developm ent

to

support

a

com petitive

business

environm ent,

sustained

developm ent and cooperation in the region; (iv) deepen economic and m onetary
integration; (v) reinforce institutional capacity; and (vi) strengthen mechanisms for
integration into the global market.
Several programmes are being executed in all sectors to strengthen to regional
integration. In the sector of energy there are the W est Africa Pow er Pool (WAPP)
and the W est Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP). The WAPP aims to integrate the national
pow er system operations into a unified regional electricity m arket - with the
expectation th at such mechanism would, over the medium to long-term, assure the
citizens of ECOWAS M em b er States a stable and reliable electricity supply at
affordable costs. The m andate of the WAGP is to transport natural gas from Nigeria
to customers in Benin, Togo and Ghana in a safe, responsible and reliable manner, at
prices com petitive w ith o th er fuel alternatives.
The free m ovem ent o f goods and persons and the establishment of ECOWAS citizens
in any ECOWAS country are effective. ECOWAS launched a Trade Liberalization
Scheme in 1990, and achieved a Custom union with a Common External Tariff in 2008
(ECOWAS Commission, 2015a). Positive strides have been m ade in the harmonization
of macroeconomic policies, the im plem entation of the Common External Tariff (CET),
m ultilateral surveillance, research and youth em pow erm ent, trade liberalisation,
customs union, favourable industrial policy, mines developm ent, agriculture and
environm ent, infrastructure-transport, telecommunications and energy. Soon, the
Abidjan-Lagos Highway Project under the

regional

infrastructure

developm ent

program m e would be com pleted. Currently, the region counts 9 currencies (Table
2-4). A unique m onetary zone and a single biometric identity card are scheduled for
202 0 (ECOWAS Commission, 2012, p. 12).

2.5.4. Challenges to regional integration
Apart from the economic challenges and setbacks that the region has suffered over
the decades, there have also been significant political challenges which have further
exacerbated the economic condition in M em ber States. Some of those challenges
include: political instability, conflicts, terrorism, endemic poverty, poor infrastructure
and lack o f political and institutional will. They have caused humanitarian disasters in
many M e m b er States, redirecting funding for developm ent to addressing these
pressing needs (Abass, 2013, pp. 2 6 -2 9 ).

Demographic profile

The ECOWAS counts 337 million inhabitants (cf. Table 2-5) of which 40% have less
than 15 years and half betw een 15 and 64 years. 52% of the W est African people are
fem ale. The density of the population is 66 inhabitants per square kilometre; the
annual population growth rate is 2.8%; about 47% of ECOWAS citizens live in an
urban area. These last three indicators display strong differences between countries
(cf. Table 2-6). As an illustration, Gambia is the densest country with 169 inhabitants
per square kilom etre and M ali and Niger have 12 to 14 inhabitants per square
kilom etre. The annual population growth rate, on the one hand, and the percentage
of urban population, on the other hand, oppose Cape Verde at the first gear (0.9%
and 64%) and Niger at the rear (2.9 and 18%) (cf. Table 2-6).

Economic profile13

2.7.1. Natural and agricultural resources
W est African lands favour the production o f agricultural resources like cereals, cocoa,
coffee, coconut, groundnut, cotton, etc. (cf. Table 2-7). The region is also endowed
w ith a vast w ealth o f untapped mineral resources, which locally undergo elem entary
processing (ECOWAS Commission, 2010b) like oil and gas, uranium, gold, etc. (cf.
Table 2-8) of which a negligible part is processed by locally implanted industries.

13 This section is largely based on A frican D e velo pm e nt Bank and A frican D e velo pm e nt Fund (2011).

2.7.2. Macroeconomic performance
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annual growth rate is comprised between 5 and
7% from 2006 to 2013 at the regional level (Figure 2-2). Agriculture contributes 33%,
Industry 36% and Services 31% (Figure 2-3). The growth rate is linked to oil price
however (GEA-African studies group et al., 2014, p. 7), because, apart from Nigeria, a
big oil producer in the W orld (and the biggest in the region) and also the major
contributor to the regional economic growth (more than 50%, cf. Figure 2-4), some
o th er countries' economy relies mainly on oil production.14 So the rising prices of
minerals and oil, over the last few years the GDP growth rates in the region have
been very high and the decreasing price since 2014 would impact the 2014 and 2015
GDP as seen in real GDP and estimates and projection data (Table 2-9). The 2014
Ebola outbreak has also decreased the affected countries' GDP,15 and hence, th at of
the region (cf. African Developm ent Bank et al., 2015, pp. 3 0 -3 1 ).

2.7.3. Business and competitiveness
The W est African private sector is mostly made up of small and m edium enterprises.
The largest companies are mostly concentrated in Nigeria, and operate mainly in the
banking, telecom m unications and industrial sectors. 44 of the 50 largest companies
in W est Africa are also Nigerian. According to the W orld Bank's Doing Business 2015

55

(W orld Bank, 2015, p. 4), less than half of the W est African countries (7 out of 15) are
ranked in the bottom quintile o f the 189 countries assessed "on how easy or difficult
it is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to medium-size business when
complying with relevant regulations" (W orld Bank, 2014a, p. 4). This result is a
progress however, compared with the 2010 edition where more than two-thirds (11
out of 15) were ranked in the bottom quintile. Ghana is in the second quintile and
the first in the region, followed by Cape Verde and Gambia. Liberia and Guinea Bissau
are

at the

rear (Table

2-10).

The

ECOWAS

has been

working towards the

harm onization of business laws, including the adoption of a Regional Investment
Policy Framework and a Regional Competition Policy.
The Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) has being published annually since 2005 by
the W orld Economy Forum to measure "the microeconomic and macroeconomic
foundations o f national competitiveness" (Schwab & Sala-i-Martin, 2014, p. 4). In the
2014-2015 report, Ghana is at the top o f the ten W est African countries included
ranked I I I th out of the 144 countries; Guinea is at the rear, fo r both the W orld and
the regional rank (Table 2-11). The 15 ECOWAS countries considered as a whole have
an average Corruption Perception Index score of 34, which would rank them 99 out
of 167 countries in the third quartile. The best ranked countries are Cape Verde and
Ghana and the worst ones are Guinea and Guinea Bissau (Table 2-12).

2.7.4. Infrastructure
"Logistics is central to daily lives of companies and citizens".16 W est Africa has the
lowest quality of transport services, as measured by the Logistics Performance Index
compared to both other regions in Africa and the rest of the world (African
Developm ent Bank & African Developm ent Fund, 2011, p. 8). In the 2014 Logistics
Performance Index (Arvis et al., 2014), W est African countries' scores vary from 2.25
to 2.81 ranking them from 75 to 146 out o f the 160 countries covered by the report
(cf. Table 2-13). Gambia, in the bottom quintile, occupies the worst place and is
categorized in the Logistics unfriendly economies that includes countries with severe
logistics constraints; remaining countries fall under the Partial performers category
th at includes countries w ith a level o f logistics constraints most often seen in lowand middle-income countries. Nigeria, in the fourth quintile, has the best LPI score
w ithin the ECOWAS.
In ICT front, there is no coordination activity; however, ECOWAS is addressing the
challenge of developing a regional ICT infrastructure through (i) im plem entation of
the

INTELCOM

II

program,

including

construction

of

alternative

broadband

infrastructure, and the laying of submarine cables; and (ii) harmonization of
telecom m unication/inform ation

and

Communication

Technologies

policies

and

regulatory frameworks.
The total electricity installed capacity is 12.07 million kilowatts in 2012; the total
electricity net consumption is 47.2 billion kilowatt-hours and the total electricity net
production is 52.9 billion kilowatt-hours.17 O f this installed capacity, about 56% is in
Nigeria,

17%

in Ghana

and

13% in Cote

d'Ivoire. The W est African

citizen

consummates less than 100 kilowatt-hours a year whereas a Belgium citizen
consummates 7,257 kilowatts-hours a year.18 Apart from Nigeria and Ghana, in the
rest of the ECOWAS countries, the cost of electricity is three times w hat it should be
to favour industries contribution to the regional developm ent (ECOWAS Commission,
2010b, p. 24).

Social statistics

W est Africa is a region which ranks low in the world in all Human Developm ent
Indicators. Except Cape Verde and Ghana classified among the middle Human
Developm ent Index (HDI), the 13 remaining countries are within the low Human
Developm ent group (cf. Table 2-14). 60% o f the region's population is estimated to
live with less than one dollar a day. Life expectancy at birth in 2015 is 54 years for
m ale and 56 for fem ale (United Nations Population Fund, 2015, p. 127) categorizing
the region in the lowest group of the W orld with the Central African region; just
behind Eastern and Southern Africa (58 and 61 years). This data rank W est African
below the W orld average of 69 years for male and 74 years for fem ale.
The goal of education for all is not yet attained in W est African; indeed, all the
children are not enrolled fo r the primary school. The rate of the population enrolled
in the secondary school is low er (cf. Table 2-15). The adult literacy rate ranges from
20 to 70% depending on the country. As the heath sector is concerned, the region
has been facing the Ebola outbreak since 2014. The child m ortality rate ranges from
26 to 126 for thousand and the under five-years m ortality rate is betw een 35 and 256
for thousand; at the level of the region these tw o indicators values are 103 and 175
respectively (Organisation Ouest-Africaine de la Sante, 2008, p. 17). The proportion
of population using improved sanitation facilities in 2012 is under 50% (W orld Health
Organisation, 2015). The main causes of death and diseases in W est Africa are
HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhea and cholera.

Industry and private sector19

The ECOWAS industrial sector is still embryonic and therefore not sufficiently
diversified to produce a wide variety o f interm ediary and finished products. The
secondary sector (industry-manufacturing, mining, energy and construction) provides
em ploym ent for a m ere 2 to 10% o f the active population according to the country,
in 2006; it contributed 30.3% to the GDP with Nigeria in th e lead (40.7%) and Gambia
(8.9% ) and Sierra Leone (8.6%) at the rear. The informal sector absorbs over 60% of
the active population in W est Africa and produces 20 to 30% o f GDP according to the
country.
Currently, no ECOWAS country has a robust and solidly productive secondary sector
to transform the national economy and join the global com petition. The region's
share to the global industrial production is less than 0.1%. Over half o f the industrial
units in W est Africa operate at less than 50% o f their capacities. The situation varies
enormously according to the geographical spheres, which is exacerbated in the
landlocked countries (M ali, Burkina Faso, Niger) and those bedevilled by serious
pow er outages (Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Liberia).
The ECOWAS adopted in 2010 the W est African Common Industrial Policy (WACIP) of
which the vision is to "maintain a solid industrial structure which is globally
com petitive, environm ent-friendly and capable of significantly improving the living
standards of the people by 2030" (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a, p. 4). Its general
objectives are to i) accelerate the industrialization o f W est Africa through the
prom otion o f endogenous industrial transform ation o f local raw materials, ii) develop
and

diversify the

industrial

productive

capacity,

and,

iii) strengthen

regional

integration and the export o f manufactured goods (p. 4). The expected results are i)
research findings are valorised by the private sector, ii) Industrial activity in the
region is re-invigorated and competitiveness strengthened. The key objectives are i)
the diversification and widening o f the industrial production base, ii) the increasing of
the contribution o f the industrial sector in the region's GDP from an average o f 6-7%
to 20% by 2030, iii) considerably improving intracom m unity trade from 12% to 40%
in 2030, and the exports of manufactured goods from the region to the world m arket
(from 0.1% to 1% in 2030).
The ECOWAS vision 2020 (ECOWAS Commission, 2011b) envisions an ECOWAS of
people w ith a conductive policy environm ent in which the private sector will be the
engine

o f growth

and

developm ent,

developed by com petitive private sector activities which provide production and

2010a).

61

efficient ECOWAS business body that promotes strong public-private partnerships for
generating w ealth to sustain the developm ent and prosperity of the region.
The main hindrances to the developm ent of the industrial sector in W est Africa are
related to (African Developm ent Bank, 2011, pp. 3 -8 ; ECOWAS Commission, 2010b):
i) strong presence o f the informal sector, ii) access to funding fo r investment in
industry,

iii)

access

to

efficient

technologies

(acquisition,

maintenance),

iv)

inadequate national markets, v) low competitiveness of existing industrial capacities
and similarity of manufacturing activities, vi) insufficient infrastructures, excessively
high costs an d /o r poor quality of factors of production (electricity, w ater, etc.) and
basic infrastructures (industrial areas, roads, railways, ICT, etc.), vii) underutilization
of installed capacities illustrated by the fact that two-thirds o f the industries operate
at less than 50% o f their capacities, vii) bureaucracy and corruption, ix) skill
shortages

and

labour

regulations.

Consequently

to

these

hindrances,

only

multinational enterprises operate continuously in the region.

2.10. Higher education
African higher education institutions were inherited from or built on the model of
those of the colonial powers. In this sector, education is mainly offered

by

universities and funded by governments only (African Development Bank, 2008).
Through decades, African universities has built solid reputation and followed high
international standards. However, with the economic crisis o f the 1980s and the
im plem entation of structural adjustm ent policies which gave priority to basic
education, resources to higher education dwindled, resulting in a deterioration of the
quality of educational services (African Development Bank, 2008).
The most common model of university in W est Africa has been designed under a
perspective o f 'massification' o f teaching and research (Minega, 2015, p. 24). The
higher education and research landscape is still characterized by low productivity in
terms o f support for the

regional

integration agenda

and

process, thus its

contribution in policy form ulation and im plem entation at national and regional levels
remains very marginal. Table 2-16 presents the number o f universities and the gross
enrolm ent in percentage of the num ber of inhabitants of the ECOWAS countries.
Nigeria has the larger num ber of universities, followed by Ghana and Benin; the
highest enrolm ent occurs in Cape-Verde (22.85%) and the lowest in Guinea-Bissau
(2 .6%).
The higher education in W est Africa is facing some challenges. Minega (2015, p. 72)
gave the top-ten list of general challenges affecting higher education in Africa (cf.
Table 2-17). Particularly, in the case o f the W est African region, others hindrances i)
lack of adequate

capacity to contribute effectively to the

ii)

lack o f capacity for

mainstreaming the fram ew ork on the ECOWAS Policy on Science and Technology at
national level, iii) lack of Institutional capacity in the sector, iv) language barrier that
affects and handicaps seriously the opportunities for academic cooperation and
mobility betw een institutions across the region; v) unpreparedness for innovation,
transform ation and internationalization, vi) limited budgets allocated to the educaÂ­
tion sector by national governments, which are still below the

international

standards, vii) inadequate institutional capacity and infrastructure, viii) deficit in
research capacity, ix) low im plem entation and harmonization of quality standards, x)
insufficient funding and poor environm ent for social and gender inclusiveness, xi)
drain brain and mass exodus of w ell-trained scholars from the region to first world.

Data on STl in West Africa

Science in Africa is still at its early stage; the entire continent annual scientific output
is lower to th at of the Netherlands (UNESCO Institute o f Statistics, 2005). Table 2-18
gives the scores and ranks o f W est African countries as regarding technology
readiness and innovation according to the Global Competitiveness Report 2014-2015
(Schwab & Sala-i-M artin, 2014). The score of each indicators ranges from 1 one to 7;
the more it is close to 7, the best the country performance. W est African countries'
scores vary from 2 to 4 with an average of the region o f 2.8 for Higher education and
training, 2.88 for Technology readiness, 2.97 for Innovation, 3.49 for Capacity for
innovation, 3.25 for Quality o f scientific research institutions, 2.7 for Company
spending on R&D, 2.97 for University-lndustry collaboration on R&D, etc. The best
scores rank the countries in the third quartile over the 144 countries assessed for the
competitiveness of their economy.

2.11.2.

National policies or strategies

Scientific activities in the W est African countries date back to the colonial period
where colonial powers w ere interested in the exploitation o f the natural resources
their colonies were endowed with (Commission de la CEDEAO, 2012, p. 17; UNESCO,
1986, pp. 1 4 -1 5 ). A fter their independence, the majority of the W est African
countries incorporated into their socio-economic developm ent plans parts about
scientific activities; indeed the governments w ere fully aware of the im portant role
th at science and technology must play in the socio-economic developm ent of their
countries (UNESCO, 1974, p. 27, 1986, p. 12). Therefore, no separate policy on
science, technology and innovation was form ulated at any country level until recent
decades. W ith the efforts of UNESCO (cf. Davis, 1983) in training, advising and
technical assistance, either directly with countries or regional organisations (Regional
economic com m unity or African Union Commission), African countries have started
form ulating science, technology and innovation documents. However, some of them
still have no sectorial policy.
Statistical data on research in African are scarce, because countries are not used to
conduct research and developm ent survey (M ugabe, 2011, p. 7). It is only in recent
years th at the African Union through the New Partnership for Africa Development
(NEPAD) Coordination Agency and the African Observatory on Science, Technology
and

Innovation

have

started

collecting

data

on

selected

countries

(African

Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation, 2014; NEPAD Planning and
Coordinating Agency, 2014;

NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, 2010).

According to these studies, African countries in general are far from allocating 1% of
their GDP to research and developm ent activities whereas South Africa has yet
reached 0.96% in 2010 (Blankley & Booyens, 2010) and European Union countries
had reached 2% and have targeted 3% in the horizon 2020 (European Commission,
2010a). Table 2-19 gives the Gross Expenditure to Research and Developm ent (GERD)
per W est African country and Table 2-20 the status of W est African countries
regarding the adoption of an explicit science policy.

Regional policy and strategies

At the African continent level, African Union M em ber States have renewed in several
documents their com m itm ent to give priority to science, technology and innovation
to solve the problems the African peoples are facing. In 2007, the ECOWAS
Commission created within the Office of the Commissioner in charge of Human
Developm ent and Gender, a Departm ent for Education, Culture, Science and
Technology w ith a mandate to prom ote science, technology and innovation for
regional integration, economic development, overall poverty reduction and social
emancipation of the people o f W est Africa.24 The ECOWAS vision 2020 (ECOWAS
Commission, 2011b) reaffirms the necessity to promote active participation of the
academic com m unity in all issues relating to the integration process.
The first Conference of the ECOWAS ministers of Science and Technology m et in
2004. In 2005, the Conference elaborated a fram ew ork basis for science and
technology (Commission de la CEDEAO, 2012). The conference recommended the
establishment o f a community sectorial policy of which the objective should be to
incite scientists and researchers to study the issues the ECOWAS peoples were facing
and to bring solutions. The ECOWAS Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST)

and its action plan (Commission de la CEDEAO, 2012) w ere adopted by the Authority
o f Heads of State and Governm ent on 29 June 2012 (CEDEAO, 2012). The ECOPOST
addresses 12 them atic areas: (a) scientific research, innovation and technological
developm ent; (b) support for education and training; (c) higher education; (d)
scientific culture; (e) enabling environm ent for scientific creativity; (f) regional and
international cooperation; (g) capacity building; (h) science and technology and
private sector involvement; (i) information on science and technology: data, statistics
and indicators; (j) gender, science and technology; (k) E-governance and Internet
massification; and (I) transfer of technology and technology watch (United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa, 2013, p. 79).

2.11.4.

Problems ofSTI in West Africa

The NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency (2014, p. 15) noticed th at common
them es emerge from STI policy and strategy fram eworks in African countries; they
relate

to

capacity

for

science,

technology

and

innovation,

human

resource

developm ent, promoting and funding research and developm ent, and STI policy and
measurements. This conclusion illustrates th at the African national innovation
systems in general and the W est African ones in particular have common hindrances.
These include (cf. Commission de la CEDEAO, 2012, p. 3; M egnigbeto, 2013e; Minega,
2015; UNESCO, 1986, p. 19, 2010b, pp. 2 8 2 -2 8 5 , 2015; United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa, 2013, p. xviii): i) insufficient funding and equipm ent, ii) lack of
m otivation of personnel, iii) lack of explicit science, technology and innovation policy
in some countries, iv) inexistence of a regional database on publications, vi) lack of
w ell-inform ed and organized policy research institutions and advisory bodies to help
identify key priority areas where countries may invest their limited resources and set
clear and measurable targets, vii) lack o f dynamism in STI policies policy design,
developm ent

and

im plem entation,

viii)

lack of assessments,

monitoring

and

evaluation o f the impact o f policy actions, iv) lack or absence o f interactions betw een
innovation actors, and, x) non-involvement of universities and research centres to
the establishment ofSTI policy, plan or strategies.

2.12. Conclusion
W est Africa groups together 15 countries out of 54 the African continent counts. It
coincides w ith the Economic Community of the W est African States (ECOWAS)
created in 1975. ECOWAS countries are commonly classified among the low income
countries in the world and are characterized by an uneven economic developm ent.
As a regional integration area, the ECOWAS has achieved some progresses namely
customs union, free m ovem ent o f persons, ECOWAS passport (African Developm ent
Bank & African Developm ent Fund, 2011, p. iv) that make it the most integrated
regional economic com m unity in Africa (Page, Bilal, & Overseas Developm ent
Institute, 2001, p. 1; Sesay & Omotosho, 2011, p. 21) and one o f the most successful
integration arrangements to date, following closely behind the European Union
(ECOWAS Commission, 2011a, p. 12). The region covers m ore than five million square
kilometres and counts more than 300 million inhabitants. Its M em b er States are
among the poorest of the W orld. Up to 1990, almost all the M em b er States were
ruled by a totalitarian regime with regular coup d'etats; since then, they all have
recognized democracy as a condition for developm ent. However, the region is still
facing severe political and security issues.
W est

African

countries

are

endowed

with

some

natural

resources;

but

industrialisation is at its beginning. Even the installed industries are facing some
problems hindering there developm ent.
Both national and regional authorities are aware o f the role of Science, Technology
and Innovation in the developm ent of the M em b er States and region. In the earlier
years o f independence, they had form ulated developm ent plans that all emphasised
the role o f Science, Technology and Innovation. Some countries established policies
of Science, Technology and Innovation. But they all are struggling in funding their
research institutions and activities. So, globally the region is still depending on
W estern

countries,

namely form er colonial

powers.

Science, Technology and

Innovation are ham pered by so many factors that UNESCO (2010b, p. 281) could
affirm th a t "sub-Saharan Africa still has a long way to go to reach the eldorado of the
knowledge economy, not only in term s o f innovation but also as regards the other
three pillars of the knowledge economy: a sound economy and institutional regime;
an educated, creative population capable of utilizing knowledge effectively; and a
dynamic inform ation infrastructure".

In this chapter, w e draw the landscape of research activities in the W est African
region and compared the region's scientific performance to th at o f Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa (referred to as BRICS) over a ten-year period (20012010). Analyses focused on total output, international collaboration rate, main
partner countries, citable documents and h-index.
This chapter is the developm ent o f the content of a poster presented at the 13th

Introduction

W est Africa is one o f the five African regions as determ ined by the African Union.34 It
counts 15 countries; in the alphabetic order, they are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote
d'Ivoire, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, M ali, Nigeria,
Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. Three international languages (French, English
and Portuguese) are distinguished in the region as the legacy of the colonisation by
France, United Kingdom and Portugal. All the W est African countries are together
m em ber of the Economic Community o f W est African States (ECOWAS), a regional
economic integration organisation. In early 2012, the region adopted the ECOWAS
Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST) that recognized the role o f Science,
Technology and Innovation in regional integration and life conditions im provem ent.
Scientometric studies on the whole or part o f Africa are very limited, compared to
other continents, even though an evident interest has been registered recently
(Adams et al., 2010; Boshoff, 2009, 2010; Megnigbeto, 2013a, 2013e; NEPAD
Planning and Coordination Agency, 2010; Onyancha & Maluleka, 2011b; Tijssen,
2007; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). They found th at i) Africa's share to the world
output is very negligible, ii) the big science producers in Africa are Egypt in the North,
South Africa in the South, Kenya in the East and Nigeria in the West; iii) the big
producers also drive collaboration links; therefore, they are the backbone of the
scientific collaboration netw ork in Africa and connect African regions and Africa to
the world; iv) language, culture, colonial ties and geographical proximity are criteria
fo r collaboration; v) hence, the main African countries' common partners are form er
colonisers, namely France and United Kingdom; however, USA follows as the third
common partner country even though it has no fo rm er colony on the Continent; vi)
collaboration betw een African countries is weak; and vii) developed countries are the
major non-African partners o f African countries.

Some regions or countries, like the South African Developm ent Community (SADC)
and South Africa, have been steadily explored; others lack examination. In this
chapter, w e intend to give a view of the W est African research landscape on the eve
of the ECOPOST adoption. The research question is: How does W est Africa compare
to em ergent countries like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa with respect to
scientific publishing?

3.2.

Methods and data

In April 2012, we perform ed a search on W eb of Science; w e retrieved all the
publications co-authored by at least one scientist from any W est African country. The
databases

selected

w ere

Science

Expanded

(SCI-EXPANDED),

Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S), Conference Proceedings
Citation Index- Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH) and Index Chemicus (1C). All
languages and all docum ent types were checked. The exact search expression
entered into the advanced search form was cu=benin or cu=burkina faso or cu=cote
ivoire or cu=cape verde or cu=gambia cu=ghana or cu=guinea or cu=guinea-bissau or
cu=liberia or cu=mali or cu=niger or cu=nigeria or cu=senegal or cu=sierra leone or
cu=togo. From the results, 28,380 records related to the period 2001-2010 (a 10-year
period) w ere extracted, downloaded and imported into a bibliographic database
managed w ith CDS/ISIS35 thanks to a program coded into CDS/ISIS Pascal.36 The
defined fields in the CDS/ISIS database w ere based on the bibliographic information
from W eb of Science data, as follows: authors, title, source title, year of publication,
times cited, language, type o f document, (co-) authors' affiliation (addresses), etc.
Searches related to each country of BRICS w ere performed separately (cu=brazil,
cu=Russia, cu=india, cu=china, cu=south africa) in Novem ber 2012 and the Analyse
Results function o f W eb o f Science was used. Thanks to the CDS/ISIS form atting
language37 and search function, W est African data w ere printed into a file and
analysed w ith statistical software or computed directly.

35 CDS-ISIS is te x t database m anagem ent so ftw a re developed and d is trib u te d by UNESCO (UNESCO,
1989a). (h ttp ://w w w .u n e s c o .o rg /is is ).
36 CDS/ISIS provides a pro gra m m ing language â designed to develop CDS/ISIS applications re q uiring

Results

3.3.1. Annual production
The total num ber of bibliographic references considered in this chapter is 28,380.
The W est African

M em b er States' share to the

regional scientific output is

represented in Table 3-1. It reveals that, on its own, Nigeria produced more than half
the total output o f the region, far followed by Ghana (11.29% ), Senegal (8.96%),
Burkina Faso (6.29% ) and Cote d'Ivoire (5.88% ). The remaining 10 countries output
each less than 5% o f the region's total scientific papers. These statistics illustrate a
very skewed distribution (Gini index = 0.708); as an illustration, the top-three
producers published 7 papers out of 10. Nigeria appears to be the biggest science
producer in W est Africa; factors like the economic performance and the size of the
population might have favoured these ranking. The annual production curve is best
fitted by a linear trend o f which equation is y = 3 6 1 .4 5 t + 8 5 0 w here y is the num ber
of papers and t the period o f tim e (t = 1 in 2001 and r2 = 0.96). Figure 3-1 shows W est
Africa's output curve, its linear fit, the region except Nigeria output and the Nigerian
annual production curve.
From 2001 to 2005, Nigeria produced about half o f the total production of the
region; however, starting from 2005, its production rose slowly and separated from
the production curve o f the rest o f the region; the dem arcation between the tw o
curves became m ore pronounced in 2006. From then on, Nigeria scientific output
became larger; th at is, since 2006, Nigeria's annual production has exceeded th at of
the other 14 countries o f W est Africa grouped together.

3.3.2. Languages, types of publication and cited documents
The W est African publications are w ritten in English mainly (95.5%); French papers
come far behind (4.35%); o th er languages (total less than 0.07%) are German,
Japanese, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. The data source may have influenced
these statistics, indeed, W eb of Science is known to include relatively few nonEnglish publication outlets. Almost all the publications (94%) are citable. The annual
rate o f cited documents reported to the total o f citable documents progressively
decreased from 81% in 2001 to 45% in 2010 following an exponential negative trend;
indeed, recent papers have been less cited. The average ratio o f cited publications
over the period is 63.99%; th at is, 36.01% of the publications have received no
citation (Table 3-2). The cited documents received an average of 10.39 citations; the
median citation is 4, th at is 50% of the cited documents received up to 4 citations
each and the second half received at least four citations (Figure 3-3). The breakdown
of the publications per docum ent type gives: Article 76.67% , M eeting Abstract
10.88%, Article-Proceedings Paper 2.57%, Letter 2.17%, Review 2.33% and Note
0.14%.
The h-index was proposed by Hirsch (2005) originally to evaluate an individual
scientist's performance. It has been used widely; it was extended and could also
apply to institutions countries, groups o f countries, or any inform ation producer (Liu,
2011; Persson, 2013) even it is also criticised for not being suitable for comparison
purpose (Leeuwen, 2008; W altm an & van Eck, 2012). To compute the h-index of
W est Africa, from the CDS/ISIS database, we printed into a file the times each

74

docum ent is cited (field "times cited"), each value on a new line. This file was then
sorted in descending order and its lines numbered. The h-index is the largest num ber
h such th at the first h documents are each cited at least h times. In the case o f W est
African data, we found th at h-index equals 100.

3.3.3. Production per field
W eb of Science is used to classify bibliographic records according to its own
knowledge field scheme structured in tw o levels. The first level counts 5 categories;
the

second

level gives subject areas (approximately 200) that are added to

bibliographic records. The revised version of the Frascati M anual Fields o f Science
(OECD, 2007) was used to categorize publications considered in this study. Based on
the concordance table provided by Thomson Reuters (2010), combined searches
w ere perform ed over the CDS/ISIS database and the field shares computed. The
region produced mainly in M edical and health sciences (49%), followed by N atural
sciences (32.81% ), Agricultural sciences and Engineering and technology have
approxim ately the same score (around 13%) (Figure 3-2). It should be underlined th at
the W eb of Science's databases w e used fo r data collection include neither the Social
Science Citation Index (SSCI nor the Art and Humanities Citations Index (A&HCI), so
the scientific performance of the region presented is more an effect of the data
source than the actual situation.

3.3.4. Research institutions
Globally, 4,622 institutions contributed to the W est African scientific research over
the period 2001-2010. It is meaningless to give a top list o f them . Furthermore, often,
affiliations in bibliographic data contain errors so that the same author or institution
may appear in many forms (Bruin & M oed, 1990; M oed, 1988). Therefore, there is a
need to normalise. Browsing a list o f 4,622 institutions names for this purpose is a
huge work.

Besides, research is primarily university's mission; for social and

economic developm ent, research products need to be transform ed by industry into
products, services and processes useful for society; these tw o entities need a
regulatory fram ew ork set up by the governm ent. The collaboration betw een the
three

actors

infrastructure

(University,
necessary

Industry
to

a

and

Governm ent)

knowledge-based

creates

economy

the

knowledge

(Leydesdorff,

2003;

Leydesdorff & M eyer, 2006). It ensures innovation (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 1995,
2000). Therefore, we opted to categorize authors' addresses according to these
actors, i.e. 'University', 'Industry' and 'Government'; thus, we used the search string
proposed and tested by Leydesdorff (2003) to label authors' addresses. W e found
th at University authored 82.82% of papers, Governm ent 41.09% , Industry 1.07%;
research institutions th at didn't fall under the above categories include NGOs, private
and

international account for 3.80%.

If we

restricted to

W est African-based

institutions, University produces 67.45% of papers, Industry 0.33%, Governm ent
26.89% and 'not classified' institutions 11.46%.

3.3.5. Co-authorship
W e computed the num ber o f papers in the W est African scientific output according
to the num ber of authors they have. W e distinguished from 1 to 5 authors and 6 and
m ore authors. The curves are shown in Figure 3-4. For the clearness of the figure,
trends w ere not plotted. It is clear that the increasing rate is the highest in case of
papers w ith 6 and more authors. Besides, Table 3-3 shows th at the total num ber of
co-authors per year rose from 6,759 in 2001 to 23,608 in 2010. Conversely, the
num ber o f papers per co-author trended downward, from 0.23 at the beginning of
the period to 0.19 at the end. The same trends are registered about cumulative data
(Table 3-4). Overall, there are 136,961 co-authorships for 28,380 papers; the
subsequent ratios are: i) num ber o f co-authors per paper: 4.82, ii) num ber o f papers
per author 0.21. Two possible explanations for this trend in co-authorship are: i) the
fields involved: the sciences are more inclined to co-authorship (Ossenblok e t al.,
2012, 2014); furtherm ore, social sciences and humanities are not covered by the
W eb

3.3.6. International collaboration
14,094 papers accounting fo r 49.66% o f the W est African total output have at least
one non-W est African address. The lowest international collaboration rate (45.26% )
was registered in 2008 and the highest (56.44% ) in 2004. An increasing trend is
registered until 2004 followed by a decreasing trend betw een 2004 and 2009. The
region's collaborators count 151 countries among them 38 African, 27 American, 40
Asian, 41 European and 5 Oceanian. France is ranked first; it contributed to the W est
African scientific literature with 3,572 papers accounting for 12.59% o f the region's
output; this num ber also represents about one quarter o f the total papers W est
Africa shared. Just behind, follows the USA as second partner, with 12.54%, followed
by the United Kingdom (10.09% ). The fourth partner is Germany, far behind with
4.39% . South Africa is ranked fifth and the first African country with 3%.
Europe is by far the first partner of W est Africa with 27.12% (9,655 papers) of
contributions followed by America 14.55% (4,240 papers), Africa 8.79% (2,530
papers), Asia 5.29% (1,540 papers) and Oceania 1.29% (367 papers). At the European
Continent level, France and the United Kingdom are respectively first and second
partner countries w ith 37% and 29.65% of the papers with a European address. In
America, the USA on its own contributed to more than 4 papers out o f 5 the
continent shares w ith W est Africa. Globally, these 3 countries, w ith 8,920 papers
accounting for 31.43% o f the W est African total output and 63.28 % o f the papers
w ith a non-W est African address, are the main partners of W est Africa.

3.3.7. Comparison with BRICS countries
BRICS is the acronym for the grouping of the world's leading emerging economies,
namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Arkhangelskaya, 2011). The
m embers of the BRICS, excepted Russia, are newly industrialized; some decades ago
they had the same economic and social conditions as compared to W est Africa. W e
chose to compare W est Africa, a region grouping 15 countries, to individual BRICS
countries fo r four main reasons: i) individual W est African M em b er States scientific
output are too negligible to allow for comparison with BRICS individual countries; ii)
even the whole region scientific output is still too low to allow for comparison with a
region or a group of countries; iii) the whole of Africa's science output is comparable
to th at o f an European country like The Netherlands (Adams et al., 2010); and iv) the
BRICS countries are viewed as models for other developing countries in science and
technology (Adams et al., 2013).
The comparison is done with respect to selected indicators like total output, annual
output, percentage o f citable documents, international collaboration

rate and

partner countries. Even though Nigeria, one o f the bigger African science producers
(Adams et al., 2010; Dahoun, 1999) is a W est African country, the whole region
performs less than Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the leader in science
producing on the African continent. Indeed, over the same period of tim e, Brazil
produced tenfold the W est African volume of papers (63,046), Russia and India about
twelvefold, China about fiftyfold, and South Africa over tw ofold (Figure 3-5 and Table
3-5). Approximately 43% of South African papers have at least one foreign address;
Brazil, Russia, India, and China share less than one third of their scientific output;
hence, W est Africa depends more on international collaboration than the four
countries.
The top 5 partner countries list of W est Africa and the BRICS countries exhibits USA,
UK and Germany as common partners. USA is the first partner of Brazil, India, China
and South Africa, but second of W est Africa and Russia; France, the first W est African
partner is ranked second in case of Brazil, third in case o f Russia and fifth in case of
India and South Africa (Table 3-6). Globally, compared to BRICS countries, W est Africa
has the lowest total output, the lowest citable percentage share; on the other hand,
it has the highest international collaboration rate, which means th at W est Africa
produced less than each BRICS country, that its scientific production counts less
citable papers, th at its research quality measured by the num ber o f citation is poorer
than th at of each BRICS countries and finally th at the region depends more on
international collaboration than BRICS countries.

Discussion

W est Africa shared approxim ately one half its annual production; this rate is higher
than th at o f individual BRICS countries. Europe and America are the main partners at
continent level. This finding confirms the result of many previous studies (e.g. Adams
et al., 2010; Boshoff, 2009; Tijssen, 2007; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). If colonial
ties explained the ranking o f France and the United Kingdom (Boshoff, 2009), Adam
et al. (2010) justified the presence o f the USA, a country with no form er colonies in
the region: "Often this is a consequence of researchers who have studied in the USA
and maintaining links w ith USA-based research groups once they returned home".
The argum ent might also apply to Belgium and Germany. As an illustration, Australia,
Canada, Italy, Japan and Spain th at are among individual BRICS countries top five
partners didn't appear in the W est African list. W est Africa and BRICS shared three
countries as top-5 partners; they are USA, UK and Germany. But W est Africa depends
much m ore on them than BRICS countries (35% against 30% for South Africa and 10
to 15% for Brazil, Russia, India and China).
Table 3-7 gives some social, economic and research statistics (scientific output,
population, scientific population ratio, GDP, GERD and HDI38) of the region and BRICS
countries. Even though China and India are ranked first and second respectively
regarding total output, they take fifth and fourth position respectively, behind Russia
(1st), Brazil (2nd) and South Africa (3rd) while output is reported to population size;
W est Africa is at the rear. The region has the highest poor population share (60%
against 3.8 to 40% for BRICS countries); its GDP is the lowest. Among the fifteen W est
African M e m b er States, thirteen w ere categorized within Low HDI; only tw o belong
to the middle HDI group (Cape Verde and Ghana, HDI > 0.536).The region's HDI (the
average o f the fifteen M e m b e r States) categorize the region in Low HDI; whereas
BRICS countries have an HDI ranging from 0.554 to 0.730. It m eant that the region's
w elfare measured by the HDI is lower than that o f the individual BRICS countries.
Besides, whereas W est Africa devotes 0.215% of its GDP to research funding, BRICS
countries allot 0.87 to 1.76%, th at is four to eight times the W est African GERD.
Furtherm ore, W est Africa counts 60% of its population among poor people. In
conclusion, the region is facing social and economic difficulties th at make it could not
prioritize research funding. Therefore, the investment in research and developm ent
is weak.

Boshoff (2009)

underlined

that Sub-Saharan

Africa's countries

"are

struggling to reach the target o f allocating at least 1% of GDP to R & D" as they
com m itted in the Lagos Action Plan (Organization o f African Unity, 1980).

38 GDP, GERD and HDI are n o t available a t W est A frican region level; th e re fo re , fo r th e region, w e to o k
the average o f m em b er countries, in o rd e r to enable com parison w ith BRICS countries.

Conclusion

The W est African scientific output over the period 2001-2010 w ere studied and
compared to th at of BRICS countries. The region's annual output is increasing
linearly. Nigeria, the largest country of the region and also one of the bigger African
science producers, on its own outputs half o f the W est African total production.
M edicine and health sciences and Natural sciences are the main fields the W est
African countries produce in. The W est African scientific profile was compared to
th at of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (known under the acronym
BRICS). The selected indicators for comparison are the total output, the percentage
of citable documents and the share of international collaboration. W e found th at
W est Africa performs less than BRICS countries taken individually. W ith respect to
the total scientific production over the period 2001-2010, W est Africa occupies the
last position; W ith regard to the percentage of citable documents, the region is
ranked behind South Africa, India, Brazil and China, but in fro n t of Russia; W est Africa
depends more on international collaboration because it has the highest international
collaboration rate. BRICS countries and W est Africa share three partners among the
top five, namely USA, UK and Germany. However, W est Africa depends more in this
three countries than the others. Even though scientific output reported to total
population size is considered, W est Africa still at the rear. This position o f W est Africa
regarding its scientific output is due to the difficulties science in the region is facing.
M egnigbeto (2013e) gave some o f them that are (i) lack o f coordination betw een
research programs and research activities, (ii) lack of human and financial resources
and equipm ent, (iii) insufficiencies or inadequacies of funding and equipm ent. As an
illustration, India devote fourfold funding to research in comparison to W est Africa;
South Africa, fourfold, Brazil and Russia fivefold and China sevenfold. "This high
international collaboration rate might indicate a structural dependence o f African
science, owing to the resources offered by advanced countries to help alleviate
infrastructural and financial constraints are hampering many African science system"
(Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). Furthermore, Sub-Saharan Africa's countries are far
from the target o f allotting 1% o f their GDP to research funding as they com m itted to
(Boshoff, 2009; UNESCO, 2015), e.g. in the Lagos plan of action (Organization of
African Unity, 1980). In these conditions, science, technology and innovation could
not get priorities and could not really contribute to w ealth creation and hence the
im provem ent of population life conditions.

4. Collaboration between countries and continents in the
West African scientific publishing
This chapter explores the num ber o f papers with multi-co-authorship, collaboration
w ith o th er African countries and regions, collaboration w ith other continents and
intraregional collaboration. It is based on M egnigbeto (2013a) and Megnigbeto
(2013b).

4.1.

Introduction

Research is a costly and tim e consuming activity. Researchers often cooperate in
order to achieve publications. Through cooperation, they reduce tim e, costs,
personal investm ent and increase their productivity; they share skills, knowledge,
data, ideas, equipm ent and research results; they benefit from advice or help from
each other, gain experience or train apprentices, obtain cross-fertilization across
disciplines, etc. (Bordons &

Gomez, 2000;

Katz &

M artin,

1997; Toivanen

&

Ponomariov, 2011; W agner, 2006). A collaboration process may imply tw o or more
scientists from the same laboratory, from different laboratories within the same
institution, from different institutions within the same country or from different
institutions from different countries.
It is well known th at Africa's share to the W orld scientific output is negligible. Adams
et al. (2010) found th a t from 1999 to 2008, the volume of the whole of Africa's
output per year is the same as th at of the Netherlands. Pouris and Pouris (2009)
attributed less than 2% to Africa's share to the global science output over the period
2000-2004, UNESCO Institute o f Statistics (2005) 1.4% in 1990 and the same in 2002.
(Toivanen &

Ponomariov, 2011) stated th at Africa has the weakest research

infrastructure and capacity among continents. Tijssen (2007) indicated th at Africa's
share in the global research decreased dramatically from 1% in 1987 to 0.7% in 1996
and th a t the continent has lost 11% of its share in global science since its peak in
1987. He added th at Sub-Saharan science has lost almost a third. But these decreases
don't mean an absolute diminishing of the volume o f publications, but rather an
increase less than the w orldw ide rate, the same study w arned. It is also w ell known
th at African research is dom inated

by non-African researchers (Bierschenk &.

M ongbo, 1995; Boshoff, 2010; Dahoun, 1997; Gaillard, 2010; Tijssen, 2007; Toivanen
& Ponomariov, 2011). This situation is due to i) how lowly equipped the Continent
was;

indeed,

some

research

areas

require

heavy

equipm ent

(Toivanen

&

Ponomariov, 2011); ii) the w eak investment African countries and supra national
institutions dedicate to the science, technology and innovation sector (Adams et al.,
2010; Pouris & Pouris, 2009; Tijssen, 2007; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011; UNESCO
Institute o f Statistics, 2005); iii) developed countries that often allot for funding of
research activities within th eir cooperation programmes only; in this case, African
researchers contributed to collect data developed countries researchers analysed
and used for publications; in this line, Bierschenk and Mongbo (1995) noticed th at

87

Beninese research is done in the shade or the wake of developm ent projects and
programmes financed by donors and Toivanen and Ponomariov (2011) stressed that
the strategic partnership betw een Africa and the European Commission signed in
2007 put a particular emphasis on building collaborative links betw een African
regions, sub-regions, and European partners;
The African Union divided the Africa continent into five regions based on cultural,
historical,

geographical

and

economic

criteria.39 They

are

the

Northern

(6

countries),40 the W estern (15 countries), the Central (9 countries), the Eastern (13
countries) and the Southern (10 countries) (cf.Table 2-1). Eight of the W est African
M em b er States are form er French colonies namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire,
Guinea, M ali, Niger, Senegal and Togo; Guinea-Bissau and Cap Verde are form er
Portuguese colonies; Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Gambia are form er British
colonies; and, Liberia, a country created in earlier 19th century by the form er
enslaved blacks returned back from the United States of America. Hence, three
international

language communities are

distinguished

in the

region that are

respectively French speaking, Portuguese speaking and English speaking. The region
has also tw o economic communities: i) the W est African Economic and M onetary
Union (W AEM U) th a t groups together the French speaking countries, minus Guinea
to which is added Guinea-Bissau, and ii) the Economic Community o f W est Africa
States (ECOWAS) th at groups together all the 15 countries.
The African Union, African regional economic communities and individual countries
have recognized the role o f science and technology for poverty alleviation and
developm ent (Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). Besides, such regional integration
institutions, financial

institutions and

UNESCO as well as other international

institutions have encouraged individual countries in formulating and implementing
science, technology and innovation policy. Article 27 of the Economic Community of
W est African States (ECOWAS) Revised Treaty (ECOWAS Commission, 1993) clearly
spells out th at m em ber states shall ensure proper application of science and
technology to the developm ent of agriculture, transport and communications,
industry, health and hygiene, energy, education and m anpow er and the conservation
o f the environm ent. The ECOWAS' Commission established a Departm ent in charge
o f Culture, Education, Science and Technology in January 2007. The ECOWAS Policy
on Science and Technology (ECOPOST) and its action plan w ere adopted on 24 March
2012. Especially, the ECOPOST should help ECOWAS M em ber States to master all
science fields required for the emergence o f a scientific community able to compete
and to exchange with the best research team s worldwide. Also at national level,
policies have been set up to make research contribute to improve life conditions.

39 Resolution CM /Res.464 (XXVI) adopted by th e African U n ity O rganization (n o w African Union) Council
o f M in isters m eeting in its tw e n ty sixth o rd in a ry session in Addis-Ababa (Ethiopia) fro m 23 February to
1st M arch 1976. The countries list was updated in 2004.
40 Even th o u g h M oro cco is an A frican co u n try and belongs to th e N o rth fro m a geographical p o in t o f
view , it is n o t m em b er o f th e A frican Union due to political reasons. T here fore, it is n o t considered in th e
A frican U nion's classification. How ever, in th is study, w e included it in to th e N o rth e rn region.

88

ECOWAS and African Union M em b er States have com m itted in many occasions to
allot 1% of their Gross Domestic Product to fund research activities, in accordance
w ith the Lagos Action Plan (Organization o f African Unity, 1980).

4.1.1. Research questions
It is clear from the institutional and legal fram eworks set up and from the policy
documents referred to above that authorities (at national, regional or continental
level) are aware o f the importance o f science and technology for developm ent. It is
too soon to assess the real impact of these measures or policy statem ents on the
scientific output in W est Africa or in Africa. However, it is useful to draw the state of
scientific publishing th at may serve later for comparison purpose. This study will
answer the following research questions: i) To which extent do W est African
countries collaborate with each other? ii) W h at are the main research partners of
W est Africa in Africa and worldwide? iii) W hat is the share of international
collaboration in W est Africa scientific output both at the level of individual countries
and the w hole region?

4.1.2. Objectives
The objectives o f this chapter are double: to produce basic statistics on intra-regional
and international scientific collaboration in W est Africa and to identify the main
partners o f W est Africa both in Africa and worldwide.

4.2.

Literature review

4.2.1. Scientometric studies in Africa
Scientometric studies on the whole or parts o f Africa are very limited, compared to
other continents, even though an evident interest has been registered recently
(NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, 2010; Tijssen, 2007). They may be
distinguished in four categories: i) studies related to the whole or almost the whole
Africa (e.g. Adams et al., 2010; Confraria & Godinho, 2015; Omwoyo Bosire Onyancha
& M aluleka, 2011b; Pouris & Pouris, 2009; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011; Urama et
al., 2010); ii) studies related to one or more African regions or several countries from
different African regions (e.g. Arvantis et al.,

2000; Boshoff, 2009, 2010; Dahoun,

1999; NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, 2010; Onyancha, 2009; Pouris,
2010; Tijssen, 2007; W aast, 2002);41 iii) papers th at are country specific with one, tw o
or three countries (e.g Dahoun, 1997; Gaillard, 2010; Jeenab & Pouris, 2008;
M egnigbeto, 2012, 2013c, 2013e, 2014d; M egnigbeto & Houzanme, 2012; Onyancha,

41 W aast (2002) gave an o ve rvie w o f cases studies on 15 A frican countries: Egypt, Tunisia. Algeria,
M oro cco a t th e N o rth e rn A frica, Senegal, Burkina, Cote d'Ivoire , Cam eroon, Madagascar, Nigeria, Kenya,
Tanzania, Z im babw e, M oza m biq ue and South A frica. Each c o u n try had been th e o b je c t o f a specific
rep ort.

89

2009)

and iv) those th at are field specific (e.g. Onyancha & Ocholla, 2007; Onyancha

& M aluleka, 2011a; Pouris, 1 9 8 9 ,1 9 9 1 ). W hereas some regions or countries, like the
South African Developm ent Community (SADC) and South Africa, have been steadily
explored, others lack examination. Certain papers from those referred to above dealt
w ith collaboration alongside w ith productivity, fields, co-authorship and citations
analyses. Some others dealt only with collaboration.

4.2.2. Research collaboration in Africa
Toivanen and Ponomariov (2011) and Adams et al. (2010) studied the whole of
Africa's research collaboration pattern. They distinguished three separate "scientific
regions" th at neither match each other nor match the African Union categorization;
they are the Northern (6 countries), the W estern (23 countries) and the SouthernEastern (25 countries) in the case of the form er, the Northern (5) countries, the
Central (34 countries) and the Southern (14 countries) in case of the latter. Toivanen
and Ponomariov (2011) reported an increasing trend in the number o f authors who
contributed to an article from 4.1 in 2005 to 4.5 in 2009; they underlined the
concentration of the growth in the group o f papers w ith 5 or more authors,
illustrating the importance of collaboration in Africa science. The same trend in coÂ­
authorship was noticed by Megnigbeto (2013e) while studying the scientific output
o f three W est African countries, especially Benin, Ghana and Senegal.
Collaboration between African regions is too low indicating "the absence of regional
integration in the African innovation systems" (Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2 0 1 1 ). The
"scientific regions" referred to above were weakly connected. Only a few countries
served as m ajor research hubs; they are Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa,
Egypt, Nigeria and Cameroon (Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). The Northern region
has no direct links neither with the W estern nor with the Southern-Eastern ones
(Adams et al., 2010; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). Collaboration between African
countries is weak too (Adams et al., 2010; Onyancha & Maluleka, 2011b; Toivanen &
Ponomariov, 2011). Adams et al. (2010) identified a French speaking group formed
around Cameroun and an English speaking one including Nigeria, Ghana, Gambia,
and Kenya w ith its geographical neighbours. Nigeria acts as a bridge betw een the tw o
languages

areas;

it

also connects

strongly to

South

Africa.

Conversely,

the

international collaboration rate is higher. It has risen very significantly from 30% in
the early 1990's up to 50% starting from 2000 (Tijssen, 2007). W hile studying the 11
central African countries output, Boshoff (2009) found 80% o f the region's papers
have a foreign address; Onyancha and Maluleka (2011b) reported the same finding
Africa as a whole. Tijssen (2007) reported that the profiles of African countries
regarding international cooperation showed significant differences, ranging from
29% to 87%. The main partners o f both African regions and countries are European
and North American countries, especially, the United Stated of America, the United
Kingdom, France and Germany.

90

African countries have strong ties with th eir form er European colonizers like France
and the United Kingdom (Boshoff, 2009, 2010; Dahoun, 1999; Megnigbeto, 2012,
2013e; NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, 2010; Pouris, 2010) illustrating the
continuing legacy of the colonisation. The presence o f the USA among the main
African partner countries is the effect of African researchers who have studied in the
USA and have m aintained links with th eir research groups after they returned back
home (Adams et al., 2010). As far as intra African collaboration is concerned,
language, culture and geographical close-up w ere identified as drivers (Adams et al.,
2010; Boshoff, 2009; Onyancha & M aluleka, 2011b). South Africa is the main African
partner country for many Africa M em b er States. It dominates the SADC regional
output and acts as the "political North" (Boshoff, 2010).
The main factors explaining the current African science situation are the weak
research infrastructure the continent has and the weak investment in science and
technology. Boshoff (2009) underlined that Sub-Saharan Africa's countries "are
struggling to reach the target of allocating at least 1% of GDP to R & D" as they
com m itted to.

4.2.3. Main findings o f previous research
The most im portant conclusions from the papers reviewed above are: i) Africa's
share to the W orld output is very negligible, ii) the big science producers in Africa are
Egypt in the North, South Africa in the South, Kenya in the East and Nigeria in the
W est; Cameroon in the Central region and Tanzania in the East are among middle
producers; iii) these countries also drive collaboration links; therefore, they are the
backbone o f the scientific collaboration network in Africa and connect African
regions and Africa to the W orld; iv) language, culture, colonial ties and geographical
close-up are criteria fo r collaboration; v) hence, the main African countries' common
partners are form er colonizers, namely France and United Kingdom; however, USA
follows as the third common partner country even though it has no form er colony on
the

Continent; vi) cooperation

betw een

developing countries

is weak;

so is

cooperation betw een African countries; vii) and, viii) developed countries are the
m ajor non-African partners of African countries; iv) countries with the same region
collaborate more than they do with countries from another region.
W estern Africa as defined by the African Union lacks these kinds of studies both
regarding the scientific output measuring, country profiles comparing, intra-regional
or international collaboration indicators computing.

4.3.

Methods and data

4.3.1. Defining research collaboration
Research collaboration is not easy to define or measure. It is often used as
synonymous of m ultiple authorships or multiple addresses; that

is, research

collaboration occurs if tw o or more scientists cooperate and publish (Bordons &

91

Gomez, 2000, p. 198; Katz & M artin, 1997). Research collaboration is a social process
and the idea of collaboration is far from simple, it can take many forms (Bordons &
Gomez, 2000, p. 198; Katz & M artin, 1997). Therefore, a central question arises: how
to measure research collaboration? Katz and M artin underlined that only some more
tangible aspects of collaboration work could be quantified because the phenomenon
may be governed by complexity o f human interaction. They also gave the advantages
o f using co-authorship as a measure in research collaboration evaluating (See also
Bordons & Gomez, 2000, p. 199): i) it is invariant and verifiable, ii) it is relatively
inexpensive and practical, iii) the sample one may analyse using the indicator can be
very large, iv) the results it yields is statistically more significant. The measure
presents however some limitations (Bordons & Gomez, 2000, pp. 199 -2 0 0 ; Katz &
M artin, 1997, p. 2; cf. Subramanyam, 1983, p. 35) : i) the precise nature and
magnitude o f collaboration cannot be easily determ ined; ii) both the nature and
magnitude of contribution of each collaborator are likely to change during the course
o f a research project; iii) only some of the more tangible aspects o f a collaborative
piece of work can be quantified while others most certainly c a n n o t; iv) even a
qualitative

assessment of collaboration

indeterm inate

relationship

between

is extremely difficult
quantifiable

activities

because of the
and

intangible

contributions; iv) not all collaboration results in publication, v) the method of
attributing co-authorship (full or fractional count), etc. Despite these limitations, in
this study, we

used multiple occurrences to

assess collaboration, indeed, in

Academia, co-authorship is the most visible indicator of scientific collaboration and
has thus been frequently used to measure collaborative activity (Abbassi et al., 2012;
Bordons & Gomez, 2000; Katz & M artin, 1997).
In practice, only individuals collaborate; by doing so, they engender collaboration ties
betw een institutions they are working in. Co-authorship analysis has been extended
to the organizational and institutional aspect o f collaboration. Therefore, the
principle of collaboration apply also to research groups within a departm ent,
departm ents within the same institution, institutions, sectors, and geographical
regions (Abbassi et al., 2012; Katz & M artin, 1997, p. 9). Hou et al. (2008) spoke of
level of collaboration and distinguished i) micro level that involves individuals, ii)
meso level with institutions and iii) macro level with countries. Information about
authors to assess collaboration is found in affiliation information (or addresses).
Research collaboration at a level occurs if at least tw o scientists cooperated and
involved tw o different actors from the considered level. Bordons and Gomez (2000)
defined the tw o main research collaboration indicators : i) the co-authorship index,
th at is the average num ber o f authors per document, ii) the collaboration rate which
is the percentage of papers resulting from collaboration between at least tw o actors.

4.3.2. Data source
A search was performed on W eb of Science in April 2012 to retrieve all the
publications co-authored by at least one scientist from any W est African country. The

92

databases

searched

w ere

Science

Citation

Expanded

(SCI-EXPANDED),

Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S), Conference Proceedings
Citation Index- Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH) and Index Chemicus (1C). All
languages and all types of docum ent w ere selected. The exact search expression
entered into the advanced search form was (cu=dahomey or cu=benin) or (cu=ivory
coast or cu=cote ivoire) or cu=niger or cu=senegal or (cu=cabo verde or cu=cape
verde) or cu=senegambia or cu=gambia or cu=ghana or cu=nigeria or cu=togo or
cu=mali or cu=liberia or cu=sierra leone or cu=guinea or (cu=burkina faso or
cu=upper volta) or cu=guinea-bissau. The search returned 75,176 records.

4.3.3. Data treatment
4.3.3.1. Regional d ata
From the results, records related to the period 2001-2010 (a 10-years period) w ere
extracted because this period represents the last com plete decade and accounts for
approxim ately 40% o f the region's total production. The results (29,323 records)
w ere downloaded and merged into a unique file. A bibliographic database was
created w ith CDS/ISIS.42 The database counts several fields, but those w e are
interested in are Affiliations and Corresponding authors; indeed, only these tw o
contain authors or co-authors addresses. The content of the file was im ported into
the database thanks to a program coded in CDS/ISIS Pascal43 (See Appendix 1 for an
example of a CDS/ISIS Pascal programme). Another CDS/ISIS Pascal program was
used to extract country names from affiliations data and add them into the inverted
file for retrieval purposes.
W hile checking for the consistency of the data, it appeared that the part o f the W eb
o f Science search expression (cu=guinea) had selected not only records o f authors
affiliated to Guinea but also those related to authors affiliated to Guinea Bissau,
Papua New Guinea and Equatorial Guinea (these three country names all contain the
word guinea, indeed). The last tw o countries don't belong to the W est African region;
therefore, associated records should be removed from the database. Thus, we run
three searches on the CDS/ISIS database: i) the first selected records related to the
15 W est African countries; ii) the second selected records related to Equatorial
Guinea and Papua New Guinea (955); iii) the third selected the records these tw o
countries shared w ith any W est African country (12); iv) the fourth stage consisted in
removing the results o f the latter search from the set selected by the form er. The
remaining records (955 - 12 = 943) represent the irrelevant ones and w ere deleted

from the CDS/ISIS database. Therefore, the total num ber of records analysed in this
chapter is 29,323 - 943 = 28,380.
W eb of Science uses countries and territories names in affiliations data. Some
territories are not independent or not recognized by the international community
(e.g. Taiwan). But, we need countries to compute reliable statistics on collaboration;
therefore, in the fields Affiliations and Corresponding authors of the CDS/ISIS
database, w e replaced territories names by the name of the countries they depend
on. Hence, M artinique, Reunion, Guadeloupe, Guyana, etc. w ere replaced by France;
England, Wales, Scotland and North Ireland w ere replaced by United Kingdom,
Taiwan by China, etc. The records edition function of CDS/ISIS was used for this
purpose. Thanks to the CDS/ISIS form atting language44 and search function, some
data w ere printed into a file and analysed with statistical software or computed
directly. Finally, another CDS/ISIS Pascal program was used to generate the countries
collaboration network file for analyses with Pajek, a software application for large
networks analysis and visualization (de Nooy e t al., 2005).
The indicators we computed in this chapter have values ranging from 0 to 1 (or 0% to
100% if expressed as percentage). As a rule o f thum b inspired by practices in
interpreting association coefficients, we considered an indicator as null or negligible
if its value is less than 0.05 (or 5%); if the value is over 0.05 and less than 0.30 (30%)
the indicator is weak; it is m oderate if the value is between 0.30 and 0.70 (30% and
70%); over 0.7 (e. g 70%), the indicator is strong.
4 .3 J .2 . In tra re g io n a l d ata
W e extracted from this database records related to intra collaboration within the
W est African region. A paper results from intra collaboration if the affiliations data
bear at least tw o addresses based in at least tw o different W est African countries.
For this purpose, we used the CDS/ISIS search function.
The CDS/ISIS search function operates mainly over the inverted file that contains
"searchable terms" as initially defined by the database adm inistrator into a file called
Field Selection Table (UNESCO, 1989a, pp. 7 5 -8 6 ). It admits the Boolean operators
OR symbolized by the sign + (plus), AND symbolized by the character * (star) and NOT
symbolized by the character A (circumflex). It also admits parentheses to prioritize
part of a search expression (UNESCO, 1989a, pp. 9 5 -1 0 5 ). Let us assume that A, B, C
and D are the names of four countries. The papers country A shared with country B
are papers in which both A and B appear in the address field. The corresponding

44 Â«The fo rm a ttin g language allow s you to define precise fo rm a ttin g re q u ire m e n t fo r data base records.

Boolean expression that permits selecting the set of such papers is A AND B. In the
CDS/ISIS search language, the search equation becomes A * B. Therefore, A * C on
the one hand and A * D on the other hand select the papers A shares with C and
those A shares with D respectively. These three search equations could be combined
and run at once like the following:
(A* B) + (A* C) + (A * D)

(4-1)

.which is also equivalent to
A * ( B + C + D)

(4-2)

th at selects papers A shares either with B, C or D. In the same manner, the three
search equations
B * (A + C + D)

(4-3)

C * ( A + B + D)

(4-4)

D * (A + B + C)

(4-5)

select papers each country, B, C and D respectively, shared with the remaining three
countries. Let us suppose Equation (4-2) be the first search expression run since the
CDS/ISIS session has started, Equation (4-3) the second, Equation (4-4) the third and
Equation (4-5) the fourth. CDS/ISIS automatically assigns each search expression an
identifier which is anything than a num ber represent the order. CDS/ISIS allows for
previous search recalling by entering its number prefixed w ith the sign (#). Previous
search expression may also be part of a new search expression. Therefore, one could
combine or prefix w ith the hash sign (#) the order in the searches history. Thus, the
search expression
#1 + #2 + #3 + #4

(4-6)

combines searches 1 through 4 with the Boolean OR (sign +); therefore, it retrieves
all the papers countries A, B, C, and D shares with each another, e. g. all the intra A,
B, C an d D papers.
W e w rote search expressions like th at in Equation (4-2), considering each o f the 15
ECOWAS M em b er States. For example, the papers Benin shared with any other W est
African country w ere selected with the search expression:
benin * (Burkina faso + cape verde + cote ivoire + gambia + ghana + guinea + guinea
bissau + liberia + mali + niger + nigeria + Senegal + sierra leone + togo)

(4-7)

.Such a search expression was built and executed over the database for each of the
15 W est African M em b er States. The fifteen search expressions were then combined
into only one search expression (like in Equation (4-6)) of which execution returned

1,302 bibliographic records accounting for 4.59% of the region's total output over the
period.

Results

4.4.1. The extent o f the collaboration
Collaboration is often measured by multiple authorships. Therefore, we computed
the num ber o f papers in W est African scientific output according to the num ber of
authors they have. W e distinguished from 1 to 5 authors and 6 and more authors.
The curves are shown in Figure 4-1. For the clearness of the figure, trends w ere not
plotted. The percentage of papers with only one author decreased from 10.5 in 2001
to 9.5 in 2010; the percentage of papers w ith 4 or 5 authors shows the same trend. In
opposition, the percentage o f papers with 6 and more authors has increased.
Besides, Table 4-1 shows th at the total number of co-authors per year rose from
6,759 in 2001 to 23,608 in 2010. Conversely, the number of papers per co-author
trended downward, from 0.23 at the beginning of the period to 0.19 at the end.
These data show the im portance the phenomenon of multi authorship, and hence,
collaboration in research, is gaining in the W est African region; it may also mean that
W est Africa is following the global trend in science publishing

4.4.2. Annual production
The total num ber of bibliographic references considered in this chapter is 28,280.
The repartition per country is presented in Table 4-2. It reveals that, on its own,
Nigeria produced more than half the total output of the region, far followed by
Ghana (11.29% ), Senegal (8.96% ), Burkina Faso (6.29%) and Cote d'Ivoire (5.88%).
The remaining 10 countries each output less than 5% of the region's total scientific
papers. The region's annual production presents an increasing trend and goes from
1,641 in 2001 to 4,617 in 2010 (Figure 4-2). The curve can be best fitted by a linear
trend o f which equation is y = 3 6 1 .4 5 t + 8 50 where y is the number o f papers and t
the period of tim e (t = 1 in 2001 and r2 = 0.96). Figure 4-2 exhibits i) W est Africa's
output curve and its linear and fit, ii) W est Africa's half output curve, and iii) the
Nigerian production curve.
Nigeria is the biggest science producer in W est Africa. From 2001 to 2005, it
produced about the half the region's total production; however, starting from 2005,
its production rose slowly and separated from the curve o f half the region's
production; the dem arcation between the tw o curves became more pronounced in
2006. From then on, Nigeria scientific output became higher; that is, since 2006,
Nigeria has annually being produced more than all the remaining 14 countries
grouped together.

4.4.3. International collaboration a t the region level
International collaboration in the context of this section stands for the collaboration
o f W est African countries in publishing with non-W est African ones as if W est Africa
constituted only one country.
4 .4 .3 .I. Trend an d m ain p a rtn e r countries
Data showed th at 151 non-W est African countries contributed to the scientific
output of W est Africa, among them 38 African, 27 American, 40 Asian, 41 European
and 5 Oceanian. They shared 14,094 papers accounting for 49.66% of the total
output of the region. The lowest international collaboration rate (45.26% ) was
registered in 2008 and the highest (56.44% ) in 2004. Both Figure 4-3 and Figure 4-4
are related to international collaboration in the W est African scientific output. The
fo rm er represents the absolute number of papers; the curve can be best fitted by a
linear trend o f which equation is y = 16 8 .9 5 t + 552.2 w here y is the num ber of papers
and t the period of tim e (t = 1 in 2001 and r2 = 0.97); the latter representing the rate
shows a decrease meaning th a t whereas the number o f publications w ith a non-W est
African address is trending upward, its rate in less than that of the annual output.
This trend may have resulted from the starting of the enrolm ent of doctoral students
by most W est African - mainly French speaking - countries at the beginning o f the
2000s and the opportunities then created for scientific collaboration at the national
level. For comparison purposes, w e plotted data related to Nigeria along with those
of the entire region. Over the period 2001-2010, the Nigerian average international
collaboration rate is lower than th at of the region, but higher than half the total of
the region.

99

The top 20 partner countries' shares are computed in Table 4-3. France is ranked
first; it contributed to the W est African scientific literature with 3,572 papers
accounting for 12.59% of the region's output; this num ber also represents about one
quarter of the total papers W est Africa shared. Just behind, the USA comes as second
partner, w ith 12.54%, followed by the United Kingdom (10.09% ). The fourth partner
is Germany, far behind with 4.39% . South Africa is ranked fifth and the first African
country w ith 3%. O ut of the top 20 partner countries, 9 are European (France, the
United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Denmark
and Sweden), 4 African (South Africa, Cameroon, Kenya and Tanzania), 3 American
(the USA, Canada and Brazil), 3 Asian (Japan, India and China) and one is Oceanian
(Australia). The top 20 countries shared with W est Africa 13,399 papers accounting
for 47.21% of the total output and 88.61% of the papers W est Africa shared with the
rest o f the world. Therefore, the region collaborated with a large num ber of
countries, but only a few partner countries concentrated the shared papers.

4A .3.2. C ollaboration w ith continents
Europe is by far the first partner o f W est Africa with 27.12% (9,655 papers) of
contributions followed by America 14.55% (4,240 papers, North and Latin America
combined), Africa 8.79% (2,530 papers), Asia 5.29% (1,540 papers) and Oceania
1.29% (367 papers). These shares double if reported to the num ber o f papers with
foreign addresses, because the latter accounts approximately for the half the total
production. The top 5 partner countries per continent are given in Table 4-4. Column
1 gives the rank, Column 2 the country name, Column 3 the num ber of papers the
country shared with W est Africa, Column 4 the country percentage share to the
share o f the Content it belongs to W est Africa's scientific output, that is the num ber
in Column 3 divided by the Continent share to the W est Africa scientific output,
Column 5 the country's share to the W orld share to W est African output, th at is
Column 3 divided by the num ber o f W est Africa shared w ith the Rest o f the world
(i.e. 14,094), and Column 6 the country's share to W est African output, that is
Column 3 divided by the total output o f W est Africa (i.e. 28,380).
At the European Continent level, France and the United Kingdom are respectively
first and second partner countries with 37% and 29.65% of papers with at least one
European address. In America, the USA on its own contributed to more than 4 papers
101

out of 5 the continent shares with W est Africa. Globally, these 3 countries, with 8,920
papers accounting for 31.43% o f the W est African total output and 63.28 % of the
papers w ith non-W est African address, are the main partners of W est Africa.
4A .3.3. Collaboration w ith African regions
Africa counts 5345 nations categorized into 5 regions: the Northern, the W estern, the
Central, the Eastern and the Southern (cf.Table 2-1). The Southern region is the first
partner of W est Africa with 1,092 papers (43.16%), followed by Eastern Africa with
890 papers (35.18% ), Central Africa with 666 papers (26.32% ) and North Africa with
(304 papers (12.02% ). These percentage shares are reported to the total Africa's
share to the W est African region.
The main partners on the Africa continent are South Africa, Cameroon, Kenya,
Tanzania, Uganda and Gabon. W e were interested in knowing w hether at this region
level, these countries only drove collaboration links or they shared with other
neighbours. Hence, we extracted from the global collaboration network the subÂ­
network containing only the African countries. W e considered not W est Africa as only
one area, but its 15 M em b er States; therefore, the sub-network counts 53 countries.
W e then visualized the collaboration network of African countries. Figure 4-5 exhibits
the collaboration links betw een the main countries involved. The threshold was set
to 20; it means th at only countries and relations with at least 20 papers are shown.
Countries w ere arranged taking into account the African regions: the Western Africa
in centre, the Central African on the left, the Northern on the top, the Eastern on the
right and the Southern at the bottom . The biggest partner country is South Africa, in
the Southern region; on its own, it co-authored 848 papers which represent 77.66%
o f the Southern Africa region's share to W est Africa scientific output. The second
im portant African partner country, Cameroun, shared 547 papers accounting for
82.13% o f papers the Central African region contributed to. Kenya and Tanzania, the
third and fourth partners belong to the

Eastern African region; they shared

respectively 416 and 227 papers accounting for 46.74% and 25.50 % of the region.
These tw o countries contributed to 557 papers representing 62.58% of the regions'
share to the W estern Africa scientific output. The contribution of Uganda (151
papers) and Gabon (103 papers) are m oderate in comparison with those of the four
form er countries. South Africa, Cameroon, Kenya and Tanzania may be qualified as
the "main African partners" of the W est African region and Uganda and Gabon as
"middle partners". Northern Africa has no m ajor relations with W est Africa, certainly
because, culturally, the form er is close-up to the M iddle East. The main partners from
African regions are the regional biggest information producers.

45 The data collected are related to th e period 2001-2010. The South Sudan, th e 54th A frican Union was

4A.3.4. Sources countries in West Africa
W h at is the situation at the local level? In other words, w hat are the source countries
in W est Africa th at drove links with the four main African partners of the region?
Figure 4-6 shows that South Africa's main partner in W est Africa is Nigeria (64.62% of
the papers South Africa shared); the other W est African countries contributions are
negligible

(the

second

is Ghana

with

13.68%).

Nigeria

and

Senegal

shared

respectively 31.24% and 24.95% of the Cameroonian contribution to the W est Africa
scientific production, followed by Burkina Faso (19.04% ), Benin (17.29% ) and Cote
d'Ivoire (12.69% ). Figure 4-6 shows the main African partner countries of W est
African countries and their link. The width o f any line that joins any couple of
countries also reflects the intensity o f the collaboration in terms of num ber of papers
they shared. Statistics related to four main countries' shares to the W est African
countries are computed in Table 4-5. Each country data were obtained by dividing
the num ber of papers the country at the head o f column's shared w ith a specific
W est African country by the total number o f papers it shared with the whole region.
The collaboration with African countries seems to be language oriented. It points out
a num ber o f clusters: i) a French-based cluster grouping together Senegal and Cote
d'Ivoire and their collaboration ties w ith Cameroun; ii) an English-based cluster
including Nigeria, Ghana and Gambia with their relationships with Cameroun, South
Africa, Kenya and Tanzania, and iii) a balanced cluster with a mixture of French and
English Speaking countries: Benin, M ali and Burkina Faso and their ties with
Cameroun, South Africa, Kenya and Tanzania. It might be remarked th at Nigeria has
strong ties w ith the main countries in each region and W est Africa has no major
relationships w ith the Northern Africa. Nigeria therefore, serves as a bridge or hub
fo r W est Africa towards the African regions; its high output volume enables it to vary
its partners much.
4.4.3.S. In te rn a tio n a l collaboration a t W est A frican countries level
The annual international collaboration rate at the regional level ranges from 45.26%
to 56.44% w ith an average of 49.66% over the whole period (2001-2010). W hat is the
situation in each country? W h at are the countries with the lowest or highest rate?
W h at their main

partners are? Table 4-6 computes the annual international

collaboration rates o f the W est African countries from 2001 to 2010. Nigeria has the
lowest international rate over the period and, in consequence the lowest average
one; 13 countries have a high collaboration rate: Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, Sierra
Leone, Gambia, M ali, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger, Benin, Guinea, Senegal, and Cote
d'Ivoire) ; one betw een 60% and 70% (Togo) and only one around 30% (Nigeria).
France is ranked first partner o f 7 out of 8 of its form er colonies and second for the
8th. Portugal is ranked first partner of one o f its form er colonies (Cape Verde) but 13th
fo r the second (Guinea Bissau). The USA is ranked first partner in case of Ghana,
Liberia, M ali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, the United Kingdom in case of Gambia only.
W e computed statistics on the times a continent (by one o f the countries belonging
to it) appeared in the top 20 list (Table 4-7). For the 15 x 5 = 75 positions related to

103

top five partner countries, 11 European countries appeared 49 times, one American
once, 9 African 11 times and one Asian once. France appeared 9 times, the USA 11
and the United Kingdom 10; other countries occurred twice or once. If the top ten
positions are taken into account, the USA occurred 15 times, the United Kingdom
also 15 times, France 14 times, Belgium 11 times, Germany and Switzerland 10 times
each; others countries appeared 6 times or less; they are African countries mainly.
So, globally, France, the USA and the United Kingdom are the first partner of the
W est African countries.

4.4.4. Intraregional collaboration
4.4.4.1. A n n u al production
The intraregional production in W est Africa slightly rose from 70 papers in 2001 to
over threefold (215) in 2010. The associated curve (Figure 4-7) follows an exponential
positive trend of which equation is y = 6 2 .9 3 5 e Â°121 w here y is the num ber o f papers
and t the period o f tim e (t = 1 in 2001 and R2 = 0.97). W ith this trend, the intraÂ­
regional production would double about a period o f 5 years 9 months and 9 days. If
linear trend is considered, the trend line equation becomes y = 15,69t + 4 3 .86 with r2
= 0.93. According to this equation, the average annual increase in the intraregional
scientific output is about 16 papers. W ith respect to result o f M egnigbeto (2013a)
th a t found an annual average of 361 papers,46 the annual average percentage o f the
intra-regional collaboration in W est African science is 4 3 /3 6 1 which leads to 5,18%.
This percentage gives the extent to which the intra-regional collaboration in scientific
publishing is weak. The real data range from 3.87% to 5.47%. The percentage share
o f intra-regional collaboration doesn't follow any regular trend. It increases regularly
from 4.52% in 2001 and reaches its maximal value 5.45 in 2004 before starting
trending downwards; it reaches its low er value in 2007; finally since 2007 it has
trended upwards again until 2010.

4.4A.2. Intra-regional collaboration
Section 4.4.3 focused on the cooperation between non W est African countries and
W est African ones. In this section, we focus on the cooperation among W est African
countries. Statistics on intra-regional collaboration are computed in Table 4-8. The
num ber in a cell indicates either the volume of papers (column #) or the percentage
share (column %) the country in the header of row and the country in header of
column shared. The diagonal, in bold, contains the total number of papers a country
produced over the period or 100%. The percentage shares are obtained by dividing
the share to the country in the header of row (Column #) by the total scientific
output o f the country in the header of column).
Even though in absolute numbers, the contribution of a country to the output of
another country is the same as the contribution of the latter country to the scientific
output o f the form er, their percentage shares differ because tw o different countries
have not exactly the same volume of output; for example, Nigeria and Ghana shared
130 papers (Row Nigeria and Column Ghana # or Row Ghana and Column Nigeria #);
in percentage however, N ig e ria 's share to the Ghanaian production is 4.06 (Row
Nigeria, Column Ghana %); the Nigerian volume of papers is 5 times the Ghanaian;
therefore, Ghana's share to the Nigerian production in 5 times smaller (0.83%) (Row
Ghana, Column Nigeria #). The last line o f Table 4-8 aggregates to the region level the
contributions of W est Africa to each W est African country science. Nigeria shared
only 2.59% of its production with the other W est African countries. Niger depends
m ore on the region than any other country; it shared approximately one third of its
production.
The num ber of papers any couple o f W est African countries shared ranges from 0 to
130. In percentage o f the countries' total output, it varies from 0 to approximately
2 2 .3 1 country pairs of countries have no relations, that is, the num ber of papers they
shared is 0. Nigeria and Ghana have the highest absolute share (130 papers).
Considering the nature o f the relationship and the number of countries, the number
o f country pairs expected is 15 x 14/2 = 105. 18 missing relations out o f the 31 (i.e.
(51.61% ) are related to the tw o Portuguese speaking countries; it's a measure of the
extent to which they are em bedded (or not) in the collaboration network in W est
Africa.
As far as the shares in percentage are concerned, the num ber of data doubled
because the share of country A to the output o f country B is no longer equal to the
share of country B to the output of country A. Each of the 15 W est African countries,
hence, may have relationship w ith the 14 others; therefore, we expected 15 x 14 =
210 couples of countries' statistics. Bilateral cooperation intensities are below 5% in
case of 198 couples of countries (94%); the remaining 12 couples o f countries have
cooperation intensity lower than 20%. No W est African country dominated the
intraregional collaboration by having strong links with several countries. Portuguese
countries connected to only fe w countries. Therefore, we can conclude that the
intra-regional collaboration is negligible or weak.

Discussion

The main findings o f this study are: i) the phenomenon of co-authorship is increasing
in W est African scientific literature; ii) Nigeria is responsible for more than half the
regional scientific output; iii) the region shared with the world almost one half its
production; iv) the main partner countries are France, the United Kingdom and the
USA both at the regional and individual country levels; hence, Europe and America
are the main partner continents; v) intra-regional collaboration is negligible; vi) the
collaboration w ith African regions is also weak and is driven by a few key countries.

4.5.1. M ulti authorships is trending upward
The phenomenon of multi authorships in scientific papers is increasing in W est Africa
science. It has already been noticed by several previous global studies like (Adams,
2012; Bordons & Gomez, 2000; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). Bordons and Gomez
(2000) underlined th at in global science, the number of co-authors per paper has
been trending upward (Adams, 2012; Megnigbeto, 2013e) in recent decades and the
num ber of single-authored papers has been decreasing. W est Africa therefore is not
a t odds w ith the global trend. Scientists are therefore aware o f the benefit of
collaboration and are taking advantage of it. Literature also underlined th at the
phenom enon has different patterns depending on the discipline. For example, singleÂ­
authored documents are still the norm in the social sciences and humanities while
they are the exception in other areas (Bordons & Gomez, 2000, p. 210). Our study is
global and didn't intend to compute this indicator per field.

4.5.2. Nigeria the local leader
Nigeria is responsible fo r over one half the region's annual scientific outputs. This
result is in accordance w ith Adams et al.'s (2010) conclusions th at listed Nigeria, as
the lone W est African M em b er State, among the six nations dominating Africa
science; it also confirms Dahoun (1999) qualifying Nigeria as "the leader" in scientific
production on the Black continent, and concurs to the findings of Gaillard (2010) and
SCimago (2007). Several factors may explain the ranking o f Nigeria : i) Nigeria is the
largest country of W est Africa by its area; ii) Nigeria is also the biggest country
regarding the population size; iii) besides, Nigeria is the only W est Africa M em b er
State w ith domestic journals indexed by W eb of Science.47 A search run in the 2011
Journal Citation Report Science Edition (Thomson Reuters, 2011) retrieved 5 Nigeriabased journals; another search in the CDS/ISIS database returned an additional 2

47 C ontrary to th e situ a tio n in th e French African colonies, th e B ritain A frican ones had established
universities. So, early a fte r th e ir independence, th e y engaged th e ir universities in respecting th e highest
European standards. T heir a m b itio n to achieve excellence was expressed in th e cre a tio n o f good
rep utatio ns scie ntific jo u rn a ls (Eisemon, 1982; Lebeau, 1997). T herefore, the presence o f Nigerian
journals in th e W eb o f Science is som ew hat a result o f colonial legacy.

115

journals.48 The seven journals published together 1,848 articles. 6 out o f the 7
journals are published by the publisher Academic journals.
A hypothesis test for the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the volume of
output and the size of population revealed a m oderate to strong association (r = 0.62,
p = 0.013, a = 0.05). Therefore, the size of population may have influenced the
volume o f output. In order to eliminate this effect, we computed the number of
papers per inhabitant in 2010 for all the 15 countries, taking into account the total
output over the period 2001-2010 and the population in 2010. Nigeria is ranked 9th
instead, behind Gambia (1st), Senegal (2nd), Benin (3rd) (Table 4-12). Dahoun (1999)
used the same indicator th at ranked Kenya leader in science production in Black
Africa over the period 1992-1998. W e would have liked to compare each country's
total output to certain variables like the number of Universities, the number of
researchers, the Gross Domestic Product Expenditure to Research and Development,
etc.; but those data w ere not available, even throughout the UNESCO Institute of
Statistics online database.

4.5.3. West African scientific output is extraverted
W est Africa shared approximately one half its annual production with non-West
African countries. The main partners are France, USA and United Kingdom both for
the whole region and for individual countries. In consequence, Europe and America
are the main partners at continent level. This finding confirms the result of many
previous studies (e.g. Adams et al., 2010; Boshoff, 2009; Tijssen, 2007; Toivanen &
Ponomariov, 2011). If colonial ties explained the ranking of France and the United
Kingdom (Boshoff, 2009), Adams et al. (2010) justified the presence of the USA, a
country with no form er colonies in the region: "Often this is a consequence of
researchers who have studied in the USA maintaining links with those research
groups when they return home". The argument might also apply to Belgium and
Germany.
The m oderate international collaboration rate of the region over the period hides
disparities among the M em ber States. The annual international collaboration rate of
individual countries goes up to 100%, especially for the smallest producers like Sierra
Leone, Liberia, Cape-Verde and Guinea-Bissau, probably mainly because they have no
science base of their own. Nigeria the biggest producer has the lowest average rate
(around 28%) over the period whereas the other countries' annual rate ranges from
69% to 96%. Some questions then arise: i) Is there a relation between the volume of
production and the rate of international collaboration? ii) Is there a relation between
the

volume

of

production

and

the

number

of

countries

in

international

collaboration?

48 The tw o jo urn als d id n 't appear in th e JCR because Thom son Reuters proceeded to th e ir rem oval a fte r

tested the association betw een the rate of international collaboration and the
volum e o f output o f a country; the result gave r = - 0.625, p < 0.01, a=0.05), leading
to the conclusion th at there is a m oderate to strong negative association betw een
the tw o variables: the less productive a country is in term s o f scientific output, the
greater is its dependence on international collaboration confirming Boshoffs (2009,
2010) conclusions.
Table 4-12 gives some social and economic data for W est African countries. W e

num ber o f partners countries and found th at at the level o f significance o f 5%, there
is a strong relationship betw een the tw o variables (p < 0.1, a = 0.05, r = 0.97).
Therefore, the m ore productive a country, the higher is its num ber o f partner
countries.

4.5.4. West African countries ignored each other
Collaboration within the region is negligible, confirming Onyancha and Maluleka
(2011b) th at "African countries contribute very little to each other's knowledge
production in term s o f research articles". Even though Nigeria is the local giant, it
shared only 2.59% o f its total production with other countries in the region. It didn't
act as the local North as South Africa did in the Southern region (Boshoff, 2009) by
dom inating their international relationships but preferred "co-linguists in East-Africa"
(Adams, 2012). W est African countries collaborated less with each other, less other
w ith African countries and African regions than they did with France, the United
Kingdom and the USA and other western countries. This result is the same as th at of
Boshoff (2010) and Jeenab and Pouris (2008). Hence, they cooperated m ore with
developed countries than they did with developing ones. The statem ent o f UNESCO
Institute of Statistics (2005, p. 4) is confirmed. Indeed, Northern countries are
w ealthier and hence have more means to train scientists, equip laboratories, fund
and prom ote research and im prove its status. They are among global donors by the
financial support they give annually to developing countries. In opposition, W est
African countries are categorized as developing countries; hence, they are poor and
facing social and economic challenges that may hinder investments in research. M ost
African researchers have been trained in W estern countries and then have kept
relationships w ith their fo rm er colleagues or supervisors. Universities in developing
countries have scientific cooperation agreements with W estern higher education
systems. Besides, Megnigbeto (2013e) reviewed the landscape of research in Benin,
Ghana and Senegal and pointed out the common issues they are facing, among which
i) lack o f coordination betw een research programs and research activities, ii) lack of
human and financial resources and equipm ent, iii) insufficiencies or inadequacies of
funding and equipm ent. W e may recall that, even some basic social, political and
economic projects are financed by W estern countries in developing countries. "This
high international collaboration rate might indicate a structural dependence of
African science, owing to the resources offered by advanced countries to help
alleviate infrastructural and financial constraints are hampering many African science
systems" (Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). In these conditions, science, technology
and innovation are not easily prioritized. Boshoff (2009) underlined th at Sub-Saharan
Africa's countries "are struggling to reach the target of allocating at least 1% o f GDP
to R & D" as they com m itted. W e found no significant relation betw een volum e of
production and HDI on the one hand and volume o f production and GDP on the other
hand.

4.5.5. Language and culture drive collaboration with African regions
The main partners in Africa are South Africa in the South, Cameroon in the Central,
Kenya and Tanzania in the East. All these countries belong to the big producers as
identified by Adams et al. (2010) and Dahoun (1999). Cameroon is bilingual; the
others are English speaking. So, w ith respect to th eir main African partners, the W est

African countries are divided into three language-based groups: a French-speaking
one, an English speaking one and a bilingual one (French and English). The bilingual
group includes Benin, Burkina Faso, and Mali; the French speaking one is constituted
by Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire.
W hile comparing Benin to Senegal and Ghana, Megnigbeto (2012) and Megnigbeto
(2013e) noticed th at Senegal published m ore in French than Benin. Particularly,
Megnigbeto (2013e) attributed this phenomenon to the so-called Precarre fran$ais
effects, th at makes France, the form er colonial power, to have privileged relations
w ith some o f its fo rm er colonies, due to economic or geostrategic interests. He
stated th at in Africa, the Precarre Fran?ais includes Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal in W est
Africa and Cameroon and Gabon in Central Africa. In order to check, we computed
the percentage o f papers each o f these five countries (Benin, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire,
Burkina Faso and M ali) produced both in English and French. Cote d'Ivoire and
Senegal produced in French 23.3% and 14.04% respectively; Benin, Burkina Faso and
M ali produced respectively 10.71%, 11.43% and 8.47%. Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal
produced in English 81.01% and 85.39% respectively; Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali
produced respectively 90.19% , 89.64% and 92.19% . These statistics allow drawing
the conclusion that the W est African French speaking countries with a lower rate of
publication in French, and hence a higher rate of publication in English, cooperate
often w ith both English and French speaking countries, and conversely, those with a
higher rate o f publication in French and hence low er rate in English have few er
research relationships w ith African English speaking countries, instead. That explains
the strength of their relations with Cameroon and the lack or insufficiency of ties
with South Africa, Kenya or Tanzania. On the other hand, Benin, M ali and Burkina
Faso have much strong ties both with Cameroon and South Africa, Kenya or Tanzania.
These analyses stressed the importance of language in driving collaboration. W e
might also notice th at W est Africa has no major relationship with the Northern Africa
whose countries share culture and language (Adams et al., 2010). Culturally, West
Africa is closer to Central, Southern and Eastern African than to the Northern Africa.
The absence of ties between W estern Africa and Northern Africa lends to the role of
culture in collaboration driving.

4.6.

Conclusion

The African continent has been examined by several scientometric studies but none
exclusively was devoted to the W est African region as defined by the African Union.
W e downloaded from W eb of Science research papers with at least one co-author
affiliated to any o f the 15 countries of the region. Analyses focused on intraregional
and

international collaboration.

M ulti-authorship is gaining importance in the

scientific output of W est Africa. Nigeria is far the leader in scientific information

collaboration rate; in opposite, the other countries' rates are too high. W est African
scientific output is extraverted. M em ber States ignore each other while collaborating
120

and seemed preferring other African region's local giant or form er colonizers or
w estern countries. Nigeria acts as a bridge towards African

regions but not

dom inated individual countries' production. Overall, language, colonial ties and
culture drive collaboration in W est Africa science.
It would be interesting to undertake further research to identify main institutions and
cities th at drive collaboration in the region. This study didn't find any effect of
geographical proximity on the W est Africa collaboration patterns. It didn't assess the
impact o f international collaboration in promoting publication by the impact it may
have on citations received.
In order to strengthen intra-regional collaboration W est African M em b er States
should really allot 1% o f their GDP to Research and Developm ent as th eir com m itted
to,

help in equipping laboratories, recruit sufficiently qualified personnel and

m otivate them . They should also prom ote research product and status, help in
setting up database at national and regional level to collect domestic research papers
in order to measure their impact. Indeed, international databases have biases
regarding developing or non-English speaking countries literature. Besides, in such
countries, there exist scientifically valuable unpublished documents (Dahoun, 1999).

regarding scientific publishing and measure the extent to which this is helping
progress tow ard w elfare. This chapter is based on M egnigbeto (2013g).

5.1. Introduction
Traditionally, University teaches and researches, Industry commercializes the results
as products, while Governm ent sets up the regulatory fram ew ork, collects taxes and
brings financial support. Knowledge-based economies need to sustain a high level of
innovation due to the growing and strengthening of relations betw een university and
firms,

the

effects

of

inform ation

and

communication

technologies

and

the

em ergence of networks and the need to reduce bureaucratic layers (Leydesdorff &
Etzkowitz, 2001). The importance of the Triple Helix betw een University, Industry and
G overnm ent has been stressed over the last decades. It ensures the knowledge flow
among the three sectors and contributes to economic growth and hence to social
and economic developm ent. Through innovation and the renewal o f the political
economy and social structure, the Triple Helix is the key to knowledge-based
economic

The African continent counts five regions based on cultural, historical, geographical
and economic criteria :49 the N orthern (6 countries ),50 the W estern (15 countries), the
Central (9 countries), the Eastern (13 countries) and the Southern (10 countries). The
W est African M e m b er States (in alphabetical order: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde,
Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria,
Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo) together constitute the Economic Community o f the
W est Africa States (ECOWAS), a regional economic integration organization. Three
international

language communities

are

distinguished

in the

region th a t are

respectively French speaking, Portuguese speaking and English speaking.

The African Union, African regional economic communities and individual countries
have recognized the role o f science and technology for poverty alleviation and
developm ent (Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). In addition to regional institutions,
other financial institutions, UNESCO and other international institutions support the
form ulation and im plem entation of science, technology and innovation policy. Article
27 o f the ECOWAS Revised Treaty (ECOWAS Commission, 1993) clearly spells out that
M e m b er States shall ensure proper application o f science and technology to the
developm ent of agriculture, transport and communications, Industry, health and
hygiene, energy, education and m anpower and the conservation o f the environment,
meaning th a t research should serve other sectors to develop and thus contribute to
economic growth and social w elfare.
A non-negligible num ber of papers dealt with the Triple Helix o f University-lndustryGovernm ent relationships (M eyer, 2012; M eyer et al., 2014); even several special
issues o f journals w ere devoted to them (cf. Appendix 2); an entire book (Saad &
Zawdie, 2011) dealt with the developing countries cases. Furthermore, an annual
scientific conference has been holding ;51 and a journal, the Triple Helix Journal, was
inaugurated in 2014. Only a few papers had sought to use bibliometric data to
explore

how

the

partnership

betw een

the

three

sectors

is established

(e.g

Leydesdorff, 2003, 2008; Park et al., 2005). However, interests have been expressed
for different areas recently, for example the OECD countries (Choi et al., 2015;
M egnigbeto, under review, 2015c); South Korea (Kwon, 2011; Kwon et al., 2012;
Megnigbeto, 2015a; Park & Leydesdorff, 2010), Japan, USA and some W est European
countries (Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009; Ye et al., 2013), W est Africa (M egnigbeto, 2013g,
2014b, 2014c, 2015a, 2015b, China (Leydesdorff & Zhou, 2013) or Saudi Arabia (Shin
et al., 2012 ).
In this chapter, our objective is to study the collaboration network between
University, Industry and Governm ent in W est Africa regarding scientific publishing.
Specifically, w e will provide answers to the following research questions: i) W hat are
the shares o f University, Industry and Government in the W est African scientific
output? ii) To which extent do the three sectors collaborate in W est African papers?
iii) How strong are the sectorial relations in each of the W est African M em ber State?
iv) Which are the main actors of each sphere of the Triple Helix in the W est Africa?

5.2.

Political and sectorial governance within the ECOWAS

From th eir independence early 1960s to the end of the Cold W ar (end of 1980s),
African States and hence almost all the ECOWAS M em bers States w ere ruled by
single-party authoritarian regimes with central control and a state monopoly in all
sectors of the economy. The fall of the Berlin W all in 1989 has changed geopolitical
strategies at the international level, mainly in W estern countries, so most of the

51 The 14th annual conference o f th e Triple Helix w ill be held in G erm any in Septem ber 2016.

124

developing countries w ere forced to switch over to democracy with a liberalized
political and economic system. W est African regional institutions and M em b er States
have recognized democracy as a system th at sustains peace, stability, economic
growth, social and economic developm ent and a condition to regional integration
(ECOWAS Commission, 2011b) and com m itted to "deepen and strengthen the
dem ocratic institutions using appropriate international standards" with an "ECOWAS
o f people" as target.
The ECOWAS adopted several sectorial policies among which the ECOWAS Policy on
Science and Technology (ECOPOST) in 2012 and the W est African Common Industrial
Policy (WACIP) in 2010. Especially, the ECOPOST should help ECOWAS M em b er States
to master all science fields required for the emergence o f a scientific com m unity able
to com pete and to exchange w ith the best research teams worldwide. Some o f the
problems W est African science is facing are (cf. Megnigbeto, 2013e): i) lack of
coordination betw een research programs and research activities, ii) lack o f human
and financial resources and equipm ent, iii) insufficiencies or inadequacies of funding
and equipm ent. The WACIP envisions to "maintain a solid industrial structure which
is globally com petitive, environm ent-friendly and capable of significantly improving
the living standards o f the people by 2030" (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a, p. 4). The
region's economic perform ance remains too inadequate (low GDP growth rate,
extrem ely high inflation, etc.) to hope to have positive impact on the socio-economic
conditions of the populations. The natural resources, especially agriculture products,
are note valorised and the manufacturing industry contributes only 7% to the GDP.
The high-tech sub sectors are not valorised. Even though W est Africa has a vast
w ealth o f untapped mineral resource (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a), these products
locally undergo elem entary processing. They are exploited by multinationals (from
the W estern countries often) that export for transform ation into finished products.
M a jo r industries are limited in num ber and are local branches o f multinationals. The
ECOWAS industrial sector is still embryonic and therefore, not sufficiently diversified
to produce a wide variety of interm ediary and finished products. Over half o f the
industrial units in W est Africa operate at less than 50 percent of th eir capacities
(ECOWAS Commission, 2010a). The ECOWAS industrial output is insignificant; it
represents only one percent o f the W orld total output (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a,
p. 4). Currently, no ECOWAS country has a robust and solid productive secondary
sector to transform the national economy and join the global com petition.
The w eak performance o f industry in W est African M em ber States is explained by
several factors. Funding for investment is scarce, access to efficient technologies
(acquisition, maintenance) which are elements of differentiation and therefore of
competitiveness

is difficult,

the

national

markets

are

inadequate

and

their

integration is hampered by bureaucracy, customs and police harassment along the
trade corridors (ECOWAS Commission, 2010b, pp. 2 4 -2 5 ). Furthermore, the existing
infrastructure is insufficient, because of excessively high costs an d /o r poor quality
factors o f production (electricity, water, etc.) and basic infrastructures (industrial
areas, roads, railways, ICT, etc.). In consequence, even though the region is endowed

125

with natural resources o f which exploitation may contribute to its economic growth,
tw o-thirds of the installed industries operate at less than 50 % of their capacities
(ECOWAS Commission, 2010a). The ECOWAS vision 2020 (ECOWAS Commission,

2011 b, p. 18) envisages a private sector "engine of growth and developm ent" and an
integrated

regional

production

base developed

by competitive

private sector

activities which provide production and distribution levers for deeper regional
integration and developm ent support by an efficient ECOWAS business body that
promotes strong public-private partnership for generating wealth to sustain the
developm ent and property of the region. The vision also has the goal to promote
active

participation o f the academic community in all issues related to the

integration. Therefore, the ECOWAS vision 2020 expressed the willing of the region
and shows th a t policy- makers are aware o f the importance of the University,
Industry and Governm ent relationships for the developm ent o f both individual
countries and the region.
Overall, democracy, which is recognized as a condition for economic and social
developm ent, has spread within the region recently. Even though there exist some
political instabilities due to coup d'etats and armed conflicts, democracy has installed
a relatively peaceful environm ent that favours investment and developm ent of the
private sector, in comparison with the Cold W ar period.

Previous studies

5.3.1. The Triple Helix o f University-Industry-Government
relationships
The

relationships betw een

University,

Industry and

Governm ent

have gained

attention in recent decades. They resulted from the transformation of the actors'
role in the new economy. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (cf. Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff,
1995, 2000; Leydesdorff, 2012a) elaborated, on this basis, the Triple Helix concept
th at represents the necessary dynamics among the three sectors. If research
activities exploit existing knowledge and produce new knowledge, the circulation of
knowledge betw een innovation actors ensures its transformation into innovations.
Innovation takes an im portant place in industrial developm ent, economic growth and
w ealth production. There is a positive correlation between the levels of research and
developm ent activities and the

level of absorption capacity and the pool of

knowledge th at can be exploited (M ueller, 2006). Hence, the knowledge flow
betw een actors can indicate the level of developm ent and the self-organization of
the society or region.

5.3.2. Measuring the Triple Helix
Due to their importance in the economy, the Triple Helix relationships are object of
indicators to allow performances m easurem ent. Indicators have become a key aspect
of works on University-Industry-Government relations and one third of publications

126

on Triple Helix indexed in Thomson Reuters' Social Science Index deals with
indicators (M eyer, 2012; M eyer et al., 2014). Some papers have proposed the use of
indicators o f science-technology interaction like patent citations, publication counts,
patents counts, citations, co-authors and related indicators or inventor/author
analysis (e.g. Acosta & Coronado, 2003; Callaert et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2012; M eyer
et al., Utecht, 2003; Ranga e t al., 2003; Van Looy e t al., 2007); others are concerned
with measuring inform ation flows especially through entropy measures (e.g. Ivanova
&

Leydesdorff, 2014;

Leydesdorff, 2003, 2008;

Leydesdorff &

Ivanova,

2014;

M egnigbeto, 2014a); and some others have developed and applied indicators that go
beyond patent counts and capture a lot o f other relevant third mission activities of
universities (e.g. Acosta et al., 2007; Baldini, 2006; Uranga e t al., 2007).
The Triple Helix configuration can be depicted statically using social netw ork analysis
(Leydesdorff, 2003). Indeed, citation or patent analysis borrowed some indicators
from social netw ork analysis because citations establish links or relations between
items that cite or are cited. Olm eda-Gom ez et al. (2008) used social network analysis
indicators

like

density,

average

degree,

num ber

of

components,

degree

centralization, betweenness centralization, mean closeness score, diam eter, and
clustering coefficient to analyse research collaboration betw een University, Industry
and

Governm ent. Considering the

relations betw een

University,

Industry and

G overnm ent as variables, Leydesdorff (2003) stated that the interacting fluxes
generate probabilistic entropy and may be measured as an indicator o f entropy. He
then developed the mutual information or transmission as a m easurem ent o f the
intensity o f the relations among the Triple Helix. The resulting value can be negative,
null or positive. A positive value means a centrally-controlled system; a negative
value

means a self-organised system, and a null value indicates absence of

interactions. Therefore, the more negative the mutual inform ation, the more nonÂ­
coordinated and self-organised the system is, and the more positive the mutual
inform ation, the m ore centrally-controlled the system is. Leydesdorff and Sun (2009)
extended the mutual inform ation in three dimensions to four dimensions, w here the
fourth

dimension,

named

'foreign',

groups

papers

co-authored

with

partner

countries and Leydesdorff and Ivanova (2014) proposed the mutual redundancy as
the positional counterpart o f the relational communication o f inform ation. M uller
(2006) proposed a model to measure the economic performance o f an area;
University-lndustry relations are an input of th at m odel52.

5.3.3. Applying Triple Helix indicators
As indicated earlier, a non-negligible num ber o f papers have been published dealing
w ith the Triple Helix o f University-Industry-Government relationships. For those
having worked w ith bibliographic records, data sources are either Internet or

52 O thers are th e annual eco no m ic g ro w th rate, th e g ro w th rate o f T otal Factor P ro d u ctivity (TFP),
research and d e ve lo p m e n t a ctivities in p rivate enterprises, th e g e ne ration o f know ledge in universities,
and e n tre p re n e u rsh ip activity.

127

multidisciplinary bibliographic national or international databases like those of W eb
o f Science. The mutual inform ation was mainly used fo r three or four-dimensional
systems (e.g. Khan & Park, 2011; Leydesdorff, 2003; Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009;
M egnigbeto, 2013g; Ye et al., 2013). Social network analysis techniques w ere also
used (Olm eda-Gom ez et al., 2008). However, difficulties may arise while attributing
labels to records based on affiliations data (Khan & Park, 2011, p. 2454). For example,
an institution name only may not be sufficient enough to allow for categorization: as
an illustration, the Chinese Academy o f the Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy
of the

Social Sciences (CASS) are

considered

either as public

belonging to

G overnm ent or University and consequently engendered the computation of tw o
mutual inform ation values fo r the county (Ye et al., 2013). W hatever the case is,
globally, University publishes more than Governm ent which, in turn, publishes more
than Industry. University's ranking is due to the continuous influx o f PhD students
(Leydesdorff & Etzkowitz, 2001) and the publication mission of scholars. Because of
these positions, University-Government output is the largest when bilateral relations
among the sectors are considered, followed by University-lndustry and IndustryG overnm ent

research

outputs.

The

joint

collaboration

University-Industry-

G overnm ent is the smallest due to the effect of the double Boolean operator AND
(Khan & Park, 2011; Leydesdorff, 2003; Leydesdorff & Curran, 2000; Leydesdorff &
Sun, 2009). Globally, the relations between the three spheres depend on the political
and economic conditions and also on the international environment.
Some studies have dealt with the University-Industry-Government relationships in
African countries specifically (e.g. Etzkowitz & Dzisah, 2007 for the whole of Africa;
Nwagwu, 2008 fo r Nigeria; and Taylor, 2004 for South Africa). In 2012, the
Association of African Universities conducted a survey on University-lndustry linkages
in Africa (Ssebuwufu et al., 2012). But these studies didn't use any indicator; they
neither studied the whole W est African region nor used any bibliographic database.

5.4.

Subjects and Methods

The elaboration of the Triple Helix o f University-Industry-Government relationships
thesis relies on collaboration betw een the three sectors. O f course, co-authorship
provides a direct measure of collaboration (OECD, 2010, p. 98); collaboration may
cover several aspects and not all collaboration yields publications (Katz & M artin,
1997). In this chapter however, w e focus on research collaboration understood as coÂ­
authorship because its entails the tacit transfer o f information and knowledge
(Olm eda-Gom ez et al., 2008). It has become an indicator for scientific collaboration
measuring and is widely used in academia (Abbassi et al., 2012; Bordons 8t Gomez,
2000; Katz & M artin, 1997; Olmeda-Gomez et al., 2008).
W e downloaded W est African scientific publications data from Thomson Reuters'
W eb o f Science over a ten-year period (2001-2010). The databases searched were
Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), Conference Proceedings Citation
Index-Science (CPCI-S), Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Social Science &

128

Humanities

(CPCI-SSH)

and

index Chemicus

(1C). The

search

expression

was

(cu=dahomey or cu=benin) or (cu=ivory coast or cu=cote ivoire) or cu=niger or
cu=senegal or (cu=cabo verde or cu=cape verde) or cu=senegambia or cu=gambia or
cu=ghana or cu=nigeria or cu=togo or cu=mali or cu=liberia or cu=sierra leone or
cu=guinea or (cu=Burkina faso or cu=upper volta) or cu=guinea-bissau. The 28,380
resulting records w ere downloaded into a bibliographic database managed with the
CDS/ISIS53 software application. Based on Leydesdorff's (2003) method for address
assignment, we established a list o f words or abbreviations to attribute a label
'University',

'Industry'

adaptations

to

the

or

'Governm ent'

three

international

to

each

language

address.

We

encountered

applied
in the

some
region.

Therefore, w e coded a CDS/ISIS Pascal54 programme that assigned each address the
corresponding label. A record may contain many addresses; therefore, one record
may have tw o or m ore different labels. The CDS/ISIS program m e was also instructed
to read the countries' name from the addresses and automatically add the associated
tw o characters ISO codes to the label. Non W est African countries w ere given the
unique identifier â21â. Therefore, in the inverted file, a university in Benin appears
under the label UNIV-BJ, an enterprise in a non-W est African country appears under
ZZ-INDU.
The CDS/ISIS search function operates mainly over the inverted file th at contains
"searchable term s" as previously defined by the database adm inistrator upon a field.
It admits the Boolean operators OR symbolized by the sign + (plus), AND symbolized
by the character * (star) and NOT symbolized by the c h a ra c te rA (circumflex). W e run
searches over the CDS/ISIS database using key-words composed of each country
names and Triple Helix actors' codes. For examples, the searches expressions (1) to
(7) w ere conducted for Benin:
(1) UNIV-BJ: retrieves all records university in Benin authored;
(2) INDU-BJ: retrieves all records industry in Benin authored;
(3) GOV-BJ: retrieves all records governm ent in Benin authored;
(4) UNIV-BJ * INDU-BJ retrieves all records university and industry in Benin coÂ­
authored;
(5) UNIV-BJ * GOV-BJ retrieves all records university and industry in Benin coÂ­
authored;
( 6 ) INDU-BJ * GOV-BJ retrieves all records industry and governm ent in Benin coÂ­
authored;
(7) UNIV-BJ * INDU-BJ * GOV-BJ retrieves all records university, industry and
governm ent in Benin co-authored.

53CDS-ISIS is te x t database m anagem ent so ftw a re developed and d is trib u te d by UNESCO (1989a).
54 CDS/ISIS provides a pro gra m m ing language "designed to develop CDS/ISIS applicatio ns re q u irin g
fu n ctio n s w h ich are n o t readily available in th e standard package" (UNESCO, 1989b). This p ro gra m m ing
language enables users to exte nd fu n ctio n s o f th e standard package, to m ake it m ore ro b u st and in
o rd e r to m ee t users' specific needs (M egnigbeto, 1998).

129

Finally, the contribution of each actor was computed as follows (according to the
Venn diagram in Figure 7-1):
U = (1) â(4) - (5) + (7): number of publications university only authored;
I = (2) - (4) - ( 6 ) + (7): num ber of publications industry only authored;
G = (3) - (5) - ( 6 ) + (7): num ber of publications government only authored;
Ul = (4) - (7): number of publications university and industry only co-authored;
UG = (5) - (7): number of publications university and government only co-authored;
IG = ( 6 ) - (7): number o f publications industry and industry only co-authored;
UIG = (7): number of publications university, industry and government co-authored.
Such searches and com putation w ere run for individual countries and then for the
w hole region.

Furtherm ore, a second CDS/ISIS programme was used to generate the social network
file for the jo in t collaboration for analysis with Pajek, a software application for large
social netw ork analysis (de Nooy, M rvar, & Batagelj, 2011). The print service of
CDS/ISIS was used to output some data into text file for statistical analyses. Finally,

W e assigned labels to 84.37% of addresses, 96.20% of records and 88.4% of the W est
Africa-based addresses and 90% of the records if W est Africa alone is taken into
account (Table 5-1). This identified a total of 13,162 institutions o f which 5,161 (38%)
are based in W est Africa.

Results

It should be borne in mind th at numbers are very low for many sectors and that this
analysis represents the emergence o f research structure in a group of countries with
historically low levels of R&D investment compared to e.g. Europe. This analysis
therefore provides both a case study of the present and a reference benchmark for
the future.

5.5.1. Production per Triple Helix sphere
Over the period 2001 to 2010, there w ere university addresses on 19,145 (67.45%)
papers, Industry addresses on 145 (0.52%) papers and Governm ent addresses on
8 ,994 (31.09% ) papers (Table 5-2). Industry's 145 papers over a ten-year period is an
average o f 15 papers per year for all the 15 W est African countries and 1 paper per
year per M em b er State. The U and I shares are trending upwards whereas the G one
is trending downwards Figure 5-2). This doesn't mean a diminishing Government
output, but rather a growth less than that o f the total production of the region (Table
5-2). It is clear however that the private sector contributes to the knowledge
exchange marginally in W est Africa, regarding scientific publishing.
Analysis at the level of individual countries shows disparities regarding each sphere's
contribution to the research output (cf. Table 5-3). Industry was absent completely in
the scientific output o f six countries (Benin, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali and
Niger). In Nigeria and Ghana, it produced 101 papers and 30 papers respectively,
ranking these tw o countries first and second respectively. However, the highest
percentage share of industrial output is registered in Cape Verde (21.4%) due to the
country's low total output (52 papers). University is the biggest science producer in
Ghana (56.85% ), Nigeria (87.80% ) and Togo (51.96% ), and Governm ent is the prime
producer elsewhere. This result may have been influenced by the categorization we
did, because hospitals w ere classified as belonging to Government.
Table 5-4 computes the specialisation indexes55 of the Triple Helix spheres in W est
Africa using Frascati Manual (OECD, 2007) categories w ith the whole W est Africa
region as reference. W hile Governm ent specializes in Health and medical sciences
(certainly a consequence of the classification of hospitals into G),

University

55 The specialization index is an in dica tor o f the in te n sity o f research o f a given geographic or
organizational e n tity (e.g., a cou ntry) in a given research area (dom ain, fie ld ) relative to th e in te n sity o f
th e reference e n tity (e.g., th e w o rld ) in th e same research area. An index value above 1 means th a t a
given e n tity is specialized relative to the reference e n tity , w h ile an index value be lo w 1 means the
opposite, an index around 1 means a n e utral p ro du ction. The specialization index is th e ra tio betw een
th e share o f an a cto r in a fie ld re p orted to th e reference areaâs to ta l o u tp u t in th e same fie ld and the
share o f th e a cto r to th e to ta l p ro d u ctio n o f th e reference area.

is therefore very much as might be expected.

5.5.2. Collaboration between the Triple Helixâs spheres
Because the total output of Industry is negligible, its breakdown per year yields weak
trends. Because o f this, collaboration betw een Industry and Government, Industry
and University and jo in t collaboration betw een the three spheres is difficult to index.
Industry collaborates however, more w ith University (Ul) than Governm ent (IG); the
University-Governm ent relations output the highest number o f bilateral publications.
All the three curves show an increasing trend and the collaboration indexes, that is
the percentage o f papers that is authored in collaboration, are also trending upwards
(Figure 5-3 and Figure 5-4).
At the level of individual countries, all the 15 M em ber States have data on University
and Governm ent collaboration; but only tw o countries have data on Industry and

134

University collaboration: Ghana with 7 papers representing 0.23% of the Ghanaian
to tal output and 33.33% of the country's industrial output, and Nigeria w ith 53
papers -0 .3 4 % of the Nigeria total and 51.43% o f the Nigerian industrial output.
These countries are the only ones th at had publication collaboration between
Industry and G overnm ent. The percentage share o f University-Governm ent relations
got its maximal value in case o f Guinea Bissau (81.22% o f the country's total output)
perhaps due to the lower level of the latter or to the weaknesses in the BissauGuinean universities research system. The jo int collaboration betw een University,
Industry

and

G overnm ent

is

marginal;

5.5.3. The level of synergy
W e used the mutual inform ation indicator to evaluate the level of self-organization
or central control in an economy. W e calculated the related value for the W est
African region over the period 2001-2010. The values are all negatives, ranging from
- 1 3 to - 3 2 millibits, with an average of - 1 9 millibits 56 {Table 5-5) showing the
weaknesses of information exchange between University, Industry and Government
in W est Africa from

the

perspective

of research

publishing as indicator of

collaboration. Annual transmissions are negative indicating synergy among actors; in
other words, the system is not centrally controlled over the studied period o f times;
however the interactions between actors are too low and cannot ensure better
knowledge circulation. Indeed, transmission varies from -13 to -32 millibits. At the
level o f individual countries, Cape Verde has the highest transmission {- 217 millibits)
and the six countries with 0 output for industrial sector has a null transmission (Table
5-6).

5.5.4. The industrial research network
The production o f Industry is very small; its co-publication with the other sectors is
even smaller due to the Boolean operator effect. The 145 industrial records
contained 107 institutions. The visualization of the network reveals 23 components
of which 20 have very few members. W e deleted these and focused on the remaining
three w ith 33, 15 and 9 actors. Each institution name was prefixed with its country's
ISO tw o characters code. The first tw o components group together Nigeria-based
institutions, and the third Ghana-based ones. The numbers are extrem ely low and
connectedness is therefore, weak. As a result, indicators o f centrality are probably
not yet inform ative. Shell Nigeria, University o f Ibadan, University of Lagos and Rivers
State University dom inate the larger Nigerian component (Figure 5-5) while in the
smaller one, the leaders are University of Calabar, M obil, University o f Maiduguri,
Innovation Biotech Ltd, and University o f Jos. In the Ghana-based component,
University of Ghana is a central actor.

Discussion

University is the biggest information producer, but Industry so far contributes little to
the W est African scientific production. Globally, University produced more than
Governm ent which, in turn, produced more than Industry. This conclusion conforms
to the results of Khan and Park (2011) as regarding web pages and also those of
Leydesdorff (2003) and Leydesdorff and Sun (2009). The joint collaboration between
the three spheres is negligible industrial sector's very small scientific output and the
effect of the double Boolean operator AND. In W est African countries, as in other
developing countries, the economy is characterized by an im portant informal sector
- 60% of the global added value (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a) - th at weakens the
form al sector. Even though the industrial sector contributes 30.3 % to the regional
Gross Domestic Product, this is still weak, in comparison to the emerging countries
(ECOWAS Commission, 2010a) and is focused on low-technology areas to sustain a
developing economy.
The

negativity o f the

mutual

information

betw een

University,

Industry

and

Governm ent is however a favourable point, although its absolute size is low. It
indicates th a t the innovation system is changing from a state-controlled to a selfÂ­
organized one, probably due to the advancement of liberal democracy within the
region. W e compared the percentage share of the industrial sector in the W est
African scientific output to th at of the BRICS countries. Whereas it is only 0.5% in
case of W est Africa, its values are 2.4% in Brazil, 1.62% in Russia, 3.13% in India and
11.07% in China (data taken from Leydesdorff, 2003); mutual information values are
respectively -2 7 .1 1 , -5 8 .1 6 , -1 0 9 .5 , - 1 9 .4 5 /-3 6 .0 1 and -2 1 .3 5 millibits (data taken
from Ye et al., 2013) whereas it ranges from - 1 3 to - 3 2 millibits in case of W est

138

Africa w ith an average of - 1 9 millibits. Because the more negative the mutual

University,

Industry

and

G overnm ent, these statistics m eant th at compared with the W est African region, the
BRICS countries have a higher synergy within th eir University-Industry-Government
relationships when publications are taken as unit.
The W est African universities and governmental bodies also collaborated w ith nonW est African industrial sector ('foreign Industry' from a W est African perspective);
but the outcom e is also marginal (16 records) even though twice the num ber of
records Governm ent and University shared with the local Industry. Globally, the
industrial sector contributed 304 papers to the W est African output, of which 167 are
authored by 'foreign Industry'. It should be underlined th at the foreign Industry
doesn't share any publication with the local Industry. The weak output o f Industry in
the region is explained by the factors that are hindering the industrial developm ent
and referred to previously. Particularly, the vast w ealth o f untapped mineral
resources the region is endowed w ith locally, undergo elem entary processing; they
are exported and transform ed into finished products th at are sold back to African
people. Consequently, the local Industry role is reduced to extracting and exporting
resources; it doesn't need to explore the local m arket, to produce to satisfy local
consumers. In other words, local Industry does not have the opportunity to do
research

and

innovate:

W est

Africans'

âtasteâ doesn't

m atter

while

thinking

innovation because products are conceived abroad. Therefore, much research is not
undertaken locally, but in the countries w here products are transformed.

5.7. Conclusion
The publication data o f W est Africa over the period 2001-20 10 indexed in Thomson
Reuters' W eb of Science was analysed. W e focused on University, Industry and
Governm ent relationships both at regional and individual country levels. Results
showed th at as regarding the

num ber of papers,

University is ranked first,

Governm ent second and Industry third. The industrial sector's share to the region's
output is marginal. University and Governm ent have relations in all the W est African
countries, but Industry exhibits relations with Governm ent or University in Nigeria
and Ghana only. Relations betw een all the three sectors occurred only in Nigeria. The
mutual information is w eak illustrating the weakness in the inform ation flow
betw een the three actors in the region, when research output is concerned. The
industrial institutional research network distinguished th ree groups among which
tw o are Nigeria-based and one Ghana-based. The Triple Helix thesis is that the
University-Industry-Government relations lead to competitiveness and economic
growth (Leydesdorff, 2003; M ueller, 2006). According to M ueller (2006) the level of
research

and

developm ent

the

developm ent. The data we treated are too weak and research collaboration is not
limited

to

publishing only;

therefore,

no

about

inform ation flow w ithin the Triple Helix system and the level of developm ent in W est
Africa.

6. The transmission power as an indicator of the Triple
Helix
In this chapter, w e analyse the complex system o f the Triple Helix o f UniversityIndustry-Governm ent relationships from the information theory point o f view. W e
show th at an inform ation source composed with n random variables may be split into

2 " or 2 n - 1 "states"; therefore, one could com pute the maximum entropy of the
source. W e derive the efficiency and the unused capacity of an inform ation source.
W e dem onstrate th at in more than tw o dimensions, the transmission's variability
depends on the system configuration; thus, w e determ ine the upper and the lower
bounds to the mutual inform ation and propose the transmission pow er as an
indicator o f the Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government relationships. Then,
we

find

out

inform ation

tw o -

and

three-dimensional

configurations

w here

the

mutual

reaches its bounds and compute efficiency, unused capacity and

transmission power for such systems as well as for some particular cases.
This chapter is based on Megnigbeto (2014a) and Megnigbeto (2014e).

6.1. Introduction
Indicators have become a key aspect of works on University-Industry-Government
relations (M eyer, 2012; M eyer et al., 2014). Leydesdorff (1991) introduced Shannon's
(1948) inform ation theory into research collaboration network analysis. Later on, the
transmission or mutual inform ation was proposed as an indicator of the relations
betw een University, Industry and Governm ent (Leydesdorff, 2003) based on the
notion o f entropy introduced by Shannon (1948, p. 394) in his M ath em atical theory
o f communication. Ivanova and Leydesdorff (2014) on the one hand, and Leydesdorff
and Ivanova (2014) on the o ther hand, dealt with the mutual redundancy. So,
research collaboration, in general, and University (U), Industry (I) and Governm ent
(G) research relations, in particular, may be measured using inform ation theory tools
as stated by von Bertalanfy (1973, p. 94). The mutual information is interpreted as
the extent to which a system is controlled by an actor, or self-organized and the
mutual redundancy as the positional counterpart of the generation of uncertainty in
relational communications. The mutual information is also called âconfigurational
inform ation 1because it results from the system's configuration; it means th at it does
not depend on one particular variable (Leydesdorff, 2003, 2008; Leydesdorff & Sun,
2009, p. 780). In m ore than tw o dimensions, the mutual inform ation is a signed
measure: it may be negative, null or positive (Leydesdorff, 2008, 2010a; Leydesdorff
&

Ivanova, 2014; Yeung, 2001, 2008);

it is not a Shannon-type

information

(Krippendorff, 2009a, 2009b; Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2014). According to Leydesdorff
(2003), in more than tw o dimensions, if the mutual inform ation is positive, it
indicates a centrally coordinated system; if it is negative, it indicates synergy or the
level o f self-organisation w ithin the system. A null mutual inform ation means
independence of variables and is interpreted as absence o f interactions betw een

141

variables; however, Krippendorff (2009a, 2009b) warned th at the mutual information
could not be used as indicator of unique interactions in complex systems.
Several

studies

used

the

mutual

information

to

analyse

University-Industry-

Governm ent relations in different areas (e.g. Khan & Park, 2011; Leydesdorff, 2008;
Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009;

Megnigbeto, 2013g; Ye et al., 2013). The

mutual

inform ation is a scalar (Ivanova & Leydesdorff, 2014); it has low er and upper bounds
that, like its value, depend on the system's configuration. Therefore, it may be
difficult, even impossible to compare a system to another or the same system over
tim es with respect to this indicator. For example, how one can compare tw o systems
Si and S2 if the upper bound to the transmission in one system (say Si) is lower than
the low er bound to the transmission of the other system (say S2)? W e argue that the
mutual inform ation is not sufficient for comparison purposes. Doing so may lead to
m isinterpretation or bias. In this chapter, w e first show that one can split the entropy
o f an n-dimensional system into 2n additive parts, each engendered by an atom 57
from the sets related to the considered variables; w e derive efficiency and unused
capacity

to

characterise

relationships system. W e

a

Triple

Helix

of

University-Industry-Government

propose the transmission

power, which

relates the

absolute value of the transmission to its lower or upper limits.

6.2. Methodological background
Let us assume th at an event occurs with the probability p. (Shannon, 1948, p. 394)
defined the associated entropy as
H = - p x log2p - (1 - p) x log2( l - p)

(6-1)

w here log2 is the logarithm to the base 2; the entropy may however be computed to
other bases e. g. 3, 4, etc. ). M ore generally, if X = ( x 1, x 2, - , x n) is a random
variable and its components occur w ith the probabilities P i,p 2, â,Vn respectively,
then the entropy generated by X is (Shannon, 1948; Shannon & W eaver, 1949, p. 14)
Hx = - I " = i P i X lÂ°g 2Pi

(6-2)

For tw o random variables X and Y (tw o dimensions), the joint entropy HXy is
HXy = Hx + Hy âTxy

(6-3)

Txy is called mutual inform ation or transmission. It is lower than or equal to HXY.
Txy = Hx + H y - H xy

(6-4)

57 An ato m is a subset o f a set w ith th e m axim um nu m be r o f elem ents so th a t th e in te rsectio n o f any
couple o f a to m is em p ty and th e union o f all th e atom s o f a set gives th e set itse lf ((cf. Yeung, 2001, p.
96, 2008, p. 50).

142

In case o f three random variables X, Y and Z (three dimensions), the joint entropy is
(cf. Leydesdorff, 2003; Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2014):
H xyz

=

+ Hy + Hz â TXY - Txz - TYZ + Txyz

Hx

(6-5)

and the transmission is
T xyz = Hx + HY + Hz â H^y - HYZ - Hxz + HXYZ

(6-6)

6.3. Splittingacomposedsourceintoitsstates
An inform ation source is a random variable th at produces symbols (Cover & Thomas,
2006; Le Boudec, Thiran, & Urbanke, 2013, p. 8; M ori, 2006, p. 16; Shannon, 1948, p.
392). An inform ation source may also be composed o f tw o or more random
variables. Assume th at the values o f the random variable are "0, the source doesn't
produce" and "1, the source produces". W e build, by this way, the alphabet A= {0,1}
of a source with only one random variable; its cardinality is 2. If the source is
composed

w ith

tw o

random

variables,

then

the

alphabet

becomes

AxA

=

A2={0,1}x{0,1} = {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)}; its cardinality is 22 = 4. Each elem ent of the
source's alphabet constitutes an event. Then, the entropy of the source is:
H xy

= ~ P ( 0 ,0) x log2p (0 ,0) - p (0 ,1) x log2p (0 , 1) - p ( l, 0) x log2p ( l, 0) - p ( l, 1) x

log2p (l> 1)

(6-7)

For example, the probability distribution o f a couple of variables X and Y, each with
the alphabet A = {0 ,1 } is given in Table 6-1.

+ P(X = 1,Y = 0)

+ p(X = 1,Y = 1)

P(X = 1)
p(X = 0) + p(X = 1) = p(Y =
0) + p(Y = 1) = 1

The probability th at neither X nor Y produce is p(X = 0, Y = 0); the probability that X
does not produce but Y does is p(X = 0, Y = 1); the probability that X produces but Y
does not is p(X = 1, Y = 0); the probability that both X and Y produce is p(X = 1, Y = 1).
It can be seen in Table 6-1 that:
p (X

= 0)

= p (X = 0, Y =

0) + p (X = 0, Y = 1)

(6-8)

p(X

= 1)

= p (X = 1, Y =

0) + p (X = 1,Y

(6-9)

p(Y

= 0)

= p (X = 0, Y =

0) + p (X = 1, Y = 0)
143

=

1)

(6-10)

p(Y = 1) = p(X = 0, Y = 1 ) + p(X = 1, Y = 1)

(6-11)

p(X = 0) + p(X = 1) = p(Y = 0) + p(Y = 1) = 1)

(6-12)

p(X = 0,Y = 0) + p(X = 0,Y = l ) +

(6-13)

p ( X = l , Y = 0 ) + p(X = 1, Y = 1) = 1

Therefore, entropies follow:
Hx = -P (X = 0) x log2p(X = 0) - p(X = 1) x log2p(X = 1)

(6-14)

HY = âp(Y = 0) x log2p(Y = 0) - p(Y = 1) x log2p(Y = 1)

(6-15)

0, Y = 0) x log2p(X = 0, Y = 0) - p(X = 0,Y = 1) x log2p(X = 0,Y
p(X = 1, Y = 0) x log2p(X = 1, Y = 0) - p(X = 1,Y = 1) x log2p(X = 1, Y = 1)
H xy =

Using the Venn diagram, the events o f which probabilities are depicted in Equation 616 may be represented as in Figure 6-1 w here E stands for the universal set, X the
subset engendered by the random variable X and Y that of Y.

Here, the entropy of the system is:

âp(0, o, 0) x log2p (0 ,0,0) - p (0 ,0 ,1) x log2p (0 ,0,1) - p (0 ,1,0) x log2p (0 ,1,0) p (0 ,1,1) x log2p (0 ,1,1) - p (l, 0,0) x log2p (l, 0,0) - p (l, 0,1) x log2p (l, 0 ,1) (6-17)
p (l, 1,0) x log2p (l, 1,0) - p (l, 1,1) x log2p (l, 1,1)
The subsets depicted in Figure 6-1 and

Figure 6-2 correspond to th e atoms

engendered by the tw o or three subsets of the universal set generated by the
considered tw o or three initial random variables (cf. Yeung, 2001, p. 95, 2008). Each
elem ent o f the source's alphabet constitutes an event and relates to a subset in
these figures. The equation of the joint entropy (Equation (6-17)) reveals them as
states o f the same source (M ori, 2006; Shannon, 1948). The alphabet o f the source is
the set o f its "finite num ber of possible states" (cf. Shannon, 1948, p. 389).
Therefore, the num ber of "possible states" o f a source composed w ith tw o such
random variables is 22 = 4 and equals 23 = 8 if the num ber of random variables is
three. M o re generally, if a source is composed with n random variables each with the
alphabet {0, 1), the num ber of events the joint distribution o f the n variables
engendered is 2n.This result conforms to the 2n atoms generated by the tw o or three
subsets of the universal set engendered by the tw o or three initial random variables
(cf. Yeung, 2001, p. 95, 2008).

6.4. Consequences: derivingefficiencyandunusedcapacity
According to the developm ent in the previous section, w e may split a composed
source into its states. Hence, w e can compute its maximum entropy (Cover &
Thomas, 2006; M ori, 2006; Shannon, 1948; Yeung, 2001, 2008).
U m ax

(6-18)

= lÂ°g2 M

w here M is the num ber o f independent random variables in the system or the
num ber of states o f the source. The maximum entropy is the upper limit of the
entropy o f the system Hs. It indicates the system's inform ation production capacity.
As Equation (6-18) shows, it do not depend on any data produced by the system but
only on the num ber of independent random variables; it means that for any system
o f the same dimensionality, Hmax has the same value. In general, the entropy o f the
system, Hs is low er than Hmax; th at means that a part of the system's inform ation
production capacity may be used and the other not. Therefore, one could com pute
the efficiency and the unused capacity o f the system.
W e define the efficiency of a system as the fraction o f its inform ation production
capacity th a t is really produced.
(6 -1 9 )

Hs and Hmax are all positive and Hs is lower than or equal to Hmax; therefore, q ranges
from 0 to 1. r| is dimensionless and could also be expressed as percentage.
Hmax- Hs represents the unused capacity of the system. The relative unused capacity
is the unused capacity reported to the maximum entropy. It is the fraction of the
capacity of the system th at is not used for information production, p is the
com plem ent to 1 of the efficiency, p is dimensionless and could also be expressed as
percentage.

6.5. Transmissionpower
The mutual inform ation or transmission is the quantity of information common to
the random variables in the system (Shannon, 1948, p. 410). In tw o dimensions, it
measures the system's variables dependence on each other (Batina et al., 2011); it is
always null or positive (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Shannon, 1948; Yeung, 2001, 2008)
and increases w ith the dependence between the components of the considered
variables (Arellano-Valle et al., 2013).

In more than tw o

dimensions, mutual

inform ation is a signed measure (Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2014; Yeung, 2001, p. 103,
2008); it may be null, positive or negative (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Leydesdorff, 2003,
2008, Yeung, 2001, p. 103, 2008).
W e define the transmission power as the fraction of the maximum value of the
transmission devoted to inform ation sharing in the system. It represents the share of
the "total configurational information" really produced in the system. In other words,
it measures the efficiency o f the mutual information and may be interpreted as the
strength of the transmission, o f the variables dependence or o f the synergy, or the
strength o f the inform ation flow within the system or between the system's actors. It
may help in measuring the level o f synergy within the system or among variables or
the pressure or the control exerted within the system.
In tw o dimensions, the transmission power formula is:
!â¢ = M
Hxy

(6-21)

Due to the possible change o f the sign of the transmission in more than two
dimensions and the duality in its interpretation, we distinguish between tw o types of
transmission power x: i i when the mutual information is negative, and x2l when it is
positive. In the first case, the 'm axim um ' value the transmission may reach is HXYz Hx ~ Hy- Hz and HXYZ in the second case (Appendix 3). It follows th at

6.6. Application
In the Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government relationships, one could figure
out three bilateral relations illustrating a composed inform ation source as dealt with
above;

they

are

University-industry,

University-Governm ent

and

Industry-

Governm ent relationships. Appendix 4 shows step by step how to compute sectorial,
bi-dimensional and three-dim ensional entropies, transmission, efficiency, unused
capacity and transmission pow er in a theoretical case. W e apply the indicators
proposed above to data taken from Leydesdorff (2003), Khan and Park (2011) and
those w e collected from W eb o f Science relating to W est Africa. For the purpose of
this case study, w e retained University and industry (Ul) bilateral relations and the
trilateral (UIG) relations only, i.e. excluding items th at have no relations with
University, Industry or Government. Therefore, w e used M = 22- 1 = 3 for the tw o dimensional system and M -

23- l

= 7 for the three-dimensional one.

In the example below, U, I, G represent the sectorial output of University only,
Industry only and G overnm ent only respectively; it means the joint output of tw o or
m ore sectors are excluded; Ul, UG, IG and UIG are the jo in t output o f tw o or m ore
sectors. In Table 6-2 and Table 6-3, only U, I, G, Ul, UG, IG and UIG data w ere taken
from the sources indicated above. Particularly, the tw o dimensional data (U, I and Ul
in Table 6-2) are derived from original data in Table 6-3 following data correction
process indicated in the two-dim ensional case in Appendix 4.
Table 6-2 shows th at the overlay betw een U and I operates largely in South Korea (TU(
= 553.796 millibits). This country has the most efficient University-lndustry system
with T) = 0.380; it is followed by the USA (r| = 0.319) and UK (ri = 0.273). W est Africa is
at the rear (r| = 0.034), following China [r\ = 0.126), Brazil (r\ = 0.153) and Russia (r\ =
0.16 9). Even though W est Africa has the least efficient system, it occupies th e second
place after South Korea with respect to the transmission power (x = 0.704); it means
th a t the region o f W est Africa devoted 70% o f its inform ation capacity production to
cooperation

or

inform ation

flow

betw een

involved

actors.

Regarding

the

transmission power, UK is at the rear, with an efficiency equal to 34.9%.
If the South Korean University-lndustry system seems to be the most efficient; it is
however less independent because it has the highest transmission power (x = 0.919);
the second least independent system is the W est African. The most independent is
the UK's system (x = 0.349), followed by the Brazilian (x = 0.355). Globally, the W est

147

African University-lndustry system is too weak: entropy negligible, efficiency near to
0 and unused capacity closer to 1. From a statistical point of view, this means that
the "message" the W est African system S = (U, I) produces doesn't contain more
inform ation,

because

entropy

measures

uncertainty and

uncertainty

contains

inform ation (Shannon, 1948). The situation may be explained by the weakness of the
research output of the industrial sector. Indeed, data revealed th at in the region, U
produces much and I less; as a result, the proportion o f the industrial sector output
reported to th at of the University is marginal. Therefore, it is certain that I w on't
publish much and unlikely U will enough. As a consequence, the uncertainty in the
system is largely reduced, the generated entropy is weak and the unused capacity
increases.
The University-Industry-Government system data (Table 6-3) exhibits synergy among
the three actors; indeed, the transmission is negative for all countries. However, the
synergy operates more in South Korea (TUfG = - 253.382 millibits) than elsewhere;
India and USA come far behind with TmG = - 78.106 millibits and T uiG = - 74.417
millibits respectively. China is at the rear with TU]G = - 14.934 millibits, following W est
Africa (TU]G = - 16.631 millibits), Brazil (TU!G = - 22.438 millibits) and Russia (TuiG = -

24.206 millibits). The most efficient UIG system is the French one (n = 0.668).
Regarding the transmission power, USA devoted the largest part of its information
capacity production to the synergy between the Triple Helix spheres; indeed, its
transmission power is the highest (x = Xi= 0.299). It is followed by South Korea (x = Ti=

0.286), UK (x = Xi=0.211), Germany (x = xa = 0.186) and France (x = Xi = 0.184). W est
Africa and China have the lowest transmission power values (x = Xi = 0.026 and x = Xi=
0.054 respectively).
The W est African UIG system exhibits a null synergy or a null information flow
betw een

innovation actors; China's system oscillates between

null and weak

inform ation flow; all the other countries or group o f countries (EU, UK, Germany,
France, Russia, India, and Brazil) have a weak University-Industry-Government
system w ith respect to the transmission power. Only USA and South Korea show a
m oderate information flow between innovation actors. Except South Korea that
positions among W estern countries, the transmission power seems to operate a
division o f the selected countries into tw o parts: the developed countries led by the
USA, on the one hand, and the developing ones led by India, on the other hand. This
ranking of South Korea may be due to the source o f data which is the Internet
whereas the other countries1 data were retrieved from W eb of Science databases.
Even though India has a transmission higher than that of USA, the transmission
pow er of the USA's system is higher.

In a tw o dimensional system, the transmission's lower and upper limits are 0 and HXY,
so th at
0 < TXy < H xy

(6-23)

6.7.1. Transmission is null ( T x y

=

0)

The transmission is null if and only if the tw o variables are independent (Cover &
Thomas,

2006; Yeung, 2001,

p. 24,

2008). The first example considers tw o

independent and identically distributed variables. Thus, the four events 'N either X
nor Y produce' (X = 0, Y = 0), 'X doesn't produce but Y does' (X = 0, Y = 1), 'X produces
but Y doesnât' (X = 1, Y = 0) and 'Both X and Y produce' (X = 1, Y = 1) have the same
probability, so th a t the four atoms generated by the subsets engendered by the
random variables have (approximately) the same cardinality. Concretely, it means
th at in a tw o-dim ensional system S = (U, I), the events 'U only produces' (U), 'I only
produces' (I), 'U and I produce jointly' (Ul) and 'N either U nor I produce' (0 ) have
(approxim ately) the same num ber of items (e.g. p = ^). Because the alphabet o f the
source counts four elem ents (U, I, Ul and 0 ), the maximum value of the entropy is
H,â¢ = log24 = 2. Therefore, the events are identically distributed, thus, Hs = Hui = Hmax.
Then follow:

p( U = 1) = p( I = 1) = p( U = 0) = p( I = 0) = i

The second example relates to the University-lndustry system on the one hand and
the Industry-Government one on the other hand drawn from the trilateral UniversityIndustry-Governm ent relationship in six58 W est African M em b er States (M egnigbeto,
2014b, 2014c). In these systems 'other'59 produced, University or Governm ent

Hui = Hu, H,G = HG, and Tui = T ig = 0. The variables are independent; Hmax = log24 = 2
bits, transmission power equals zero, relative unused capacity and efficiency vary
according to sectorial outputs.

6.7.2. Transmission equals system's entropy ( T x y

= H

xy)

The transmission reaches the system's entropy HXY means th at TXY = HXY.
Adding Txy âT xy to the right term of Equation (6-3) leads to
= Hx + Hy - Txy + Txy - Txy

(6-24)

Hxy = (H x - TXY) + (H Y - TXY) + Txy

(6-25)

h xy

and

Because HXY = TXY, w e can w rite
(H x - TXY) + (H y - Txy) + Txy = TXY

(6-26)

which is equivalent to
(H x - T xy) + (H y - T xy) = 0
But (H x â T x y ) = H X|Y and

(6-27)
(H y â TXY) = H Y|X. Besides, HX|Y and HY|X are all

positive or null; therefore, their sum is null ifand only if each o f them . Thus,
fHX|y = H x - Txy = 0
(6-28)
kHY|X = HY - T xy = 0
System o f equations (6-28) admits 7 solutions (cf. Appendix 5): i) there is no output in
the system (Table 13-10, #1), ii) only one event occurs among the four possible,
(Table 13-10, #2-5), iii) each of the variables produce separately only (Table 13-10,
#6), iv) other produces and the tw o variables produces jointly (Table 13-10, #7). This
case also is illustrated by six W est Africa States' University-lndustry or IndustryGovernm ent systems data (M egnigbeto, 2014b, 2014c); The South Korea Universitylndustry system in 1999 (Khan & Park, 2011) is a second illustration.60 Then, marginal
entropies, system's entropy and transmission are all equal, transmission power is 1
but efficiency and unused capacity vary depending on variables' value.

60 U = 21, I = 23, O = 0 and Ul = 0. HU( = Hy = H, = Tu, = 0.999 bits, transm ission po w e r = 1 and relative
unused capacity = 0.501 (M = 4) o r 0.632 (M = 3).

152

6.8. IndicatorsattheboundstothetransmissioninatriÂ­
dimensional system
A three-dim ensional transmission has HXYz - Hx - HY - Hz as lower bound and HXYz as
upper one. The low er bound is negative and the upper one positive; th at reflects the
possible negativity o f the transmission. The resulting inequality Hxyz - Hx - HY - Hz <
Txyz ^ Hxyz can be split into tw o others taking into account the transmission's sign.
They are: HXYZ - Hx - HY - Hz < TXYZ < 0 and 0 < TXYZ < HXYZ. Therefore, w e distinguish
three cases below: i) TXYZ = - Hx - Hy - HZ/ ii)T XYZ= HXYZand iii)TXYZ = 0.

6.8.1. Transmission equals system's entropy minus sum of sectorial
entropies (Txyz - Hxyz-H x - H y - Hz)
Equation (6-5) gives:
H x yz =
H xyz

Hx + H Y + H z - TXY - Txz - TYZ + TXYZ. Thus,

â HX â H y â Hz = âTxy â Txz â Tyz +

Txyz

(6-29)

The left term o f Equation (6-29) is the low er bound to TXYZ
If Txyz takes this value, then w e can write:
T xyz

-

~ T xy - TXz ~

T Yz

(6-30)

+ Txyz

Thus,

âTxy â Txz â Tyz = 0

(6-31)

Knowing th at the bilateral transmissions are null or greater than 0, it comes that
âTx y - Txz - Tyz = 0 if and only if bilateral transmissions Txy, Txz and T ^ are all null,
e.g. the random variables X, Y, Z are pairwise independent. Figure 6-3 gives an
illustration.

Let us consider a University-lndustry-Government

relationships system

where

individual actors' outputs are null (U = I = G = 0), the joint output UIG also is null (UIG
= 0) but bilateral outputs and 'other' have (likely) the same value (Ul = UG = IG = 0 =
a, a > 0). Let us consider the bilateral system S = (U, I) drawn from this threedimensional one. W e need first to compute the right output of U, I and Ul in the two
dimensional system following the method given by Megnigbeto (2014a, 2014c).
U2 = U3 + UG3 = 0 + a = a;
l2 = l3 + IG3 = 0 + a = a;
Ul2 = Ul3 + UIG3 = a + 0 = a;
0 = a.
Hence, in the two-dim ensional system S = (U, I), the outputs are U = I = Ul = 0 = a (a
> 0), which refers to a tw o dimensional system case studied above where TXY = 0 and
the four events involved are independent and identically distributed. In conclusion, in
each tw o dimensional system derived from the tri-dimensional one, the transmission
is null, the system's entropy reaches its maximum value (2 bits), and marginal
entropies are each equal to 1 bit. Therefore, in the tri-dimensional system, marginal
entropies are equal to 1 bit, bilateral entropies are equal to 2 bits, bilateral
transmissions are null. The considered system is composed with 4 events (Ul, UG, IG
and O) th at produce each the same num ber of units. Therefore,
H u ig = I i ( - ; x lo g 2 J ) =

- 4 x i x l o g 2 J = lo g 24 =

By applying the formula in Equation (6-6), we get T^ g = - 1 bit. Data are summarized

6.8.2. Transmission equals system's entropy (Txyz = Hxyz)
Let us consider Equation (6-5):
H xyz =

H x + H Y + H z - TXY - Txz - TYZ + TXYZ

If Txyz = HXyz then it comes that
HXyz = HX + HY + Hz â TXY â Txz â TYZ + HXYZ

(6-32)

That is Hx + Hy + Hz â Txy - Txz - TYZ = 0

(6-33)

and
(H x - Txy) + (H y - Tyz) + (H z - Txz) = 0

(6-34).

Similarly, w e can w rite from Equation (19)
(H x - Txz) + (H y - Txy) + (H z - Tyz) = 0

(6-35)

W ith a logical reasoning analogous to th at in 2 dimensions above, we get
HX|y = Hx - Txy = 0
HY|z â Hy â Tyz = 0

(6-36)

kHZ|X = Hz = Txz - 0
or
rH X|Z = Hx â TXZ = 0
HY|x â Hy - TXY = 0

(6-37)

^HZ|Y = Hz â Tyz â 0
The systems of Equations (6-36) and (6-37) are equivalent (Appendix 6).
The system o f Equation (6-36) leads to
/'Hx = Txy
Hy = Tyz

(6-38)

( H z = Txz
The System of Equations (6 -3 8 ) admits 12 solutions (Appendix 7): i) there is no
output in the system (Table 13-11, #1), ii) only one event occurs (Table 13-11, #2-9),
iii) one variable produce and the other tw o produce jointly only (Table 13-11, #1012). In the cases w here all eventsâ cardinality is null if only one event occurs, the
system entropy and transmission, marginal entropies, bilateral entropies, bilateral
155

transmissions are all null; consequently, efficiency is null, unused capacity equals 1
and transmission power is null, by definition. In the case w here one sectors produces
and the tw o other sector produce jointly, the system's entropy, the system's
transmission, marginal entropies, bilateral entropies, bilateral transmissions are all
equal; consequently, transmission power is one. However, unused capacity and
efficiency vary according to the variables. Figure 6-4 is an illustration.

6.8.3. The transmission is null ( T x y z = 0)
If the transmission is null, the three variables are mutually independent. The first
illustration is the theoretical case w here the three variables are independent and
identically distributed. Therefore, the eight atoms of the universal set have the same
cardinality so th at corresponding events have the same probability. Concretely, it
means th at in a three dimensional system S = (U, I, G), the events U, I, G, Ul, UG, IG,
UIG and O produce the same or approximately the same number of items (e.g. p =
^). Therefore, the maximum value of the entropy is Hmax = HU)G = log28 = 3 bits.

Hy = H, = H g = - - l o g 2- - - l o g 2- = 1 b it

Hui = Hug = H[0 = 4 x ^ - l i 0g2i ) = 2 x log22 = 2 bits
Bilateral transmission are null; fo r example Tyl = HG + H, -

H^ = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0.

Consequently, Hu,G = HG + H, + HG = 3 bits. Therefore, efficiency equal 1, relative
unused capacity is null; as transmission is null, transmission power as well.
The second illustration consists o f examples from the W est African States cases
(Table 6-5). Six of them have a null industrial output, so Ul, IG and UIG are null. Tu,G is
null, but not all bilateral transmissions. Figure 6-5 illustrates this case as well. These
156

results contrast w ith the consequence of variables independency theorem stating
th a t when at a system's level the transmission is null, variables are mutually
independent and also pairwise independent (Yeung, 2001, pp. 1 2 5 -1 2 7 , 2008).
Accordingly, we should have bilateral transmissions equal 0; th at is not the case.
According to Leydesdorff (2014), this happens because the m utual inform ation in
three or m ore dimensions is not a Shannon-type inform ation. Krippendorff (2014)
claims th a t this is a proof th a t algebra is not able to get unique interactions among
th ree or m ore variables for the simple reason th at probabilities do not take care of
circular interactions which begin w ith th ree or more variables (Krippendorff, 2009a,
2009b).

6.10. Discussion and conclusion
In the scientific literature, the quantity we defined as unused capacity is called
redundancy and the relative unused capacity called relative redundancy (Cover &
Thomas, 2006; M ori, 2006; Yeung, 2001, 2008). Leydesdorff (2010a) and Leydesdorff
and Ivanova (2014) defined redundancy as the fraction o f the capacity that is not
used; besides, they recognized th at this definition may seem counterintuitive
because redundancy is intuitively associated w ith the overlapping inform ation. In our
opinion, the system has the capacity to produce information up to Hmax, but really
produces Hs. Therefore, Hmax- Hs is unproduced. It may be called redundancy only if it
w ere really produced but didn't serve in communication. Besides, Leydesdorff and
Ivanova (2014) assumed th at the redundancy R = Hmax- Hs equals the transmission in
absolute size; they also dem onstrated that when the number of dimensions is even,
redundancy and transmission have opposite signs and have both the same sign
otherwise. That is RXy = - TXY (in case of a tw o dimensional system) and RXYz = TXYz in a
three-dim ensional system. If R is negative in a two-dimensional system, it comes out
th at Hmax is lower than Hs, which is mathematically absurd. Furthermore, according to
our com putation (Table 6-9), the tw o quantities R and T^ or T UK5 do not exhibit any
equality.

W e s t Africa

In this chapter, we showed th at any information source composed with n random
variables of which each has the alphabet {0,1} may be split into M = 2n events. W e
computed the maximum entropy of the system and derived indicators like the
efficiency, the unused capacity and the transmission power of the system. W e
defined the efficiency o f a system as the fraction of its information production
capacity th at is really produced. The relative unused capacity is the fraction of the
160

capacity of the system th at is not used for inform ation production. The transmission
pow er measures the efficiency of the mutual information; it indicates how strong the
inform ation flow or the control exerted within the system is. Particularly, in case
w here the relations are reduced to the Triple Helix actors' output only, the n-tuple
{0}n is excluded leading to M = 2n - 1. W e computed these indicators for data taken
from the scientific literature or directly from the W eb of Science's databases and
related to different countries or regions. W ith such indicators, a same system may be
compared over tim e; different systems may also be compared.
W e also found out tw o - and three-dim ensional configurations w here

mutual

inform ation reaches its bounds and com puted efficiency, unused capacity and
transmission power for such systems as well as for some particular cases.
The two-dim ensional transmission reaches its upper bound, if there is no output
w ithin the system, only one actor produces (other included), or if other produces and
the tw o

actors produce jointly. The three-dim ensional transmission takes its

maximum value if there is no output within the system, or if only one actor produce
(other included) or if one actor produces and the other tw o actors produced jointly.
M utual inform ation in a two-dimensional system is null if the tw o variables are
independent; in a three dimensional system, the mutual inform ation is null is the
three variables are m utually independent; however, this doesn't m eant th a t the
variables

are

pairwise

independent.

In

a three

dimensional

system,

mutual

inform ation reaches its lower bound if variables are pairwise independent. For these
cases, transmission power is either null or 1, entropies, unused capacity or efficiency
vary according to the system configuration.
In a two-dim ensional system where other is not considered and the tw o actors
produce separately equally as they produce jointly, the system's entropy is invariant,
bilateral entropies are invariant and equal, transmission power equal 0.159. In a
three-dim ensional system w here all events have the same probability and other not
considered, entropies and transmission are invariant, transmission power equals

=

0.591. In a three-dim ensional system where all events have the same probability, the
jo in t output of the three actors is null and other not considered, entropies and
transmission are invariant, and transmission power equals Tj= 1.
Efficiency, relative unused capacity and transmission power ranges from 0 to 1. Their
interpretation may be inspired from practices in association coefficients: they may be
said null or negligible if their value is low er or equal to 0.05 (or 5%); if th eir value is
over 0.05 and less than 0.25 (25%), they are weak; they are m oderate if their value is
betw een 0.25 and 0.60 (25% and 60%); over 0.6 (e. g 60%), they may be said strong.
The reflections above may be extended to four or more dimensions; for example,
one may consider internationally co-authored documents as Leydesdorff and Sun
(2009) did, or also distinguish these types o f collaboration into 'foreign University',
'foreign Industry' or 'foreign Governm ent' and assess international Triple Helix actors
influence on a country or region's economic performance. These reflections may also

161

apply to any field of collaboration betw een University, Industry and Government, and
not only to research output, for example funding, grants, etc.
W e also made the equivalence between "events have the same probability" and the
"associated sets have the same cardinality". In fact, the associated set to events may
have likely the same cardinality; the result is approximately identic. For example, in
case of a tw o dimensional system, if the four cardinalities are 100, 98, 96, and 94
yields the same indicators as all four cardinalities are equal to 100.

7. Information flow within the West African innovation
systems
W e use the mutual inform ation and the transmission pow er as indicators of
knowledge circulation betw een innovation actors. The unit o f analysis is scientific
publications indexed in W eb of Science with at least one W est African-based address.
W e find th at at the regional level, University is the biggest knowledge producer
followed by G overnm ent and Industry in that order; however, at the national level,
G overnm ent is the biggest information producer in the m ajority o f countries.
Industrial sector output is w eak both at the regional level and individual countries
level. It is even null in some countries. The mutual inform ation indicated the
existence o f synergy betw een the three actors, both at the regional and the national
level. However, its value is too low to allow knowledge circulating fluently among
actors.
The text is based on a brief communication published in ISSI New sletter (Megnigbeto,
2014b) and an article published in the Triple Helix Journal (M egnigbeto, 2014c).

7.1. Introduction
The role of University, Industry and Governm ent has been changing fo r recent
decades; university does not only teach and do research but can com pete w ith firms
as well, for example as far as call for tends, bids or services are concerned;
Governm ent does not only set up rules, watch over their respect, fund and collect
taxes but can also institute administrative body to do research or participate to firms
capital; Industry does not only output services, processes and products for the
com m unity but can conduct research for their im provem ent. Each sector is taking the
role o f another. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff elaborated, on this basis, the Triple Helix
concept th at represents the necessary dynamics among the three sectors (cf.
Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 1995, 2000; Leydesdorff & Etzkowitz, 2001). If research
activities exploit existing knowledge and produce new ones, knowledge circulation
betw een

University and

Industry

ensures its transform ation

into

innovation.

Innovation takes an im portant place in industrial developm ent, economic growth and
w ealth production. There is a positive correlation betw een the levels o f research and
developm ent activities, the level of absorptive capacity and the pool of knowledge
th at can be exploited (M ueller, 2006, p. 1500). Hence, knowledge flow betw een
actors can indicate a society's level of developm ent and the self-organization.
The Oslo M anual (OECD & EUROSTAT, 2005, p. 46) defines innovation as Â«the
im plem entation o f a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or
process, a new m arketing m ethod, or a new organisational m ethod in business
practices, workplace organisation or external relationsÂ». In other words, innovation
supposes new things, new ways of doing, creativity, added value. In the Triple Helix
model, innovation results from interactions betw een three main actors: University,
Industry and Governm ent (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 1995, 2000). Research and
163

innovation can be measured; collaboration for research and innovation too (OECD,
2010; OECD & EUROSTAT, 2005; Serbanica, 2011). Leydesdorff (2003) introduces the
m utual inform ation as an indicator of the Triple Helix o f relations betw een University
Industry and Governm ent, based on the Shannon's (1948) notion of entropy and
Megnigbeto (2014a) proposed transmission power as the efficiency of the mutual
inform ation. The mutual inform ation indicates the synergy or information flow
betw een innovation actors and transmission power the strength o f information flow
w ithin a system or betw een its actors. Transmission power may help in measuring
the level of synergy, the pressure or the control exerted within the system.
W est Africa, one of the five African regions as determ ined by the African Union,61
counts 15 countries (listed alphabetically as follows: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote
d'Ivoire, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, M ali, Nigeria,
Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo). All the W est African countries are together
m em ber o f the Economic Community of W est African States (ECOWAS), a regional
economic integration organisation. In early 2012, the region adopted the ECOWAS
Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST) that recognized the role of science,
technology and innovation in regional integration and life conditions improvement.
From their independence early 1960s to the end of the Cold W ar (end of 1980s),
African States and hence almost all the ECOWAS M em bers States w ere ruled by
single-party authoritarian regimes with central control and a state monopoly in all
sectors o f the economy. The fall of the Berlin W all in 1989 had changed geopolitical
strategies at international level, mainly in W estern countries, so most of the
developing countries w ere forced to switch over to democracy with a liberalized
political and economic system. W est Africa integration institutions and M em ber
States have recognized democracy as a system that sustains peace, stability,
economic growth, social and economic developm ent and a condition to regional
integration

(ECOWAS

Commission,

2011b)

and

com m itted

to

"deepen

and

strengthen the democratic institutions using appropriate international standards"
w ith an "ECOWAS o f people" as target.
The

Triple

Helix of

University-lndustry-Government

relationships

ensures the

knowledge flow among the three sectors and contributes to economic growth and
hence to social and economic developm ent. Through innovation and the renewal of
the political economy and social structure, the Triple Helix is the key to knowledgebased economic developm ent (Leydesdorff & Etzkowitz, 2001) because knowledge
creation, flows and capitalisation are also im portant elements in stimulating
economic developm ent and contributes to regional growth (M ueller, 2006). The aim
of this chapter is to measure knowledge flow between innovation actors in the W est
African region. Our research question is: how does information circulate among

164

innovation actors in W est Africa? For this purpose, w e use mutual information and
transmission power as indicators.

7.2. Literaturereview
The exploitation of knowledge requires it to be produced, circulate and be acquired
(M ueller, 2006, p. 1500). Â§erbanica (2011, p. 46) gave an overview of knowledge
circulation indicators; she distinguished funding flow

(in the

form

of grants,

donations and contracts), cooperation, strategic partnerships, co-publications, and
patents statistics. Research collaboration has become an indicator of scientific
collaboration (Abbassi et al., 2012; Bordons & Gomez, 2000; Katz & M artin, 1997;
Olm eda-Gom ez e t al., 2008). Co-authorship is often used as m easurem ent of it
mainly in academia, and an evidence of tacit transfer of information and knowledge
as well. Several publications studied co-authorship w orldwide (e.g. Adams, 2012;
Adams e t al., 2014; Bordons & Gomez, 2000) or in Africa (e.g. Adams et al., 2014;
Adams et al., 2010; Boshoff, 2009, 2010; Megnigbeto, 2013e; Onyancha & Maluleka,
2011b; Tijssen, 2007; Toivanen & Ponomariov, 2011). They all reported an increasing
trend in the num ber of authors who contributed to an article; some of them
underlined the concentration of the growth in the group of papers w ith 5 or more
authors, lending strong importance to collaboration. Globally, co-authorship has
exploded

recently

(Adams,

2012)

and

internationalisation

of

collaboration

characterizes science today (Adams, 2013).
Num ber o f studies used citations analysis (e.g. Onyancha & Maluleka, 2011b;

Megnigbeto (2013g) fo r W est Africa and Etzkowitz and Dzisah (2007) for the whole
Africa; in 2012, the Association of African Universities conducted a survey on
University-lndustry linkages in Africa in order to determ ine w hat interface structures,
policies, positions, incentives, and funding avenues are currently in place (or lacking)
and w hat services or interventions African institutions themselves gauge to be most
im portant for strengthening their efforts (Ssebuwufu et al., 2012). The above studies
on Africa described and analysed relationships betw een University, Industry and
Governm ent; in addition, M egnigbeto (2013g) discussed the inform ation flow
betw een Triple Helix actors in W est Africa; but he based his study on mutual
inform ation only which is not suitable for comparison; contrary, the transmission
pow er is (M egnigbeto, 2014a). So, how does the transmission power measures
inform ation circulation within W est African innovation systems?

165

7.3. Dataandmethods
7.3.1. Data collection
The elaboration of the Triple Helix thesis lays on collaboration between University,
Industry, and Government. O f course, collaboration may cover several aspects and
not all collaboration yields publications. In this chapter however, we focus on
research collaboration understood as co-authorship. W e downloaded W est African
scientific publications data from Thomson Reuters' W eb o f Science over a ten-year
period (2001-2010). The databases selected were Science Citation Index Expanded
(SCI-EXPANDED), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), Conference
Proceedings Citation Index- Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH) and Index
Chemicus (1C). The search expression was cu=benin or cu=cote ivoire or cu=niger or
cu=senegal or cu=cape verde or cu=gambia or cu=ghana or cu=nigeria or cu=togo or
cu=mali or cu=liberia or cu=sierra leone or cu=guinea or cu=burkina faso or
cu=guinea-bissau. The 28,380 resulting records were downloaded and imported into
a bibliographic database managed with the CDS/ISIS62 software application. Based on
Leydesdorff s (2003) method for label assignment to addresses, we coded a CDS/ISIS
Pascal63 programme that assigned each address the label âUniversity1 (abbreviated
UNIV, âIndustryâ (abbreviated INDU) or âGovernm entâ (abbreviated GOV) to each
address. A record may contain many addresses; therefore, one record may have two
or more different labels. The CDS/ISIS programme was also instructed to read the
countries' name from the addresses and automatically add the associated tw o
characters ISO codes to the label. Non-W est African countries w ere given unique
identifiers ZZ. Therefore, in the inverted file, a university in Benin appears under the
label UNIV-BJ, an enterprise in a non-West African country appears under INDU-ZZ.
The CDS/ISIS search function operates mainly over the inverted file that contains
"searchable terms" as previously defined by the database administrator upon a field.
It admits the Boolean operators OR symbolized by the sign + (plus), AND symbolized
by the character * (star) and NOT symbolized by the ch aracterA (circumflex). W e run
searches over the CDS/ISIS database using key-words composed of each country
names and Triple Helix actors' codes. For examples, the searches expressions (1) to
(7) w ere conducted for Benin:
(1) UNIV-BJ: retrieves all records University in Benin authored;
(2) INDU-BJ: retrieves all records Industry in Benin authored;
(3) GOV-BJ: retrieves all records Government in Benin authored;
(4) UNIV-BJ * INDU-BJ retrieves all records University and Industry in Benin coÂ­
authored;

62 C D S -IS IS is text database management software developed and distributed by U N E S C O (1989a).
83 CDS/ISIS provides a program m ing language "designed to develop CDS/ISIS applications req uiring
fun ctions w hich are n o t readily available in th e standard package" (UNESCO, 1989b). This program m ing
language enables users to extend fun ctions o f th e standard package, to make it m ore robust and in
o rd e r to m eet users' specific needs (M egnigbeto, 1998).

INDU-BJ * GOV-BJ retrieves all records University, Industry and

G overnm ent in Benin co-authored.
Finally, the contribution of each actor was computed as follows (according to the
Venn diagram in Figure 7-1):
U = (1) - (4) - (5) + (7): num ber of publications University only authored;
I = (2) - (4) - (6) + (7): num ber of publications Industry only authored;
G = (3) - (5) - (6) + (7): num ber of publications Governm ent only authored;
Ul = (4) - (7): num ber o f publications University and Industry only co-authored;
UG = (5) - (7): num ber of publications University and Governm ent only co-authored;
IG = (6) - (7): num ber of publications University and Industry only co-authored;
UIG = (7): num ber of publications University, Industry and Governm ent co-authored.
Such searches and com putation w ere run for individual countries and then for the
w hole region.

7.3.2. Entropy, mutual information, efficiency and transmission power
Shannon (1948, p. 394) defined the entropy of an event that occurs w ith the
probability p as:

H = - p x log2p - (1 - p) x log2( l - p)

(7-1)

w here log2 is the logarithm to the base 2; the entropy may however be computed to
other bases e .g .3 ,4 ,..., 10). M o re generally, if X = ( x i , x 2, - , x n) is a random variable
and its components occur w ith the probabilities P i,p 2, ...,p n respectively, then the
entropy generated by X is (cf. Shannon, 1948; Shannon & W eaver, 1949, p. 14)
Hx =

(7-2)

- Â£ â= i P i x k > g 2 Pi

167

An inform ation source is a random variable that produces symbols (Cover & Thomas,
2006; Le Boudec et al., 2013, p. 8; M ori, 2006; Shannon, 1948, p. 392). An
inform ation source may also be composed of tw o or more random variables. For tw o
random variables X and Y (tw o dimensions), if Hx is the entropy of X and HY th at of Y,
the joint entropy HXYof the tw o variables is equal to the entropy Hx plus HY minus the
entropy o f the overlay of X and Y. The latter is called "rate of transmission" (Shannon,
1948, p. 407) or mutual inform ation (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Leydesdorff, 2003;
M ori, 2006; Yeung, 2001, 2008) between X and Y. The relations between the
transmission, TXY, the joint entropy HXY and the marginal entropies of the variables, Hx
and HY,a re (Shannon, 1948, p. 409):
Hx y =

H x + H y - T xy

(7 -3 )

Hx +

(7 -4 )

and
Txy =

H y - H xy

In case of three random variables X, Y and Z (three dimensions), Leydesdorff (2 0 0 3 )64
demonstrated th at the relations between the system's entropy, its transmission, the
marginal entropies and the bilateral transmissions are given by
h xyz

= H x + H Y + H z - Txy - Txz - Tyz + Txyz

(7-5)

and
Txyz =

Hx

-I-

H Y + H z â H XY â HYZ â H xz +

(7 -6 )

The transmission or the mutual information may be used as innovation indicator.
According to Leydesdorff (2003), in more than tw o dimensions, if the transmission is
negative, it indicates the level o f synergy or information flow betw een variables; if it
is positive, it indicates how centrally controlled is the system; a null transmission
means an absence o f interactions between variables. However, Krippendorff (2009a,
2009b) claims th at mutual information doesn't measure the unique interactions in a
complex system and a null transmission could not be interpreted as absence of
interaction within a system.
M egnigbeto (2014a) defined the efficiency of a system as the fraction of its
inform ation production capacity that is really produced; relative unused capacity is
the com plem ent to 1 of the efficiency; the transmission power o f a system is the
fraction of the maximum value o f the transmission devoted to information sharing in
the system. It represents the share of the "total configurational information" really
produced in the system. In other words, it measures the efficiency of the mutual
inform ation. All the three indicators vary from 0 to 1; they all are dimensionless and
may be expressed as a percentage.

In a three-dim ensional one, tw o types of transmission power are distinguished
(M egnigbeto, 2014a, p. 287): the first one (xi) when the transmission is negative, and

7.4. Results
7.4.1. Sectorial outputs and collaboration data
University produced 82.82% o f papers, Governm ent 41.09% , and Industry 1.07%.
Research institutions th a t do not fall under the above categories include NGOs,
national or international associations; they account for 3.80%. If data are restricted
to W est African-based institutions, University produces 67.45% of papers, Industry
0.52% and Governm ent 31.69%; not classified institutions' share rises to 11.46%. The
breakdown o f records with W est African-based addresses per year and Triple Helix
actor alongside w ith th eir combinations are given in Table 7-1. Annual data show the
same trend and confirm University (U) as the biggest science producer. Due to the
effect o f the Boolean operator AND, University and Governm ent (UG) produce jointly
m ore than

University and

Industry (Ul) on the one

hand

and

Industry and

G overnm ent (IG) on the other hand; the double Boolean operator makes the joint
output o f the three sector (UIG) smaller; these results confirm the findings o f (Khan &
Park, 2011). At national levels however (Table 7-2), Governm ent is the biggest
inform ation producer, ahead University and Industry in 12 countries; even some
countries (Benin, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, M ali and Niger) have no industrial
output. Globally, the industrial sector's output is weak both at regional and national
level, which indicates th at the sector didn't use to do research in W est Africa.

7.4.2. Knowledge flow between actors
W e used mutual inform ation (Leydesdorff, 2003), efficiency and transmission power
(M egnigbeto, 2014a) as measurements of knowledge circulation among the Triple
Helix actors. The unit o f analysis is publications. The regional University-lndustryG overnm ent system data are output in Table 7-3. The entropy (H uiG) ranges from
1.207 bits in 2009 to its highest value (1.367 bits) in 2003; no trend is depicted over
the period (Figure 7-2). It comes that, from 2001 to 2010, the W est African
innovation system produced less than half its capacity; indeed, annual efficiencies (r|)
are lower than one half, ranging from 43% to 48%. Annual transmissions (Tu,G) are
negative indicating synergy among actors; in other words, the system is not centrally
controlled over the studied period of times; however the interactions betw een actors
are too low and cannot ensure b etter knowledge circulation. Indeed, transmission
varies from -13 to -32 millibits; and, as a consequence, transmission power (x) ranges
169

from 0 .026 to 0.0S7 meaning that 3 to 6% o f the system's information sharing
capacity was really used. In other words, much information doesn't circulate among
innovation actors in W est Africa. Synchronous data (Table 7-3, Row Total) reveals
th a t the W est African innovations system products 1.301

bits of information

representing 46% o f its capacity; the synergy is evaluated to - 19 millibits that is 4%
of the inform ation sharing capacity.
The comparison of bilateral transmissions (TU(, TUG and T|G) reveals that w hatever the
year is, the entropy of University-Government system (HUG) is higher than that of
University-lndustry system (Hui) which in turn is higher than th at of IndustryGovernm ent system (H,G); the system's entropy (H uiG) is the highest (Figure 7-2).
Entropy measures uncertainty; when the transmission (Tu,G) is negative, it contributes
to the reduction of the uncertainty th at prevails at the system level (Leydesdorff,
2003). In Equation (7-6), the right term groups entropies, thus positive values;
however, bilateral entropies are affected with the negative sign; therefore, the
higher they are, the m ore negative the transmission. In other words, bilateral
entropies contribute to the reduction of the uncertainty at the system level. In the
case o f the W est African innovation system, HUG > HU( > H,G over 2001-2010 (Figure
7-2); we conclude th at at the tri-lateral system level, the University-Government
relations contribute m ore to the uncertainty reduction than the other tw o bilateral
systems.
At national levels, because industrial output is null in some countries, Hui and HG on
the one hand and H,G and HG on the other hand are equal; therefore, the
transmission betw een the industrial sector and the tw o others are null as far as these
countries are concerned. In the remaining countries, Tui and T,G are weak (0.1 to 10
millibits). W hatever the country is, HUG is greater than Hui and H,G, TUG than T^ and
T,s. The national system with the highest entropy is the Sierra Leonean (H uiG = 1.387
bits) and the one with the lowest value is the Gambian (H uiG = 0.359 bits). Cape Verde
has the highest transmission (T uig = - 217 millibits) and the six countries with 0 output
for industrial sector has a null transmission. Gambia has however the less efficient
system (r) = 13%) and Ghana the most efficient one (ri = 55%). O ut o f the nine
countries with a non-null transmission, Cap Verde has the highest transmission
power (x = Ti = 0.245) and Burkina Faso the lowest (x = t i = 0.010). These data
suggest th at the am ount of knowledge that circulates among actors is larger in Cape
Verde than elsewhere in W est Africa, and that the Cape-Verdean innovation system
share more inform ation among its actors than elsewhere.

7.5. Discussion
Among the 15 W est African M em ber States, six has no industrial output; over the
remaining, tw o (Ghana and Nigeria) exhibit relationships betw een Industry and
G overnm ent on the hand and Industry and University on the other hand; but the
jo in t collaboration between the three actors occurs only in Nigeria. These results
170

show th a t there is no tradition in industrial research in the region. Indeed, the W est
African industrial sector is facing a num ber of problems that make less than half its
capacity is really used (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a; Megnigbeto, 2013g). The
numerous untapped underground and mineral resources the region is endowed with
are exported rather than processed locally (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a), so final
products are mainly conceived out o f Africa and not for African. Consequently, local
Industry doesn't need research activities to improve products, processes or services.

In the countries with null industrial output, the bilateral transmissions Ty, and T,G are
null; further, the trilateral transmission TyiG is null. These results suggest that
regarding research output, there is no knowledge transfer between industrial sector
and the tw o others on the one hand and on the other hand, there is no information
transfer between

the three

actors. Only

Nigeria and Ghana show

industrial

collaboration w ith University (U) and Governm ent (G) sectors; however, Ghana has
no University-lndustry-Government (UIG) relations. These tw o countries have the
higher industrial contribution to Gross domestic product (GDP). On its own, Nigeria
counts one half the region industries and contributed 40% of the regional GDP in
2006 (ECOWAS Commission, 2010a, p. 17), that means industrial activities is better
developed in this country than elsewhere in W est Africa.
It is expected th at University is ranked first with respect to scientific output, because
o f the flow of doctoral students and scholars' publishing activities. At national level,
except Ghana, Nigeria and Togo, University output is lower than governmental one,
presumably because hospital which is also the affiliation o f some scholars, are
categorized into governmental body. However, Nigeria on its own produces half the
regional output (Megnigbeto, 2013a, 2013d, 2013f) and its University share is the
largest compared with other countries; consequently, the regional output is balanced
in favour of University. The ranking of countries with respect to transmission and
transmission power yields the same result, leaving at the rear the six countries with

174

null industrial o utput.65 In comparison with other countries, taking into account a
ten-year period (M egnigbeto, 2014a, pp. 2 8 8 -2 8 9 ), W est Africa performs less than
individual countries like USA, UK, Germany, France, Russia, India, Brazil, and South
Korea for th eir one-year data. Indeed, these countries transmission and transmission
pow er for the year 2001 are respectively - 74.417 millibits and 0.229, - 63.118
millibits and 0.211, - 43.37 millibits and 0.186, - 52.123 millibits and 0.184, - 24.206
millibits and 0.093, - 78.106 millibits and 0.169, - 22.438 millibits and 0.099, and 253.382 millibits and 0.286. The synergy among innovation actors over a ten-year
period in W est Africa based on scientific publications is less than that o f these
countries over one year.
One

may

notice th at for countries with

no industrial output,

and thus

no

collaboration between Industry and other sectors (I = Ul = IG = UIG = 0), the trilateral
transmission (TUIG) is null while not all bilateral transmissions (T^, T UG and T,G) are. In
bilateral relations, transmission

measures the

level o f independence between

variables (cf. Batina e t al., 2011). That is, if tw o variables are independent, the
transmission betw een them is null. If more than tw o random variables are mutually
independent, there are also pairwise independent (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Yeung,
2001, 2008). In a three-dim ensional system, if the system's transmission is null,
therefore, the variable are m utually independent, so there are pairwise independent
(cf. Cover 8i Thomas, 2006; Yeung, 2001, 2008). However, our results show th at in
some cases, the three-dim ensional transmission is null whereas not all bilateral
transmission are (See Appendix 8). Normally, we should get Tu, = Tug = T(G = 0 each
tim e Tuig = 0. Leydesdorff (2014) explained this situation by the fact th at the mutual
inform ation in three or more dimensions is not a Shannon-type information and that
is such a system, loops are involved that may generate redundancies (Leydesdorff,
2014; Leydesdorff &. Ivanova, 2014). Krippendorff (2009a, p. 676) added that
interactions with loops entail positive or negative redundancies; he claimed that this
is a proof algebra is not able to get unique interactions among three or more
variables for the simple raison that probabilities do not take care o f circular
interactions which begin w ith three or more variables (Krippendorff, 2009a, 2009b,
2014).

Leydesdorff and

Park al.

(2014)

supported

however th at the

mutual

inform ation due to the change o f its sign measures both the "the necessarily positive
interaction inform ation and the potentially negative correlational inform ation".
A nother rem ark is th at except the tw o countries with Ul and IG relations (Ghana and
Nigeria, in bold in Table 7-4 w here HUG is less than H uiG, HU!G equals HUG elsewhere. A
m athem atical dem onstration is given in Appendix 8. This result suggests that the
trilateral University-lndustry-Government system operates like a simple bilateral
University-Governm ent one. Therefore, one may expect TU(G to be positive as in the
case of a two-dim ensional system and Tyi equal to T UG, as if the presence of industrial

output or relations w ith University or Government had no effect; but calculations
give T uig ^ 0. Leydesdorff and Ivanova (2014, p. 390) gave an explanation:
A spurious correlation can reduce uncertainty, as when tw o
parents reduce uncertainty for a child by providing mutually
consistent answers to questions. (...). The marriage can be
considered as a latent construct in which the child plays a
role w ithout constituting it. Similarly, in U niversity-lndustryGovernm ent relations, a strong existing relation between tw o
of the partners can make a difference for the third.

7.6. Conclusion
This chapter aimed at measuring knowledge flow between innovation actors in the
W est African region. It uses publications as unit o f analysis and computes data on the
collaboration between the three Triple Helix innovation model actors that are
University, Industry and Government. The publications data w ere collected from
W eb of Science for the 15 W est African countries. W e used the mutual information
and the transmission power as indicators of knowledge flow. These indicators were
computed for both the region and individual countries. W e found that at the regional
level, University is the biggest knowledge producer followed by Government and
Industry in th at order; however, at national level, Governm ent is the biggest
inform ation producer in majority of the countries. Industrial sector output is weak
both at regional and individual countries level. It is even null in some countries.
The mutual inform ation values computed indicated the existence o f synergy between
the three actors, both at regional and national level. However, they are too low to
allow a fluent knowledge circulation among actors; indeed, at the regional level the
mutual inform ation varies from - 32 to - 12 millibits o f information; at individual
countries level, it is null in six countries, takes a value less than - 2 0 millibits in four
countries and more than - 40 millibits in five countries; Cape Verde has the highest
negative mutual information ( - 217 millibits of information). Consequently, the
annual transmission power which indicates the efficiency of the mutual information
has weak values at the regional level (2 to 5%). This indicator showed a large
variation at national level: it is null in the six countries, takes a value less than 10% in
six countries and more than 10% in the three remaining countries, with Cape Verde
having the highest value (25%).
According to Leydesdorff (e.g. 2008, 2010b), the mutual information indicate how
knowledge-based an economy is. W e argue that the transmission power, as an
indicator derived from the mutual information also is a candidate indicator for the
measurem ent of the knowledge-based economy.

176

8. The transmission power and the knowledge-based
economy
The Triple Helix hypothesises that the University-lndustry-Government relationship
maintains a knowledge infrastructure th at allows producing knowledge of which
circulation engenders innovation. Because knowledge is created by researchers,
there is a relation between research and innovation. How does knowledge creation
relate to knowledge economy? In this chapter w e used the transmission pow er as
knowledge sharing indicators. W e test for any relation it has w ith some indicators
used to measure knowledge-based economy. The case study is based on six OECD
countries namely the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and South
Korea.
This chapter is based on conference paper presented at the Journees Scientifiques
Internationales de Lome in 2014 (Megnigbeto, 2014e), a short paper published in ISSI
N ew sletter (M egnigbeto, 2015c) and an article under review (Megnigbeto, under
review).

8.1. Introduction
The

preponderant role knowledge

has been

playing fo r mankind

ended the

traditional economy based on the industrial production; in the same way, it has
inaugurated the post-industrial economy and made intangible assets to be included
in economies performance, so that the term "knowledge-based economy" has been
used to characterize nowadays' economies. According to the Organisation for the
Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), a knowledge-based economy is
the one which is "directly based on the production, distribution and use of
knowledge and inform ation" (OECD, 1996, p. 7). It implies that economic growth,
w ealth creation and em ploym ent are driven essentially through the production,
distribution and use of knowledge (APEC Economic Com m ittee, 2000). Since the term
has been coined, conferences w ere held, e.g. by OECD (OECD & National Science
Foundation, 1999) or by the European Union (European Commission - EUROSTAT,
2006). They aimed at deepening the concept, defining its contents and contours and
discussing its measurem ent. Frameworks were set up to provide the concept with
indicators mainly by international organisations (APEC Economic Com m ittee, 2000;
Chen & Dahlman, 2005; OECD, 1996) (cf. Appendix 9) and enable its m easurem ent so
th at economies could be assessed and compared. Strategies and plans w ere
form ulated at international, regional and national levels in order to prom ote
economies towards knowledge-based ones. (e.g. APEC Economic Com m ittee, 2000;
Australian Bureau of Statistics & Trewin, 2002; European Commission, 2010a; United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe, 2002); publications are released regularly
th at assess how economies are knowledge-based (e.g. European Commission, 2014;
OECD, 2013).

177

The publications th at attem pted to measure to which extent an economy is
knowledge-based used a range of indicators th at vary from one version to another
and also from one institution to another (cf. Godin (2006a) for the case o f OECD; and
Karahan (2012) for the overview of the indicators used by international organizations
like OECD, the W orld Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the European
Union). Therefore, there is not yet a consensus on which indicators to use to measure
a knowledge-based economy. However, economy growth is the result of interactions
betw een innovation actors of which the main ones are University, Industry and
Government.
Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995) noted that the relations and the role of these
actors are being changing; each are exerting the role of the another (Leydesdorff &
Etzkowitz, 2001). Therefore, the traditional role of these actors is changing. Etzkowitz
and Leydesdorff (1995) elaborated the theory of Triple Helix o f University-lndustryGovernm ent relationships to model these changes and their impact on economic
growth, and hence on developm ent and social welfare. The interactions between the
three actors provide a knowledge infrastructure necessary to the knowledge-based
economy (Leydesdorff, 2003, 2008, p. 401). In order to provide the theory with a
measure, Leydesdorff (2003) elaborated the mutual information as an indicator of
the University, Industry and Government relationships and hence, an indicator of the
extent to which an economy can be characterized as a knowledge-based economy
(Leydesdorff, 2008, 2010b). M any studies used the mutual information to assess the
relations between University, Industry and Government in different parts of the
world (e.g. Khan &. Park, 2011; Leydesdorff et al., 2013; Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009;
Megnigbeto, 2013e) or to assess the knowledge base of economies (e.g. Leydesdorff
et al., 2015; Leydesdorff & Zhou, 2013; Park et al., 2005). Megnigbeto (2014a)
proposed the transmission power as the efficiency of the mutual information and
affirmed that it is more suitable for comparison purpose. The transmission power
was used to assess the knowledge flow within the W est African innovations systems,
both at national and regional levels (Megnigbeto, 2014b, 2014c); it was also used to
compare the knowledge production profiles of six OECD countries (Megnigbeto,
2015c). Jointly with other indicators, it helped in studying the Norwegian innovation
system both at national and county level, based on data including the num ber of
establishments in geographical, organizational, and technological dimensions over a
13-year period (Ivanova, Strand, & Leydesdorff, 2014).
Innovation has an incidence on economic growth and social wellbeing (Dolan &
M etcalfe, 2012); besides, the level o f developm ent of a region depends on the level
of research product consumption (M ueller, 2006). Therefore, w e need to test
w hether the transmission power could be used as an indicator of research, research
collaboration or innovation. In other words, our objective is to test w hether there is
any correlation between transmission power and the level of development o f a
country (or region). This study seeks to answer the following research question: does
the transmission power measure the extent to which an economy is knowledgebased?

178

The aim of this study is to test any correlation between the transmission power and
some indicators used to measure knowledge economy. Any correlation found could
mean th a t the transmission power measures the same things as the considered
indicator; the absence of correlation could mean that the transmission power really
captures a dynamic th at is missing from other indicators.
The chapter is organised as follows: first, a background on the transmission pow er is
given; then the selected countries and indicators w ere dealt with in a third step, the
data source and collection w ere described, and finally, results are presented and
discussed in subsequent sections.

8.2. Howtomeasuretheknowledgeeconomy?Areviewof
literature
The initiatives towards measuring the knowledge-based economy w ere mainly taken
by international organisations like the OECD, the W orld Bank, the European Union,
the Asia-Pacific Economic Com m ittee or the United Nations. Some nations also
contributed. In fact, the economy has been always based on knowledge; indeed,
even in the so-called industrial economy (or traditional economy) humans needed
knowledge in order to transform natural resources and contribute to economic
growth, "because everything we do depends on knowledge" (W orld Bank, 1999, p.
16).
The OECD has published several reports related to the knowledge-based economy
(e.g. OECD, 1996, 1999, 2013). These reports used up to sixty indicators with
variations from one publication to another; for example, Godin (2006a, p. 18) noted
th a t the OECD collected up to sixty indicators aiming at measuring the knowledgebased economy. The W ord Bank devoted its 1998 annual developm ent report to
"knowledge for developm ent" (W orld Bank, 1999). A few years later, it established
the Knowledge Economy Framework (Chen & Dahlman, 2005) which built tw o
indicators: the Knowledge Economy Index (KEI) and the Knowledge Index (Kl). The Kl
measures a country's ability to generate, adopt and diffuse knowledge; it is an
indication o f the overall potential fo r knowledge developm ent in a given country. The
KEI takes into account w h eth er the environm ent is conducive for knowledge to be
used effectively for economic development; it is an aggregate index th at represents
the overall level of developm ent o f a country or region in relation to the knowledge
economy. The tw o indexes are based on four pillars: i) economic incentive and
institutional regime, ii) education and human resources, iii) innovation system and iv)
inform ation and communications technologies. These indicators are used by the
W orld Bank to rank economies regularly. The Statistical Office o f the European Union
regularly publishes statistics on innovations and knowledge-based economy.

The Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation started by defining the idealised knowledgebased economy under the name o f Nikuda, and fixed its characteristics (APEC
Economic Com m ittee, 2000, pp. 3 -1 6 ).

(APEC

Economic Com m ittee, 2000, p. 16). However, the docum ent recognized that the
given indicators are too idealistic and that not all its members could provide the
statistics; then a sub-set was extracted and presented (p 19, Table 1-3-1) following
the knowledge chain (acquisition, creation, dissemination and use).
The European Commission also published reports on its M em ber States' knowledgebased economy. In the 2010 innovation scoreboard (European Commission, 2010b),
it published twenty-six statistics in five categories that are, i) innovation drivers (5), ii)
knowledge creation (5), iii) innovation and entrepreneurship (6), iv) application (5)
and v) intellectual property (5). M ore recently, the European Commission has set up
a composite

index, the Summary

Innovation

Index -

which summarizes the

performance of a range of 25 different indicators (European Commission, 2014, p. 8).
The objective is no longer a direct m easurem ent of the knowledge-based economy
but rather innovation performance.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (2002) defined a fram ew ork to
measure the knowledge-based economy. It suggested the Global Knowledge-Based
Economy Index (GKEI) as a measure. The GKEI has tree sub-indexes: i) technology
(TGKEI), ii) public institutions (PGKEI) and iii) macroeconomic environm ent (MGKEI)
(p. 55 ff). The main weakness in the UNECE knowledge-based economy fram ework is
th at the selected indicators relate all to ICTs while "knowledge economy does not
necessarily revolve around high technology or information technology" (Suh, Chen,
Korea Developm ent Institute, & The W orld Bank Institute, 2007).
Apart from efforts by international organizations to define indicators to assess a
knowledge-based economy, national institutions also have contributed to the
debate. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics defined a fram ework
following the same methodology as the OECD, the W orld Bank, the APEC and the EU.
All the fram eworks referred to above used a "suite-of-indicators". Godin (2006a)
noted that none of the indicators intended to contribute to the measurem ent of the
knowledge based economy is really new; they all existed before the concept and
have been used to measure a particular aspect o f the "traditional economy" for
decades.
Individual researchers have also proposed indicators. For example, Arvanitidis and
Petrakos (2011, p. 25) developed the Economic Dynamism Indicator, a composite
index. The Centre for International

Development (CID) at

Harvard

University

proposed 19 indicators in 5 areas that are i) networked access, ii) networked

66 The categories are: i) in no vation system, ii) hum an resource de velopm e nt, ii) in fo rm a tio n and
com m u nica tion technologies in fra stru ctu re and iv) business en viro nm en t.

learning, iii) networked society, iv) networked economy and v) networked policy).67
Leydesdorff (2003) on the one hand and Leydesdorff and Ivanova (2014) on the other
hand respectively proposed the mutual information or transmission and the mutual
redundancy as a measure of the interactions among innovation system actors, and
hence, of a knowledge-based economy. These tw o measures are derived from
Shannon's (1948) inform ation theory.
In summary, even though fram eworks are produced by international or national
institutions or researchers about the knowledge-based economy, there is not yet an
internationally accepted indicator to capture the concept. W hat the fram eworks
have in common, however, is the omnipresence of information or knowledge chain
th at includes production, acquisition, dissemination and uses. Considering th at the
mutual inform ation is a scalar (Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2014), that it indicates the
quantity of inform ation common to tw o variables (Shannon, 1948) and is used to
measure how knowledge is shared within a system o f variables (cf. Leydesdorff,
2010b; Leydesdorff & Zhou, 2013), Megnigbeto (2014a) determ ined the upper and
low er bounds to the mutual information that vary depending on the system's
variables; then he proposed its normalisation under the name transmission power.
Because the mutual inform ation has been used to study how an economy is
knowledge-based, it is needed to test any relation with indicators used to study the
knowledge-based economy.

8.3.

Methods and data

8.3.1. Mutual information and transmission power
The mutual inform ation is borrowed from the Shannon's (1948) information theory
of which central notion is entropy. The entropy is the quantity o f information
contained in a variable. If an event occurs with the probability p, its entropy is (cf.
Shannon, 1948):

H = - p x log2p - (1 - p) x log2( l - p)

( 8- 1)

w here log2 is the logarithm to the base 2; the entropy may however be computed to
other bases e.g. 3, 4, ..., 10). M ore generally, if X = ( x ! , x 2, ...,x n) is a random
variable and its components occur with the probabilities P i,P 2#âÂ»pn respectively,
w ith X f = i Pi = lth e n the entropy generated by X is (Shannon, 1948; Shannon &
W eaver, 1949)
(8 - 2 )

H x = â Z R = i Pi x lo g z P i

For tw o random variables X and Y, if Hx is the entropy of X and HY that of Y, the joint
entropy HXy of the system of the tw o variables is equal to the entropy Hx plus HY
minus the entropy o f the overlay of X and Y. The latter is called "rate o f transmission"

(Shannon, 1948) or mutual information (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Leydesdorff, 2003,
2008; M ori, 2006; Yeung, 2001, 2008) between X and Y. The relations between the
transmission, TXY, the joint entropy HXY and the marginal entropies of the variables, Hx
and HY are (Shannon, 1948):

H xy = Hx + H y - Txy

(8-3)

and

Txy = H x + H y - H XY

(8-4)

In case of three random variables X, Y and Z (three dimensions), the relations
between the system's entropy, its mutual information, the marginal entropies and
the bilateral mutual informations are given by (cf. Abramson, 1963; Leydesdorff,
2003; Theil, 1972):
Hxyz =

H x + H y + H z â T xy â Txz â Tyz + Txyz

(8-5))

and
Txyz = H x + H Y + H z - H Xy ~ H Yz â Hxz + H XYZ

(8-6)

The transmission power of a system is the fraction of the maximum value of the
m utual information devoted to information sharing in the system; it represents the
share of the "total configurational information" really produced in the system. In
other words, it measures the efficiency of the mutual information.
For a three-dimensional system, Megnigbeto (2014a) distinguished tw o types of
transmission power: the first one (ii) when the transmission is negative, and the
second (x2) when the transmission is positive:

The transmission power varies from 0 to 1; it is dimensionless and may be expressed
as a percentage (Megnigbeto, 2014a).

8,3.2. Selected countries and indicators
For the purpose of this article, we collect data on six countries over a 10-year period
(2001-2010). All the countries are members of the OECD: tw o from the American
continent (USA and Canada), tw o from Europe (France and Germany) and tw o from
Asia (Japan and South Korea). This choice is guided by the fact that the OECD has
been playing a crucial role in the dissemination of the term knowledge-based

182

economy (Godin, 2006a) and also regularly provides statistics on different aspects of
its M em b e r States' economy. The APEC Economic Com m ittee's (2000, p. 19 Table 1-31 ) m atrix of indicators was used as a starting point o f the process o f indicator
selection; indeed, this matrix distinguishes indicators according to the knowledge
chain (acquisition, creation, uses and dissemination). As far as our research is
concerned, mutual inform ation is derived from
collaboration

data.

By doing

research,

research output and research

researchers

produce

inform ation

and

knowledge; by collaboration means, they increase their productivity (Katz & M artin,
1997) and share inform ation and knowledge (Guns & Rousseau, 2014; Katz & M artin,
1997; Olm eda-Gom ez et al., 2008). Therefore, w e can consider mutual inform ation as
an indicator of inform ation and knowledge production on the one hand, and
inform ation and knowledge sharing on the other hand. According to Liu (2011, p. 87
ff) and Liu et al. (2013) knowledge diffusion starts with the 'act o f publication' and
the citations publications received. Clearly, the mutual inform ation, and therefore,
the transmission power, do not intervene at the diffusion side of knowledge or
information; it intervenes on neither the acquisition side nor the use side; but rather
on the production and sharing side only.
The APEC m atrix retained four indicators in four categories for the knowledge
production. They are the Gross Domestic Expenditure fo r Research and Developm ent
(GERD) as percentage o f Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the

natural science

graduates per annum, the Business Expenditure for Research and Developm ent
(BERD), the num ber of researchers per capita and the Patents awarded in the US per
annum . Hence, from the APEC's matrix, w e retain the GERD as percentage o f GDP
and the num ber o f researchers; these indicators are also present in the fram ew ork
proposed by the OECD, the W orld Bank and the European Union. Karahan (2012)
distinguished them as input indicators. Some indicators are usually used to measure
economic

and

social

developm ent;

we

selected

three

considered

as output

indicators; they are: i) the Human Developm ent Index (HDI), ii) the Gross Domestic
Product growth rate and iii) the Gross Domestic Product per capita. The HDI is a
composite index measuring average achievem ent in three basic dimensions of
human developm ent: i) a long and healthy life, ii) knowledge and iii) a decent
standard o f living (UNDP, 2013, p. 147). The last tw o indicators measure the growth
in the domestic w ealth production in a given area. Finally, we select the Total Factor
Productivity (TFP) also called Multi-Factor Productivity (MFP) because it represents
the "part o f GDP growth th at cannot be explained by changes in labour and capital
inputs".68
W e should stress th a t the HDI tim e series cover only the period 2005-2010. Indeed
the indicator is provided by interval of 5 years from 1980 to 2000 and for each year,
from 2005 to 2013, in the recent Human Developm ent Report (UNDP, 2014). But
when referred to previous versions of the report, the HDI for a particular country and
year is not the same from one report to another, because the methodology in

68 h ttp s ://d a ta .o e c d .o rg /lp rd ty /m u ltifa c to r-p ro d u c tiv ity .h tm

183

computing the indicator and the indicators composing it varies over tim e; therefore,
the UNDP advises against comparison of HDI across years (UNDP, 2005, p. 212). So,
for methodological reasons, w e restrict data to the period 2005-2010 for the HDI.
In summary, the six selected indicators we are comparing the transmission power to
are GERD (OECD, 2014a), num ber of researchers (OECD, 2014b) , GDP growth rate,
GDP per capita (OECD, 2015a), HDI (UNDP, 2014, Table 2) and TFP (OECD, 2015b).

8.3.3. Research data collection
Research collaboration is recognized as crucial for knowledge production and
innovation (OECD, 2010, p. 98); it may cover several aspects. Even though research
collaboration doesn't always yield publications, w e consider co-authorship as its
indicator, because it has been widely used in Academia (Abbassi et al., 2012; Bordons
& Gomez, 2000; Katz & M artin, 1997; Olmeda-Gomez et al., 2008). It entails the tacit
transfer o f inform ation and knowledge (Olmeda-Gomez et al., 2008) and ensures
diffusion o f ideas and knowledge circulation (Guns & Rousseau, 2014). The Triple
Helix thesis relies on research collaboration.
W e collect data over a ten-year period (2001-2010) on the selected countries'
University, Industry and Governm ent research output and collaboration through the
W eb of Science. The databases searched w ere Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIEXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities Citation Index
(A&HCI),

Conference

Proceedings

Citation

Index-Science

(CPCI-S),

Conference

Proceedings Citation Index- Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH). The search
strategy consists of eleven steps for each country, adapted from Ye et al. (2013),
based on the search strings previously developed and tested by Leydesdorff (2003, p.
458) and Park et al. (2005, p. 13 ff):
#1: CU=COUNTRY and PY=2001-2010: selection of all the scientific output of

8.3.4. Computation of indicators
The results of each stage w ere entered into a worksheet; and on a second worksheet,
formulas are entered to com pute University, Industry and Governm ent sectorial
output and o th er bilateral and trilateral collaboration data. W e coded a PHP
programme th at computes the sectorial entropies, the bilateral entropies and
transmission, and the trilateral entropies and transmission according to the formulas
given

above

(cf.

Appendix

10)

Furthermore,

the

programme

calculates

the

transmission pow er and the efficiency at the trilateral level.

Results

Analyses are presented at the following three levels: i) mutual information and
transmission power level, ii) selected indicators level and iii) selected countries level.

8.4.1. Mutual information and transmission power o f selected
countries
The mutual inform ation and the transmission power of the selected countries are
com puted in Table 8-1. Figure 8 -lp lo ts the tim e series of the mutual information of
the selected countries over the period of study (2001-2010). It shows that the mutual
inform ation values are negative for all the countries meaning th at synergy exists
within the selected national innovation system. Because the more negative the
mutual inform ation, the more there is synergy, we consider the absolute values of
the tim e series. It results th at the South Korean innovation system has gained in
synergy over tim e (the absolute value of its mutual information has increased over
tim e) and th a t the five other countries' innovation systems have lost synergy (the
absolute value of their mutual information has decreased over tim e). Germany is in
the lowest position, followed by South Korea; Canada and USA, the systems of which
185

exhibit approximately the same values over the period, occupy respectively the third
and second positions. The French mutual information is higher than that of Japan
until 2007 w here the tw o countries display an equal value; then, the synergy into the
Japanese innovation system became higher.
Regarding the transmission power (Figure 8-2), Japan keeps the first place, far ahead
of the five remaining countries; France is still the second best performing system but
reduces the gap with its successors; Canada also keeps the third place. Even though
the USA begins the period with the fourth place, it has been caught up by South
Korea in 2004 which competed with it until 2007 where it took the fourth place
lagging the USA at the fifth position. Over all the period, Germany keeps the rear
with respect to the transmission power. Whereas the tw o Asian countries exhibit an
increasing trend w ith respect to the transmission power, the other countries show
the reverse (Table 8-2).
In summary, the synergy within the innovations systems operates largely in Japan
and France than elsewhere; the USA and Canada present likely similar pattern; the
South Korean innovation system has gained in synergy while the five others have
lost. Germany seems to have the least integrated innovation system as measured by
the indicators w e used.

8.4.2. Selected indicators level analyses
The plots of GERD against transmission power for the selected countries are
presented in Figure 8-3. Three countries exhibit a negative correlation between
transmission power and GERD. They are USA, France and Germany. Whereas the
correlation is strong in the case of Germany (r = -0 .9 ) and France (r = -0 .7 5 ), the tw o
European countries, it is weak in the case of USA (r = - 0.26). Conversely, Canada and
Japan show a strong positive correlation between transmission power and GERD (r =
0.78 and r = 0.85 respectively) while, South Korea displays a m oderate positive
correlation between the tw o variables.
Japan and South Korea, the tw o Asian countries, show a positive m oderate
correlation betw een transmission power and number of researchers (r = 0.4 and r =
0.66 respectively). The four remaining countries (France, Germany, USA and Canada)
exhibit a negative correlation with regard to the tw o indicators. However, the
negative correlation is less pronounced in the case of France than that of the three
others countries where it is strong (Figure 8-4). The situation depicted by the plot of
GDP growth rate against transmission power is exactly the opposite of that of
transmission power against num ber of researchers. Indeed, the tw o Asian countries,
Japan and South Korea, show a negative correlation (r = - 0.17 and r = - 0.44)
whereas the four other countries, which are American (USA, and Canada) and
European (France and Germany) show a positive correlation. If the American
countries show a weak correlation, the European ones exhibit a m oderate to strong
correlation between transmission power and GDP growth rate (Figure 8-5).

18 6

GDP per capita and transmission power on the one hand and HDI and transmission
pow er on the o th er hand show th e same pattern as numbers of researchers per
thousand inhabitants and transmission power fo r all the selected countries: the Asian
countries have a positive relation and the others a negative one (Figure 8-6 and
Figure 8-7). W ith regard to TFP, the USA presents a strong negative correlation with
the transmission power; Canada and Germany have a negative m oderate or weak
correlation; France exhibits a positive m oderate correlation one while the tw o Asian
countries show a positive strong correlation (Figure 8-8).

8.4.3. Country level analysis
Table 8-3 summarises the correlation coefficients of transmission power w ith the
selected indicators for the selected countries. It shows that USA exhibits negative
correlations between transmission power and five o f the indicators and a positive
m oderate correlation betw een transmission power and GDP growth rate. W hereas
the correlation betw een transmission power and GDP per capita on the one hand
and transmission power and HDI is negative and strong (r = - 0.83 and r = - 0.75), it is
m oderate w ith GERD and the num ber of researchers. In the case of Canada, four
indicators present a negative correlation with the transmission power; they are:
num ber of researchers, GDP per capita and HDI. These correlations are m oderate
(GDP per capita and

num ber o f researchers) or strong (HDI). The Canadian

transmission power has however a strong positive correlation with this country's
GERD and a weak one w ith GDP growth rate, but has no correlation with TFP.
France has a negative strong correlation between transmission power and GERD, but
a negative m oderate correlation between transmission power and number of
researchers on the one hand, and transmission power and GDP per capita on the
other hand; but negative m oderate correlation between transmission and HDI.
Conversely, it shows a positive m oderate correlation betw een transmission power
and GDP growth rate and transmission power on the one hand and transmission
pow er and TFP on the other hand. As far as Germany is concerned, transmission
pow er shows a negative correlation w ith GERD, numbers o f research, HDI and TFP
and a positive correlation w ith GDP growth rate and GDP per capita. Japan and South
Korea show the same patterns. The correlations are positive or negative with regard
to the same indicator, the difference is the strength of the correlation.

8.5. Discussion
The Triple Helix indicators computed from scientific publications data reveal different
patterns o f the dynamics o f the national innovation systems of the selected
countries. Globally, the Japanese national innovation system exhibits the largest
synergy, followed by France, USA, Canada, South Korea and Germany.
195

8.5.1. Globalization erodes synergy at national level
The leading position o f Japan with regard to the mutual information was already
recorded by Leydesdorff (2003) and that o f Japan and France by Ye et al. (2013) for
the year 2011, while the latter study computed the mutual information o f a set of
countries including the ones we selected. Our results globally confirm the ranking of
countries (Ye et al., 2013) obtained after calculation mutual information based on
data from W eb of Science, except that Canada and South Korea interchange their
ranking. They also conform to the findings that for most countries, the mutual
inform ation's absolute value is decreasing (Ye et al., 2013). This trend is due to
globalisation

th at

erodes

the

synergy

between

national

innovation

actors

(Leydesdorff & Park, 2014; Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009; Ye et al., 2013). Indeed,
globalization gives opportunities to

research

institutions to

cooperate widely

regardless of the distance separating their home countries; it has enlarged worldwide
partnership (W altm an et al. 2011). Therefore, a university in one country has the
opportunity to collaborate with a company or a governmental body, each located in
different countries. This form of collaboration, even though linking the three
innovation actors of the Triple Helix, escapes to be accounted for the synergy at the
national level, as the present research paper measures it. Hence, the synergy at the
national level diminishes.
Leydesdorff and Sun (2009) located the starting point o f globalization after the end of
the Cold W ar between 1990 and 2000; in other words, starting from the demise of
the Soviet Union, the unification of Germany, and the opening o f China since the
early 1990s. The decrease in the absolute value of the mutual information and its
small values are therefore a consequence of the internationalization of science in the
selected countries (namely Germany, South Korea, Canada and USA). Japan's
performance is driven by domestic activity (Adams, King, Miyairi, et al., 2010); this
country's national innovation system is less internationalized than that of Canada,
the latter is more integrated in the Anglo-American system (Leydesdorff & Sun,
2009). Before globalization, USA had the highest share in the international papers of
all countries (Glanzel, 2001, p. 87; Zitt et al., 2000, p. 641); therefore, it should be
expected th at its mutual inform ation and transmission power show a lower value
over the period of study. In the case of South Korea, the gain of synergy, although
slow over tim e, may be interpreted as the consequence of strengthening of its
national innovation system after years of benefiting from international collaboration.
This situation is a consequence of changes in this country's policies over decades
(Kwon et al., 2012).

8.5.2. Strengthening domestic co-authorship explains the performance
o f South Korea and Japan
Table 8-4 and Figure 8-9 show the tim e series of the entropies of the selected
countries innovation systems and the equation o f their linear trends. Except for
Japan and South Korea, which have an increasing trend, all the remaining countries
196

have a decreasing one. The same trend is registered as regarding the bilateral
entropies Hu,, HUG and H,G (cf. Table 8-5 to Table 8-7 and Figure 8-10 to Figure 8-12).
The entropy of a system is the quantity o f information or knowledge produced within
the system. In other words, the quantity of information or knowledge produced by
the Japanese and South Korean information systems are growing, whereas in the
o th er countries, it is diminishing. Therefore, it is unsurprising th a t the share th at
circulated betw een actors (the transmission power) at the domestic level also
decreases. That explains the negative correlation of the transmission power w ith the
selected indicators in the American and European selected countries.
The expression of HuiG drawn from Equation (8 -6 ) is:

H uig = Hui + H ug + H IG â Hy â H[ â HG + Tyic

(8-8)

Equation (8 -8 ) shows th a t HUIG has a positive relation with the bilateral entropies. In
order words, the bilateral entropies add to the system entropy, e.g. an increase in
the bilateral entropies engenders an increase in the system's entropy. That is the
case of Japan and South Korea. Conversely, the four other countries' bilateral
entropies have decreased; consequently, the system's entropy decreases. This
emphasizes the role o f collaboration in knowledge production and sharing for
innovation.
The decreasing trend of bilateral entropies in the USA, Canada, France and Germany
innovation system should not be interpreted as lack o f collaboration between
University, Industry and Government; it may have resulted from the an increase in
collaboration

with

partners

abroad;

we

have

concluded

that

international

collaboration has eroded the mutual information at domestic level. W e should recall
th at this study doesn't include foreign innovation actors in the computation o f the
indicators, and th at the Japanese co-authorship is domestic and that South Korea has
engaged in strengthening its domestic science.

8.5.3. Investment in R & D feeds synergy at national level
The GERD as percentage of the GDP o f the countries over the period of study (Figure
8-13) and the num ber of researchers per thousand inhabitants (Figure 8-14) shed
more light on the gain of synergy within the South Korean innovation system. Indeed,
at the beginning o f the period, South Korea's GERD is equal to 2.59 and South Korea
was ranked third, after Japan and USA; it rises to 3.06 in 2006 and reaches 3.56 in
2009 making South Korea the country with the highest GERD as percentage o f GDP
w ithin the set o f the six selected countries starting from 2009. The same trend is
recorded for the num ber o f researchers per thousand inhabitants. This steady
investm ent in research and developm ent may have strengthened collaboration
betw een innovation actors at national level. It explains the performance o f the
country with regard to m utual inform ation and transmission power; it illustrates the
efforts South Korea has made to catch up with leading economies (OECD, 2009, p.
13). W e should underline th at Japan and South Korea has the highest GERD as
percentage o f GDP meaning th at these tw o countries have been investing heavily in
research and developm ent, and hence, in human capital. If Japan has this tradition
(its GERD equalled 2.9% GDP in 1990 and has reached 3% since 2000, cf. data in
(OECD, 2014a), South Korea has prioritized strengthening its economy towards a
developed one (Kwon et al., 2012; OECD, 2009).
These results illustrate th at investing in research and developm ent (e.g. GERD and
research

personnel) strengthens the

innovation system

research and extends

research collaboration. Therefore, opportunities for doing research and research
collaboration betw een innovation actors are widened; knowledge could then be
created and shared by and among innovation actors at national level. Indeed at the
origin, the mutual inform ation, borrowed from the Shannon's (1948) inform ation
theory, indicates the quantity of inform ation common to tw o variables. In case of
m ore than tw o variables (the three actors of an innovation system, in our case), it

203

measures the synergy within the system if it is negative, or the control one actor
exerts on the others if it is positive (Leydesdorff, 2003). The transmission power is
the normalization of the mutual information; it is obtained by dividing the mutual
inform ation by the maximum value it may reach according to the variables value
(M egnigbeto,

2014a);

it can

be interpreted

as the

efficiency o f the

mutual

inform ation. In other words, the transmission power is the fraction of the quantity of
the 'sharable inform ation' th at is actually shared within the system. It indicates the
extent to which the produced information and knowledge flow betw een innovations
actors (Megnigbeto, 2014b, 2014c).

8.5.4, South Korea has gained profit more than other countries
Figure 8-15 plots the TFP (base = 100 in 2005) of the selected countries. It shows that
before 2005, the South Korean TFP was the lowest but has become the highest after
w ith a significant gap. The OECD states that, TFP is the part of GDP growth that
cannot be explained by changes in labour and capital inputs. According to the W orld
Bank (W orld Bank, 1999, p. 19 Table 1.2), at least 70% o f growth rate is explained by
intangible factors like knowledge, not by labour and capital. Indeed, the other
countries have attained a certain level of development; a country like South Korea
which 'suddenly" starts investing should have a shift in its output. That is why even
though South Korea's GERD equals that of Japan only in 2007 and its numbers of
researchers th a t of Japan only in 2009, the TFP (base = 100 in 2005) has risen. In
conclusion the investment in R & D by South Korea since early 2000 as the results of
changes in the country's research and innovation policy may have influenced the TFP
tim e series.

8.6. Conclusion
This chapter aimed to study the correlation between the transmission power and
some selected indicators used to measure the knowledge-based economy, taking the
case o f six OECD countries namely USA, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and South
Korea. The results show th at the selected countries don't have the same pattern with
regard to the selected indicators. Indeed, while some countries exhibit a positive
correlation regarding the transmission power and a particular indicator, others show

205

a negative correlation between the transmission power and the same indicator.
However, Japan and South Korea exhibit a positive strong correlation between the
transmission power and GERD on the one hand and the transmission power and the
num ber of researchers on the other hand; they also have the same pattern as
regarding the correlations studied. The particular situation of these tw o countries is
due to the domestication in co-authorship in the Japanese science and the efforts of
strengthening the national innovation system at the South Korean level. On the
opposite, the four remaining countries are affected by the international collaboration
they are involved in.
The results did not allow drawing any evident relation between the transmission
pow er and the selected indicators, certainly because the transmission power
captures a dynamic th at is missing from other indicators. However, the study showed
th at the transmission power as measured by the method used informs only at the
country level and does not measure the added value University, Industry and
Governm ent relationships create at the international level. Therefore, reasonably it
could not be used fo r absolute comparison of countries unless the synergy created
abroad is taken into account with the inclusion of University-lndustry-Government
relationships at international level. This study shows that investments in research
and developm ent, particularly a constant increase in GERD and research personnel or
equipm ent, strengthens domestic collaboration and give more opportunity for
knowledge sharing at the country level. There is however a need for innovation
system actors both to favour collaboration between innovation actors at the
domestic level and enlarging collaboration at the international level in order to
contribute to knowledge sharing abroad.
From this study, we could conclude that if collaboration sustains innovation and
contributes to economic growth, mutual information and transmission power may be
means for measuring the advances attained.

9. International collaboration and knowledge flow within
an innovation system
This chapter computes the effect of international collaboration on the synergy and
knowledge circulation within an innovation system. Three levels o f study are
considered: the

domestic one, the foreign one and the global. The

mutual

inform ation and the transmission power are used as indicators, W est African region
and South Korea served as cases of studies.
This chapter is based on a conference paper presented at the Vkme Colloque de
I'Universite d'Abomey-Calavi (M egnigbeto, 2015b) and an article published in the
Triple Helix Journal (M egnigbeto, 2015a).

9.1. Introduction
Two types of models of innovation w ere proposed up to now to explain the
functioning o f an economy: the linear and the nonlinear models. Each explains how
growth is generated. The linear model postulated that "innovation starts with basic
research,
production

is followed
and

by applied

diffusion"

(Godin,

research
2005,

and

2006b,

developm ent,
2014). The

and

ends with

nonlinear model

introduced w ith the national innovation system concept "suggests that the research
system's ultim ate goal is innovation and that the system is a part o f a larger system
composed

of

sectors

like

Government,

University

and

Industry

and

their

environm ent. The system also emphasized the relations betw een the components or
sectors as the "cause" explaining the performance of innovation system" (Godin,
2007, p. 5). Both models have been criticized (Godin, 2005, 2006b, 2007) and variants
o f them w ere proposed. In the national innovation system model, analysis focuses on
the flows o f knowledge betw een actors (OECD, 1997, p. 11).
The Triple Helix laid down by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995, 2000, p. 2) is one of
the variants of the nonlinear model of innovation (cf. Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 2000;
Leydesdorff, 2012b, p. 26; M eyer et al., 2014, p. 153). The model postulates th at the
interactions betw een University, Industry and Governm ent maintain a knowledge
infrastructure th a t generates knowledge o f which circulation among innovation
actors drives economic growth and social w elfare (Leydesdorff & Etzkowitz, 2001).
The mutual inform ation (Leydesdorff, 2003) was elaborated as an indicator o f the
Triple Helix relationships betw een University, Industry and Governm ent. It has been
used widely to assess countries or region

profiles (e.g.

Khan &

Park, 2011;

Leydesdorff et al., 2013; Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009; Megnigbeto, under review, 2013g,
2015; Shin e t al., 2012) or assess the knowledge base o f economies (Leydesdorff et
al., 2015; Leydesdorff & Zhou, 2013; Park et al., 2005). The transmission power was
proposed by Megnigbeto (2014a) as the normalization o f the mutual information. It
was used to assess the knowledge flow within the W est African innovation systems,
both at national and regional levels (M egnigbeto, 2014b, 2014c); it was also used to

207

compare the knowledge production profiles of six OECD countries (Megnigbeto,
under review, 2015c). Jointly with other indicators, it helped in studying the
Norwegian innovation system both at national and county level, based on data
including the

num ber of establishments

in geographical,

organizational,

and

technological dimensions over a 13-year period (Ivanova et al., 2014).
The Triple Helix model relies on collaboration. W hen publications serve as unit of
analysis, co-authorship is taken as a measurem ent of collaboration (Abbassi et al.,
2012; Bordons & Gomez, 2000; Katz & M artin, 1997; Olmeda-Gomez et al., 2008);
indeed, it entails the tacit transfer of information and knowledge (Olmeda-Gomez et
al., 2008) and ensures diffusion of ideas and knowledge circulation (Guns &
Rousseau, 2014). The importance of co-authorship in knowledge creation and sharing
may be measured by the international co-authorship trend. Indeed, publications on
co-authorship worldwide all reported an increasing trend in the num ber of authors
w ho contributed to an article (e.g. Adams, 2012; Adams et al., 2014; Adams et al.,
2010; Bordons & Gomez, 2000; Boshoff, 2009; Leydesdorff et al., 2013; Leydesdorff &
W agner, 2008; Megnigbeto, 2013a; Onyancha & Maluleka, 2011b; Ossenblok et al.,
2014; Tijssen, 2007; Toivanen 8c Ponomariov, 2011; W agner et al., 2015). Some of
them underlined the concentration of the growth in the group of papers with five or
m ore authors, underlining the strong importance of co-authorship in scientific
publishing. As an illustration, research collaboration networks have been evolving
and countries th at w ere at the periphery are becoming m em ber o f the core; besides,
the global international collaboration network has become denser (Leydesdorff &
W agner, 2008). Globally, co-authorship has exploded recently (Adams, 2012) and
internationalisation o f collaboration characterizes science today (Adams, 2013) due
mainly to globalization69. Therefore, by the means of collaboration, innovation actors
contributed to synergy and knowledge creation both at national and international
levels. Leydesdorff and Zawdie (2010) affirmed that "knowledge-based economy
develops as a dynamic system at the global level, thus transcending national or
geographical boundaries".
At our knowledge, few papers studied international co-authorship in relation with
the Triple Helix. Firstly, Leydesdorff and Sun (2009), Kwon (2011) and Kwon et al.
(2012) included the internationally co-authored papers as a fourth elem ent of the
model; this method requires a huge am ount of data processing and cleaning of the
institutional address inform ation (Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009, p. 215). Secondly, Choi et
al. (2015) studied the intra-sectors co-authorship at international level. And thirdly,
Shin et al. (2012) combined domestic and international collaboration by University,
Industry, and Governm ent and their bi or trilateral output.

69 According to

UNESCO

(2 0 1 0 a ),

"globalisation

is th e ongoing

process th a t

is linking

people,

neighbourhoods, cities, regions and countries much m ore closely to g e th e r th a n th e y have ever been
befo re. T he process is driven econom ically by in tern atio n al financial flow s and tra d e , technologically by
info rm ation technology and mass m edia e n te rta in m e n t, and very significantly, also by very hum an
means such as cultural exchanges, m igration and intern atio nal tourism ". So this d efinition includes
econom ic, technological, and cultural aspects o f th e p heno m en a.

208

The above m entioned studies computed neither the synergy or knowledge the
national innovation actors contributed abroad nor its effect on the synergy or
knowledge creation and sharing at national level; therefore, they could not measure
the real am ount of knowledge that circulates among an a r e a ' s innovation actors
(M egnigbeto, under review, 2015c). Indeed, globalization has given opportunities to
researchers to collaborate w orldwide regardless the distance (W altm an e t al., 2011).
Besides, it has eroded some countries' mutual information (Kwon et al., 2012;
Leydesdorff & Park, 2014; Leydesdorff & Sun, 2009), and might have affected how
knowledge is shared at the country's level.
Because the mutual inform ation at a country's level could have been eroded by
international co-authorship, it is not sufficient alone to indicate how knowledgebased an economy is (M egnigbeto, under review, 2015c). So, while comparing
countries on the basis of the mutual information or derived indicators, the synergy
contributed due to international collaboration remains unilluminated. Thus, the
comparison may be biased. As an example, the Japanese research performance is
driven by domestic activity (Adams, King, Miyairi, et al., 2010). This country's mutual
inform ation

was

always

higher while

compared

to

that

of other

countries

(Leydesdorff, 2003; M egnigbeto, 2014a, 2015c; Park et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2013). The
conclusion th at the synergy at the Japanese national level is higher than elsewhere is
true but deriving th at the Japanese economy is more knowledge-based than th at of
another country may not be.
In this chapter, we hypothesize th at the synergy or knowledge contributed at the
international level by a country's domestic innovation actors may have affected the
synergy or knowledge they created at the national level. In other words, foreign
innovation actors can influence the synergy and knowledge creation and sharing at a
country's level. Our research question is twofold: i) How to measure the synergy or
knowledge contributed to abroad by an area's innovation actors due to their
relations with th eir foreign

partners? ii) W h at is the effect o f international

collaboration on knowledge flow within an innovation system?

9.2. Methods
9.2.1. Mutual information and transmission power
The m utual inform ation is borrowed from the Shannon's (1948) inform ation theory.
Central to this theory is the notion of entropy defined as the average quantity of
inform ation contained is a variable. Shannon (1948) defined the entropy o f an event
th a t occurs w ith the probability p as:

H = - p x log2p - (1 - p) x log2( l - p)

(9-1)

w here log2 is the logarithm to the base 2; the entropy may however be computed to
other bases e.g. 3, 4, ..., 10). M ore generally, if X = (x 1(x 2, ...,x n) is a random

209

variable and its components occur with the probabilities P i , P 2 . - . P n respectively,
then the entropy generated by X is (cf. Shannon, 1948; Shannon & W eaver, 1949)

HX = - I ? = i P i X l o g 2Pl

(9-2)

For tw o random variables X and Y, if Hx is the entropy o f X and HY th at of Y, the joint
entropy HXY of the system of the tw o variables is equal to the entropy Hx plus HY
minus the entropy of the overlay of X and Y. The latter is called "rate of transmission"
(Shannon, 1948) or mutual information (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Leydesdorff, 2003,
2008; M ori, 2006; Yeung, 2001, 2008) between X and Y. The relations between the
transmission, TXY, the joint entropy HXY and the marginal entropies of the variables, Hx
and HY are (1948):
H xy =

H x + H y - Txy

(9-3)

Hx +

(9-4)

and
Tx y =

Hy -

H XY

In case of three random variables X, Y and Z (three dimensions), the relations
betw een the system's entropy, its transmission, the marginal entropies and the
bilateral transmissions are given by (cf. Abramson, 1963; Leydesdorff, 2003; Theil,
1972):
H xyz -

HX + HY +

Hz -

TXY -

T xz - T YZ -I- T XYZ

(9-5)

and
T XYz â H x + H Y -I- H z â H XY â H y Z â H x z + H x y z

(9-6)

The transmission power of a system is the fraction of the maximum value of the
transmission devoted to information sharing in the system; it represents the share of
the "total configurational information" really produced in the system. In other words,
it measures the efficiency of the mutual information.
For a three-dim ensional system, Megnigbeto (2014a) distinguished tw o types of
transmission power: the first one (ii) when the transmission is negative, and the
second ( t 2) when the transmission is positive:

(9-7)

The transmission pow er varies from 0 to 1; it is dimensionless and may be expressed
as a percentage (M egnigbeto, 2014a).

9.2.2. Domestic, foreign and global systems
Leydesdorff and Sun (2009), Kwon (2011) and Kwon et al. (2012) named 'foreign'
institutions from partner countries and considered it as the fourth elem ent o f the
innovation system composed with the three national actors th at are University (u),
Industry (i) and G overnm ent (g), leading to the com putation o f the

mutual

inform ation (Tujgf) of the Quadruple Helix. The type o f the institutions involved was
not taken into account; Figure 9-1-a illustrates this method. Our method suggests
considering three levels o f analysis: i) the domestic one grouping the country or areabased innovation actors as done in the literature hitherto, ii) the foreign one
grouping the innovation actors from the partner countries, and, iii) the global
grouping the tw o previously defined systems Hence, the global system may be
considered as composed w ith the 'domestic' and the 'foreign' sub-systems, each with
three innovation actors leading to six actors at the global level (Figure 9-1-b). The tw o
sub-systems interact and exert on each other a mutual influence th at may act on the
synergy

within

each

other

by the

mutual

relationships

they

entertain.

The

relationships existing betw een the actors on Figure 9-1-a (as represented by arrows)
also exist within the domestic sub-system on the one hand, and the foreign one on
the other hand (Figure 9-1-b). Abstraction is done of these relationships on Figure
9-1-b however. Studying such a Sextuple Helix (Leydesdorff, 2012) requires the
com putation o f 26 = 64 sectors data.70 A simpler way to proceed consists in
considering the global system as if actors w ere from the same geographical area and
studying separately the three domestic, foreign and global Triple Helix systems. Thus,
w e can com pute the mutual inform ation and transmission power o f the domestic,
foreign and the global systems using the formulas given above. W e suggest using the
normalised difference betw een the global and domestic transmission pow er as the
effect of international collaboration on knowledge flow within an innovation system.

70 If th e n u m be r o f variables is n, th e system m ay be decom posed in to 2n subsets (cf. M eg nigbe to , 2014,
pp. 28 5-2 86).

9.2.3. International collaboration and transmission power
Because a record could have both foreign and domestic co-authors, the method of
entropy decomposition suggested by Theil (1972, pp. 2 0 -2 3 ) is not applicable;
indeed, the number of records from 'domestic' and th at from 'foreign' do not sum up
to the num ber of records at the global level. W e suggest computing the mutual
inform ation and transmission power of the domestic, foreign and the global systems
using the formulas given above. Hence, it seems that Shin e t al. (2012) computed the
domestic and global mutual informations for Saudi Arabia w ithout using these
denominations, but they did not compute the foreign mutual information; they did
not compute the transmission power values any longer.
If we denote xd, the domestic transmission power, xf the foreign one and xg the global
one, the effect of the international collaboration on an area may be measured with
^ _ T/f

the scalar ââ expressed as percentage. W e argue th at the total knowledge within
*d
such a system is measured by xg. Therefore, one can compute the total transmission
power for such a country and compare countries on this basis. In this section, w e do
not consider the knowledge created at the foreign level solely because it does not
add any value to our interpretation and its effects combined with the domestic
included in the global values. However, it may help in assessing the level of
integration on the innovation system at the country level.

212

9.2.4. Data collection
The data source is the W eb of Science. Our research question requires the distinction
betw een the papers originated from an geographic area's University, Industry and
Governm ent relationships and those resulting from the collaboration w ith at least
one University, Industry or Governm ent abroad. If the W eb of Science search
language could perm it to retrieve the first category of papers, the second category is
not searchable w ith it. Therefore, we opted for data downloading for fu rth er relevant
treatm en t.
The primary area for the application is the W est African region; however, Korea, a
country which some decades ago had the same economic and social conditions as
the W est African countries, has been steadily studied with regard to Triple Helix
dynamics (e.g. Khan & Park, 2011; Megnigbeto, under review, 2015c; Park et al.,
2005; Park & Leydesdorff, 2010); therefore, it is chosen for comparison purpose. So,
this article treats the scientific data of the W est African region and South Korea. W est
African71 and South Korean72 publications data from W eb o f Science73 over a ten-year
period (2001-20 10) w ere downloaded. This article treats the scientific data of the
W est African region and South Korea. The records resulting from these tw o searches
w ere im ported into tw o different bibliographic databases, with the same structure,
managed w ith the CDS/ISIS software application.

9.2.5. Data treatment
Based on Leydesdorff (2003, p. 458) and Park et al.'s (2005, p. 13 ff.) method for
address assignment, a list o f words or abbreviations w ere established to attribute
each record address a label: UNIV for University, INDU for Industry or GOV for
G overnm ent. A second CDS/ISIS Pascal programme was coded for this task. A record
may contain many addresses; therefore, one record may have tw o or more different
labels. The CDS/ISIS Pascal programmes were also instructed to read the countriesâ
name from the addresses and automatically add the associated area name: W estAfrica for the W est African database and Korea to the South Korean database.
Addresses th a t do not relate to any W est African country or South Korea are labelled
'FOREIGN'. So, in the inverted file of the databases, a university in W est Africa
appears under the label UNIV-WEST-AFRICA, an enterprise in South Korea appears

71 The search expression was (cu=benin o r cu=Burkina faso o r cu=cote ivo ire o r cu=cape verde o r
cu=gam bia o r cu=ghana o r cu=guinea o r cu=guinea bissau o r cu=liberia o r cu=m ali o r cu=niger o r
cu=nigeria o r cu=senegal o r cu=sierra leone o r cu=togo) and (py=2001-2010). It also selected data of
cou ntrie s like Equatorial Guinea and Papua New G uinea due to th e te rm guinea. The records o f these
tw o cou ntrie s th a t n o t resulted fro m co lla b o ra tio n w ith any W est A frican cou ntrie s w e re d e le te d fro m
o u r local database.
72 The search expression was cu=south korea and py=2001-2005.
73 The databases searched w e re Science C itation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), Social Sciences
C itation Index (SSCI), A rts & H um anities C itation Index (A&HCI), Conference Proceedings C ita tio n IndexScience (CPC1-S), Conference Proceedings C ita tion Index- Social Science & H um anities (CPCI-SSH).

213

under the label INDU-KOREA, and a foreign university (from the W est Africa or South
Korean point o f view) under UNIV-FOREIGN, etc. As a result, the inverted file contains
only the following keywords, in the alphabetic order:74 GOV-FOREIGN, GOV-KOREA,
INDU-FOREIGN, INDU-KOREA, UNIV-FOREIGN, UNIV-KOREA for the South Korean
data and, GOV-FOREIGN, GOV-WEST-AFRICA, INDU-FOREIGN, INDU-WEST-AFRICA,
UNIV-FOREIGN, UNIV- WEST-AFRICA for the W est African data.
The CDS/ISIS search functions w ere used to compute the University, Industry and
G overnm ent outputs and their bi or tri lateral collaboration data at the domestic,
foreign and global levels. The CDS/ISIS search function operates mainly over the
inverted file th at contains "searchable terms" as initially defined by the database
adm inistrator into a file called Field Selection Table (UNESCO, 1989a, p. 75). It admits
the Boolean operators OR symbolized by the sign + (plus), AND symbolized by the
character * (star) and NOT symbolized by the character A (circumflex). It also admits
free search expression and parentheses to prioritize part of a search expression and
hashtag (#) to recall a previous search by its number (UNESCO, 1989a, pp. 9 7 -1 0 5 ).
The following searches summarize the search strategy adopted (the example is based
on the South Korean case and is related to the computation of the domestic level
data (See Appendix 11):
#1: UNIV-KOREA selects all records with at least one South Korean-based university in
affiliation;
#2: INDU-KOREA selects all records with at least one South Korean-based industry in
affiliation;
#3: GOV-KOREA selects all records w ith at least one South Korean-based government
in affiliation;
#4: #1 * #2 selects all records with at least one South Korean-based university AND
one South Korean-based industry in affiliation;
#5: #1 * #3 selects all records with at least one South Korean-based university AND
one South Korean-based governm ent in affiliation;
#6: ft2 * #3 selects all records w ith at least one South Korean-based industry AND one
South Korean-based governm ent in affiliation;
#7: #1 * #2 * #3 selects all records with at least one South Korean-based university

The print service of CDS/ISIS was used to output the publication year of the searches
results into text files fo r statistical analyses with the R software (R Development Core
Team, 2 0 1 4 ); then, the repartition of records per year of publication were obtained.
The results of each stage w ere entered into a worksheet; and on a second worksheet,

74 N ot categorized addresses w e re labelled 'NC'; so th e in ve rte d file also con tain ed NC-WEST AFRICA,

9.3. Results
9.3.1. Output and international collaboration
Table 9-1 and Table 9-2 provide basic data respectively on the W est African and the
South Korean scientific publishing over the considered period of times: output,
num ber of co-authors, average number of co-authors per paper, num ber and
percentage of papers resulting from international collaboration. Over the decade,
South Korea outputs a total of 368,729 papers and W est Africa 30,717 papers; this
leads to an annual average of 38,873 papers for South Korea and 3,072 for W est

Africa. One South Korean publication out of five has at least one foreign co-author
and about half of W est African publications have at least one foreign co-author. For
both areas, the num ber of papers with at least one foreign address is increasing in
absolute value; however, the trend seems to decrease very slowly in percentage.
South Korea foreign co-authorship is more or less stable compared to W est Africa.
Both outputs increase with a linear trend (Figure 9-3 and Figure 9-4). The number of
co-authors per paper rose progressively from 2.39 in 2001 to 3.02 in 2010 in the case
of W est Africa and from 2.09 in 2001 to 2.65 in 2010 in the case of South Korea.

9.3.2. Triple Helix sectorial outputs
The University (U), Industry (I) and Government (G) and their bi or tri-lateral
collaborations (Ul, UG, IG and UIG) outputs are presented in Table 9-3, Table 9-4 and
Table 9-5 w ith regard to the level o f production (e.g. domestic (d), foreign (f) and
global (g)). These tables illustrate the problematic o f the study: fo r example, the line
labelled 2001 (cf. Table 9-3) indicates th at for the W est African region, U produces
829 publications at the domestic level, 376 publications at the foreign level and 816
publications at the global one. A closer analysis reveals that 829 -

819 = 10

publications attributed to U at the domestic level do no longer belong to this sector
at the global level. In fact, they were co-authored with other innovation actors (I or
G) from 'foreign'; so, they accounted for the collaboration of U (Ul, UG or UIG) at the
global level. For both areas, w hatever the sectorial output, the domestic value is
higher than the global one for the Triple Helix actors, but lower for their bi or
trilateral combinations (See Figure 9-5 to Figure 9-8). This result m eant th at for both
South Korea and W est Africa, the international collaboration has strengthened the
Triple Helix inter-sectorial collaboration. At the country level, University constitutes
an exception in Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia and Liberia (cf. Table 9-5).

9.3.3. Mutual information and transmission power time series
The mutual inform ation and the transmission power tim e series are presented in
Table 9-6 for W est Africa and Table 9-7 for South Korea. They are related to the
domestic, foreign and global levels. The mutual information values reveal th at there
is synergy within the considered innovation systems over the period of study at all
levels. For the tw o areas under consideration, the curves of the three levels don't
show the same relative positions over the period. In the case of South Korea, the
domestic mutual inform ation has the highest (absolute) value and decreased, except
in 2009 w here it took the m edian position. The global m utual information is low er (in
absolute value) than the domestic one over the

period; the foreign

mutual

inform ation has either the top position or the median one (Figure 9-9). In the case of
W est Africa however, the relative positions o f the curves are no longer identic (Figure
9-10). Indeed, the foreign m utual information has the highest (absolute) value except
in 2001 and 2006 w here it has the lowest. The domestic mutual inform ation has the
highest absolute value in 2001 and 2006 and keeps the median position over the rest
o f the period. The global mutual information gets the lowest absolute value over the
period except 2001 and 2006.
In summary, globally, the foreign mutual information is higher (in absolute value)
than the domestic one in the case o f W est Africa; but the South Korean innovation
system exhibits an opposite pattern. In other words, the synergy operates more at
the foreign level than at the domestic one in the case o f W est Africa but the reverse
is recorded in the case of South Korea. These results suggest th at the South Korean
domestic system is m ore integrated than the 'foreign' one and that the W est African
system is less integrated than the 'foreign' one. It means that W est Africa is very
dependent on foreign partners, whereas this is much less the case for South Korea.
At a country's level, innovation actors are submitted to the same rules and policies;
they have the same domestic socioeconomic backgrounds and research agendas. On
the other side, the foreign actors come from different countries; they are submitted
to d ifferent policies and research agendas; therefore, the cohesion in their actions
could not have the same strength as in the case of national actors. W est African
institutional partners even coming from different horizons seem more organised than
the W est Africa-based innovation actors.
At individual countries level, five countries (namely Benin, Guinea Bissau, Liberia,
M ali and Niger) have a null domestic mutual inform ation and transmission power;
the remaining countries have all negative mutual information (Table 9-8). The foreign
m utual inform ation divided the W est African countries into three classes: i) the ones
w ith negative mutual inform ation (10), ii) the ones with null mutual inform ation (2)
and iii) the ones with positive mutual inform ation (3). The foreign mutual inform ation
is higher (in absolute value) than the domestic one in four countries: Benin, M ali,
Nigeria and Senegal. W hereas Benin and

M ali

have a null domestic mutual

inform ation, Nigeria and Senegal have not. As a result, ten countries could be said

227

have an integrated national innovation system: Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote
d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Togo
The global transmission power is highest in the case of South Korea. The foreign
transmission power's relative position has changed over the period: it was the lowest
over the period, except in 2004 and 2009 where it was median; it has interchanged
its position with the domestic transmission power (Figure 9-11). The same global
trend was registered in the case of W est Africa: the global transmission power is
higher than the domestic one but the foreign changed positions over the period
(Figure 9-12). The mutual inform ation measures the quantity o f information common
to the random variables in the system (Shannon, 1948, p. 410). It then measures the
quantity of inform ation or knowledge shared within the innovation actors. The
transmission power is "the strength of the information flow within the system or
betw een its actors." (M egnigbeto, 2014a, p. 287). Therefore, the knowledge sharing
is more efficient in the global system than the domestic one, for both South Korea
and W est Africa. The global system ensures a better knowledge circulation among
innovation actors.
As we may note, the scientific production o f the African region is too weak (30,000
records in a 10-year period means 300 records a year, whereas South Korea produces
more than 30,000 records a year) to allow analyses that could yield for any definitive
conclusion. However, studying the structure of research collaboration in the W est
African region and countries may help in identifying explanation to these results.

9.3.4. Effect o f international collaboration
The effect of the international collaboration on the knowledge flow is computed in
the last columns o f Table 9-6 and Table 9-7 and displayed in Figure 9-13. If South
Korea has gained a little w ith regard to its domestic transmission power (7 - 24%,
w ith an average of 12.7% over the ten-year period), the involvement in international
collaboration has even doubled the W est African knowledge circulation capacity. The
region has gained from 5.33% to 100% of its knowledge sharing capacity with an
average of 54.04% over the 10-year period.

23 1

As regarding the effect of international collaboration, W est African countries are also
divided into three categories: i) the one comprising countries with undefined effect
because they have a null domestic transmission power (Benin, Guinea Bissau, Liberia,
M ali, and Niger), ii) the one comprising countries with a positive effect (Burkina Faso,
Cape Verde, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo), and iii) the last
comprising countries with a negative effect (Cote d'Ivoire, and Gambia). The
undefined effect is due to the formula used. The positive effect indicates that the
international collaboration has increased the knowledge flow within the considered
national innovation systems and the negative effect is quite surprising. It indicates
th at the international collaboration has decreased the rate of knowledge circulation
within the innovation system. How this might have occurred? W e should underline
th at the countries considered have a weak innovation systems and a weak scientific
output. This may limit our analysis and prevent from drawing any definite conclusion

Discussion

W est Africa and South Korea display opposite pattern with regard to the relative
positions o f the foreign and domestic mutual informations curves. Indeed, whereas
the domestic mutual information is higher in absolute value than the foreign one in
the case o f South Korea, the reverse is recorded for W est Africa. According to
(Leydesdorff, 2003, 2008), when the mutual information is negative, it indicates the
level of synergy w ithin a system, the extent to which a system is self-organized. This
result leads to the conclusion that the W est African innovation system is less
integrates than the set o f its institutional partners considered as coming from the
same country, and conversely that the South Korean innovation system is more
integrated by itself. In fact, South Korea has strengthened its national innovation
system after years of benefiting from international collaboration (Megnigbeto, under
review, 2015c, p. 21) following changes in its policies over decades (Kwon et al.,
232

2012). The stead investment in research and developm ent may have strengthened
collaboration betw een innovation actors at the country level and explains the
perform ance of South Korea (Megnigbeto, under review, 2015c, p. 21). It illustrates
the efforts made by South Korea to catch-up with leading economies (OECD, 2009, p.
13).
W est Africa is a "region" composed w ith 15 countries. It is also an economic
integration area with "supranational" institutions that have the role to conceive and
apply policies at regional level. Even though the ECOWAS has form ulated sectorial
policies (e.g. in the fields of agriculture, Industry, energy, etc.), it is recently, in 2012,
th at the

Economic Community of W est African States Policy on Science and

Technology (ECOPOST) was adopted. Actually it is hard to know the actions executed
and the progress achieved tow ard a regional innovation system. Furtherm ore, not all
ECOWAS M em b er States have a science and technology policy (Oti-Boateng, 20 1 0 ).76
Globally, the W est African national innovation system is hindered by many factors
among which are : the instability o f the institutional fram ew ork, the inadequate
coordination within the system, the lack of coordination between research programs
and research activities, the lack of optimal use of human resources and loss of
m otivation o f researchers, the lack of human and financial resources and equipm ent,
the weaknesses in the institutional fram ew ork, the lack or weaknesses in the actors
network,

Nations,

Educational,

and

Organisation,

pp.

4 -5 ;

Megnigbeto, 2013e, p. 1115). Consequently, research in this part of the world is
driven by foreign actors, and not by national or regional agendas. Even the
intraregional collaboration is driven by international organisations or institutions
w ith national representations in countries o f W est Africa (M egnigbeto, 2013e, p.
1133). That explains the high rate o f international collaboration in the W est African
science (about 50% against 21% for South Korea); that also explains why the W est
African domestic mutual information is w eaker (in absolute value) than the foreign
one.
In our interpretation, the relative positions o f the South Korean mutual inform ation
at the foreign and domestic levels seem to be the normal one. Indeed, a national
system should be m ore integrated than a set of institutions from different horizons
(nam ed here 'foreign') because the components o f the form er are ruled by the same
policies and have the same research agendas. This normal situation was also
registered by Shin et al. (2012) for Saudi Arabia.
W est Africa doesn't appear like a single unit of analysis; indeed, m em ber countries
do not exhibit the same pattern. Some are more integrated and others less than their

76 UNESCO distinguished e ig h t ECOWAS M e m b e r States in th re e groups: those w h o have na tion al STI
policy (1), in c o m p le te /n o n fu n c tio n a l o u t dated STI policies (2) and, those w ith o u t any STI policy (6) (O tiBoateng, 2010, p. 4).

partners. In other words, some countries are affected positively by international
collaboration (e.g. Burkina Faso, Ghana and Nigeria) and others negatively (e.g.
Gambia, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire). However, the size o f the data may have affected
the W est African results at both regional and national levels. Therefore, the resulting
analysis could not be confident. The large variability of the effect of international
collaboration on knowledge sharing in W est Africa is an illustration.
The main result of this research is that the international collaboration the tw o areas
under study involved in affected the synergy at their domestic level and also how
knowledge is created and flows between innovation actors. In the case o f South
Korea, international collaboration makes that the country gained about 20% of its
domestic strength o f inform ation flow. In the case of W est Africa, the effect goes up
to 100%. The relative positions of the mutual informations and the transmission
powers in the tw o areas indicate that the W est African innovation system is less
integrated than the set of its international partners.

9.5. Conclusion
The objective o f this chapter was to measure the effect of international collaboration
on the mutual inform ation and how knowledge flows among innovations actors. W e
form ulated tw o research questions: i) How to measure the synergy or knowledge
contributed to abroad by an area's innovation actors due to their relations with their
foreign partners? ii) W hat is the effect of international collaboration on knowledge
flow within an innovation system? To answer these questions, w e distinguished three
levels of analysis: the domestic one grouping innovation actors based in the country
under study, the foreign level grouping institutional partners and the global one
merging the innovations actors from both domestic and foreign levels. W e computed
the mutual information and the transmission power o f South Korea and W est Africa
for the three levels, then, w e could derive the effect of international collaboration.
W e found th at the foreign mutual information is higher (in absolute value) than the
domestic one in the case of W est Africa, and lower in the case of South Korea
meaning th at the South Korean innovation system is integrated by itself whereas the
W est African is less integrated th at its foreign system. W e also found th at in the tw o
areas, the global transmission power is higher than the domestic one meaning that
international collaboration has strengthened knowledge sharing at the domestic
level; in other words, the tw o areas has benefited from international collaboration in
term of knowledge flow.
However, because mutual information measures information sharing, our study
could not indicate the direction of the exchange. Indeed, by being involved in
international collaboration,

a country contributes to

knowledge creation and

circulation; by the same way, it receives knowledge from its partners as well;
therefore, the effect of the international collaboration is both the contribution of the
country and w hat he gains.

Conclusions

This thesis aims to measure the contribution of research to innovation. It uses the
Triple Helix model of innovation, which postulates that innovation results from
collaboration

betw een

three

main

actors,

namely

University,

Industry

and

Governm ent. The geographical fram ew ork for this thesis comprises the 15 W est
African countries, all members of the Economic Community o f the W est African
States (ECOWAS), the largest regional integration space in this part of Africa.

10.1. Recall oftheobjectivesandresearchquestions
The specific objectives o f this thesis are to:
1.

describe the landscape of scientific publishing in W est Africa by analysing the
scientific output o f the region with respect to annual research output,
language and publication type, scientific fields and co-authorship.

2.

study the collaboration pattern in W est African scientific publishing by
determ ining the annual collaboration rates o f the W est African countries and
the main partner countries of W est Africa in term s of country, region as well
as continent;

3.

determ ine the extent to which W est African innovation actors collaborate
towards knowledge creation and sharing both at country level and regional
level;

4.

propose a method to measure knowledge circulation among innovation
actors; and,

5.

measure the extent to which knowledge is created and shared between
innovation actors both at individual country level and regional level.

In order to

attain

these

objectives,

the

following

research

questions

w ere

form ulated:
6.

W h at are the characteristics o f the scientific output in W est Africa?

7.

To which extent do W est African countries collaborate with each other or
w ith the rest o f the world regarding scientific publishing?

8.

How do innovation actors collaborate in scientific publishing in W est Africa?

9.

How can knowledge circulation among the innovation actors be measured?

10. How

is knowledge

produced

and

circulated

within

the

W est African

innovation systems?
Bibliographic references of the scientific publications o f the W est African countries
over a 10-year period (2001-2010) w ere collected from the W eb of Science, an
international multidisciplinary database. The landscape of scientific publishing in
235

W est Africa was described and intraregional and international collaboration as well
as collaboration betw een the main innovation actors (University, Industry and
Governm ent) w ere depicted. Next, the transmission power was proposed as an
indicator of the Triple Helix relationships. This indicator was used to measure the
knowledge flow within the W est African innovation systems. Together with the
mutual inform ation, the transmission power was used in this thesis to study the
profiles of six OECD countries (USA, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and South
Korea); possible correlations with indicators used in knowledge-based economy
assessment w ere

investigated.

Finally,

a

method

to

compute

the

effect of

international collaboration on knowledge flow in an economy was proposed.

10.2. ResearchlandscapeinWestAfrica
Chapter 3 provides an answer to the first research question "W hat are the
characteristics o f the scientific output in W est Africa?". The indicators used to
describe the landscape o f research are annual output, language and type of
production, field of production, co-authorship, international collaboration rate, main
partner countries, citable documents and h-index.
W est Africa produced approximately 30,000 records (or 3,000 publications/year)
over the decade 2001-2010. The production curve shows a linear increasing trend
over this 10-year period. Nigeria, due to the size of its population and its larger
num ber o f (both public and private) universities, is the biggest science producer in
W est Africa, accounting for more than half (55%) o f the total regional output. Ghana
is ranked second (11%), followed by Senegal (9%), Cote d'Ivoire (6%) and Burkina
Faso (6%). Together, these top-5 countries produced approximately 9 out of 10 W est
Africa-based papers, with the remaining 10 countries hence accounting for less than
10% of the region's production. These statistics show that the distribution of
scientific output among the W est African countries is highly skewed. The (vast)
m ajority of the publications are articles that are w ritten in English and belong to the
fields of Medicine and health sciences and N atural sciences. There is an increasing
trend towards co-authored papers within the region with half of the papers being coÂ­
authored w ith at least one non-W est African researcher. The main partner countries
are European and North American countries. Colonial ties explain the ranking of
France and the United Kingdom as the top partners of the region.
Almost all W est African publications are citable and approximately 60% received at
least one citation. Overall, cited documents received an average of 10 citations; the
median citation is 4, i.e., half of the cited documents received no more than 4
citations and the other half received at least 4 citations. The h-index of the West
African scientific output over the period 2001-2010 is 100.
W est Africa performs less well than Brazil, Russia, India, China or South Africa, taken
individually, as far as its annual research output is concerned. Indeed, its annual
production amounts to 3,000 W eb of Science-indexed documents, whereas Brazil

236

produced nine times, Russia ten times, India eleven times, China forty times and
South Africa twice as many papers. W est Africa's science depends more on
international collaboration - mainly with W estern countries - than Brazil, Russia,
India, China or South Africa. This lesser performance of the region is explained by
poor investments in science, technology and innovation: Africa in general has the
weakest research infrastructure as compared with other continents, which is why
W est African researchers need to collaborate more with non-African researchers to
benefit from funding or infrastructures to maintain their research capacity and
advance in grade. As a consequence, W est African countries cooperate less with each
another.

10.3. ResearchcollaborationinWestAfrica
Chapter 4 offers an answer to the second research question: "To which extent do
W est African countries collaborate with each other or with the rest of the world
regarding scientific publishing?".
Over the 10-year period of study, the share of W est African papers with only one
author has diminished, whereas that of papers with six or more authors has
increased; this trend illustrates the increased importance of collaboration in scientific
publishing w ithin the region. W est Africa shares half of its publications w ith nonW est African countries. Over the period o f study, the num ber of papers resulting
from international collaboration has increased, whereas the percentage curve shows
a slow decrease. W est Africa's main partner countries on the continent are South
Africa (in the Southern Africa region), Cameroon (in the Central Africa region) and
Kenya and Tanzania (in the Eastern Africa region). The main non-African partner
countries are France, USA and the United Kingdom, together accounting for over 63%
of the papers w ith a non-W est African address. The international collaboration rate
at the individual country level varies largely: 28% for Nigeria vs. >70% for each of the
remaining countries. Some countries like Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone
share m ore than 90% of their publications with their partner countries. The main
partner countries o f individual W est African members remain the W estern countries
w ith, at the top, the form er colonial powers.
W est African countries cooperate less with each other (about 5% in average) and less
w ith African and developing countries than they do with developed ones. The
intraregional collaboration rate for individual countries varies from 3% to 31%. The
weakest rate is registered for Nigeria and the highest for Niger.

10.4. Collaborationbetweeninnovationactors
The third research question: "How do innovation actors collaborate in scientific
publishing in W est Africa?" is dealt with in Chapter 5.

237

The scientific output in W est Africa over the period 2001-2010 was produced by
around 5,000 research institutions -b o th W est Africa-based and non-W est Africabased. M ore than half are universities, approx. 40% are governmental bodies, less
than 2% have industrial affiliations, and the remaining are non-governmental
organisations,

international organisations or

non-classified

institutions.

At the

regional level, University is the biggest science producer (around 60%) followed by
Governm ent (41%) and Industry (1%); however, at the national levels, Governm ent is
the top inform ation producer in the majority of countries. The industrial share is very
negligible because Industry in W est Africa, due to various barriers, does not
contribute much to research activities.
Taking into account W est Africa-based affiliations only, University produced ~ 70% of
the regional scientific papers, Government ~ 32% and Industry 0.52% . The research
output of these three main innovation actors is increasing, although the num ber of
industrial

publications

is still

negligible.

Consequently,

bilateral

collaboration

betw een University and Government is more visible than th at betw een University or
Governm ent and Industry. Collaboration between the three Triple Helix spheres was
found only in Nigeria, which is the biggest science producer in the region and also the
first economy o f Africa - and hence also of the region - in term s o f GDP.
The mutual inform ation, which indicates the level of synergy betw een University,
Industry and Governm ent, varies from - 1 3 to - 3 2 millibits of information, with an
average o f - 19 millibits over the decade. The synergy between innovation actors in
W est Africa is weak compared to that o f other countries like India ( - 7 8 millibits) or
South Korea (-2 5 3 millibits), illustrating the low level of knowledge flow among
actors in the region as far as scientific publishing is concerned. The weak production
of the industrial sector affected its collaboration with University and Governm ent
and hence also impacted on the knowledge production and circulation among the
innovation actors in the region.
At the individual country level, all 15 ECOWAS M em b er States have data on
University-Government collaborations, whereas Industry established relations with
Governm ent or University only in Nigeria and Ghana, the region's tw o largest
inform ation producers.

10.5. Transmissionpowerasanindicatorofknowledgecirculation
In Chapter 6, we introduce the notion o f transmission power as an indicator to
measure the knowledge flow within an innovation system. The chapter provides an
answer to the fourth research question: "How can knowledge circulation among the
innovation actors be measured?".
From a communication netw ork point of view, the University-lndustry-Government
relationship system can be considered as an information source. An information
source composed w ith n random variables may be split into 2n or 2 n - 1 "states",

238

allowing calculation of the maximum entropy of the source, which is log(n). The
mutual information depends on the values of the considered variables. In three
dimensions, w here the mutual information may be positive or negative, its upper
bound is the system's entropy and the lower bound the system's entropy minus the
sum o f each variable's entropies. The transmission power is proposed as an indicator
o f the Triple Helix o f University-lndustry-Government relationships. It is equal to the
division of the mutual inform ation by its upper bound if positive and by its lower
bound if negative. In this sense, the transmission power is the normalisation of the
m utual information; it represents the fraction of the maximum value o f the mutual
inform ation produced in a system. In other words, the transmission power is the part
of the system's sharable inform ation capacity that is really shared; it may be
expressed as a percentage and measures the knowledge or inform ation circulation
rate within an innovation system.

10.6. KnowledgeflowwithintheWestAfricaninnovationsystem
Chapter 7 computed the transmission power for the W est African region over the
period 2001-20 10 in order to measure the knowledge flow betw een University,
Industry and G overnm ent at both national and regional levels, and as such provides
an answer to the fifth research question "How is knowledge produced and circulated
within the W est African innovation systems?".
The results are indicative of the existence of synergy betw een the three actors, both
at the regional and the national level. The transmission power varies from 2 to 6%,
i.e., only 2 to 6% o f the sharable information produced over the period 2001-2010
within the W est African innovation system at the regional level is actually distributed.
Over the decade, the average value of the transmission power is 3.75%, illustrating
the low level of knowledge flow among actors in the region as far as scientific
publishing is concerned. At individual country level, the transmission power varies
from 0 to 25%. The highest value is registered for Cape-Verde (24.51% ), followed by
Sierra Leone (12.08% ), Guinea (11.06% ), Ghana (8.03%), Nigeria (7.58% ), Togo
(2.49% ), Senegal (1.61% ),

Burkina

Faso (1%) and

Cote d'Ivoire

(0.87% ). The

transmission power o f the six remaining countries (Benin, Gambia, Guinea Bissau,
Liberia, and M ali) is zero, meaning that there is no information exchange within the
innovation system o f these countries, possibly as a consequence of the extraversion
o f the research system within the region.

10.7. Transmissionpowerandtheknowledge-basedeconomy
According to the Triple Helix theory, the mutual information is an indicator of the
extent to which an economy is knowledge-based; therefore, the transmission power
can be considered for the same purpose. Chapter 8 also contributes to answering the
fifth research question "How is knowledge produced and circulated within the W est
African innovation systems?".

239

M utual information and transmission power were used to profile six OECD members
(USA and Canada in North America, France and Germany in Europe, and Japan and
South Korea in Asia). The analyses focused on possible correlations between the
transmission power and a num ber of indicators used to measure the knowledgebased economy (GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, number of researchers, GERD, HDI
and TFP). The results showed th at the six countries do not have the same pattern
with regard to the selected indicators: while some countries exhibit a positive
correlation regarding transmission power and a particular indicator, others show a
negative correlation between transmission power and the same indicator. However,
Japan and South Korea exhibit a strong positive correlation between transmission
power and GERD on the one hand and transmission power and number of
researchers on the other hand; they also display similar patterns when correlations
w ith other selected indicators are considered. The specific situation of these tw o
countries is due to the preponderance of domestic co-authorship in Japanese science
and the efforts o f strengthening the national innovation system at the South Korean
level. In contrast, the four other countries are influenced by the international
collaboration they are involved in.
The results did not allow to infer any evident relation between transmission power
and the selected indicators, possibly because the transmission power captures a
dynamic th at is lacking in the other indicators. However, the results did reveal that
the transmission power as measured by the method used provides information at
country level only and is not appropriate to measure the added value o f University,
Industry and Governm ent relationships created at the international level. Therefore,
it cannot be used for absolute comparison of countries unless the synergy created
abroad

is

taken

into

account

by

including

University-lndustry-Government

relationships at the international level.

10.8. International collaboration and knowledge flow
Chapter 9 equally deals w ith the answering the fifth research question "How is
knowledge produced and circulated within the W est African innovation systems?".
Three levels of analysis are distinguished to determ ine the effect of international
collaboration on knowledge flow: the domestic level pooling the innovation actors
within one country under study, the foreign level grouping the institutional partners
and the global level merging the innovation actors from both domestic and foreign
levels. The mutual information and transmission power were computed for South
Korea and W est Africa for the three levels over a ten-year period (2001-2010);
subsequently, the effect of international collaboration was calculated. The foreign
mutual

inform ation

is higher (in

absolute value)

than

the

domestic

mutual

information for W est Africa, and lower for South Korea, i.e., the South Korean
innovation system is integrated by itself, whereas the W est African one is less
integrated than its foreign system. In the tw o areas, the global transmission power is
higher

than

the

domestic

transmission

240

power,

implying

that

international

collaboration has strengthened knowledge sharing at the domestic level; in other
words, both South Korea and the W est African

region have benefited from

international collaboration in term of knowledge flow. The results show th at 3 to 7%
of the sharable knowledge is really shared in the W est African region. This share
increases to 3-10% when the effect of international collaboration is considered.
Both domestic and foreign actors benefit from collaborations in the tw o areas in
term s of knowledge sharing. Indeed, by being involved in international collaboration,
a country contributes to knowledge creation and distribution and, in turn, also
receives knowledge from its partners; therefore, the effect of the international
collaboration is dual: it is reflected in w hat the country contributes and in w hat it
gains.

10.9. Contribution of this thesis to the advancement of science
According to the Triple Helix model, the knowledge th at circulates within a system
contributes to the production o f innovation. Our work consists in building an
indicator to assess the am ount of knowledge that is distributed among the
innovation actors. In this sense, taking publications as unit of analysis, the global
transmission power, expressed as a percentage of the total sharable knowledge,
allows us to measure the am ount of knowledge shared within an innovation system.
The transmission power, expressed as a percentage, is based on the mutual
inform ation used up to th at point to characterize the relationships betw een
University, Industry and Government. The mutual inform ation is a scalar: it can be
positive or negative. If it is positive, it indicates the extent to which an innovation
system is centrally-controlled; if it is negative, it indicates the level o f synergy within
an innovation system. Consequently, the lower the mutual inform ation, the higher
the synergy within the system. W e dem onstrate that the mutual information has
low er and upper bounds th at also depend on the output of each sector and th eir bior trilateral collaboration; therefore, the variability of the mutual information
depends on the variable considered. The transmission power is the normalisation of
the mutual information; indeed, it is the mutual information divided by its lower
bound when it is negative and by its upper bound when it is positive. The mutual
inform ation is the fraction of the maximum mutual information th at is really
produced and shared within the system. Therefore, it is the fraction o f the
inform ation sharing capacity that is really shared within the system. W e use it as an
indicator o f knowledge flow w ithin an innovation system.
However, the mutual inform ation at the domestic level does not tell us how much
the innovation actors o f a given country contribute to the production of knowledge
at the foreign level as a result of the international collaborations they are involved in.
Therefore, we propose the global transmission power, which integrates both the
domestic and foreign transmission power. The global transmission power is then
higher than the

domestic transmission

241

power and

indicates the

quantity of

knowledge th at circulates within an innovation system. It is an indicator of the extent
to which an economy is knowledge-based.
W hen the mutual inform ation or the transmission power is computed as done in
several studies, the synergy or the knowledge contributed by the innovation actors of
a country at the international level as a result of international collaboration remains
unconsidered. W e have built a method that takes into account this kind of synergy or
knowledge. W e argue th at our method more faithfully reflects the real properties of
an innovation system in term of synergy and knowledge flow and that it can be used
fo r comparison purposes. Applying our method to the W est African region and South
Korea revealed th at the South Korean innovation system is more integrated by itself,
whereas the W est African one is less integrated than the set of its foreign
institutional partners, illustrating the strong dependence of science in W est Africa on
international

collaboration.

Another conclusion that can

be drawn

from

our

comparative analysis is th at international collaboration has strengthened knowledge
sharing at the domestic level for both South Korea and W est Africa, be it to a
different extent; in other words, both areas have benefited from international
collaboration in term of knowledge flow.
The main contributions of this work to the advancement of science are twofold: i)
application o f the transmission power as an indicator of knowledge production and
sharing within an innovation system and ii) the distinction between domestic, foreign
and global levels when computing the influence of international collaboration on
knowledge creation and sharing within innovation actors at the individual country
level.

Discussion

Similar to/Building on the non-linear model of innovation, the Triple Helix theory
postulates that innovation results from the interactions between three main actors,
i.e.,

University,

Industry

and

Government.

The

system

ensures

knowledge

production, w ealth generation and political control (Leydesdorff, 2016, p. 19).
Particularly, the Triple

Helix model

postulates that the

interactions between

University, Industry and Government maintain a knowledge infrastructure that
generates knowledge whose circulation among innovation actors leads to innovation
(Leydesdorff & Etzkowitz, 2001). It focuses on the "overlay of communications and
expectation" th at reshapes the institutional arrangements among actors (Etzkowitz &
Leydesdorff, 2000, p. 109).
The concept of interaction between innovation actors includes three basic ideas
(OECD, 2002a, p. 15): i) competition, which is the interactive process where the
actors are rivals and which creates the incentives for innovation; ii) transaction,
which is the process by which goods and services, including technology embodied
and tacit knowledge, are traded between economic actors; and iii) networking, which
is the process by which knowledge is transferred through collaboration, co-operation

242

and

long

term

network

arrangements.

The

Triple

Helix

model

emphasizes

collaboration.
The mutual inform ation was used as an indicator of the Triple Helix relationships. It
measures the level of synergy when it is negative, or how centrally controlled an
innovation system is when it is positive. A negative mutual information value means
the absence o f dom ination of one actor over the tw o others; each acts autonomously
within the legal fram ew ork to achieve its goals. Together with it partners, each
innovation actor therefore collaborates to produce knowledge and share it in order
to produce innovation; the economy is "knowledge-based". W hen the Governm entIndustry relations dom inate other bilateral relationships, the economy is a "political
economy" (Khan & Park, 2011, p. 2453; Park et al., 2005).
The values o f the W est African regional mutual information vary from - 2 4 to - 6
millibits of information, indicating the existence of synergy betw een innovation
actors. At country level, not all innovation systems exhibit synergy. The transmission
power defined as the normalisation of the mutual inform ation varies from 0 to 1 or
from 0 to 100 if expressed as a percentage. It indicates the efficiency in information
sharing betw een the Triple Helix actors or the strength of information or knowledge
circulation among the innovation actors. W est Africa's transmission power values
over the period 2001-20 10 varied from 5 to 9%, i.e. 5 to 9% of the sharable
inform ation available within the W est African region was actually shared at the
regional level. In comparison, the South Korean transmission power values varied
from 10 to 19% over the same period, i.e. twice the W est African information flow.
International collaboration is known to influence knowledge flows, leading to the
introduction of global, domestic and foreign mutual information and transmission
power. According to Leydesdorff (2003), the mutual information does not only
measure the level o f synergy within an innovation system but also the level of
integration o f the actors within th at system. Consequently, the distinction between
domestic, foreign and global mutual information allows us to compare the level of
integration of the W est African University, Industry and Governm ent system with
th a t o f their institutional partners, and the distinction betw een domestic, foreign and
global transmission power enables us to measure how knowledge flows at the
domestic

level and w hat the

influence o f the

institutional

partners

is. Our

com parative analysis revealed th at the institutional partners of South Korea are less
integrated than its domestic innovation actors, whereas the opposite holds true for
W est Africa. Accordingly, W est Africa has doubled its transmission power due to its
external scientific relations, whereas South Korea has gained only up to 20% due to
international collaboration.
W est Africa's specific profile with regard to the indicators of the Triple Helix (mutual
inform ation and transmission power) results from a num ber of problems related to
Science, Technology and Innovation in the region. W hereas African countries have
hardly invested in Science, Technology and Innovation, South Korea has strengthened
its economy by investing heavily in research and innovation. For example, the GERD

243

of the W est African countries is still a long way from the target of 1%, while South
Korea's GERD amounts to > 3.75% in 2010, which is far ahead of that of Japan (3%),
Germany and USA (2.5%), France 2.25% and Canada (1.8%) (cf. OECD, 2014a).
Considering the above-m entioned

hindrances to the developm ent of Science,

Technology and Innovation in W est Africa, we cannot really speak of the existence of
an innovation system in the true sense at the regional level. At individual country
level, "the image of an assemblage o f fragile, somewhat disconnected and constantly
under-resourced institutions is perhaps a more apt m etaphor to describe the science
arrangements" (M outon, 2007, p. 15; M outon & Waast, 2008, p. 39, 2009, p. 167).
Indeed, a "system is a complex whole"; it requires not only individual elements, but
coordination among them and sufficient means to make it function. An innovation
system needs a legislative and institutional fram ework, sufficient equipm ent, human
and financial resources as well as a solid agenda. At the W est African regional level,
there is a policy document, the ECOWAS Policy on Science and Technology, and a
Commissioner is in charge of STI. However, the relations between the Commission
and the national ministries in charge of research have not been defined to date:
moreover, in 2016, the ECOWAS Commission is still seeking foreign financial
assistance in order to im plem ent the document policy conceived for the period 20132017.
As underlined previously, W est Africa lacks human resources and research is mainly
funded by foreign donors. Additionally, the region's research institutions and
researchers are more instrumental in executing the activities pertaining to the
partner's agendas than implementing their own agenda or th at of their countries.
Therefore, the "research system could collapse with the withdrawal of foreign
partners" (Commission de la CEDEAO, 2012, p. 40). A few of the ECOWAS countries,
like Burkina Faso, have a solid national research system (Commission de la CEDEAO,
2012). In general, developing countries im itate developed ones "rather slavishly and
uncritically" (M outon, 2007; M outon & Waast, 2008, p. 37, 2009) but cannot always
act like them .
The research and innovation problems in Africa listed in this thesis explain the lower
output of African countries in general and W est African ones in particular. For
instance, the entire African continent produces ~ 1% of the global scientific output,
while the Netherlands, a European country, produces more than the entire African
continent (UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2005). If the W est African scientific output
compared to the global output is low, the output of the Triple Helix actors is even
lower; the industrial output in particular is negligible as a consequence of the low
industrial developm ent within the area, even though the region is endowed with
natural resources, which are extracted, exported to and processed in Western
countries. Only the M edical and Health Sciences, N atural Sciences and Agricultural
Sciences are developed within the region as a consequence of lack of industrialisation
and a legacy of the priorities colonial powers had given to science in the colonies.
A fter their independence, however, African countries have not succeeded in boosting

244

their industrialisation due to lack of sufficient investments in infrastructure and
energy as shown by the Logistics Performance Index (Arvis et al., 2014).
Our analysis of applying the transmission power to the W est African case, both at the
regional and the national level, is based on limited data, which is why caution needs
to be exercised when interpreting the W est African data only. To overcome this
problem , w e included South Korea in our analysis, yielding more robust results and
perm itting a long term analysis compared to the W est African case both at the
domestic and the global level. The same applies to the effect of international
collaboration on the distribution of knowledge.

10.11.

Limitations of the study

The data analysed within the fram ew ork of this thesis are collected from an
international database, the W eb of Science. This database has been criticised for its
bias towards the industrialised world and publications w ritten in English (see e.g.
Moravcsik, 1988). The geographic area covered in this thesis is W est Africa, a region
categorized within the developing world and composed of 7 English-speaking
countries and 8 French- and Portuguese-speaking countries. Consequently, the
scientific production o f this part o f the world is not fully searchable via the W eb of
Science. O f the 15 W est African countries, only Nigeria has 7 journals indexed in the
W eb o f Science. Therefore, the collected bibliographic data are those of W est African
scientists who appear mainly in journals based in Anglo-Saxon or W est European
countries.
Furtherm ore, it should be noted th at the W est African region is not a big science
producer. As a consequence, its bibliographic data are very limited for many Triple
Helix sectors. Therefore, any conclusion drawn needs to be interpreted with caution.
This is why w e decided to include data on another country, South Korea, to compute
the effects o f international collaboration on knowledge flow and compare these
results w ith those of the region. Our comparative analysis shows that the South
Korean situation is more stable than that o f W est Africa, because data for South
Korea are seven tim es more extensive than those on W est Africa.
A third lim itation to this thesis pertains to the unit of analysis. Research encompasses
many activities among which publications. Publications are merely one outcom e of
research activities, next to, for example, patents. All the variants of the non-linear
model o f innovation consider innovation as a result of collaborations betw een
University, Industry and Government, the main innovation actors. Collaborations
betw een these actors do not take the form o f publications only. As pointed out by
Katz and M artin (1997), research collaboration does not necessarily always lead to
publications. In addition, collaboration between innovation actors may not only
involve research activities, but also take the form of training, equipm ent, etc. As
M ugabe (2011, p. 4) underlined, "linkages in a national system of innovation usually
take different forms, including: joint research projects among public R&D institutions,

245

joint technology developm ent and transfer activities betw een public and private
sector institutions, mobility and exchange of scientists and engineers, technology
licensing agreements, and the sharing of information and technology infrastructure.
Assessing the performance of a national system of innovation entails tracing the
various institutional links and measuring the intensity of the interactions among
various knowledge producers and economic actors." Therefore, the knowledge flow
measured in this thesis does not represent the entire spectrum, since its covers only
one aspect of collaboration.
The method used in this thesis here may also apply to patent data or other research
outcomes, and one may also combine several research products in order to measure
the circulation of knowledge globally within an innovation system.

Policy implications of this study

Taking into account the results of this thesis, the limitations o f the study and the
specific

problems

regarding

research,

innovation,

universities,

industry

and

governance in W est Africa, w e form ulate the following recommendations. In order to
facilitate efficient contribution of research to the advancement of the region, we
suggest that:
i.

the national authorities of countries lacking a proper Science, Technology
and Innovation policy take the necessary steps to im plem ent such a policy;

ii.

the

national authorities of countries with

a Science, Technology and

Innovation policy update it on a regular basis;
iii.

national authorities allocate the necessary means for the execution of
established research programmes;

iv.

national authorities express their com m itm ent to appropriate at least 1% of
their GDP for science and technology funding;

v.

both

national and

regional authorities set up dedicated

authoritative

institutions for Science, Technology and Innovation;
vi.

regional authorities encourage and fund research activities that involve
several institutions from different W est African countries in order to increase
intra-regional scientific collaboration;

vii.

regional integration institutions create a regional database indexing scientific
output published in regional sources as well as the output o f researchers
originating from W est Africa but published in foreign sources;

viii.

both national and regional authorities to invest in higher education and
research institutions and as such contribute to Science, Technology and
Innovation policy form ulation and im plem entation at the national and the
regional level;

246

ix.

political leaders, scientists and the private sector com m it themselves to
cooperate in order to foster Science, Technology and Innovation in the W est
African region;

x.

both national and regional authorities allocate sufficient financial resources
to Science, Technology and Innovation on a programme basis

xi.

both national and regional authorities clearly define sound research and
innovation strategies or policies with clear indication of measurable targets
and the role to be played by each stakeholder.

10.13.

Directions for future research

This thesis proposed the transmission power as a metric for knowledge flow within
an innovation system. This metric was applied to the case of W est Africa and South
Korea

and the

effect of international

collaboration

on

knowledge flow

was

determ ined.
In order to measure the knowledge production and circulation, w e applied the
mutual inform ation, which is related to Shannon's information theory. However, in
m ore than tw o dimensions, like in the case o f the Triple Helix relationships, the
mutual inform ation may be negative and as such is no longer valid as a Shannon-type
measure. Krippendorf (2009a, 2009b) warned that the mutual information does not
measure the unique interaction information in more than tw o dimensions; instead he
proposed the interaction information, an indicator which is positive or null. However,
Leydesdorff and Park (2014) argued th at the mutual inform ation, which measures
both the negative synergy and the positive correlation in such a system, is a valid
indicator to measure the synergy and the extent to which an economy is knowledgebased. The interaction information proposed by Krippendorff (2009a, 2009b) may be
analysed for comparison purposes. The transmission pow er based on the interaction
inform ation may then be determ ined and the correlation w ith the transmission
pow er based on the mutual information studied can be assessed.
Because collaboration in science is symmetric - e.g. when Country A collaborates
w ith Country B, Country B also collaborates with country A with an equal num ber of
papers - our calculation does not take into account the direction of the exchange,
i.e., the am ount of knowledge th at flows from Country A to Country B is identical to
th at flowing in the reverse direction.
Recently, Yuret (2016) introduced the notion of direction in knowledge sharing based
on co-authorship; he distinguished im port and export of ideas. Following this theory,
one may compute the outgoing and the incoming am ount o f knowledge an area
imports or exports and, as a result, the outgoing and the incoming knowledge flows
using the transmission power. In this way, one could determ ine if an area is a net
im porter or exporter o f knowledge within a period of tim e.

Txyz = (H x ~ H x y ) + (H y - H YZ) + ( H z - H Xz ) + HXyz

(13-2)

or
T xyz = (H x â H Xz ) + ( H y â H x y ) + (H z â H YZ) + H XYz

(13-3)

Equations (1 3 -2 ) and (1 3 -3 ) are equivalent (See Appendix 13)
Equation (1 3 -2 ) leads to
Txyz = - ( H Xy -

Hx)

- ( H YZ - H Y) - ( H xz - H z ) + H XYZ

(13-4)

The system's entropy minus one variable's entropy gives the second variable
conditional entropy. The formula is (Shannon, 1948)
H xy "

H x = H Y,X

(1 3 -5 )

Similarly,
H yz - H y = HZ|y

(13-6)

and
Hxz â H z = H*|z

(13-7)

Thus, we can w rite Equation (1 3 -4 ) as follows:
T xyz = âHY|X - HZ|Y - HX|Z + H XYz
The bilateral conditional entropies HX|z,

(13-8)
H Y jx

and HZ|Y are all positive; therefore, their

opposites-HX|z, âHY|x and - H Z|Y are all negative, so is the quantity - HX|Z- HY)XâHZ|Y.
Because

is positive, it appears like the upper bound to TXYZ in Equation (13-6).

Furtherm ore, the bilateral conditional transmissions may be null. So, we can write:
1X YZ

< H Xyz

(1 3 -9 )

T Xy =

(1 3 -1 0 )
277

Thus,
HX|y =

H x - T xy

(13-11)

Equation (13-11) allows writing that
H x ,y < H x

(13-12)

Therefore,
H Y|X < H y

(13-13)

H Z|Y < H z

(13-14)

HX|z â Hx

(13-15)

Thus, the sum of Equations (13-13), (13-14) and (13-15) gives:
Hy|x + H Z|Y + H X|Z <

Hx + HY + Hz

(13-16)

The negation of Equation (13-16) gives:
â H x âH y â H z <

âH Y|x ~ H Z|y â H X|Z

(13-17)

Adding HXYZ to the right and left terms of Equation (13-17) gives:
â H x âH y â H z +

H XYz ^ âH Y|x â H Z|y â HX|Z + H XYz

(13-18)

The right term o f Equation (13-18) represents TXYZ(cf. Equation (13-8)). It comes
that:
â H x âH y â H z +

HXYz ^ TXYz

(13-19)

And finally, w e can w rite, from Equations (13-9) and (13-19):
H xyz

â Hx â H y - H z <

Txyz ^ H xyz

(13-20)

In conclusion, the lower bound to the three dimensional transmission is the system's
entropy (or the joint entropy of the three variables) minus each of the three marginal
entropies and the upper bound to the three dimensional transmission is the system's
entropy.

Appendix4Computingsectorial,bi ortri-dimensional entropies
andtransmissions
Let us consider a University-lndustry-Government system w here the outputs are as
follows: University (U) alone: 125 units, Industry (I) alone: 25 units, Governm ent (G)
alone: 75 units, University and Industry (Ul): 20 units, University and Governm ent
(UG): 50 units, Industry and Governm ent (IG): 15 units, University, Industry and
G overnm ent (UIG): 10 units.

Case 1: The two-dimensional system S = (U, I)
Because data are given for a trilateral system, w e need, first, to proceed to some
corrections for determ ining the right output o f U alone, I alone and the joint output
o f U and I in the bilateral system S = (U,l). For the correction purpose, to avoid
confusion betw een term s, we index output with the system's dimension; so that, U2
means U in a two-dim ensional system and l3 means I in a three-dimensional one.
Referring to Figure 6-2, w e can write: U2 = U3 + UG3, l2 = l3 + IG3 and Ul2 = Ul3 + UIG3.
Therefore, U2 = 125 + 50 = 175 units, l2 = 25 + 15 = 40 units and Ul2 = 20 + 10 = 30
units. The total output o f the system S = (U, I) is then T = U2 + l2 + Ul2 = 245 units.
Returning to the standard notation, we can w rite for the two-dimensional system
th at U = 175 units, I = 40 units and Ul = 30 units. Therefore, the probability th at U
175

only produces is p(U = 1 , 1 = 0) = â ; the probability th at I only produces is p(l = 1, U =
245

0) =

the probability th at U and I produce jointly is p(U = 1, I = 1) =â . In this

particular case, the probability that neither U nor I produce is p (U = 0 ,1=0) = 0. W e can
check th at p (U = l, 1=0) + p (l= l, U=0) + p(U = 1 , 1 = 1) + p (U = 0 ,1=0) = ^

0 = â

= 1. W e derive the entropy of the system S = (U, I) using the formula in

Equation (6-2) which leads to Hs = 1.145 bits. Then Table 13-1 follows:

By definition, the conditional entropy HX|Y is (Yeung, 2001, p. 12, 2008, p. 14):
H X|Y

= Zx,y p(x,y) X log2p(x|y) = - E y p(y) X HX|Y=y

(13-21)

Because HX|Y is a positive scalar (Yeung, 2001, p. 12, 2008, p. 14), it is null if and only

Replacing Equation (13-27) into Equation (13-26) gives
Hy = HY|X + Hx - HX|Y

(13-28)

Therefore,
Hx|y =

Hx â HY + HY|X

(13-29)

Hy|x =

HY â Hx + HY|X

(13-30)

Subtracting Equation (13-30) from Equation (13-29) leads to:
HX|y -

Hy|x = 2(Hx - Hy)

(13-31)

Similarly,
HY|z H Z |X

HZ|y = 2 (H Y - Hz)

(13-32)

Summing up Equations (13-31), (13-32) and (13-33) leads to:
H x \y ~ H y\x + HY|z â Hziy + Hz\x ~ Hx|z = 0

(13-34)

which may also be written as follows:
(H xlY + Hy|z + Hzlx) - (HYlx + HZ|Y + Hx,z) = 0

(13-35)

According to System of equations (6-36), HX|Y = HY|Z = Hzjx = 0; therefore, Equation (13-35) is
equivalent to
ffy|x + HZ|Y + HX|Z = 0.

(13-36)

Because conditional entropies are necessary positive, Equation (13-36) means that each of its
terms is null; therefore, HX|Z = 0, HY|X = 0 and HZ|Y = 0 which is the System of equations (636). An analogous logical reasoning on System of equations (6-37) results in System of
equations (6-37). So, the two are equivalent.

Appendix 8. Demonstrating how trilateral entropy could be
equal to bilateral entropy.
Let us consider a three-dimensional system of university-industry-government
relationships S = (U, I, G). Let us suppose that the seven engendered sets'
cardinalities are: U = a, G = 3, UG = y, I = 6, (a, (3, y and 6 > 0) and Ul = IG = UIG = 0.
The cardinality of the considered universal set is T = a + 3 + y + 6. Therefore, using
form ula in Equation (), the entropy of the system is

H u ig =

j lt ) g 2 ~

^ lt ) g 2

^ )o g 2 ~

~ lo g 2 ~

Hereafter, we consider the three two-dimensional systems derived from the threedimensional one which are university-industry (Ul), university-government (UG) and
industry-government (IG). W e calculate the non-empty sets' cardinality (Table 13-12)
using the method indicated in (Megnigbeto 2014). Figure 13-1 gives an illustration.

Appendix13EquivalencebetweenEquations(13-2)and(13-3)
Equation (13-3) is TXYZ = (Hx â Hxz) + (H Y â HXY) + (H z - HYZ) + HXYZ.
It leads to
TXyz - ( _ HXz + Hx) + ( - H xy + HY) + (

HyZ + Hz) + HXYZ

(13-37)

and
Txyz = âHZ|X â HX|Y â HY|Z+ Hxyz

(13-38)

According to Equation (13-5), H x y - Hx = H Y|X . Similarly,
Hxy â Hy = HX|Y

(13-39)

The expression of HX|Ydrawn from Equation (13-5) gives
H xy = H y ,x + Hx

(13-40)

Replacing Equation (13-40) into (13-39) leads to
H X|y = H Y|x + H x - H y

(13-41)

W e could w rite, similarly:
Hz|X = H x|z + H z - H x

(13-42)

and
Hy|z = H z |y + H y â H z

(13-43)

Thus, Equation 13-38 becomes:
Txyz = â(H X|z + Hz â Hx) - (H Y|X + Hx - HY) â (H Z|Y + Hy â Hz) + HXYZ(13-44)
and
Txyz = âHX|Z â Hz + Hx â HY|X â Hx+ HY âHZ|Y â HY
Txyz = ~ H X|z + (Hz + Hz) + (Hx - Hx)

âHY|X +

+ Hz + HXYZ

(HY - HY) - HZ|Y +

(13-45)
HXYZ(13-46)

and finally
Txyz = âHX|z â HY|X - HZ|Y + HXYZ

(13-47)

which is equivalent to the expression of TXYz in Equation (13-2).
