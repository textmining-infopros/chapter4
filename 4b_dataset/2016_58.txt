Abstract
As academic libraries evolve to affirm their place as key partners in research, teaching,
and learning in university communities, the process of innovation is one of great
importance in the intentional design of library services, resources, and staffing. This
dissertation was a qualitative, exploratory research study in which the conceptual
framework of Peter Senge’s systems thinking was used to examine three case studies
representing three universities located in the Western and Midwestern United States.
Interviews with 10 participants were conducted to deeply understand the drivers of
innovation in academic libraries and how the organizational structure of libraries helps to
incubate ideas. The researcher used constant comparative analysis techniques to code
and understand the data. Key themes that emerged from the data included the library as
laboratory: experimentation and investment in people; collaboration and community:
partnerships, communication, and decision-making and funding; student success: 21st
century skills, user experience, and student feedback and development; and
organizational structure: changing perception and reorganization and the evolving library
profession.
Keywords: academic libraries, innovation, organizational structure, qualitative

Chapter I. Introduction
Background
Library leaders are faced with the challenge of proving the relevance and value of
academic libraries as access to information has shifted from a brick-and-mortar
environment to a digital, ubiquitous, technology-driven experience. Contrary to critics’
suggestion that libraries have become irrelevant, given advances in technology and
information access, administration and staff in libraries have reacted often quite nimbly
to changes in access to information and technology (Raju & Schoombee, 2013). Leaders
of school and academic libraries are incorporating new ways of thinking to respond to
changes in curriculum and culture as well as reimagining space and functionality to
introduce new programming and services that engage communities through fresh social,
cultural, and educational approaches (Schopfel, Roche, & Hubert, 2015).
In many academic libraries great efforts have been made to be forward-thinking
and proactive regarding decision-making concerning the allocation of resources for the
design of space and the support of seamless access to high-quality databases and wellorganized e-resources, in consideration of their responsibility and commitment to serving
the students, faculty, and staff at their colleges or universities. Some academic libraries
are remarkably technologically-advanced, such as the James B. Hunt, Jr. Library at North
Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina; the Kelvin Smith Library at Case
Western Reserve University; the Georgia Tech Library; and the University of Richmond
Library, and introducing high-tech automation, design, and innovative services.

2
Philosophical and fiscal buy-in from key stakeholders provides aid to these libraries in
their sustained success. Modern, technology-focused facilities have the potential to
attract library users and to help libraries become, or remain, relevant in the lives of the
university community they serve. The quality and perception of facilities and services
have a significant impact on recruitment and retention (Reynolds, 2007, p. 70). College
and university libraries ranked second in students’ selection process with facilities for
students’ majors ranked first, and were “ranked ahead of technology facilities, the student
union center, and even recreational facilities” (Michigan Academic Library Council,
2007, p.2; Oakleaf, 2014, p.13), indicating that academic libraries have significant
potential to attract prospective students to an institution.
The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL, 2015) showed that
students who receive library instruction as part of their courses achieve higher grades and
library instruction “contributes to retention and persistence”; meanwhile, library research
and study space “fosters social and academic community among students” (Association
of College and Research Libraries, 2015, p.1). The ACRL (2015) report described the
ongoing program titled “Assessment in Action: Academic Libraries and Student
Success,” the purpose of which is “the design, implementation, and evaluation of a
program to strengthen the competencies of librarians in campus leadership and datainformed advocacy” (ACRL, 2016, para.1). The Assessment in Action (AiA) program,
advised by social learning theorist Etienne Wenger-Treyner (2016), is an effort to
establish a community of practice of academic librarians for support and collaboration in
the development of assessment programs for academic libraries and higher education.

3
Innovative resources and services in academic libraries are imperative to respond
to and stay ahead of rapid technological change and to satisfy the expectations of students
who are comfortable, if not fluent, with the use of technology. In academic libraries,
instruction, technology, and services are provided that support faculty research
productivity, student learning, student job success, and skills for lifelong learning. In
measuring library impact, it is valuable to look at what administration and staff in
libraries are trying to do, and how they can tell they have made a difference (Oakleaf,
2014), although it can be difficult to assess impact in an environment in which “people,
services, and needs are constantly evolving” (Everest & Payne, 2001, p.21; Oakleaf,
2014). Students in the 21st century need to develop strong technology, media, and
information literacy skills as effective citizens and workers who can “create, evaluate,
and effectively utilize information, media, and technology” (Partnership for 21st Century
Learning [P21], 2003, Outcome 3, para.9). Students in the 21st century have grown up in
and will work in a technology-rich world, with unprecedented access to information, use
of diverse media, engagement in collaborative learning and work environments, and
ubiquitous use of technology. The needs of 21st century students build upon traditional
approaches to education and place emphasis on creativity, collaboration, global
awareness, civic responsibility, and fluency with the proficient and ethical use of
technology and information (P21, 2015). As technology tools become ubiquitous, the use
of technology to support and facilitate educational goals becomes increasingly important.
Academic librarians are accustomed to “dealing with untested and radically
different methods or technologies” (Bell, 2014, p.4) and by encouraging a culture of
experimentation, can provide an environment in which users may experiment with new

4
technologies, develop ideas, and make connections in the learning process. Students
show increased interest in “accessing library services via popular technologies” (Cassidy,
et al., 2014, p.126) and students use both Mac and PC laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones, suggesting the importance of cross-platform support in the design of library
services and technologies. As administration and staff of academic libraries engage in
experimentation in introducing new resources, services, and technologies, the importance
of considering the user experience, needs, and preferences becomes increasingly
important.
Innovation is defined as “a new idea, device or method; the act or process of
introducing new ideas, devices, or methods” (Merriam-Webster, 2016). The concept of
innovation for the purposes of this research study was considered to be a new service or
technology that is designed and implemented in an academic library environment to
improve the experience of students, faculty, and staff.
Conceptual Framework
In this study, the conceptual framework of systems thinking was applied to
examine how innovation happens in academic libraries to examine the challenges
academic libraries collectively face, provide some perspective on those challenges, and
give some leverage and insight into what is being done differently—and similarly—to
address these challenges (Senge, 2006). According to Arnold and Wade (2015), systems
thinking is a term attributed to Barry Richmond in 1987, and many researchers have
defined and redefined systems thinking, including Meadows in 2008, Plate in 2010,
Senge in 1990, and Sterman in 2003. As global complexity and interdependency
increases, the need for systems thinking, especially for decision-makers, increases;

5
systems thinking suggests that people must be able to see both the forest and the trees, to
“better understand the deep roots of these complex behaviors in order to predict them
and, ultimately, adjust their outcomes” (Arnold & Wade, 2015, p.670). Systems thinking
is a system of thinking about systems: in 1990 Senge defined systems thinking as a
discipline for “seeing wholes and a framework for seeing interrelationships rather than
things, for seeing pattern of change rather than static snapshots” (as cited in Arnold &
Wade, 2015, p. 672). Through case study analysis, the current researcher listened to
different points of view to achieve new knowledge from the perspective of the case study
participants.
The current researcher further connected the conceptual framework with the
literature review and study results in Chapter V, following Creswell (2014, p. 65) and the
proposition that there are several ways to apply a theoretical or conceptual lens in
qualitative research:
•

As in quantitative research, theory could be used as “a broad explanation for
behavior and attitudes . . . with variables, constructs, and hypotheses”
(Creswell, 2014, p. 64).

•

The use of a theoretical lens or perspective can be used, for example, to study
questions related to marginalized groups in which “the lens becomes a
transformative perspective that shapes the types of questions asked, informs
how data are collected and analyzed, and provides a call for action or change”
(Creswell, 2014, p.64).

•

A theoretical or conceptual lens can be used in qualitative studies in which
“theory (or some other broad explanation) becomes the end point . . . an

6
inductive process of building from the data to broad themes to a generalized
model or theory” (Creswell, 2014, p.65).
•

A theoretical or conceptual lens can be applied in qualitative studies that do
not use a specific theory.

Accordingly, the current researcher used the conceptual framework of systems thinking
in alignment with the third point above, to place the theory “at the end of the study,
where the central propositions in it could be contrasted with the existing theories and
literature” (Creswell, 2014, p. 68). In this study, the researcher sought to understand how
administration and staff in academic libraries approach innovation and how the
organizational structure of academic libraries helps to incubate ideas. In orientation with
systems thinking, the focus was on the environment in which academic libraries exist and
how many different elements are interrelated. Libraries operate within a rapidly
changing environment; according to Senge (2006),
The art of systems thinking lies in seeing through the detail complexity to the
underlying structures generating change. Systems thinking does not mean
ignoring detail complexity. Rather, it means organizing detail complexity into a
coherent story that illuminates the causes of problems and how they can be
remedied in enduring ways. (p. 124)
Senge (2006) described three general areas in which organizations may begin to address
challenges: production capacity, human resources, and competitive factors (Senge, 2006,
p. 124). To apply this to academic libraries, the researcher suggests that production
capacity elements such as scheduling, process technology, competitor plans, and service
hours can be addressed for industry and libraries alike. For human resources,

7
administrators of academic libraries can address elements such as service personnel,
maintenance, hiring, training, turnover, morale, productivity, experience, and team
management. For competitive factors, administrators can look at elements such as
technology trends, reputation, service quality, competitor service quality, and
attractiveness for talent, capital, and labor productivity. These three general areas
contribute to the complexity of the system, or the organization and its environment, and
should be considered when attempting to apply principles of systems thinking to
academic libraries.
As the world becomes increasingly complex, many managers, according to Senge
(Senge, 2006, p. 125), assume erroneously that they have too little information to be
effective. Senge (2006) suggested that there is actually too much information, and that
what is needed most are “ways to know what is not important, what variables to focus on
and which to pay less attention to—and we need ways to do this that can help groups or
teams develop shared understanding” (p. 125). Senge (2006) theorized that seeing
information in terms of both broad and detailed patterns enables people to effectively
approach the challenges of complexity and change. Further discussion of theory to
contrast existing theories and literature is included in Chapter V (Creswell, 2014).
Purpose
This study represents an effort to provide evidence of best practices in the
implementation of innovation in academic libraries that show evidence of a commitment
to implementing new services and educational technologies to support learning and
teaching. The researcher aimed to equip readers with a well-rounded awareness of
driving factors for successful innovation in academic libraries and illustrate areas that

8
emerged as critical points for consideration. Through the research process and in
developing the methodology, the researcher arrived at a checklist of attributes that
elucidate the aforementioned evidence of a commitment to new services and
technologies. This checklist is discussed in further detail in the Method section and
includes, but is not limited to, areas such as diverse methods by which to assist users with
research inquiries, library instruction that is embedded in the university curriculum,
diverse technologies provided for use and experimentation, collaboration with campus
partners to deliver services, and organizational development which reflects changes in the
academic library landscape.
In this study, the researcher worked to identify ways in which administrators and
staff of academic libraries, and specifically, through case study analysis, libraries that are
considered exemplary innovators, are managing innovation and adapting their
organizational structure to implement new technologies to meet the needs of 21st century
students. In alignment with the P21 skills and outcomes, Palfrey (2015) stated,
Technology on its own is not the point; but by applying it with care, we can
breathe new life into our schools and communities and redefine what we mean by
excellence. We will reach more students and prepare them better for the jobs that
they will create and the lives of principle we aspire for them to lead. (Palfrey,
2015, R.54)
Libraries and information technology have been used together in a synergistic
relationship and there has been and continues to be vibrant research on the congruence of
innovation, technology, and libraries. The impact of constant change on libraries is a
topic that is undergoing constant, valuable exploration, and this impact was addressed in

9
this study through the literature review and interview process. In this study, the
conceptual framework of systems thinking was applied to consider the dynamic
complexity of the forces shaping the present and future of academic libraries. Systems
thinking is exemplified by a shift in mind toward “seeing interrelationships rather than
linear cause-effect chains, and, seeing processes of change rather than snapshots,” or
isolated parts of the system (Senge, 2006, p. 73). In essence, the application of the
concept of systems thinking
•

enables people to recognize deeper recurring patterns;

•

“engenders a willingness to share responsibility for problems generated by a
system” (Senge, 2006, p. 78);

•

encourages people to view every influence as both cause and effect (Senge,
2006, p. 75);

•

helps people “understand even the most subtle aspects of the learning
organization” (Senge, 2006, p. 12); and

•

supports people in their initiatives to address issues in their situation.

Through viewing the present state of academic libraries through a systems
thinking lens, the current researcher considered the ways in which academic libraries
have evolved in relation to swift, significant changes in higher education, information,
policy, technology, and culture, and to illuminate ways in which administrators in
exemplary libraries—such as the three libraries involved in the case study analysis
herein—have been proactive and reactive in the face of great change. Through case
study analysis, the researcher aimed to identify ways in which administrators in

10
exemplary libraries are thinking about innovation to provide critical, relevant services to
students, faculty, and staff at their institutions.
Research Questions
The research questions investigated in this study included the following:
1. What drives innovation in academic libraries?
2. How does the organizational structure of academic libraries help to incubate
ideas?
The researcher sought through case study analysis to identify the factors that contribute to
successful innovation in academic libraries. Interview questions were used to understand
how the selected administrators of academic libraries move through the process of
learning about emerging technologies, selecting technologies and developing services to
accomplish strategic goals, gathering support for the adoption of selected technologies
and services, implementing technologies and services, reviewing benefits and relevance,
and sustaining technologies and services. The researcher investigated the process by
which administrators of libraries make decisions about changing job responsibilities, job
requirements, and job titles in an effort to understand how the role of academic library
personnel is evolving in technologically advanced academic library environments.
The researcher designed open-ended interview questions aimed to “yield
descriptive data, even stories” (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 120) that specifically
addressed the two research questions while providing in-depth, rich understanding of the
conditions and the systems that contribute to innovation in the selected libraries. The
interview questions were designed to reflect a combination of elements: the factors that
led to the development of the research questions, the researcher’s curiosity regarding the

11
issues at hand, the themes that emerged from the literature review, and points that
emerged from the researcher’s evaluation of the content and functionality of the library
websites.
The researcher wanted to understand how the administrators of these libraries
respond to the needs of users and stakeholders as well as anticipate the needs of users and
stakeholders. It was also important for the researcher to understand how the
organizational structure of academic libraries helps to support the process of innovation.
Need for the Study
Through case study research, this study was an examination of practices related to
innovation of three academic libraries. Specifically, the researcher sought to identify
how innovation occurs within the organizational structure of academic libraries that
exhibit services and technologies determined by the researcher to be exemplary. As the
landscape of information access and education changes, the ways in which people use
libraries change as well. Students attending universities today are accustomed to using
technology for personal and educational purposes, and some libraries are not equipped to
reflect the new levels of technology readiness or to meet the demands of 21st century
learners.
Technology and services that are thoughtfully incorporated into the educational
goals of the university and aesthetically incorporated into the design and planning of the
library may contribute to a positive user experience and student success (Oakleaf, 2014).
The need for well-planned library spaces and services is substantiated with established
research and literature, as demonstrated in the literature review.

12
Administrators of academic libraries seeking to elicit interest and support from
stakeholders may use this case study analysis to progress toward their goals. The case
study analysis will also be of value to library leadership, librarians, library staff, and
university leadership and administrators. Finally, this study will provide evidence
through detailed documentation and analysis of the inspiration propelling innovation in
academic libraries.
Definitions
To provide context for the topics discussed in the study, definitions are provided
for the following terminology.
21st century learning: The P21 (2015) 21st century skills (critical thinking,
problem solving, communication, and collaboration) will be essential for success in a
complex, technology-centric world. Schools in which the teaching of 21st century skills
are incorporated focus on interdisciplinary themes including “global awareness; financial,
economic, business, and entrepreneurial literacy; civic literacy; health literacy; and
environmental literacy; ...information literacy; media literacy; ICT [information,
communications, and technology] literacy” (P21, 2015, Outcome 3) and skills such as
leadership, accountability, initiative, and cross-cultural skills are emphasized. The P21
Framework is implemented through a synergy of standards and assessments; curriculum
and instruction; professional development; and learning environments.
Academic library: Libraries that serve students, faculty, and staff at colleges and
universities (American Library Association [ALA], 2016b, para. 2). The staff of an
academic library includes professional librarians, paraprofessionals, and sometimes
students. Professional librarians earn a master of library science degree and sometimes

13
have additional degrees to enable them to be qualified as a subject specialist. Some large
colleges and universities have multiple libraries; many colleges and universities often
have one main library.
Educational technology: The practice and study of educational technology
represents an effort to improve education for all learners through the application of
technology in teaching and learning environments with emphasis on advocating for
public policy, digital fluency and citizenship, professional development for educators,
and developing technology skills in all learners to prepare them for the current and future
global economy (International Society for Technology in Education [ISTE], 2016).
Educational technology supports learning through the creation of diverse learning
resources.
Information literacy: Historically, there have been many phrases to define the
work librarians perform regarding instruction, including bibliographic instruction, user
education, library instruction, and information literacy. These terms actually have
different meanings, and “the progression of their use over time reflects significant
changes in the development of the teaching library” (Ariew, 2014, p. 209). “Information
literacy is a set of abilities requiring individuals to ‘recognize when information is needed
and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information’”
(ACRL, 2000).
Library science: Related to “the study, principles, and practices of library care and
administration” (Merriam-Webster, 2016) and the fact that libraries were involved early
in the use of information technologies (Foskett, Francis, & Estabrook, 2016, para.5), a
professional librarian is required to earn a master of library science (MLS) degree.

14
Master’s degree programs accredited by the ALA can be alternatively titled master of
library and information studies, master of information, master of arts, master of science,
master of librarianship, or master of library service.
Chapter Summary
The challenges faced by academic libraries offer the opportunity for deep
discussion into the ways in which libraries have changed and are continually changing in
order to adapt services and resources to improve the lives of the constituents served.
Educational technology and innovation in libraries provides an area of research with
many facets. This study was conducted to apply the conceptual framework of systems
thinking to understand the evolution of academic libraries as a whole, with
interconnected issues and events, not disparate pieces. Through an extensive literature
review and case study analysis, the researcher sought to understand how administrators of
libraries that are noted for innovative use of educational technology gather ideas, make
decisions, collaborate, and implement new services to improve the lives of students,
faculty, and staff at their colleges and universities.

15

Chapter II. Review of Related Literature
The literature review serves to integrate what has been presented in the literature
and to build connections between related areas of the study of academic libraries and
educational technology. The researcher selected a qualitative study approach because it
is exploratory (Creswell, 2014) and the researcher aimed to learn directly and deeply
from participants through their unique responses to interview questions. This review of
related literature is organized into four sections based on themes explored in the research:
Innovation in Academic Libraries; Issues in 21st Century Academic Libraries; the
Changing Organizational Structure of Academic Libraries; and Leadership, Advocacy,
and the Future of Academic Libraries. The four sections provide an understanding of the
many challenges and opportunities faced by academic libraries.
Innovation in Academic Libraries
Innovations in academic libraries include improvements in the accessibility and
usability of research tools as well as other developments in technology. In a
constructivist study of library skills curricula, Douglass and Mack (2015) stated,
Although formal connections between librarians and undergraduate researchers
may seem unnecessary given the increase in students’ un-mediated access to
research tools, we find in our study that innovations in research tools and other
technologies create opportunities to deepen students’ engagement with academic
librarians . . . [and] library partnerships with the research skills development
programs have provided safe places for librarians to . . . engage students in

16
knowledge and wisdom production. (p. 540)
Additionally, Douglass and Mack contended that formal, similar partnerships contribute
to student success by improving student research and skills, and therefore can help
improve the metrics of great importance to colleges and universities, including graduation
and retention rates and research productivity (p. 541). Douglass and Mack also cited
Powell, Gilleland, and Pearson (2012, p. 121) who aimed to provide tools (i.e., the
benchmark model of institutional efficiency and effectiveness) with which higher
education planners could approach the critical issue of rising higher education costs, and
also emphasized the need for balancing efficiency, productivity, and quality in higher
education to arrive at ideal funding levels.
Disruptive innovation provides a backdrop for illustrating the current environment
exemplified by uncertainty and fast-moving change in how people access information.
Academic libraries will be pushed to “respond by either sustaining innovation (e.g., keep
improving the same system and services) or become participants in creating disruptive
innovation (e.g., replacing and inventing new systems and services), and this decision
will determine the libraries future relevance” (Shank & Bell, 2011, p. 106). The concept
of blended librarianship was developed in 2004 by Shank and Bell, and the term has
come to signify the role of academic librarians involved with instructional development
and who are knowledgeable about emerging technologies as well as effective teachers of
information literacy and research skills, and effective communicators regarding the value
of libraries to stakeholders and colleagues. As libraries evolve, their value strengthens, as
noted by Hendrix (2010),
Even as the nature of the library and the work of the librarian change, the librarian

17
will continue to play an essential role in the provision of those services. The
nature of the landscape may shift, but the need for a navigator will remain. (p. 19)
Administrators of academic libraries can encourage a research and development
(R&D) culture amongst staff which, according to Gibbons (2007) promotes a “sandbox”
environment that “requires funding, flexibility of schedule and job duties, and, most
important, a shared understanding that it is okay for an experiment to fail” (p. 93). An
R&D culture will engender a more agile and flexible approach to trying new initiatives,
whether they be technology-oriented or related to experimentation with new types of
furniture, services, processes, or staffing (Gibbons, 2007, p. 93).
Affirming Gibbons’s (2007) ideas about support for experimentation, Evener
(2015) stated that library leadership can implement a culture of innovation to increase
staff engagement and energy and that “library leaders in cultures of innovation hone
persuasive abilities to create buy-in for implementing innovations in order to serve users
more effectively with dynamic solutions to persistent problems” (p. 296).
Innovation in libraries evolves in different ways, taking varying paths, and is
affected by unique conditions specific to the culture of the college or university in which
they exist. Libraries may not have the management structure to deal with the extreme
uncertainty in implementing radical innovations (Bieraugel, 2015, p. 351) and
administrators of academic libraries may consider alternative methods by which to
approach innovation; for example, the lean startup method, serves as a methodology for
creating a new product or service (Bieraugel, 2015, p. 351). The lean startup method
began as a method to reduce waste and improve efficiency in manufacturing; Bieraugel
(2015) suggested that this method can be applied in libraries to remove inefficient

18
processes and wasted time to improve the movement of information through a system as
well as improve services. Constant testing of assumptions about customers supports the
lean startup method, with the goal of using information to understand customers’ needs
and to rapidly respond and adjust services or product. Similarly, Furr and Dyer (2014)
asserted that lean startup methods can be applied to many diverse fields, offering what
they termed “the innovator’s method” (p. 2), an end-to-end process for creating, refining,
and bringing new ideas to market (p. 2) which is aimed to reduce uncertainty, address
fear of failure, and shorten the time involved to allow for successful, effective innovation.
As academic libraries evolve, new services and programming are offered, such as
workshops that are focused on skills that had not previously fallen under the traditional
purview of academic libraries, such as using Geographic Information System [GIS] data
resources, managing data, scholarly communication, creating multimedia presentations,
and using specialized technology. A similar workshop described by Denda (2015)
demonstrates the active role librarians and libraries can play in student learning and
knowledge production (p. 299) in which students critically engage with visual forms of
communication and the meanings of media to build interview skills and visual literacy.
Medical and health sciences librarians are introducing maker spaces with 3D
printing capabilities, embedding online reference services into clinical work
environments, and assisting researchers to assess their scholarly impact as ways to
integrate library services and programs with the work being done by medical
professionals and students. According to an anonymous column in the Journal of the
Medical Library Association highlighting seven technology-based projects introduced by
health sciences librarians, “Technology provides the chance for librarians to innovate,

19
boost quality, measure success, and align services with the priorities of their
organizations. With technology, librarians can reintroduce themselves as visible,
valuable, and essential partners in achieving common goals” (“Enhancing Library Impact
Through Technology,” 2015, p. 222).
Challenges for the 21st Century Academic Library
Expressing concern for the “impending death of the traditional library” due to
increased use of electronic library research resources outside of the library building and
the possibility of a decline in library gate counts, Gayton (2008, p. 60) suggested that
campus administrators would respond by incorporating social spaces within libraries to
attract students. Gayton argued that there existed a lack of understanding on the part of
campus administration that academic libraries were not and had never been simply
storage facilities for printed materials (p. 60) and further asserted that students would
never cease to value the “communal” experience of seeing and being seen by others,
quietly engaged in the same serious, studious activity (p. 60). Gayton (2008) suggested
that new, “social” library services (i.e., cafes, museums, theatres, collaborative work
space) may not add value to academic libraries and could potentially undermine the
communal activities (i.e., students engaged in study in proximity to one another), Raju
and Schoombee (2013, p. 27) argued that academic libraries have exhibited a proactive
response to the demands of changes in higher education pedagogy, and that libraries have
historically been early adopters of technology to support educational goals. To support
their claim, Raju and Schoombee (2013) cited the 2009 United Nations Educational,
Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Conference on Higher Education
as evidence for a relevant paradigm shift in pedagogy, from the “changing role of the

20
lecturer as a top-down deliverer of education (domestication) to the lecturer as a
facilitator in the education process (liberator)” (p. 27). Raju and Schoombee (2013)
suggested the UNESCO conference highlighted “leading academic institutions committed
to realigning their foci within their core functions of research, teaching, and service to the
community, to incorporate the promotion of critical thinking” (p. 27) and that libraries
should concentrate their efforts on the process of learning that occurs within the library
setting, including offering individual study space as well as collaborative learning space.
Moreover, the 2009 UNESCO conference document contains the statement, “At
no time in history has it been more important to invest in higher education as a major
force in building an inclusive and diverse knowledge society and to advance research,
innovation and creativity” (p. 2, para. 4) and elaborates that all governments should view
higher education as a public good and high-priority social responsibility. Further, in the
conference document UNESCO (2009, pp. 2-3) emphasized the responsibility of higher
education to promote critical thinking skills and active and ethical citizenship.
Raju and Schoombee (2013, p. 27) suggested that academic librarians have
responded in a proactive manner by redesigning library space to encourage the exchange
of ideas and collaboration. This response includes offering virtual reference services
(i.e., services by which library users may receive assistance from anywhere using
computers and mobile devices through email, phone, text messaging, social media);
focusing on organizing, digitizing, and making accessible online an institution’s
distinctive archival materials; implementing digital repositories of an institution’s
scholarly output to be openly accessible; and offering support for research and

21
researchers, including research data management, curation and preservation, facilitation
of open access and bibliometric analysis (p. 28).
Coinciding with the emphasis on the responsibility of those in higher education to
teach critical thinking skills as stated in the UNESCO (2009) conference document,
Gunselman and Blakesley (2012, p. 261) acknowledged that over many years librarians
have developed a large amount of materials to support the teaching of information
literacy skills and that recent emphasis has been placed on critical thinking skills, more so
than search mechanics. Specifically, the ACRL (2000) developed information literacy
competency standards for higher education which emphasize building critical thinking
skills.
The model of coworking spaces and communities is illustrated by Schopfel et al.
(2015) as an opportunity for academic libraries to support innovation and the transfer of
knowledge to the world of work (p. 67). Schopfel et al. suggested that administrators of
academic libraries can meet their “social responsibility on the campus and in society” (p.
67) by developing the work-related aspects of a learning center or commons space in an
academic library. In addition, Schopfel et al. suggested that the concepts of coworking
and innovation are generally new for academic libraries and that “conceptual papers are
still missing that combine empirical experience with a theoretical approach,” (p.67)
which supports the appropriateness of the current dissertation topic.
Library mission statements should not merely be aimed to support learning—they
should be aimed to enact the learning mission, according to Bennett (2009, p. 194) with
librarians thinking like educators rather than as service providers. Bennett articulated
three paradigms that have affected the design of library space: reader-centered design,

22
book-centered design, and learning-centered design. Learning-centered design, Bennett
argued, was made possible due to dramatic changes in information technology, and paves
the way for libraries to consider space design to encourage intentional learning. Citing
Bereiter and Scardamalia (1989), Bennett (2009, p. 192) described intentional learning as
cognitive processes that have learning as an intrinsic goal rather than an incidental
outcome and suggested that academic librarians should work to transform their role and
the role of the library to enact, rather than support, the university learning mission.
Information commons, learning commons, and now media commons have been
introduced in academic libraries in the past 15 years, with the distinction between the
terms often difficult to distinguish upon first glance. Mestre (2013) detailed the creation
of a collaborative effort between library leadership and colleagues across campus at a
large university library to implement a media commons, which
provides students and faculty opportunities to experiment with emerging
technologies, with expanded opportunities to learn of best practices in educational
technology. In addition to a robust loanable technology program, the Media
Commons is a service space that offers faculty, students, and users the ability to
create, disseminate, use, and curate digital media. It meets a need for broad
access to media creation tools, information technology training in multimedia
hardware and software, and instruction in media literacy. (p. 670)
An early advocate of commons spaces in academic libraries, Beagle (2010)
assessed the contemporary literature and examined examples of libraries in which
commons environments had been incorporated, remarking that students found value in
the interactions they had with librarians as they acknowledged the interaction helped

23
them to become more independent researchers (2010, p. 12). Beagle (2010, p. 13) noted
that traits of professional library staff showed them to be inherently collaborative, open to
sharing information, and eager to understand emerging ideas, making them receptive to
understanding the need for staying current and malleable in a swiftly changing
environment.
The concept of an information or learning commons presents a physical and
virtual space in which students can access important, diverse services and find
collaborative work space, individual study space, and technology in a centralized
location. Beginning with the term information commons, libraries began to incorporate
computers, software, collaborative works space, study rooms, rooms for presentation
practice, and multimedia labs (Mestre, 2013, p. 670). The terms learning commons or
knowledge commons were introduced to include additional technologies and services
offered through partnerships with colleagues on campus to support student learning.
Mestre (2013) stated that at the time of publication, there existed few articles that
documented the creation of a media commons at a library, while there were many articles
published about information commons and learning commons.
Proposing that libraries, through the implementation of a commons environment,
have a fresh opportunity to fulfill the commitment of providing equalized access,
Lippincott (2010, p.34) stated,
Libraries have traditionally played a role in leveling the playing field for their
users; students who do not have adequate skills can find assistance at the library;
students who do not have adequate resources to purchase materials related to their
academic work can borrow them at the library. (p. 34)

24
Lippincott (2010) further stressed that librarians embarking upon a project to incorporate
a commons should conduct a needs assessment to ask students about their actual needs,
and not just needs perceived by librarians.
Architecture and design of library spaces may impact stakeholders’ perception of
academic libraries. Successful innovation may take many forms: from Makerspaces (a
place in which people gather to work on projects and share equipment, ideas, and
knowledge); collaborative, technology-enabled workspaces to teaching and visualization
laboratories; from strong library involvement with curriculum planners to sophisticated
online library research resources and services. Facilities and services designed to reflect
innovative practices may contribute to a perception of success which, in turn, may impact
recruitment, retention, learning, and the student experience (Reynolds, 2007). Early
proponents of the information commons model envisioned environments in which
support was available for “the important relationship between information technology
and academic scholarship by providing areas in libraries that provide a full-range of
library resources and productivity software” (Cowgill, Beam, & Wess, 2001, p.438).
Involving the customer (i.e., students and faculty) in the process of service
innovation is an effective and important strategy adapted from the business literature,
according to Scupola and Nicolajsen (2010, p. 305). Citing arguments in favor as well as
cautious of the involvement of users or customers in the service innovation process,
Scupola and Nicolajsen concluded that academic libraries depend on several factors to
foster an innovative environment: employees’ creativity; a management team and
employees that are “outgoing and alert to changes taking place elsewhere in their
network” (p. 309); and engagement with the customers, or, library users to elicit their

25
service needs. In a case study conducted in a Danish library, Scupola and Nicolajsen
revealed that “user innovation is seen as a complement to the library internal innovation
process and not as a substitute for internal practices” (p. 310).
The Changing Organizational Structure of Academic Libraries
The discussion of whether teaching what has come to be known as information
literacy should be the role of librarian or faculty member has been going on since the late
19th century, according to Gunselman and Blakesley (2012, p. 260) with academic
libraries offering credit courses or other types of library instruction from the 1870s
onward. The discussion regarding whether library instruction should be provided as part
of student orientation or fully integrated into the curriculum has been going on for many
decades, as well. The famous early Twentieth Century debate documented in
professional and popular publications between librarian John Cotton Dana and Vassar
College professor Lucy Maynard Salmon opened up considerable discussion regarding
whether academic librarians or faculty should provide library instruction to students at
colleges and universities (Gunselman &Blakesley, 2012, p. 262). The historical
examples researched and reported by Gunselman and Blakesley (2012) provide a launch
point for contemporary discussion as to the role of the library in higher education, while
also illuminating some consistently controversial topics, including the status of librarians,
professional identity, and the value of libraries within higher education institutions.
Using Abbott’s (1988) theory of the system of professions as the theoretical
framework and its focus on the evolution of occupational groups for their analysis, Cox
and Corrall (2013, p. 1527) suggested that librarianship is inherently responsive to
change. Using content analysis of job listings, surveys of current library employees, case

26
studies, and literature, Cox and Corrall (2013) provided detailed descriptions of the
evolution of adjacent library positions, including systems librarians, electronic resources
librarians, digital librarians, repository managers, clinical librarians and informationists,
digital curators/research data managers, teaching librarians/information literacy
educators, information and knowledge managers, and web managers and web teams.
Cox and Corrall (2013) suggested that in keeping with Abbott’s theory, the success of the
profession may be affected greatly by
the efficacy of the profession’s knowledge base in that area or its ability to absorb
other knowledge bases, the plausibility with which new roles can be equated to
the existing public image of the profession, and the organization and posture of
other professions that are jostling for position. (p. 1538)
To understand the varied roles that are being taken on by professional librarians,
Vassilakaki and Moniarou-Papconstantinou (2015) conducted a systematic literature
review that resulted in the selection of 114 papers which revealed, through analysis, that
six roles have been adopted by librarians between 2000 and 2014: teachers, technology
specialists, embedded librarians, information consultants, knowledge managers, and
subject librarians.
As an example of the way in which librarian roles are evolving, embedded
librarians are those librarians who are linked closely with a specific group, whether it be
an academic department, a school within the college or university, or a branch campus.
Hall and Hunter Marshall (2014) explained, “Advancing one’s knowledge of the
discipline and the curriculum is key to becoming embedded” (p. 512).
The concept of blended librarianship was developed to describe librarians who

27
incorporate technology seamlessly to support their practice. Shank and Bell (2011)
proposed, “blended librarians should push the boundaries of faculty, staff, and student
adoption of new educational technologies to improve learning” (p. 107). According to
Shank and Bell, “Blended librarianship arose out of this profound societal confusion over
the future relevance of the academic library and the uncertain role of future college and
university librarians.” Further, Shank and Bell stated,
Blended librarianship is intentionally not library centric (i.e., focused on the
building and its physical collections) but, rather, it is librarian centric (i.e.,
focused on people’s skill, knowledge they have to offer, and relationships they
build). It focuses on why librarians matter to provide compelling reasons for why
academic libraries remain essential and indispensable to the academy. (p. 106)
Students who can effectively demonstrate proficiency by using technology in creating
undergraduate work may have a competitive edge in seeking employment (Lippincott,
2010, p. 35).
In addition, Gibbons (2007) articulated that library staff must make proficiency in
technology a core job responsibility, to be informed of disruptive technologies (Gibbons,
2007, p. 2). According to Gibbons (2007), academic libraries that have a mission to be
“both essential and irreplaceable by technology” serve to embrace the understanding that
“although technology can be a better information provider, it cannot substitute for the
essential role of humans in the creation, transmission, and dissemination of knowledge”
(p. 11). Further, Gibbons stated,
If an academic library is truly committed to being the best in the world at serving
the teaching, learning, and research needs of its unique host institution and to

28
being a key part of the scaffolding for the creation, transmission, and
dissemination of knowledge, then it is imperative for that library to really come to
know and understand its youngest patrons, the undergraduate students. (p. 11)
Staffing in academic libraries is changing as both libraries and higher education are
changing. Library missions must be linked to the institutional mission, as explained by
Gremmels (2013, p. 240) and assessment of the effectiveness of library instructional
programs, collaborations with other departments to provide services, and contributions to
student success have evolved as priorities for library management.
Recent trends in staffing in academic libraries include the hiring of more
paraprofessionals; rethinking the staffing of the reference desk to include technology
assistance, paraprofessionals, and tutors; limiting the staffing in areas in which activity
has decreased (e.g., as libraries collect fewer books, there is a decrease in staffing for
collection development departments); and an increase in and emphasis on teaching
library instruction. While Gremmels (2013) suggested longevity may no longer be
considered preferable, she also stated that trusting relationships with faculty and
administration are built over time, illustrating a conundrum faced by contemporary
academic libraries. Gremmels posited that a serious challenge faced by librarians is the
importance of collaborating with faculty in instructional design to integrate information
literacy into the curriculum.
Building effective programs takes time, continuous effort, and creativity. An
academic library in which there are allowances for experimentation and variety in the
areas of staffing, and understanding that trends will come and go, and optimism about
trying new approaches, can “expect many different structures, each perhaps unique to its

29
institution, that try to capitalize on synergies and break through traditional mindsets”
(Gremmels, 2013, p. 243). In some academic libraries there have been attempted
mergers of departments and services. Providing the example of a small academic library,
Doherty and Piper (2015) described a reorganization of its departmental structure: Public
services “refocused its efforts on information literacy and outreach” where access
services merged with technical services, which now includes “collections, cataloging, and
lending services” (p. 160).
Libraries in which the principles of collaboration, flexibility, community,
education, creativity, and innovation are embraced seem better poised to survive and
thrive in the fast-paced climate of higher education and libraries. According to Hendrix
(2010), libraries in the 21st century face many challenges, including the following
themes:
•

“Technology changes traditional information forms;

•

Digitization changes the landscape of information access and use;

•

New information processes are changing libraries, library services, and
librarians; [and]

•

The future is collaboration” (p. 4).

Leadership, Advocacy, and the Future of Academic Libraries
In an effort to arrive at effective ways in which to help ACRL members
demonstrate the value of academic libraries to the academy, the Board of Directors of
ACRL has been working since 2009 to develop research that will “support library
advocacy efforts to influence decision-makers and funders in higher education” (Staley &
Malenfant, 2010, p. 57). The first step of this project included an extensive review of the

30
literature, methodologies, and best practices related to demonstrating the value of
academic libraries that were in place as of 2009 (Staley & Malenfant, 2010, p. 57).
Next, in an effort to assist ACRL members with strategic planning, a futures
project was carried out, in which members of the ACRL with varying positions
(directors, deans, academic librarians, and library school students) were surveyed
regarding their perceptions of 26 possible scenarios related to the future of higher
education and academic libraries. Staley and Malenfant (2010) sought to challenge
current perceptions and suggested that by reflecting on alternate futures, people may see
their strategic assumptions and values in a new light (p. 58). The themes for the
scenarios were relevant to “academic culture, demographics, distance education, funding,
globalization, infrastructure/facilities, libraries, political climate, publishing industry,
societal values, students/learning and technology” (Staley & Malenfant, 2010, p. 57).
The report served to provide a way for those in the academic library profession to open
up discussions with various stakeholders or those who have an interest in the future of
academic libraries. In challenge of statements that suggest libraries are moving toward
obsolescence, Raju and Schoombee (2013) applied an optimistic approach, asserting that
“libraries are in transformation due to their positive and proactive response to the
demands of changing higher education pedagogy and e-science” (p. 27).
Providing library staff at all levels to take on responsibility roles can encourage
skills improvement and dedication to the library mission. Badia (2015) contended that
libraries can and should act as leaders in the current climate of considerable change,
stating, “tapping into the leadership potential of its librarians can help academic libraries
be proactive in the face of change, plan for succession, and retain their professionals” (p.

31
1). Badia also suggested that providing library staff at all levels of the organization with
significant responsibility and leadership roles can help to encourage creativity and
dedication in staff members.
Aligning the library mission with the university’s strategic mission is integral to
facing challenges and opportunities and to improving the synergy between the library and
the university. In a perspective piece, MacDonald and vanDuinkerken (2015) proposed
that academic libraries should become “entrepreneurial organizations [that] are based on
business models, rather than tradition” (p. 406). MacDonald and vanDuinkerken applied
several business models, including that of creative destruction, attributed to economist
Joseph Schumpeter to the academic library environment, to suggest the development of
culture that embraces entrepreneurship.
Academic library leadership faces many challenges and opportunities, and
research in the area of academic library leadership is limited, according to Le (2015, p.
300). In a survey of academic library leaders, Le found that the top five challenges are
the following:
•

“demonstrate the library values to the university community;

•

operate the library under fiscal uncertainty;

•

retrofit outdated library facilities to accommodate new services;

•

strike a balance between digital and print materials;

•

keep the library staff trained and current” (p. 300).

Chapter Summary
This literature review was organized into four main areas, Innovation in
Academic Libraries; Issues in 21st Century Academic Libraries; The Changing

32
Organizational Structure of Academic Libraries; and Leadership, Advocacy, and the
Future of Academic Libraries. The literature review was organized to demonstrate and
investigate key issues related to the research questions described in Chapter I. The
literature review provided insight into the challenges faced by academic libraries in the
21st century as well as some understanding of the history and development of academic
library services. The ever-changing landscape of academic libraries provides a setting for
understanding how the organizational structure of academic libraries is changing to adapt
to needs, trends, and conditions in higher education, society, and culture. Further, the
literature review provided some understanding of the challenges related to leadership and
advocacy in the face of challenges to support present and future academic libraries in
their mission.

33

Chapter III. Method
The literature review helped to position the study in the context of some of the
challenges faced by academic libraries today, as well as to determine the selected
methodology and structure of the study. To understand how academic libraries engage in
the process of innovation to create and develop services, technologies, and initiatives, the
researcher sought to design a qualitative study that would take into account the
complexity of the situations to be studied, to use an inductive style, and to focus on “the
meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem” (Creswell, 2014, p.
4).
Design of the Study
The method selected for this study was case study research. Data were collected
through interviews and the analysis of existing documentation. The researcher selected
nonprobabilistic, purposeful sampling to identify unique information-rich cases to
“discover, understand, and gain insight and therefore select a sample from which the
most can be learned” (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 96). By selecting academic libraries
that have received recognition for innovation or that exhibit traits that align with those of
libraries that are recognized for innovative services and resources, the researcher focused
the study to gain insight into what drives innovation in academic libraries perceived as
successful, noteworthy, and innovative.
Research Questions
As stated in Chapter I, the two research questions for this study are as follows:

34
1. What drives innovation in academic libraries?
2. How does the organizational structure of the academic libraries help to
incubate ideas?
Context
The study consisted of three libraries, with each library representing a separate
case. Within each case, there were two to five interviews conducted with individuals
employed in the libraries. Each case was focused on an academic library or its larger
library system, depending on the case. The researcher examined each library’s website
extensively to gain in-depth understanding of the university context, the library’s services
and resources, the library’s unique attributes, and the organizational structure of the
library. The three academic libraries are located throughout the United States, with two
in Western states and one in a Midwestern state. Each library was selected based on
criteria developed by the researcher (see Appendix E); the criteria was used by the
researcher to identify libraries that demonstrate exemplary innovation through the
implementation of innovative educational technology and relevant modern services.
Researcher’s Position and Positionality
The researcher recognized that the concept of the researcher as primary
instrument for data collection and analysis would shape the way in which the researcher
would approach the interactions with the participants to be interviewed for the study
(Merriam &Tisdell, 2016, p. 16). Following Merriam and Tisdell (2016, p. 16), the
researcher took considerable care to identify and monitor potential biases or
“subjectivities” with the goal of reducing the inherent power dynamics (Merriam &
Tisdell, 2016, p. 130) within the interview encounter; speaking and behaving in a way so

35
that the participants would feel comfortable and willing to speak openly and thoughtfully;
and reduce the potential that those being interviewed would perceive any bias or
judgment related to the interview process coming from the researcher.
As the primary instrument for data collection and analysis (Merriam & Tisdell,
2016, p. 16) the researcher briefly provided an overview of her orientation toward the
subject matter of this study to provide relevant background as it relates to the researcher’s
positionality. The researcher has worked as a professional librarian in an academic
library since 1999 and holds a Master of Library Service degree, a Master of Science in
Management degree, and Bachelor of Arts degrees in Art History and Psychology with a
minor in Spanish. The researcher has relevant research interests in relationship to the
topic of the study, including library innovation, educational technology and libraries,
library advocacy, the future of libraries, information access in the 21st century,
information literacy, and library leadership and management.
When the researcher began working on the dissertation, she was serving as the
Interim Library Director at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey; she
was promoted to the position of Library Director in February, 2016. Therefore, the
researcher’s positionality is similar, but not identical to, that of the participants who were
interviewed for the study (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 64), in that the participants
included library leadership and librarians at institutions of higher education. The
researcher, however, does not purport to be an expert in driving factors of innovation nor
the successful implementation of technology. Rather, the researcher’s professional
curiosity about the motivations, contributing success factors, environmental conditions,
and decisions made by leadership led the researcher to have a passion for understanding

36
innovation in academic libraries from the perspective of those individuals who are
heavily involved in these cases. Through the perspective of these individuals, the
researcher aimed to gain a rich understanding of the realities of the environments studied
in the three cases.
At every stage of the study, the researcher was careful to pause, consider, and
make note of the potential for bias and subjectivity, for example, in the design of the
interview questions, during the research conducted to identify appropriate academic
libraries; during the interview encounter; and during the subsequent write-up. The
researcher was aware that her previous professional experiences could influence the
worldview with which she presented the study, interview questions, and write-up.
In creating the data collection instrument, or interview questions, the researcher
understood that her background knowledge could influence the phrasing of questions and
themes addressed. Understanding that the interviewer–respondent interaction is complex
and that both parties bring biases and preexisting beliefs that affect the interview process,
the researcher attempted to take into consideration the potential for influencing biases
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 130). Following Merriam and Tisdell (2016), “Participants
usually enjoy sharing their expertise with an interested and sympathetic listener. . . . For
some, it is also an opportunity to clarify their own thoughts and experiences” (p. 129).
The researcher tried to approach each interview by being respectful, nonjudgmental, and
nonthreatening (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 129). Although the researcher works within
academic libraries, the researcher believed she had enough distance and sufficient lack of
concrete knowledge to make it possible for her to form questions that would be truly
revealing and informative and would be considered objective by anyone and everyone.

37
The researcher provided a draft of the interview questions to her dissertation advisor for
feedback and was able to eliminate a number of questions that were redundant or
irrelevant in relation to the two research questions.
The researcher was careful to apply the tenets of the ALA (2016a) Code of Ethics
to the research process, in particular points VI and VII, which state that librarians should
not advance private interests at the expense of library users, colleagues, or employing
institutions, and that librarians must distinguish between personal convictions and
professional duties (ALA, 2016a, para. 4). The application of these principles helped to
guide the researcher to reflect on the potential for bias and subjectivity.
Participants
The researcher established criteria through extensive investigation to identify
academic libraries that have been recognized (by entities described in subsequent
paragraphs) for their innovative use of technology to provide services to students, faculty,
and staff at their universities. The researcher identified the characteristics of libraries that
have received commendation for their innovative use of technology and used the
knowledge of these characteristics to assist in the selection of libraries for the study.
These libraries provided the researcher with information-rich cases “from which one can
learn a great deal about issues of central importance to the purpose of the inquiry”
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 96). The researcher conducted two-tier sampling to first
identify the cases (libraries) to be studied, and then identify the participants to be
interviewed within each case (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 100).
The researcher aimed to confirm three to five academic libraries for participation
in the study; there would be three to five interviews conducted with individuals at each of

38
the libraries; and the number of interviews was appropriate to the method of qualitative
case study research (Creswell, 2014, p. 189). The number of interviews for each case
was appropriate for the researcher to gain a well-rounded understanding of the
environment within each case through multiple voices within each library staff; by
interviewing the director or dean and several members of the library staff with varying
job responsibilities, the researcher would have the opportunity to hear diverse
perspectives.
The researcher established criteria (Appendix E) and thus an observational list of
exemplary traits to guide decision-making regarding libraries that qualify for the study.
The checklist included the following considerations used by the researcher:
•

Has the library been mentioned in notable literature and websites? If so,
where and for what reason?

•

Has the library received awards or significant commendation?

•

Do library personnel work closely with the university to embed information
literacy instruction in the general curriculum?

•

Does the library offer advanced technology services?

•

Are there special initiatives that make the library stand out from others (e.g.,
digital scholarship initiatives, teaching and learning centers, user experience
programs, advanced technology services and resources)?

•

Does the library staff communicate its services and resources in a robust way
that makes the library stand out?

•

How have the job titles and descriptions of library staff responsibilities
developed to reflect new services, trends, and/or resources in libraries?

39
Through Internet and database searching, the researcher identified nine academic
libraries that exhibit exemplary use of technology to provide improved, innovative
services to students, faculty, and staff at their university. The researcher used an Excel
spreadsheet to keep track of the libraries, contact information, dates of contact, and notes.
Ultimately the researcher selected three libraries as cases and engaged in 10 interviews;
there were two, three, and five interviews for each case, respectively (see Table 1).

Note. To preserve confidentiality, names of universities have been changed.
The researcher identified libraries that are characterized by noteworthy and
innovative initiatives, resources, and services. Selection of the universities to be
considered for participation in the research study emerged through a careful evaluation of
criteria established through an extensive literature review of academic journal literature,
books, e-books, websites, videos, reports, blogs, newspapers, and magazines. The
researcher performed a meticulous search to identify exemplary academic libraries and
themes described in the scholarly literature, as well as award-winning or notable libraries
defined by organizations such as the ALA, the ACRL, and the New Media Consortium
Horizon Report: 2015 Library Edition and Wiki. The annual ALA Design Showcase, the
ALA Office of Information Technology Policy (OITP) America’s Libraries for the 21st
Century program, the ALA Library Information Technology Association (LITA), the

40
ALA Center for the Future of Libraries, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at
Harvard University, the Stanford Prize for Innovation in Research Libraries (SPIRL), and
the American Institute of Architects and American Library Association (AIA/ALA)
Library Building Awards provided the researcher with pathways to academic libraries
receiving attention for thoughtful, cutting-edge, innovative services and design
(Appendix E).
LITA is an example of an organization that tracks technology trends in libraries
throughout the United States and shares knowledge through blog posts, meetings, and the
Top Tech Trends events at all annual and midwinter ALA conferences. The researcher
conducted research using LITA committee online resources to seek leads about academic
libraries that are incorporating technology in noteworthy ways, and the researcher
followed up through related literature and Internet searching to gather evidence and
background information.
The researcher also reviewed posts on the ACRL TechConnect Blog, which is a
moderated blog that is focused on technology and innovation in academic libraries.
Using the blog posts as a discovery tool, the researcher investigated further academic
libraries of interest. In addition, the researcher identified blogs and websites including,
but not limited to, Designing Better Libraries, Library Tech Talk, Designing Libraries,
Disruptive Library Technology Jester, The Digital Shift, and New York Public Library
(NYPL) Labs that provided current information about technology trends and projects in
libraries.
Another source that proved helpful to identify academic libraries was the New
Media Consortium Horizon Report: Library Edition 2015 and its corresponding Wiki,

41
which included mentions of libraries that are implementing new technologies and
embarking on projects of interest. The projects shared on the Wiki provided relevant
links that led to libraries implementing innovative services and technologies.
Data Collection
To determine a list of libraries that would meet the aforementioned criteria, the
researcher performed extensive research of library websites. The notes and observations
made during this process helped to triangulate the data and affirm the internal validity of
the study by using multiple sources of data to confirm the findings that would emerge
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 244). The notes and observations of library websites,
interviews, and member checks would become the three measurements points, or sources
of data, used for triangulation of the study. Website descriptions are discussed in Chapter
IV.
After performing research and selecting a list of nine libraries, the researcher
contacted the director or dean of the libraries via email to ascertain their willingness to
participate as case study participants; three libraries would ultimately be selected. It was
understood by the researcher that barriers to this process included the possibility that
selected libraries would decline or ignore the request. The researcher created a schedule
for managing the communication process and used the aforementioned Excel spreadsheet
to track the communication and scheduling process.
The researcher sent an informed consent email (Appendix B) to the directors or
deans of the nine libraries to explain the study and request their participation as well as
approve the participation of others within their library. Upon receiving a positive
response to the request from the directors or deans, the researcher conducted the next tier

42
of sampling. In the next sampling tier, the researcher performed extensive research of the
libraries’ websites to gain a preliminary understanding of the organizational structure of
each library and to identify potential participants within each library’s staff, based on job
title, job responsibilities, and in some instances, library staff members’ curricula vitae,
professional/academic output, and/or social media presence. The researcher was
particularly interested in identifying participants that work with students and faculty to
support teaching, learning, and research as well as participants who are involved with
integrating technology into library services, resources, and the university environment.
The researcher asked each dean or director if they would be receptive to the researcher
providing to them a list of suggested potential participants at which she had arrived
through her research of the library website. Upon receiving permission to interview the
director or dean, the researcher offered a list of interview questions to provide the
director/dean with an understanding of and familiarity with the aim of the study. All
participants were asked to read and sign a participant consent form (Appendix A) and all
participants were amenable to this request.
The researcher created interview questions with the goal of identifying evidence
of how innovation happens in exemplary academic libraries. Interviews were conducted
between March and April 2016 with participants identified as library leadership,
librarians, and library staff members. To carry out the study, the researcher used the
following hardware: a pen with paper notebook to take notes during interviews; a laptop
computer to transcribe interviews and observations, review existing documentation, and
write the study results; an external hard drive for backing up files securely; and a printer
to print selected papers, documentation, and instruments. In addition, the researcher used

43
the following resources: New Jersey City University email system to communicate with
interview participants; online library research databases, the Internet, and reference
management software (i.e., RefWorks) to conduct research and manage documents and
references; and other equipment, services such as interlibrary loan and document delivery
services, and resources that were determined to be of value to the research process.
Data Organization
The notes for each interview were transcribed by the researcher into a Word
document and saved locally to the researcher’s computer as well as to the researcher’s
external hard drive. Documents were saved both locally to the researcher’s computer and
to the external hard drive. Some documents, including dissertation drafts and
bibliographies, were saved to the researcher’s password-protected Dropbox account; no
confidential data were saved to Dropbox. Folders and files were set up with a suitable,
simple naming convention to aid in retrieval.
Data Analysis
To make sense out of the data and to work toward answering the two research
questions, the researcher closely followed the guidance of Merriam and Tisdell (2016, p.
199) to develop a system to organize the data and assign some designations to phrases
that seem to represent a salient point, an outstanding summary, or a thought-provoking
statement in a process described as coding. The researcher was careful to assign codes
that would assist in retrieving specific pieces of the data later (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016,
p. 199). The researcher began by assigning codes to summarize particularly profound or
salient points made by the participants; some of the first level of codes included
technology, organization, teaching and learning, innovation, services, change,

44
uncertainty, 21st century skills, funding, leadership, future of libraries, and staffing. The
researcher made notes related to ideas evoked during the process of reviewing each
interview transcript by using pencil or pen to make notes on printed transcripts of data
that appeared interesting or relevant. The researcher approached the data analysis
process using the constant comparative method which is both inductive and comparative,
and in which the words and phrases elicited from the interviews drove the process of
coding (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The researcher used the coding techniques of grounded
theory (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 228), but was not seeking to create a substantive
theory or grounded theory. The researcher conducted the coding process in three phases
in which terms were derived from the literature review and the interviews and then
grouped into larger themes (see Table 2).

Merriam and Tisdell (2016) described the process of qualitative data analysis as
inductive and comparative; therefore, the researcher considered many examples from the
interviews to develop ideas about the data, and compared the responses from each case to
find common and unique themes, or categories. The categories represented answers to

46
the research questions. The researcher began with many categories and then engaged in a
process of looking for recurring themes and grouping them together to create a smaller
number of principle categories. Following the recommendations of Merriam and Tisdell
(2016, p. 213) the principle categories were
•

exhaustive

•

mutually exclusive

•

sensitive to the data

•

conceptually congruent

The researcher made certain to consider that the categories should make sense based on
the data, and that readers of the dissertation should be able to agree that the categories
derived are sensible. It was important to the researcher to be able to describe the
categories and observe connections between the cases, and to be able to describe new
information or awareness about the themes of the study from the perspective of the
interview participants. The researcher printed out each interview transcript and made
notes on each transcript to reflect the process of coding and grouping the emergent codes
into categories. The researcher systematically read through each transcript numerous
times to make notes and to begin to group, or code, the emergent themes.
Ethical Considerations
The researcher submitted the Institutional Review Board (IRB) application in
November 2015 and was subsequently asked to clarify several points. The researcher
submitted the requested clarifications in December 2015. The process was finalized in
January 2016 with approval granted by the IRB.

47
The researcher committed to confidentiality and therefore pseudonyms are used
throughout this study. Further, the researcher took careful steps to ensure confidentiality
when making mention in the written analysis which included a review of existing
documentation such as academic library websites, job titles, marketing text, locations,
notable characteristics, library services or centers with specific and unique titles, and
similar potentially identifying details. As stated in the previous section titled
Researcher’s Position and Positionality, the researcher made note of the careful
consideration of the ALA (2016a) Code of Ethics, to which the researcher abided
throughout the study to ensure the participants and findings of the study were the focus of
the process. The researcher was careful to reflect regularly on the potential for bias and
subjectivity.
The researcher took great care in designing communications in a professional
manner and to provide explicit detail about the research topic and what would be
expected from participants. The researcher made efforts to put the participants at ease
during the telephone interviews and took into consideration factors that may have
affected the participants’ comfort level with taking part, such as time constraints, the
potential for a sense of disconnectedness due to a telephone versus in-person interview,
and the guarantee of confidentiality.
Standards of Quality
To assess the rigor of the research, the researcher addressed the questions of
internal validity, the “extent to which research findings are credible” (Merriam & Tisdell,
2016, p. 265) and reliability, “the extent to which there is consistency in the findings”
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 265), and credibility. To address internal validity, the

48
researcher collected data through multiple sources including interviews and library web
site analysis toward the strategy of triangulation of data to confirm emerging findings
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 259) and “to build a coherent justification for themes”
(Creswell, 2014, p. 201).
The researcher engaged in member checks with all participants to ensure the truth
value of the data (Creswell, 2014, p. 201, 210; Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 290) and create
an opportunity for each participant to confirm what he or she stated was reported
accurately. The member checks contributed to the triangulation of the data, or using
multiple sources of data to compare and cross-check data (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p.
245). The researcher also requested the assistance of a colleague to read the interview
transcripts to provide commentary or ask questions about points that did not make sense
and the researcher subsequently followed up with the handwritten notes taken during the
interview and followed up to clarify points with participants if necessary.
The researcher approached the analysis and writing to exemplify rich, thick
description and create context for the reader, provide in-depth details about the setting,
and convey a sense of reality and validity to the findings (Creswell, 2014, p. 201). The
researcher engaged in critical self-reflection and reflexivity throughout the process to
identify biases and understand her personal worldview and relationship to the study
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 259). Without shifting the focus to the researcher and her
worldview, theoretical assumptions, and potential biases, the researcher was careful to
focus the study on the participants and study findings (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 65).
The researcher engaged in formal and informal peer review to varying extents
through discussion with doctoral cohort peers and professional librarian peers, and

49
through discussion with her doctoral advisor. The researcher constructed the study
keeping in mind that an audit trail was critical to the understanding of how each decision
was made so that the reader would be able to follow explicitly the process by which the
study developed. The researcher examined academic libraries with similar traits related
to exemplary innovation, but was mindful to approach universities with a wide range of
characteristics to consider maximum variation (i.e., large and small universities or
colleges, location within the United States, private or public, curriculum, and notable
specialty).
Chapter Summary
The researcher selected case study analysis as the method by which to conduct the
study in the interest of benefitting from the rich, thick description that interviews can
produce. The researcher designed open-ended, thought-provoking interview questions in
order to inductively gather information to assist in understanding the worldview of the
case study participants. To select appropriate cases for the study, the researcher
conducted extensive research of diverse web resources and professional literature to
arrive at a list of possible cases. The researcher requested permission from the dean or
director of nine libraries and obtained written consent from three libraries and two, five,
and three participants from library A, B, and C, respectively. The researcher was careful
to ensure confidentiality for the libraries, the participants, and their corresponding
universities. It was imperative for the researcher to abide by strict ethical guidelines and
engage in critical self-reflection to avoid bias and subjectivity. The method and
methodology were selected to assist the researcher in addressing the two research

50
questions for the study related to innovation in academic libraries and how organizational
structure helps to turn ideas into innovation in academic libraries.

51

Chapter IV. Results
As stated in Chapter I, this study was conducted to examine the following two
research questions:
1. What drives innovation in academic libraries?
2. How does the organizational structure of academic libraries help to incubate
ideas?
This chapter is organized into two parts. Part 1 includes the results of the interviews in
relation to the two research questions, and is organized into three cases: Case 1 (Burnett
University), Case 2 (Gerritsen University), and Case 3 (Stuart University). Each case is
organized further into two sections each: Research Question 1 and Research Question 2.
Therefore, in Part 1, the researcher extracted salient points from the interview transcripts
and reported them in relation to the two research questions. In Part 2, the researcher
discussed comparisons between the findings reported within the three cases, and
presented an analysis of themes which emerged during the interview and coding process.
Part 1 is a report of findings in narrative form. Transcripts for each interview are
included in Appendix F. The researcher provided analysis and interpretation of the
results in Chapter V.
Part 2 is organized according to the following four main themes and their
respective subthemes that emerged through the interview and coding processes:
•

Library as laboratory
o Experimentation

52
o Investment in people
•

Collaboration and community
o Partnerships
o Communication
o Decision-making and funding

•

Student success
o 21st century skills
o User experience
o Student feedback and involvement

•

Organizational structure
o Changing perception
o Re-organization and the evolving library profession

Part 1: Three Cases
This study was an examination of three university libraries as three case studies.
To ensure the anonymity of the universities and the participants within the libraries, the
researcher changed all participant, university, and other identifying names and titles (see
Table 3).

In the next section, the researcher provided context for the three cases by briefly
describing the library websites in an effort to assure the internal validity of the study and
triangulate the data by using multiple sources of data (i.e., the interviews, the library
websites, and the member checks). The section also includes description of the job
responsibilities of the participants in the following paragraphs to provide a more in-depth
understanding of the perspectives of the participants and the context in which they work.
Many of the participants’ job titles, divisions, and departments have been changed to
ensure confidentiality as some of the job titles, divisions, and departments have specific,
potentially identifying titles.

54
Burnett University
Burnett University, a public university, is located in the Western United States
and has approximately 30,000 students; the city in which it is located has approximately a
half million people. The library at Burnett University has approximately 120 staff and
library faculty. The Burnett University libraries website presents information in a
straightforward manner, highlighting new services, construction project updates, and
important resources succinctly. The website appears to be user-centric with well-planned
functionality and language, in that its search box has prime real estate followed by highquality photo- and image-driven news and events, a deep footer with image-driven maps
and links to frequently used resources, and categorization that appears to get site users to
where they need to be quickly. The text on the website appears to be written with the
intention of transparently conveying the value of services and resources; for example, the
benefits of particular renovations/services/resources are explicitly stated in a way that
aligns with the university’s mission, making it readily clear that the library plays a major
role in teaching, learning, technology, and research at the university.
Alexandra, Dean of University Libraries, is responsible for all operations,
management, and vision for the libraries. Juliana, Head of Digital Collections at Burnett
University, is responsible for the leadership of the Digital Collections department, which
consists of five people and is one of three departments that fall under the Library
Technologies Division: Systems, Web and Application Development, and Digital
Collections. Digital Collections promote the awareness and use of the likely unique
archival documents, photographs, objects, and ephemera in the library’s archives and
special collections area, most of which are specific to the history and industry of the city

55
and region surrounding Burnett University, by organizing and digitizing items for
inclusion in searchable online databases and web-based exhibits.
Gerritsen University
Gerritsen University, a public university, has approximately 25,000 students and
is located in the Western United States in a culturally diverse city of approximately a half
million people. The library at Gerritsen University has approximately 65 staff and library
faculty members. The Gerritsen University library website appears clean and crisp, using
clear language for headings and subheadings and offering efficient paths for users to find
what they need quickly. The site’s About Us page appears sophisticated and serves as a
marketing tool for the library, with a data-driven video about the library that explicitly
highlights the library’s pride in innovation in services, resources, and architecture. The
About Us page also provides a welcoming message from the dean of the library which
advertises the importance of the role of the library in the lives of students and faculty as
well as the geographic region; provides a historical timeline of the library in relation to
the development of the university; and highlights awards received by the library. The
website appears to be organized thoughtfully and provides high-profile space to research
functionality, events at the library, news of new services and notable achievements, and
links to unique collections. The library website also links to the library development
office, offering site visitors ways to support the library and become involved.
At Gerritsen University, as Associate Dean of the User Services Division,
Brendan is responsible for the leadership of three units: Research Services (Instruction,
Liaison Program, Reference), Collection Management, and Public Services (Circulation,
Interlibrary Loan, Maps, Music). Jamie, the First-Year Student Experience Librarian,

56
and Nora, the Coordinator for Research Services, are situated on the organizational chart
within the User Services Division. Jamie engages with first-year students and faculty in
support of the library’s and university’s information literacy and technology goals. Nora
is responsible for instruction, the liaison program between librarians and faculty, and
reference services.
Stuart University
Stuart University, a private university, has approximately 10,000 students and is
located in the Midwestern United States in a city and suburban region with an
approximate population of 100,000 people; the library has approximately 200 staff and
library faculty members. The Stuart University website offers research functionality that
quickly helps users to refine their search, and offers prime real estate to important
information such as hours, important events, and unique collections. The website
highlights high-profile services and resources such as information literacy tutorials, the
institutional repository, the library research award, and digital technology resources, and
provides library renovation updates and alerts in a clear location on the home page. The
university librarian indicated during the interview that the website was going through a
redesign process. The site also features a branding phrase that highlights the library
mission, and provides information about how people can become involved to help in
advancing the libraries.
At Stuart University, Charlotte is the University Librarian and therefore
responsible for carrying out the library mission and all library operations in support of the
academic and research goals of the university. Claire is the Organizational Development
Librarian at Stuart University, where she is responsible for assessing and enhancing the

57
effectiveness of the organizational structure of the library. Claire ensures that the
university’s and library’s goals and values are integrated into the library’s functions,
including how positions are designed, recruitment, assessment, how teams are formed,
and communication. Claire provides support for local training and professional
development, coaching, and specialized training to support organizational development
among individuals and teams on the library staff.
Ethan, as Emerging Technologies Librarian, assists students, faculty, and
researchers to select, evaluate, and use emerging technologies to create many types of
papers and projects, including multimedia presentations and projects. Ethan actively
works to explore innovative and emerging tools and technologies to support teaching,
learning, and research. Gregory is the coleader (along with Miranda) in the area of
digital initiatives and digital scholarship and he leads the areas of data curation and
digital library project implementation. Gregory oversees data management policies,
which includes disaster recovery, retention, and data integrity, and also works with
campus partners (faculty, students, researchers) to find solutions for the preservation,
curation, management, and sharing of digital content and data for their use in teaching,
learning, and research. Miranda is the coleader, with Gregory, of the area of digital
initiatives and digital scholarship, and she is the curator of a specific, specialized area
within the archives. Miranda leads the university archives, rare books and special
collections, digital production, and preservation.
Case 1: Burnett University
Research Question 1. In considering driving factors of innovation, Alexandra,
Dean of Libraries at Burnett University, stated that innovation is “coloring outside the

58
lines, breaking with the norm to try something different” and is “not just technology, but
ideas and how technology connects to an idea.” Juliana from Burnett University stated
that, in defining the term innovation, she thinks about “the evolution of the profession,
and how the profession changes to translate to meet the needs of modern day users” and
suggests that in the library, they are “going above and beyond just functioning, thinking
about the health and culture of the organization, one that is oriented toward problem
solving beyond satisfying needs” and that innovation is thinking about “how the
organization can reach out beyond what’s expected.”
Alexandra described a “fundamental shift in what you need to know to habits of
mind—the focus is on lifelong learning—not necessarily to acquire knowledge. . . . The
skills and ability to continue to learn—that’s what 21st century skills really are.”
Alexandra posed the question, “What does it mean to have serendipitous learning in the
21st century?” and described some initiatives the library staff have been working on:
In [the] leisure space, we have curated content by students on monitors to
showcase student research by the community . . . this is a celebration of students.
There are different types of seating, like booths and coffee shop seating. We have
a Press Reader. It’s sort of like the Newseum café in Washington, D.C. Students
can access thousands of international newspapers. They can use the hotspot app
while they’re in the space; it’s a fun way to push newspapers. How do you push
the concept of diverse views?”
Alexandra also mentioned, “We have a tech corner/gadget corner—we circulate VR
[virtual reality] goggles, microscopes, molecular model kits, that kind of thing. It
expanded to support group learning.” Alexandra posed another question: “The research

59
lifecycle: what does it look like for faculty, graduate students, undergraduate students?
It’s all about instruction and creative output. Disciplines are different—what does it look
like?”
Throughout the interview process, many study participants reflected upon the
concept of user experience, or the experience—and specifically, barrier-free ease of
use—a person has while using a service or product, and how this concept connects with
academic libraries. Alexandra stated that she
fundamentally [believes] the role of an academic library is to collect and preserve
the creative and intellectual output of a society. We’ve always done that. We are
moving from collection-centric space to connection-centric space . . . New ideas
aren’t discovered. We make our own way; we don’t follow others. I’ve been
breaking molds. I want to create the research library of the future.
To understand student needs and preferences and ways by which to enhance the user
experience, Juliana from Burnett University stated that they “study and gather data about
and by students” which leads to action, specifically, “how we implement strategy with a
responsibility to our students and what we are hearing from our students.” Alexandra
suggested their library was not very strong in the area of involving students in the process
to implement new services and technologies: “We don’t have a student advisory group.
We do surveys constantly. We do observational studies. We used cameras to watch
students moving around, creating spaces. Peers asked them questions. This information
gathering technique is: go broad and deep.” Juliana from Burnett University stated that
there has been evolution in how students are involved, through

60
student feedback, surveys, white boards in public areas with a question, have a
free coffee and chat. . . . It has been consistent that we always have gone directly
to students for feedback. If there is something we want to implement—a need
that is documented—just because the librarians want it doesn’t mean we should
do it. Once it’s implemented we do testing.
Students who work for the library, according to Alexandra, do better. By working
for the library, “they have other adults in their lives” and they are learning skills:
Participating in a workshop series is part of their job, to learn different skill sets.
We have many first generation students and students who are statistically at risk
for success. We intensely mentor them, pay them more, pay them what they need
for their education, have them become peer mentors. . . . The students thrive.
They’re in the dorms, orientation, they serve as ambassadors, they help the
librarians with instruction . . . and “the highest form of learning is to teach..”
Research Question 2. A theme that emerged throughout the interview process
suggested that innovation is enabled and enhanced by a culture of experimentation, and
that the organizational structure of a library may contribute to an environment that
supports experimentation. Alexandra remarked that she has been involved with space
planning for many years, and that intentional design contributes to a space and services
that support student learning. Alexandra termed this the “pedagogy of place” and
suggested the library is a laboratory in which members of the university may use
independent and group space, flexible seating, corners with white boards, and leisure
space; and that “people come to campus each day and spend their time doing different
things and move around their day.” Alexandra tells her staff that “they are cultural

61
anthropologists” and therefore must “observe behaviors and practices and make
connections” to help library patrons “connect to format-agnostic resources to make their
own meaning.” Alexandra suggested that “innovation happens along these pathways”
and that their library is “moving from collection-centric space to connection-centric
space.”
Juliana recalled how she was struck by how much people referred to their library
and the university as “entrepreneurial” and that the library staff are encouraged to
experiment and try new technology; for example, digital exhibitions and a research
project that led to an initiative with linked open data. Juliana explained that there is
generous support for professional development to attend conferences and opportunities
for networking, and that they are “encouraged to develop staff in ways to keep them
challenged.” Juliana reflected that she feels
good about [her] ability to [have] evolved staff to meet the needs of the
department. This is an important aspect when it comes to innovation. As our
organization evolves we have been able to cultivate an environment where people
trust each other. People are not able to innovate unless trust is there.”
Juliana indicated they receive $2,100 for professional development to attend conferences
and opportunities for networking. Juliana added, “there is a sense that it’s okay to
experiment . . . there’s no sense that you have to be successful at any cost.”
Alexandra recalled,
In lean times, we were asked, ‘What are you cutting?’ Others were cutting
professional development, travel, exhibits . . . I scrimp, I save to put money into

62
my people for professional development. This is for professional staff and
classified staff, too. . . . They’re learning, engaging, representing.
Through the interview process, many participants discussed the importance of
building partnerships between colleagues, across the university, and outside the
university to further the goals of the library organization. Alexandra stated,
Innovation is not an end, it’s a means to an end. . . . We interact and collaborate
with everyone, literally. We have liaisons. You name a department, we’re there.
Online education, diversity, civic engagement, career services, residence life. We
have undergraduate peer research coaches embedded; they give us further reach. .
. . What we teach, how we teach, engagement, intentional design of cocurricular
activities. This contributes to learning outcomes. The library is the only one that
functions in all spaces.
Alexandra described how the library is involved with curriculum:
How we’re making a difference in how the educational experience is delivered
and how we’re deeply embedded in general education. . . . [There are] vertical gen
ed pathways [beginning with the] first year experience, second year writing, third
year major, fourth year culminating experience. We have a place in the
curriculum with learning outcomes. We led curriculum reform. All new courses
are designed in the library to ensure the skills of lifelong learning are embedded.
There are spaces in the library for faculty to design courses. The library’s closest
colleague is the assessment and teaching and learning people.
Juliana stated that the community surrounding their university is

63
making strides to become a technology hub. We as a university take note of this.
We are looking at offering technology incubator initiatives, meet-ups to partner
with the technology community to support their needs in terms of innovation. We
see that economic diversification is happening in our area.
Related to relationships with IT, Juliana mentioned, “We have our own IT department in
the library. We’re not under the larger, university IT department. People really value
this; in order to make decisions quickly, it really helps to have our own IT infrastructure.”
Alexandra stated that they look at other university libraries, but that they do not
necessarily follow others. She communicates with other library directors and follows
higher education very closely to make connections and not just looking at libraries.
Alexandra said,
We used to have a hot topics meeting, but we stopped because it became
embedded in all our communications. . . . We have a robust committee structure
and a staff wiki which we’re moving to Google sites. We are very transparent.
We have 130 staff with a middle managers group of 22. We meet every other
week in Council. The meetings are open to all. Our agenda is open and all topics
are vetted. Any committee doing any work must have it vetted: the charges,
deliverables, timelines, input, results, recommendations.
Juliana stated that when it comes to discovering or coming up with new ideas,
People are the key here . . . by having ambitious, talented staff who are following
those ideas and bringing their ideas to the organization [and that] there are so
many bottom-up initiatives . . . sometimes I think we may be a little too

64
ambitious, trying to do everything at once. The staff is being encouraged to look
for things, try things.
During the interview process, some participants shared insight into the way in
which ideas are presented, proposed, funded, and implemented; introducing the concept
of decision-making and how projects related to innovation receive approval and funding.
Alexandra shared that they
started with the campus strategic plan and the library strategic plan which is
aligned with all five areas of the campus strategic plan, and they considered the
activities, user-based assessments, goals, and budget from the state. [They] made
a 1-year summary and a second year summary, all aligned.
Alexandra described how she encourages library staff to submit proposals for projects
and initiatives, stating,
Every year I do an open call . . . furniture, space, equipment, and one-time
projects. I ask, how does it support our strategic directions? For example, we
have a backlog of special collections and we want to get part-time help. They
[staff] can ask for anything they want. It inspires them to be creative. Limitations
are low. For the project-based, one-time money, for example, we had fellows in
special collections. As people start doing more, they see each other’s projects.
They ask, could I have some funding? They start getting really creative and have
the money plus the frame in front of them. And we are considering, what’s the
difference? What’s the impact? What’s the budget? What happens? How does
it fit?. . . . How will you measure it?. . . . Outcomes must be written in a usercentered way. They must think through proposals. There is shared ownership in

65
Council. Everyone at the table asks questions. Your job is to know the whole, to
understand the organization, the energy. At our organization, you must have a
high tolerance for ambiguity.
Alexandra further stated,
Another way we get funding is through donor funds, and this requires passion and
a clear vision. The library did not have a development office when I got here. I
have a board; not a “friends of the library.” They each pay $1,000 per year.
There are about 20 members. I’ve been bringing in about $400,000 to $500,000
each year. There are 12 estate gifts. Instead of me spending it, I give it back to
the board. I’ll do a call for projects to the organization. It’s an opportunity for
creativity and offers another pathway for staff. The board is more engaged and
proud of their projects. They say, we’ll make up the difference, we’ll raise the
money. The ideas come from my people; the board steps up. These are important
partnerships.
Alexandra also noted,
Another innovation is an 11-foot wall of monitors, a MultiTaction wall. They are
about $20,000 per monitor. This is a donor-funded gallery. We took about
60,000 images from our special collections and designed the interface. You can
see a word cloud of metadata and select; multiple people can use it at once.
The formation and disbanding of committees in relation to decision-making was
mentioned by several interview participants. Juliana described,
In addition to the permanent committees, amorphous functions of committees
come and go with the needs of the organization. [Some committees] come

66
together, do some work, dissolve, and re-form in different ways [and that] lately,
there are more people owning those decisions; I think that’s an interesting
direction that we’ve gone in. We have gone from a group decision-making
structure to people owning the decisions. We needed people to have permanent
responsibility for maintaining. . . . Discussion and evaluation is happening across
the whole staff.
Juliana also pointed out, “People are always a bit fearful or apprehensive when there is a
new leader. We have the sense that we’re flexible in order to sustain the life of the
organization, we may need to change things around.”
Alexandra indicated,
[For] every vacancy we discuss and decide if it will stay the same or change. Our
organizational structure changes a lot. . . . Library science programs are slow . . . I need
people who understand data and what digital scholarship looks like. I need people who
can help with media production; instructors with an interest in educational technology; to
embed the library in the learning management system to make sure our resources are
there. . . . For our classified staff and library assistant structure, we found the library
assistants were not recognized for the skills they bring; they’re paid less and top out at a
low salary. These jobs are more technology based. We’re turning classified [positions]
to professional level with more of a technology skills set. This allows me to upgrade the
positions.
Juliana shared,
The library organizational structure has experienced changes in various ways. . . .
Sometimes it seems that many things do a 180 turn and circle back. Things like,

67
what do we call technical services? Where do people perform different functional
pieces of the organization? What do we call public services?. . . . There is always
the sense that we can’t expect it to stay the same forever, and that is a good thing .
. . there is a great emphasis on developing nontraditional research services; data,
open access, partnering with faculty, digital discovery services.
Juliana stated, “The key point is that it hasn’t been extremely painful; we have
welcomed the opportunity to grow and change . . . we have a commitment to change and
growth, otherwise it would have been more painful.” Juliana offered that new hires need
to have the ability to come in and communicate their new ideas, and “there is an
expectation to be able to present your personal vision of innovation and how you will be
taking part in collaborative innovation.” Juliana proposed that “We have a job, we
should do the job as if it’s tomorrow” and to think about where things are going in the
future.
Case 2: Gerritsen University
Research Question 1. During the interview process, Brendan from Gerritsen
University explained that innovation is “coming up with unique ways to solve problems”
and that it is not just technology, but it could be “changing a service, a technology, hiring
people with new skills.” Jamie, also from Gerritsen University, stated, “Innovation
means that you are utilizing resources very differently to advance your agenda and
mission to service and access,” and that “it’s definitely about being willing to take risks,
experiment, and make things more accessible, like staff, people, and resources.” Nora
from Gerritsen University posited, “Innovation ideally should not just be occurring for
itself; it should be about improving the user experience; not just innovation for

68
innovation’s sake” and proposed that “we’re more successful when we are looking at
what are the problems we’re solving” and indicated that the focus is on improving the
student user experience.
Throughout the interview and coding processes, the theme of 21st century skills,
and what libraries are doing to support learning outcomes and new skill sets, emerged
frequently and in many forms. Jamie stated,
We are creating online modules and tutorials to support students; topics such as
how to use resources remotely. They are digital native learners, and the tools can
prepare them and they don’t necessarily have to be in the library. The 21st
century connection is that we are branding libraries differently; it’s similar to the
past, but we are focusing on different areas. We are forming task forces, for
example, the graduate students, we are meeting more to have discussions about
ways to promote student learning and engagement.
Brendan described initiatives that have been designed to fulfill specific student
needs:
Our students demographically are low income. Our area is ethnically diverse. . . .
Many families have no money. . . . One of the things we do is help the children of
these families who are coming to college, but don’t have tools. We started the
laptop program [in the late 1990s] where we check out technology for students;
[in addition to laptops we now lend] cameras—video and still—projectors,
calculators. We provide technology to students so students have tools they need
to succeed. We’re proud of this service. . . . We saw that we could help with

69
student success. Our graduation rates were low. We thought about what we
could do to help. A lot of work goes behind that.
Brendan found a cost-effective source for laptops: Faculty typically refresh their
laptops every 3 years, and the library then uses some of these laptops for lending.
Brendan continued,
We have a media editing lab with seven computers for students to do higher end
production work. There is only one [other] classroom on campus where students
can work on production work when there are no classes in there. The lab is
popular with students who are learning these skills.
Brendan noted they are adding modular collaborative study rooms as it follows the
learning methodology and it is a better use of space.
Brendan also described an innovation that did not cost much money, but that
made a big impact: They added subject headings to the call numbers on each shelf of the
book collection. They took into account that many students may not have had exposure
to libraries prior to attending the university, and this innovation makes it easier for people
to find items and make sense of how the collection is organized. Brendan suggested this
is perhaps the most important kind of innovation, as it is inexpensive and it directly
addresses a user problem.
Jamie stated,
One innovation we are working on is we formed a first year information literacy
advisory group consisting of faculty and librarians to define how we see
information literacy in terms of learning outcomes, tutorials, creating appropriate
content we’re putting in our tutorials. We meet once a month and we have

70
discussion and find lots of synergies. Before, things were siloed. Now we have
more faculty buy-in, and faculty feel more propriety and [have a sense of]
ownership. Librarians are playing more of an active role in terms of student
learning; creating bridges and dialogue.
Jamie noted,
We have special projects; for example, we’re looking at mobile apps in
research—this is a presidential initiative. We’re looking at Open Educational
Resources [OER] and how the library can partner with open textbook resources in
a cost-effective way.
Nora described a tablet initiative from the university president:
We are looking to create space that is BYOD [bring your own device] enabled.
Classrooms are being remodeled; students working in groups can collaborate on
shared screens. We have a big checkout program for technology: tablets,
cameras, all kinds of things like that. We have a Makerspace with small 3D
printers and we have a pilot test with Google Cardboard. We try to provide
technology . . . a lot of our students come from very low income backgrounds . . .
so I think it’s important for us to provide technology for checkout.
Nora continued, highlighting “a major website redesign which is mobile friendly” and
“new tutorials embedded in more classes rather than discrete and standalone . . . we work
on making information literacy a part of the curriculum rather than something the
librarians just do.”
Many participants addressed the significance of student feedback as it relates to
the design of library services and space, and some participants mentioned the reciprocal

71
relationship between academic libraries and student library employees. Brendan
indicated,
We use students who work for us as a sounding board, we just ask them. . . . [and]
I work with student government; when we have ideas we work with the
executives of the student government. If you have ideas, it’s a good place to get
feedback.
Jamie stated,
Traditionally I think students have been just consumers, but in my role, I formed a
student group—a focus group—that meets once per month; we talk about how
they feel, if they knew about a service or resource, and we get a sense of
something, it could be an app, to really be part of the library development process.
I recently developed a library technology video; they liked it and didn’t know
there was so much they could borrow from the library. They give us feedback.
Nora stated they could do better with getting students involved in the process to
implement new services and technologies, and that “We have student assistants, they
work on testing of things, graphic design, and individual projects. . . . When we do
usability testing, students’ responses are incredibly enlightening.”
Brendan described how the special collections and unique features of the library
have helped change the perception of the library:
People view it as more than a library. We have our own piano and we partner
with the music department for concerts. It gets people into the library. We are a
player on the city arts scene. This allows us to make connections with people you
don’t often see. This raised money for us. This is innovation of a different kind.

72
It changes how people perceive the library. . . . This is as important as the
technology. It gives the library a new purpose as an arts center, music center, as
well as an information center.
Research Question 2. Throughout the interview process, many respondents
commented on the importance of organizational support for relationship building and
professional development, both internal and external to the organization. Nora reported
that their library’s office of information technology and library public services “have an
easygoing relationship and are committed and receptive to new ideas and bringing new
ideas from conferences” and that the library dean is “very receptive to new ideas and
supportive of trying new ideas.”
Brendan stated, “It’s always a good investment of our funds to help with
professional development” and that the “dean is good about professional development
funding,” including online, free, ALA classes, conferences, big state conferences,
national [ALA] conferences. “Last summer,” Brendan stated, “one of our student
employees expressed interest in attending a library conference and we personally paid for
her registration.” Jamie indicated there were many opportunities for library staff to
attend conferences, workshops, and training, and stated, “We can craft our own
educational profile, look at the skills we need to address, see the gaps, in consultation
with other people in the library; this provides the opportunity for people to learn more
about their profession.” Nora stated,
We are super lucky; we have tuition remission for all the state universities. I am
currently working on a second master’s in instructional design. . . . We receive a
good amount of funding compared to other libraries. It changes with the budget.

73
We are faculty and part of the tenure process; we are encouraged to present at
conferences and write papers. It is ingrained in our environment and we are
encouraged to do this. If we need to change our job description, learn new skills .
. . [the dean] is very supportive.”
Brendan stated,
We partner with agencies on campus. Five years ago we brought in the learning
center for tutoring in the lower level. They make a good partner. We help with
the research, they help students write papers. We have the disabled students in
the library since the 1970s; they’re still a partner with us. They have adaptive
technology. . . . Having the disabled students in the library makes it accessible to
students more easily.
Brendan described having university administration offices in the library:
We have an advantage based on construction; the president of the university,
provost, top administrators have their offices on the top floor of the new wing. . . .
This means that every day . . . all of them need to go through the library to get to
their offices. They see all this activity going on and how many people are in the
library. . . . It’s good because the top administrators can visualize and see what’s
going on, they see the level of action and that our library is pretty busy. . . . Any
weekday this place is just packed. Our president goes and walks around and talks
to students. He’s very much a people person. He’s a good president for our
campus.

74
Brendan added that their library has partnerships that help them present art exhibits and
music events in a special space that is both visually appealing and closed off from the rest
of the library so the events do not bother people who are studying.
Jamie stated that aside from the many partnerships within the library, they
do a lot of partnerships with one, faculty as part of their research; we are
showcasing students’ posters inside the library as if it’s a library event as well,
and, two, we work with a lot of centers, such as special research centers in
engineering or business, it could be the entrepreneurship center . . . to work with
faculty and support their teaching needs.
Nora stated,
We have a technology innovation center for learning and teaching; it’s a campus
initiative. Instructional designers work on tutorial creation and this is housed in
the library. We have a nice working relationship. . . . We have a decent
relationship with our campus IT department; the library is just such a different
entity . . . we’re always asking for exceptions. In the library, we have a strong IT
head who is fantastic at getting people on board; he has good leadership. Library
IT is so different than IT anywhere else. . . . It’s good to have people—library
IT—who are focused on the library.
Many participants provided commentary about the significance of the ways in
which academic libraries address the communication of ideas and engage in collaborative
projects. Brendan indicated that the library staff gains new ideas from many sources:
attendance at conferences, listservs, the professional literature, and from themselves.
Brendan stated that they are “small enough that we have good, informed communication,

75
with off and on weekly newsletters on Fridays . . . monthly all-staff meetings so that
we’re together all at the same time.” Brendan added that meeting records are placed in
the library’s archives so there is “a record for the future.” According to Brendan, “the
library leadership team [dean, associate deans, head of IT, budget, facilities, faculty
members, head of special collections, head of research services] meet[s] every
Wednesday to discuss ideas and issues.” Jamie cited professional development
opportunities such as webinars; on-campus workshops; regional, national, and
international conferences, and “When we return from a conference, we have a brown-bag
lunch talk where we share with our colleagues informally and keep up with what’s going
on today.” Jamie listed sources of internal communication such as meeting round robins,
internal newsletters, minutes from meetings, brown-bag talks as ways to help the staff
share information internally. Nora shared that they “look at other libraries and keep track
of what they’re doing, for example, NCSU [North Carolina State University], and “we
have emails, meetings . . . we use our blog to post things there . . . the blog can be
searched and we can use it as a repository of stuff about the library.”
Many of the participants described reorganization initiatives that had occurred or
were occurring at their libraries. Related to the changing organizational environment in
these academic libraries was the subtheme of the evolution of the library profession,
including how library job responsibilities and requirements are changing. Brendan stated
that their library performed a reorganization approximately five years ago in which
technical services and digital services were placed under library IT, and created user
services, special collections, and administrative divisions. Brendan stated that their staff
had fewer people because of the economy, but that now they were hiring more people,

76
such as a new first-year experience librarian position and a new public relations
professional, who is not a librarian, to enable better communication. Brendan stated that
they are “hiring according to the needs of our community which is what we should
always do.”
Jamie described his position as a brand new position to help first-year students.
He stated, “The roles of technology are emphasized by the new university president, not
just the library administration, and campus leadership.” Jamie further stated,
There is more emphasis on technology and communication skills; you’re
constantly working with faculty, students, and peers, forming community, leading
meetings, all kinds of inputs to create an environment which is collegial and
supports group work. With technology there needs to be an awareness—you may
or may not use it, but you have to be aware. There is more awareness of
diversity—a lot of campuses are going through discussions about what it means to
be diverse and multicultural.
Nora stated that the reorganization required people to “change quite a bit,”
specifically within the areas of collection development, circulation, cataloging, technical
services. She acknowledged that “change can make people uncomfortable, for sure.”
Nora said that when looking to hire new library staff, “we look at specific skills, for
example archives, web proficiency . . . we have not replaced the ‘traditional librarian’
positions like cataloging; I think that’s true for all libraries.”
Case 3: Stuart University
Research Question 1. Charlotte, university librarian at Stuart University, offered
that innovation

77
Simplistically . . . is paying attention to what’s developing . . . in the publishing
industry, higher education, K-12 education as that’s where our students are
coming from [and that they are] being creative with how [they] develop new
services and how [they] exceed their expectations and give them new
opportunities.
Charlotte added that innovation involves “being flexible enough to try things out and
willing to say, ‘that didn’t work’ without people feeling as though they’re getting
punished . . . it’s experimenting.”
Miranda from Stuart University indicated that innovation “is to recognize library
patrons have very different research and technology needs than they did 5 to 10 years
ago” and her colleague Gregory stated that innovation is “new ways of approaching a
service, people, process, or technology, or provide a new service” and that it “doesn’t
have to be just in a heavy R&D area like digital humanities, scholarship, or digital
libraries.” Charlotte described an area in their library they “call the ‘fish bowl’, which is
a glass-walled room with a variety of seating. We observe how the students gather in the
space and how they use the space . . . so, renovating space as an experiment.”
Miranda recalled,
We found technology skills were a problem for students . . . they were
underprepared for job hunting upon graduation. This was a nonacademic,
democratized need. It was decided that the library would be a good organization
to help fulfill this need.
Gregory listed several initiatives that demonstrate new technologies and services, such as
the institutional repository (IR), epidemiology software for simulation, open science,

78
digital exhibits and collections, a program for digital scholarship with “various offerings
on GIS [geographic information system] text mining, data management; digital
publishing site for best compositions [not only text based, but multimedia] from first-year
students.”
Charlotte offered,
We gather a lot of information from our current students. As we were beginning
to plan our renovation, we had focus groups and the student advisory [group],
which is made up of undergraduate students and graduate students . . . so that we
are “staying up with that they want.”
We also rely on the Library Advisory Council, which is a donor council
made up of businessmen and lawyers, who don’t know much about libraries. . . .
We ask them what they’re looking for in graduating students. . . . As we were
developing the [program] for digital scholarship we were informed by that [in
thinking about how to] gather information and find specific types of data related
to their business.
Charlotte indicated their library has student advisory groups:
We’re developing graduate student fellowships in the [program] for digital
scholarship. The opportunity would be for them to work on their own projects
while learning more about the technology available. . . . It’s sort of the train-thetrainer model. This is how we involve students in the process.
Miranda stated that they “get feedback from the workshops [we] offer” through a
feedback form. She noted,

79
When we first opened we had a 3D printer; some graduate students stepped up
and said they’d teach it. . . . We have formal undergraduate and graduate student
focus groups. With the renovation, the groups help us understand what students
need to see.
Gregory stated they are “trying to get more engagement, and offer opportunities
for students to work on technology ideas related to libraries. . . . Students are working
with digital production. We will hold our first hackathon soon.” Ethan stated,
The library employs students . . . for reshelving books; some serve to do a little
hacking work in library IT services; our grad students at the reference desk are
amazing and well-trained. I sometimes leverage the graduate students who serve
on the references desk to do some design work.
Many participants remarked upon the evolution of academic libraries and how the
concept of changing the perception of libraries was involved in their diverse efforts to
help the library provide useful, relevant resources and services. Miranda stated that their
library’s “digital exhibitions and collections help us to manipulate library digital content
and drastically increased the number and visibility of people that support these services”
and that they “are looking to change the perception of the library and demonstrate the
library is evolving to meet the needs.” Charlotte recalled,
[As they were] beginning to renovate the interior space, [they] went on
benchmarking trips; the whole steering committee which included student
representatives, the associate provost, the money people, the associate deans,
people from student affairs, people from IT . . . we visited six libraries in 3 days.

80
It was an excellent way of helping those who don’t live and breathe libraries to
see [and to gather] ideas and information about trends, space, and services.
Ethan suggested that innovation should address questions related to rebranding,
remarketing, and reaffirming “our uniqueness and relevance as information and service
providers,” and “how might we best assert our claim to be a central hub of intellectual
and research activity,” and “how can the [library] establish itself as a technology center
on campus?” Ethan went on to state,
I want to stress that innovation is often understood as founded on the introduction
of new technologies which “change everything” [technological determinism]. But
I understand the relation of culture and technology as deeply imbricated and the
library seems to understand it this way too. In that sense, I see them taking a
multifaceted approach to changing the way the library is seen by changing the
culture on campus.
Ethan provided some examples of how the library is making these changes:
•

The revision of the library itself will get students to see the library as a nice
space to be in. We’ve totally redone the graduate student offices in the library
and they’re gorgeous spaces to work in, now.

•

The redesign and expansion of our (digital scholarship program) (thanks to a
multimillion dollar donation) will hopefully centralize the center/library in
students’ minds as and space for emerging tech (3D and line printing,
Arduino, robots soon? . . . design workstations, the assistance of experts in
GIS and other, and hopefully a more “community of practice” feel.

81
•

Hiring at least four positions [all PhDs] that I know of, in nonstandard
disciplines [non library-degree holders] in the area of digital services and
specific content areas, including an economics subject librarian, a GIS
librarian, a Digital Humanities librarian, and an Emerging Technologies
Librarian (my position). Several of these positions did not exist before.
We’ve also hired a User Experience staff member to help with the next bullet.

•

The foregrounding (soon to be a strategic initiative) to redesign the webpage.

•

A student library hackathon to leverage the students’ creativity in building the
interfaces and services they want and need.

•

Our library research and information literacy tutorial, which we are
redesigning.

Research Question 2. In considering ways in which the organization supports
innovation, many interview participants addressed the importance of those in the
organization’s willingness to change and adapt a culture of constant change, for all
aspects of the library, including physical spaces, technology, research resources, and
staffing. Ethan offered that “innovation, then, with regard to libraries, should address the
changes to physical and virtual spaces in answer to (in part) these questions:
•

How can we transform libraries physically to effect a mental shift in the way
patrons see libraries and make libraries spaces for two types of related
relationships—librarians as helpful guides who exist in and of library spaces
as communities of practice?

82
•

How can we leverage [emerging] technologies and technologically-skilled
library personnel to best serve library content and services to a demographic
for such patrons?

•

How can we [re-]brand and [re-]market libraries in ways that [re-]affirm our
uniqueness as information and service providers for such patrons?

According to Ethan,
[The innovation is] getting all of the patrons at the library [typically, but not
limited to, faculty, staff, and students] to see the library as a central partner in any
research process, as a place they want to be because they get the freedom where
necessary to explore and experiment, and the guidance when they need it to take
that further.
In the case of their library’s new center for digital scholarship, Gregory noted, “If
our charge is preservation and access we need to be engaged while it’s happening, not
just retrospectively” and that “the suggestion of new technologies is both top-down and
bottom-up” in which assistant university librarians, program directors, unit managers, and
individual contributors alike are given a “great deal of freedom to propose and implement
solutions”. Gregory cited an “internal hackathon where developers plus librarians work
together on an idea for a day and then present on them the next day; the winner gets to
hold onto (their) hackathon statue mascot until the next one” to “keep it fun”; and that at
least five ideas have made their way into production since then. As mentioned in the
previous section, Ethan cited the freedom to “explore and experiment” as important to
innovation, and that their library and university have made a commitment to “new spaces,
new faces, and new interfaces” through a “multiyear and multimillion dollar structural

83
renovation.” Charlotte suggested that library staff should feel as though they can “try
things out” without “getting punished.”
Gregory stated that “we have support to go to conferences and professional
development; our requests to attend professional development and conferences are sought
at least once a year.” Gregory added, “The organizational development librarian supports
some webinars and other local training. There is strong encouragement to attend training
on campus that largely is geared towards developing skills for communication,
leadership, and collaboration.” Claire described an environment in which
[It] doesn’t matter if I’ve worked here 12 years, I can have a new opportunity.
We bring in training in-house, anyone can sign up for a class. People can work
toward a project management certification, business analyst, technology
certification. We offer people time to get those certifications, we pay for them.
They can show their supervisors they will gain skills and expertise. . . . We offer
generous professional development support, approximately $2,000 per year per
librarian. We are in our second cohort for our leadership development program;
faculty and staff can apply. . . . In the leadership development program they focus
on communication, team building, influencing, change management, strength
finding, and continuous improvement. All leadership comes to talk to the cohort
about what it is like to be a leader. We encourage people to not be boxed in; if
you have the desire, you can look at new opportunities, we can help you. The
program is 8 months with 14 people in each cohort, one session per month; they
receive a mentor. Out of the first cohort, 10 are now new supervisors or leading a
team.

Ethan stated,
This year I was given enough [funding] to attend three fairly distant conferences.
We all have access to Lynda.com . . . and my memberships to ALA, etcetera are paid. I
also took a few online courses. We travel together to regional and smaller conferences,
colleagues and I, as well. All employees, within the scope of their job, are encouraged to
seek professional development. We are all required to write up a yearly progress report
of the things we’d worked on.
Charlotte described how they worked with the office of IT as they were launching
their IR:
It’s an institutional level need so IT will own it. The office of information
technology has a shared service model for basic computing and desktop support.
We work very closely with the campus development office; they are a great
partner. Fundraising is very centralized; we don’t go out on our own to do it. The
university human resources group is invaluable as we’ve reorganized, regarding
changing expectations and skill levels.
Gregory indicated that they are
pretty active locally and externally in terms of collaboration. Campus IT handles
all our support—our servers, storage equipment, network. We have our own IT
development and systems administration. We work with the center for research
computing for high performance computing support and simulation. We
collaborate with different organizations such as academic technologies where we
invest in and experiment with new technology for the classroom. . . . Just by
having the [new] center for digital scholarship created we have more

85
opportunities. Many were already here, but the center created traction. . . . The
community is a big part of our strategy and long-term sustainability model.
Gregory continued, describing partnerships with projects and organizations for
preservation of digital content, making digitized books and documents available online,
and an initiative for open science. Ethan described working with entities across campus
including a program that is focused on undergraduate student engagement, the graduate
school, writing department faculty, and the center for teaching and learning.
Charlotte shared,
The library faculty have a listserv we use administratively to share articles and
information they come across. For example, there are a few who are interested in
scholarly communication; those people who are tuned in and focusing on these
topics are screening and sharing, for example, “The best articles I’ve read…”;
they share trends and new ideas.
Miranda explained,
Once a month we have a brown-bag lunch and we come prepared to talk about
what sessions we attended and what we learned. For example, we have a
visualization space—what manifests in the library is what people come into
contact with, and how they are introduced to concepts.
We are expected to be at monthly faculty meetings; this is a central point
for dissemination. We discuss new jobs, retirees, modernizing positions, bigger
initiatives. Once a year the provost comes and talks about his vision for the
library.
Gregory stated,

86
[We] keep track of the Horizon [New Media Consortium] report, follow
colleagues closely at other institutions through blogs, and we are plugged in at
multiple levels in conferences and larger collaborations. The suggestion of new
technologies is both top-down and bottom-up with regular assessments at the
associate university librarian and program director levels while we have also
given unit managers and individual contributors a great deal of freedom to
propose and implement solutions.
Gregory stated that for internal communication, there are meeting minutes, direct verbal
communication, and that “we try to hit all the bases.” Gregory continued,
We do a variety of things, and it’s something we’re constantly trying to get better
at. . . . We hold library town halls . . . we hold open forums where people come to
listen to updates; our campus partners attend as well. We also have a weekly
newsletter that goes out with small little articles about projects. . . . We try to visit
other units across programs in the libraries.
Claire stated that they gain ideas from
conferences, sites like trendwatching.com . . . we don’t necessarily look at library
trends—we look at any trend—just a cool thing. . . . Anything that our users may
be wanting. We look at the Center for the Future of Libraries [ALA], Pew
Research reports, Ithaka reports. The university librarian looks at the library in
broad terms and doesn’t get down in the weeds; she is looking at the whole
organization and ensuring we are being transparent, meeting our goals, and
assessing. We love getting feedback and we do a lot of assessment. We make

87
sure we’re not just sitting back, saying, “well, we did it,” and getting into old
habits.
Ethan shared,
We have various Google groups and listservs under which we gather interested
individuals together. We also use HipChat to communicate with likeminded
colleagues. . . . Interest groups meet regularly. This is probably the biggest area
where faculty are encouraged to be bold in creating these relationships and
making themselves as T-shaped as they can. [A T-Shaped worker is an openminded, lifelong learner who has “deep knowledge in just one area, but a good
knowledge set and communication skills across many other areas” (Demirkan &
Spohrer, 2015, p.13)].
Charlotte stated that decision-making
is sort of a tiered process depending on the scope and level; decision-making
happens at the appropriate level. Technology decides the type of computer to
place at the workstations, they have a budget and they stay within it. But the
program for digital scholarship is a much broader implementation of services.
This initiative was out of my administrative group. [They] got start-up funds
from the university to create the spaces and services. The decision-making is
much broader. . . . If we have funding, the decision is made at the administrative
level, then it is my job to figure it out. We make a proposal to the provost or . . .
fundraisers . . . For new technology across the library, the process begins with the
library cabinet—the direct reports (two assistant university librarians, budget
office, communications director, program directors, about 13 to 14 people total).

88
We meet once or twice per year and we have a planning retreat. We started by
developing a strategic plan with five goals and strategic areas of focus. Every 6
months we look at what strategic initiative we can do.
Miranda stated,
For budgeting, sometimes we’re asked for these and we can’t accommodate, and
they’re put on the back burner. Data visualization packages can cost about
$10,000 per year and require specialized hardware. We also have to consider who
the staffing support would be. We try not to launch new services without
someone behind it with the right technology training.
Within the libraries we’re much better when we’re planning to start
projects, maybe 12 to 18 months in advance, so that the right kind of
dependencies can be lined up; for example, software licensing and hardware
acquisition, the time we need, who is in charge of implementation, who’s paying
for it. . . . We look at what is feasible, and what can the library support.
Gregory indicated that in the decision-making process,
It is a mix of looking to vended solutions and community solutions, and
ultimately we want to find a solution that will meet needs opposed to settling for
an insufficient solution. . . . With emerging areas, in many cases there is no
vended solution and we can do far more working with our peers. Research in
general is also a very difficult thing to serve with a one-size-fits-all solution, as by
its very nature it can be new and experimental.
[We] moved away from the idea of committees toward a more teamoriented culture. “Working group” is the best way to describe it. Some

89
committees outlived their purposes, they met specific outcomes and deliverables. .
. . We might form virtual teams to support a service that crosses multiple
programs; a diverse group that has the diverse abilities to meet that need.
Charlotte stated that the organizational structure of their library had changed
“pretty dramatically,” and
Once we developed our strategic plan in my first year as the director, we needed
to be organized in such a way to move forward these goals. We went from three
associated directors and 23 department heads to two assistant university librarians
and seven program directors; it’s more broad in scope. The reason was to break
down the siloes. Our guidelines were to aim for four to eight direct reports, with
no one-to-one reporting. Two to three people is not a department; it needs a
hierarchy. This enables more natural communication across the libraries. One
negative is we’ve created such broad portfolios, it’s sometimes hard to recruit.
Miranda stated that with the reorganization described by Charlotte, “management
received more training, which has been extremely helpful. We just did another
reorganization; once it’s done, you keep going.” Miranda further stated, “the most
recently hired subject librarians don’t have an MLS, they have a Ph.D. and external
experience to graduate school that applies to librarianship. This helps to increase Stuart
University’s research profile.” Ethan offered,
My hunch is that forward-thinking libraries are trying to effect tighter
relationships and partnerships with faculty and staff across campus. In key
positions such as those held by my colleagues and me, I will say that it helps to

90
have a degree at the same level as the faculty we’re working with to combat that
prejudice.
Gregory explained that to conduct the reorganization(s),
We did a survey and assessment to match needs and made quite a few changes.
It’s almost easier to do a lot of change at once rather than one here, one there. . . .
There were some voluntary retirements that allowed us to create new positions,
like the emerging technologies librarian. We are trying to hire a copyright
librarian.
Gregory remarked,
One change is that there is less emphasis on having a library degree, and more
emphasis on having a specialization and experience. A Ph.D. in a specific subject
area is very much equivalent. For example, I don’t have a library degree. I’m
seeking a library degree not necessarily just because there are opportunities for
more leadership, but more opportunities in terms of working with some of the
library based technologies and extending my skills, for working better
collaboratively and to facilitate interdisciplinary conversation, so as to make more
individual contributions in scholarship.
Claire described the major restructuring that occurred when the university
librarian arrived approximately five years ago:
Now there is more collaboration and cross-collaboration. . . . it used to be siloed,
then it became two divisions. The message is that “we need you to work
together”; that message has continued to this day. . . . Part of the reorganization
was to enhance our digital footprint; we didn’t have the staff before to do that. . . .

91
We made an effort to change and move away from strict subject specialties;
librarians would also be a curator, cataloger, be involved with digital
humanities—they would do something else in addition to their subject specialty.
This helps in adding accountability to subject specialists. They are expected to
teach classes, usually 15 classes during the fall and 15 during the spring semester;
some subject specialists are really embedded and teach 50 classes throughout the
academic year. Some provide instruction as requested, and more librarians are
teaching for-credit classes. As for groups, the units within the programs are
grouped traditionally by function. We were thoughtful and did benchmarking.
We looked at trends and issues like scholarly communication and we look ahead
to see what’s coming down the pike.
Claire also described their librarian in residence program in which librarians do a 2-year
rotation. She also added that, during the hiring process,
We look for librarians who are willing to take on leadership; this is now a
question we ask candidates. We also ask if they have any project management
experience. We created a project management office last year and we hired
someone to lead that office. No one else had prior experience in project, end date,
steps, and so much of what we do is project management.
Part 2: Comparisons and Analysis of Themes
To reiterate the structure of Part 2, there were four main themes that emerged
from the interview process, the website evaluation, and the member check. The
following four main themes and their respective subthemes were elicited from the
multiple sources of data and the three-phase coding process of the interviews:

92
•

Library as laboratory
o Experimentation
o Investment in people

•

Collaboration and community
o Partnerships
o Communication
o Decision-making and funding

•

Student success
o 21st century skills
o User experience
o Student feedback and involvement

•

Organizational structure
o Changing perception
o Re-organization and the evolving library profession
Library as laboratory. The first of the four main themes is the idea of the

library as laboratory, or a place where educational experimentation occurs given tools,
resources, and guidance to assist in the process. Alexandra of Burnett University used
the term “library as laboratory” to describe her beliefs about the intentional design of
library space and services. Many interview participants described the importance of an
environment in which experimentation is supported and encouraged, much like the
setting of a laboratory in which experiments are attempted, efforts are made to make
improvements upon existing ideas, and there is a culture of inquisitiveness. The

93
subthemes of experimentation and investment in people play an important part in
encouraging an environment in which innovation is encouraged and supported.
Alexandra also referred to the concept of the “pedagogy of place,” in that the
library represents a space in which library staff observe user behavior and try to offer
resources, space, and services that encourage the development of lifelong learning skills
and to help users make meaning through their use of the library. Juliana of Burnett
University remarked that an important aspect of innovation is an organizational culture in
which people trust each other and that experimentation is valued and appreciated.
Charlotte of Stuart University emphasized that flexibility is key to innovation, and
creating an organizational climate in which it is okay to fail, try again, and keep trying to
approach problem-solving in new ways with the goal of supporting library users.
An organization’s willingness to provide continuous support for professional
development, scholarly activities, and collaboration was a theme that emerged in many of
the 10 interviews. Many participants expressed the importance of organizations investing
in staff development, particularly as it connects to the theme of the library existing in a
physical and virtual space in which students, staff, faculty, and visitors are encouraged to
try new approaches to learning, grow intellectually, and engage in an atmosphere that
emphasizes lifelong learning skills.
Claire of Stuart University emphasized the importance of professional
development to the staff’s ability to carry out the strategic goals of the library and the
university. Claire noted that their library offers a leadership development program and
that all staff are encouraged to engage in new opportunities, training, and skill
enhancement. Nora and Brendan of Gerritsen University affirmed that there is a great

94
deal of support for professional development, and that staff are encouraged to attend
local, regional, and national conferences and training, so as to bring fresh ideas back to
the library and to make networking connections; the university also offers tuition
remission for advanced degrees. Jamie from Gerritsen University remarked that library
staff are encouraged to build their own educational profile and to take advantage of
opportunities to learn new skills. Juliana from Burnett University explained that there is
generous support for professional development and conferences, and that the library staff
is encouraged to experiment, try new technology, and make proposals for funding and
support for new efforts; she stated that many people refer to their library and their
university as “entrepreneurial.”
Collaboration and community. The next main theme elicited throughout the
interview process was that of collaboration and community and the importance of
developing strong relationships within and outside the library organization. Many
participants provided detailed descriptions of how the communication of ideas occurs
within the organization, and how the process of proposing ideas and projects takes place.
This theme includes three subthemes: partnerships, communication, and decision-making
and funding. Gregory of Stuart University expressed the importance of partnerships
across campus and with external agencies to the success of digital projects and the
implementation of new technology, in alignment with the goals of improving learning,
teaching, and research. Alexandra of Burnett University stated that the library functions
in all spaces, actively seeking out partnerships with numerous departments on campus
and leading university efforts to reform curriculum to embed lifelong learning skills into
the general education curriculum. Brendan from Gerritsen University described many

95
campus partnerships as well as reaching out to the city community, which helps people to
see the library as multidimensional.
Another subtheme that emerged through the study was that of communication,
and the many methods through which library organizations communicate both internally
and externally. Brendan of Gerritsen University listed newsletters, monthly all-staff
meetings, and regular leadership team meetings, as well as the importance of keeping a
record of meetings in the library archives to keep a record for the future. Charlotte of
Stuart University described a listserv the library faculty use to communicate about trends,
issues, and share articles and information. Miranda from Stuart University noted that
they hold monthly brown-bag lunch events in which staff and faculty come prepared to
talk about professional development sessions they have recently attended. They also hold
monthly faculty meetings in which they discuss initiatives, new positions, and other
issues. Information is gathered from diverse internal and external sources; and staff learn
about trends, new ideas, and topics through professional reading, professional
development, and conferences.
The subtheme of decision-making and funding emerged in many participants’
interview transcripts. Alexandra from Burnett University shared that she issues an open
call each year to encourage library staff to make proposals for projects related to any
aspect of the library. Alexandra stated that she considers how each proposal supports
their strategic decisions and goals, and she noted that this process encourages staff to be
creative and to understand the whole organization as well as the energy of the
organization. Charlotte from Stuart University indicated that decision-making depends
on the scope and level, and that they hold a strategic planning retreat once or twice per

96
year. All three universities have different ways in which they approach donor funding;
Gerritsen University library has its own office of development, Burnett University library
has a board of approximately twenty members and engages the board’s support and
interest through creative project proposals from the staff, and Stuart University library
partners closely with the university development office and a library donor council that
provides advice regarding how the library can help develop essential skills students need
after graduation.
Student success. The third main theme that emerged from the interviews was
that of student success. One participant referred to the term student success as the current
buzz phrase. Student success is described as high-engagement, high-impact educational
practices that advance liberal education outcomes (Association of American Colleges &
Universities, 2016). Student success initiatives are intended to inspire colleges and
universities to put their collective best effort forward in support of the best possible
learning outcomes. This section is divided into three subthemes: 21st century skills, user
experience, and student feedback and involvement.
In one of the interview questions the participants were asked directly about how
the library supports 21st century skills. Jamie from Gerritsen University explained that
they are branding libraries differently to promote student learning and engagement. Nora
from Gerritsen University noted they are establishing a BYOD initiative and also lending
numerous items (including laptops, tablets, and cameras), offering 3D printing, and
piloting other technologies to encourage creativity and impart new skills. Alexandra
from Burnett University emphasized the integration of research skills and information
literacy in the general education curriculum, as was also noted by librarians at Gerritsen

97
University and Stuart University. Stuart University’s new center for digital scholarship
brings new digital technologies to students and faculty, and initiatives that exemplify new
directions for academic libraries.
Ethan from Stuart University described the renovation of library space as a
contributing factor to improving the user experience and for changing the perception of
the library, as well. Improvements in the physical environment and intentional planning
and design of space and resources are important to many of the participants. Making
emerging technologies available to library users, according to Ethan of Stuart University,
is of high importance, and redesigning the library website and information literacy
tutorial are vital to improving the user experience. An internal hackathon was hosted at
Stuart University to get the library staff and faculty to work together to come up with new
ideas to solve issues in the libraries; they planned a student hackathon to engage students
in the problem-solving process and raising awareness about the library, ultimately
changing the perception of the library and its people and resources. Gregory from Stuart
University stated that the new center for digital scholarship created traction for new
opportunities.
Although library staff at both Burnett University and Stuart University reported
that they could do better in the area of involving students in the process of decisionmaking regarding resources and services, all three universities appear to engage with
students quite frequently and in meaningful ways. All of the universities use student
surveys and sometimes focus groups and town hall meetings; some have student library
advisory boards to encourage students to become involved and have their voices heard
about their impressions of the library and suggestions for improvement. All of the

98
libraries employ students and often the student employees provide valuable feedback and
insight into library services and resources. Students also serve as ambassadors for the
library.
Organizational structure. The fourth and final main theme that emerged from
the interviews and the coding process was organizational structure and its impact on the
past, current, and future of academic libraries, and this theme was found within many
different responses to various interview questions. This theme is subdivided into two
subthemes: changing perception & reorganization, and the evolving library profession.
Claire from Stuart University offered that they place great value on getting
feedback and they actively, continuously assess to ensure the library is meeting its goals.
Continuous evaluation of strategic direction appears to be interwoven in the values of the
organization. Shared vision and a long-term view of the organization, according to Senge
(2006), are important to the ability of an organization to adapt to change and thrive. As
Alexandra from Burnett University commented, their staff must have a high tolerance for
ambiguity. Claire from Stuart University indicated that the university librarian must see
the bigger picture and the staff helps in carrying out the vision. Following Senge, this
awareness of the need to see both the forest and the trees is important for the organization
to be able to identify problem areas and address them in a balanced way, and encouraging
all members of the organization to understand and take responsibility for solving
problems.
Juliana from Burnett University indicated that “there was a boom in the early
2000s, a bust, a hiring freeze, early retirement offered . . . there has been an evolution of
positions filled, vacant, renamed, new hires.” Brendan from Gerritsen University also

99
discussed a recovery from a period of financial uncertainty and subsequent staffing
deficits, indicating that their library is now hiring according to the needs of the
community, recently creating a new position specifically to help first-year students, and
supporting the development of technology and communication skills for students which
is a key goal of the university administration. Nora from Gerritsen University
acknowledged that their library is placing emphasis on different skills in the hiring
process, and that traditional librarian responsibilities are evolving to expand to web
proficiency and specialized technology skills. Juliana from Burnett University indicated
that their library is committed to change and growth, and so the changes in emphasis have
been manageable and positive for the staff.
Several participants commented upon the changing perception of academic
libraries and how innovation in services, space, resources, and staffing plays a significant
role in changing the way the university community interacts with the library. Ethan from
Stuart University addressed rebranding and remarketing libraries to promote libraries’
uniqueness to be viewed as a central partner in all research processes and as a place to
explore and experiment. Both Alexandra from Burnett University and Claire from Stuart
University stated that their organizational structure changes often, allowing positions to
be upgraded and making it possible for committees or working groups to form and
dissolve as needed. All three universities in the study had experienced major
reorganizations and participants viewed the outcomes as essential to growth and
development.

100

Chapter V. Discussion of the Findings
As academic libraries face critical challenges in the 21st century, many are
rethinking space, services, resources, and staff skills to meet the evolving needs of library
users. Still, many libraries face funding deficits and challenges in the way libraries are
perceived. There are some critics who state that libraries are obsolete due to the
advanced capabilities of the Internet. On the other end of the spectrum, there are library
advocates who believe libraries are more important and more integrated in culture than
ever. This study represents an effort to understand how innovation happens in academic
libraries, and how the organizational structure of academic libraries supports ideas to
become innovative services and technologies; in other words, how the libraries incubate
ideas. The researcher was deeply interested in identifying exemplary libraries—those
that meet criteria which distinguish the libraries as outstanding—and then having the
distinctive opportunity to speak with individuals working in those libraries who are
coming up with ideas, collaborating in teams, making decisions about how to implement
ideas, and continuously thinking about ways in which to improve the library for their
respective university communities.
Results of this study may provide insight into what exemplary academic libraries
are doing differently and similarly to address these challenges. As previously discussed
(in Chapter I), this chapter includes an extensive discussion of the theory as it can “be
contrasted with the existing theories and literature” (Creswell, 2014, p. 68). The
researcher used Senge’s (2006) conceptual framework of systems thinking to consider

101
how the themes that emerged during the interviews and subsequent coding processes
were inextricably interconnected and complex. In systems thinking, there is a “profound
shift in awareness” because “seeing only individual actions and missing the structure
underlying the actions . . . lies at the root of our powerlessness in complex situations”
(Senge, 2006, p. 77). The feedback perspective, in which “everyone shares responsibility
for problems generated by a system” (Senge, 2006, p. 78), can be a significant
contributing factor to growth or decline, aligning with the challenges facing libraries
today.
A reinforcing process, following Senge, suggests that a small change can build on
itself, in that it can become a “vicious cycle” or a “virtuous cycle,” or a “self-fulfilling
prophecy” (Senge, 2006, p. 80-81) in which reinforcement of beliefs encourage resulting
similar beliefs. Senge theorized that reinforcing processes can accelerate growth or
decline. Limits, a form of balancing feedback, occur to assist the organization to
“maintain conditions for survival in a changing environment,” or homeostasis (Senge,
2006, p. 84). These balancing processes can be challenging to navigate, especially for
leaders who are attempting to enact change within an organization, as many library
leaders are doing today, and as evidenced by the study results in Chapter IV. The
findings of this study suggest that the university libraries in this study create processes to
have an awareness and shared vision of how they create positive changes and
continuously evaluate progress and alignment with strategic goals. The libraries’
organizational structure is continuously assessed to ensure attempts to make positive
changes are contributing to the learning and growth of the organization and its
constituents.

102
Delays between actions and consequences, as Senge (2006) described them, “are
everywhere in human systems” (p. 88). Senge suggested that “aggressive action often
produces exactly the opposite of what is intended. It produces instability and oscillation,
instead of moving you more quickly toward your goal” (p. 91). The systems viewpoint,
according to Senge, is “generally oriented toward the long-term view” (p. 91).
Great ideas often fail to become implemented; Senge (2006) suggested this is due
to mental models:
New insights fail to get put into practice because they conflict with deeply held
internal images of how the world works, images that limit us to familiar ways of
thinking and acting. That is why the discipline of managing mental models—
surfacing, testing, and improving our internal pictures of how the world works—
promises to be a major breakthrough for building learning organizations. (p. 163)
Shared visions, according to Senge, “derive their power from a common caring. In fact,
we have come to believe that one of the reasons people seek to build shared visions is
their desire to be connected in an important undertaking” (p. 192). According to Senge, a
shared vision is not just achieved through compliance, but also through commitment
because of personal investment and significance.
Summary of the Study
Through case study research, this dissertation was aimed to elucidate evidence of
best practices of the implementation of innovative services and technologies in academic
libraries. Interviews with study participants provided salient points and themes related to
the research questions:
1. What drives innovation in academic libraries?

103
2. How does the organizational structure of academic libraries help to incubate
ideas?
This study is significant because there is a documented need for library services and
technology to be thoughtfully aligned with and incorporated into the educational goals of
the university (Oakleaf, 2014). The literature review showed that there exists literature
on innovation in libraries and areas related to this study; however, a deep dive into case
study research provides an opportunity for rich, thick description (Merriam & Tisdell,
2016, p. 256) and connections may be made between a qualitative study of these three
specific libraries and other libraries.
Summary of Method and Methodology
The method used was case study analysis, to perform a deep dive and gain rich,
thick description from the participants in the interview process. The researcher designed
the data collection instrument with 12 open-ended questions to inductively gather
information and gain knowledge of the participants’ worldviews. The researcher created
a checklist of attributes that would indicate a library as exemplary so as to be considered
for the study. The researcher requested participation consent from nine academic
libraries and ultimately selected three libraries and 10 participants for the study. The
researcher took steps, outlined in Chapter III, to ensure confidentiality for the libraries,
the participants, and their corresponding universities.
It was critical for the researcher to adhere to strict ethical guidelines and engage in
critical self-reflection to avoid bias and subjectivity. The design of the method and
methodology enabled the researcher to address the two research questions for the study
related to innovation in academic libraries and how organizational structure helps to

104
encourage ideas to turn into innovation in academic libraries. The researcher took notes
during each of the 10 interviews, transcribed the interviews, and then conducted a coding
process in which the transcripts were read numerous times and notes were made to keep
track of the themes that emerged. The researcher grouped and regrouped the emergent
themes until there were four main themes by which the researcher organized the results in
Chapter IV.
Limitations, Delimitations, and Assumptions
In this section, the limitations and delimitations for the study will be discussed to
provide the reader with an understanding of any features of the study that may
“negatively affect the results or [your] ability to generalize” (Roberts, 2010, p. 162).
Limitations and delimitations may be described as circumstances that may impact the
study’s methods or analysis: limitations are generally beyond the researcher’s control,
while delimitations are considered choices made by the researcher that should be
mentioned. A limitation of the study may manifest in that although the researcher
selected universities with diverse locations and varied private versus public status, two of
the three universities have similar student population sizes as well as comparable city
sizes. Another limitation of the study may present itself in that the researcher did not
travel to the three locations for the study to perform an observation of the physical space
and services in action; instead, the researcher conducted the interviews with participants
via telephone and gained insight into each library’s space, services, technologies, and
staff through information made available on the libraries’ websites. A delimitation of the
study may present in the researcher’s decision to focus on the perspectives of library

105
administration, library staff, and library faculty, but did not choose to focus on the
student perspective.
Discussion of the Findings; Findings Related to the Literature
In this section, the researcher will summarize the prominent points that emerged
through the interviews and the coding process. The interviews revealed that the librarians
and library administrators consider innovation to be a way to approach solving problems
and to meet and exceed the specific needs of library users, but that it also involves
“coloring outside the lines,” a “tolerance for ambiguity” at times, experimentation
without fear of failure (Gibbons, 2007), looking outwardly at the world for inspiration
and trends, and counting on collective staff creativity to come up with new ideas. A
contributing factor to innovation may be a culture in which experimentation is
encouraged and expected. The sharing of ideas as well as transparency of how ideas turn
into action may support the innovation process. A salient point that emerged is that
people and organizational culture may have a significant impact on the forward
momentum in the academic library environment (Hendrix, 2010; Shank & Bell, 2011).
Professionalism, the ability to communicate ideas and effectively transmit meaning, and
an appreciation for lifelong learning, combined with the expectation that the organization
and profession are continuously evolving, may represent attributes that academic
librarians and staff may benefit from embracing. The participants indicated that generous
support for professional development may be a key factor in encouraging staff to
continuously improve their skills and knowledge, interact with others outside their
organization, build the profile of the university and the library, and expand opportunities
for innovation.

106
The participants’ responses demonstrated that collaboration may be integral to all
aspects of innovation including, but not limited to, internal collaboration as well as
collaboration with campus partners, students, faculty, and entities outside the university.
Actively looking for opportunities to partner with others and perform collaborations with
professionalism and transparency appears to be a supporting factor for innovation.
Leaders of academic libraries seem to understand that communication is important and
the participants generally agreed that there exists barriers to communication, in that there
is no one perfect way to communicate, whether it be internal communication or
communication to the community or globally. The participants appear to try many forms
of internal communication of ideas as well as external marketing of services and
resources, to cover all bases and ensure information is disseminated.
The decision-making process related to how ideas are generated, communicated,
and ultimately implemented is handled in a relatively transparent manner; often, open
calls are made for the proposal of new ideas and projects toward innovation. In some
libraries idea generation events like hackathons are being conducted to encourage staff
(and students) to address and find creative solutions for issues facing the libraries in a
collaborative, constructive way. Service innovation may be impacted in a positive
manner through involving students and faculty in the innovation process (Scupola &
Nicolajsen, 2010). Some library administrators establish strong relationships with donors
and supporters as well as advisory boards to assist in gathering relevant feedback about
what students need and want, or what skills students will need after graduation.
Administrators in academic libraries appear to be thinking about student success
and student learning outcomes, and they are aligning library activities, services, and

107
resources to the strategic goals of their respective universities. The study participants
seek to understand the needs of 21st century students by gathering feedback through
surveys, focus groups, advisory boards, and student employees, in addition to being wellversed in the literature of libraries and higher education. User experience is important to
the participants, and it seems that great effort is put into hiring creative, thoughtful staff
who share the same interests and values aligned with improving the user experience
across all levels of the academic library environment. A commitment to providing
equalized access to resources, technologies, and services (Lippincott, 2013) is displayed
in these libraries, particularly Gerritsen University, as these participants think about the
possibility that their students may not have access to technology nor may they have
familiarity with how libraries are organized or the range of services offered.
Many participants expressed the importance of changing the perception of
libraries, and it appears that many librarians and library administrators are contributing to
a serious effort to advocate for their libraries and assert their centrality and value in the
university environment (Staley & Malenfant, 2010), which aligns with statements from
the literature that describe investment in higher education, the promotion of critical
thinking skills, and the advancement of innovation and creativity as paramount (Raju &
Schoombee, 2013). Modernizing facilities and offering technologies and services that
support the learning needs of students may contribute to student success, recruitment,
retention, and the student experience (Douglass & Mack, 2015; Reynolds, 2007), and
many participants in the study noted that new spaces, redesigned spaces, new
technologies, new initiatives, and staff who can help users make their best use of the
services and technologies make a significant difference. All of the libraries involved in

108
the case study have experienced some form of reorganization and some continue to
reorganize based on changing needs. Fear of change is recognized as a natural aspect
within an evolving environment, and it appears that the methods of reorganization
address the need to help staff overcome barriers to accepting change and engage in
professional development to align skills with new areas of focus (Doherty & Piper,
2015). Job descriptions are evolving to meet the needs of the universities (Gremmels,
2013), and requirements and desired skills for prospective employees are changing. The
participants, however, demonstrate the continuing value of the role of humans (Gibbons,
2007) in specialized services and technologies offered at the libraries. Changes in
organizational structure appear to be supporting these libraries to encourage the process
of generating innovative ideas and bringing them to implementation.
Conclusions
Implications for practice. Based on the findings and the conclusions that may
be drawn from the findings, the researcher believes a value of this study is that it was an
examination of three academic libraries that are classified as exemplary by the researcher
using a checklist of attributes including, but not limited to, whether the library has
received notable mention for practices, services, initiatives or facilities; if the library
embeds information literacy, programs, and services into the general education
curriculum in a robust way; and if the library offers advanced technology resources,
services, or initiatives. This special group of libraries shares similar attributes and also
demonstrates differences in approaches to innovation, decision-making, solving
problems, and their respective environments. This study may be valuable to library staff
who are seeking a way to understand the worldview of the people who work within these

109
exemplary libraries, and to those who may seek to understand ways to communicate the
best practices of exemplary libraries related to innovation and the impact of
organizational structure on the process of innovation.
Recommendations for further research. In future, similar case studies, the
researcher would recommend an exploration into innovation in libraries with even wider
variation (e.g., size of student population, size of staff, budget size, and/or geographic
location). It would also be useful and important to conduct a study of libraries not
necessarily classified as exemplary as they were in this study. The researcher
hypothesizes that there may be insight to gain through conducting case studies to
understand how innovation happens and how organizational structure impacts innovation
in diverse types of libraries.
Chapter Summary
In addition to presenting a summary of the study to review the purpose, research
questions, methodology, limitations, and delimitations, Chapter V included a discussion
of the findings reported in Chapter IV and a linkage of the emergent themes with points
examined in the literature review. This chapter also included implications for practice
and clarification of the meaning and applicability of the methods and findings of this case
study analysis for future research studies.

Appendix F. Interview Transcripts

Interview with “Brendan” from Gerritsen University
Wednesday, March 2, 2016

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

Innovation is coming up with unique ways to solve problems. You look at things with
new ways, an issue you have. It could be changing a service, a technology, hiring people
with new skills. It’s not just technology. People usually think of it that way, but it’s not
just technology.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

Our students demographically are low-income. Our area is ethnically diverse. There is
no majority, it’s an interesting mix of ethnicities. Many families have no money. People
come here for jobs picking fruit; they’re not good jobs. One of the things we do is help
the children of these families who are coming to college but don’t have tools. We started
the laptop program in (the late 1990s) where we check out technology for students;
cameras - video and still - projectors, calculators. We provide technology so students
have tools they need to succeed. We’re proud of this service. In one year we loaned
107,000 laptops for 4-hour periods. Now, we lend laptops for the whole semester; the
number of checkouts is 50,000. We saw that we could help with student success; this is

127
the buzz thing all over the country. Our graduation rates were low. We thought about
what we could do to help. A lot of work goes behind that. We moved laptop checkout to
a separate location ten years ago because it overwhelmed the circulation department. We
started with lending 25 laptops; now we lend 600. We found a great source for the
laptops: faculty. Faculty refresh their laptop every three years; I got them to give us their
old ones. So, we’re not spending money. The students don’t care that they’re three years
old. It’s an innovative solution to meet the needs of our students. We opened a new
building about seven years ago. It was designed to meet student needs. We don’t have
enough group study rooms. It’s the nature of teaching, group work is a staple. We added
four modular group study rooms last summer and we’re adding three more this year.
This follows the learning methodology. It was $112,000 for four modulars. It’s a better
use of the space. We have 8 acres of space; we now have a better use of the space we
have.

3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.
With the laptop expansion we adopted other equipment, projectors, calculators, cameras.
We have a media editing lab with seven computers for students to do higher end
production work. There is only one (other) classroom on campus where students can
work on production work when there are no classes in there. The lab is popular with
students who are learning these skills. We partner with agencies on campus. Five years
ago we brought in the Learning Center for tutoring in the lower level. They make a good
partner. We help with the research, they help students write papers. We have the

128
disabled students in the library since the 1970s; they’re still a partner with us. We built
space for them; the library hours are open more. They have adaptive technology,
therefore we don’t have to put this on our computers. Having the disabled students in the
library makes it accessible to students more easily; they got better space.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

Comes from all over the place. A lot of ideas we came up with ourselves. Our librarians
are very active in ALA (American Library Association). We use listservs and the
literature to see what people are doing elsewhere.

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments? We’re not so big that we can’t communicate effectively... We’re small
enough that we have good, informal communication. We have off and on weekly
electronic newsletter on Fridays. This is a tool of the administration. Archives prints it
out and puts it in the archives so there’s a record for the future. We just hired a new
graphic artist and we have a new position: public relations. This helps us with getting the
word out. We have monthly all-staff meetings so that we’re together all at the same time.

6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).
The library leadership team is the main management team: dean, associate dean, head of
IT, budget, facilities, faculty members, head of special collections, head of research

129
services. We meet every Wednesday and discuss ideas and issues. A lot comes from IT;
we need services when we want to try something new. The budget person knows the
money. The final decision is made by the dean, and he makes recommendations.

7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?
Other committees: the web implementation team aids in decision making for the website,
LibGuides, reference, research services, web staff person.
A lot of innovative ideas coming out of it. Research services have once per month
meetings. Technical services have regularly monthly meetings. Technical services is
under Library IT; the head sets the meetings.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation? Disabled students have the adaptive technology and
they’re good at that; that is our longest partnership. The learning center - we like having
that in the library - in the students’ mind, you find stuff, you get help - it makes it easy.
We have an advantage based on construction: the president of the university, provost, top
administrators have their offices on the top (fourth) floor of the new wing. The library is
floors 1-3 plus the basement. This means that every day, the provost, president,
personnel director, residence life director - all of them need to go through the library to
get to their offices. They see all this activity going on and how many people are in the
library. Before the construction in 2004-2005 there was a feeling that they were “taking

130
our space”; however I see it as a good thing. You can bet the library is cleaned every
night and the restrooms will work. There is space we no longer have that we initially
had, but overall it’s been very good for us. It’s good because the top administrators can
visualize and see what’s going on, they see the level of action and that our library is
pretty busy. We have 40-50,000 people per week. Any weekday this place is just
packed. Our president goes and walks around and talks to students. He’s very much a
people person. He’s a good president for our campus. He’s in his third year so he’s
relatively new.
Other partnerships. We have lots of space and we do lots of exhibits; art exhibits in the
(special event) space, an architectural theme that goes up through the whole building. It
is designed to be a fancy reading room on the third floor. We do big exhibits and events.
We’re doing things that the city art museum does. It brings the community to campus on
weekends. Parking can be a problem during the week. The special collections director
and development director work together to support innovation in the library…People
view it as more than a library. We have our own (rare, historical) piano and we partner
with the music department for concerts. It gets people into the library. We are a player
on the city arts scene. This allows us to make connections with people you often don’t
see. This raised money for us. This is innovation of a different kind. It changes how
people perceive the library. The (special event) space is closed so the concerts won’t
bother people who are studying. This is as important as the technology. It gives the
library a new purpose as an arts center, music center, as well as an information center.

131
9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services? They are the beneficiaries. We use students who work for us as a sounding
board; we just ask them. I work with student government; when we have ideas we work
with the executives of the student government. If you have ideas it’s a good place to get
feedback. Sometimes you hear things you don’t always want to hear; students want more
hours, for the library to be open longer. The student government controls a lot of money,
so when times were not good, the student government gave us money. They will give us
a charging station. (Another library in our system) has a charging station with little cords
to charge all devices with a locker door, you close the door and punch in a PIN. The
innovation came from the students; it’s a need everyone has - charging devices in secure
spaces. We also have a Starbucks on the second floor. What do people like to have?
Food and drink. We have the highest or second highest Starbucks sales in the whole
county. We have a liberal food policy, people can have drinks and snacks anywhere.
They can have a meal, bring a pizza to the second floor. Campus catering does the
events.
The library does a faculty publications event each year; this was started twenty years ago
to recognized faculty publications. What can you do to get our own faculty? We have a
display case with books, copies of articles. We have wine and food at this event. (Our
university is the only in the country with its own commercial winery). The library is a
place that people want to be.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?

132
We did a big reorganization 4-5 years ago. We essentially put technical services under
library IT. User services (I am in charge of that), Digital Services with technical services
and IT. Special Collections. Administrative services division.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
It hasn’t. We added STEM areas and cut back in Humanities. We have fewer people
because of the economy. Now we are hiring more people. We have a new first year
experience librarian in library since last year.. we’re hiring according to the needs of our
community which is what we should always do. Our new public relations person is not a
librarian. This helps us to enable better communication.

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?
An area we do quite well is if people are interested we fund conferences and training.
The dean is good about professional development funding. Online and free is easier to
pursue. Staff can take ALA classes, attend conferences, big state conferences, a lot is
going on in our area. I always go to ALA conferences. It’s always a good investment of
our funds to help with professional development. Last summer, this was an exception,
one of our student employees expressed interest in attending a library conference and we
personally paid for her registration.

133
An innovation, more than five years ago, it’s a claim to fame that is not touted often; we
didn’t want robotic book storage and retrieval. We wanted high-density, browsable
compact shelving and we put this in the basement. We have one million volumes on one
floor. We’re not filling up our floors with books. It’s an innovation related to shelving.
The collection has become much more useful and usable.
We began using RFID more than five years ago; we know who has the book, where it is,
if it’s shelved incorrectly. This is a collection innovation; it uses technology but a
different kind.
We use wands to read RFID; the circulation desk (employees) can do inventory, read the
tags, uploaded to the system. The provost paid for it with end of year funds - $600,000
for RFID tags. We can load into the wands all the missing items and find missing items.
We have 800,000 ebooks. A lot are government documents. When we buy we try to buy
an e-copy so that it’s accessible 24/7, unless it’s specified in a request. Whenever
possible we buy the e-copy. We’re making a conscious effort to buy e-copy versus print
to avoid space issues.

Additional material:
After I hung up, I thought of another collection-related innovation. This again was my
idea -- and one that we adapted throughout the library. It also relates to the needs of our
students, most of whom are not very familiar with libraries and have used their local
public library (if any at all) before coming to our university. This innovation relates to
one simple, standard thing that every library has, but that can really confuse people: the
range guides that tell people what call numbers are on which shelves.

134
We use the Library of Congress classification, as most academic libraries do. Students
have no idea what those call numbers mean. QD = Chemistry? There is no logic in that.
M for Music makes a little sense, but PS for American Literature means nothing. And
some students come to the reference desk asking for the Fiction section, which works in a
public library but not in LC because the P's have both literature and criticism mixed
together.

What I thought we should do is have the subjects listed on the same signs as the call
numbers. Since our call number holders are magnetic and cover the full width of the end
of each shelf, there was plenty of room to put the subjects in the middle. I am attaching a
picture of one guide from the Reference collection as an example so that you can see
what I mean. This makes it easier for people to find what they want -- or browse the
collection.

Is this innovation? YES, in my mind. And it is perhaps the most important kind. It
directly addresses a user problem -- finding the right section of the shelves. It is
inexpensive, with the only cost being printing out new range guides. For probably a
thousand dollars in labor and paper, we were able to do this throughout the entire
collection. And it certainly makes it more understandable to our users. especially down
in the basement where we have the compact shelving.

To me, that is true innovation -- inexpensively solving a problem using existing
technology (in this case the range guide holders).

135

Another innovation that I did not think of was the name of the Reference Desk. We held
a staff contest to rename it into something that we thought students would relate to.
(Staff person in the Arts) came up with this name. You will have to look at the picture to
see the result, but I love it!

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

Interview with “Jamie” from Gerritsen University
April 25, 2016

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

I think innovation means that you are utilizing resources very differently to advance your
agenda and mission to service and access. We are branding academic libraries as
fundamentally committed to supporting your community. This is maybe broad and vague
but it’s definitely about being willing to take risks, experiment and make things more
accessible, like staff, people, and resources.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

So, this library, specifically the one I work at, is going through changes. We are creating
online modules and tutorials to support students; topics such as how to use resources
remotely. Our students are digital native learners, and the tools can prepare them and
they don’t necessarily have to be in the library. The 21st century connection is that we are
branding libraries differently; it’s similar to the past but we are focusing on different
areas. We are forming task forces, for example the graduate students, we are meeting
more to have discussions about ways to promote student learning and engagement.

3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.
One innovation we are working on is we formed a first year information literacy advisory
group consisting of faculty and librarians to define how we see information literacy in

137
terms of learning outcomes, tutorials, creating appropriate content we’re putting in our
tutorials. We meet one a month and we have discussion and find lots of synergies.
Before, things were more siloed. Now we have more faculty buy-in, and faculty feel
more propriety and ownership. Librarians are playing more of an active role in terms of
student learning; creating bridges and dialogue.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments? I think based

on my experience we have professional development opportunities such as webinars; on
campus workshops; regional, national, and international conferences. When we return
from a conference we have a brown bag lunch talk, where we share with our colleagues
informally and keep up with what’s going on today.

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments?
We have research services, meeting round robins, internal newsletters, minutes from
meetings, brown bag talks when people come back from conferences – all of these help
us to share information internally.

6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).
So based on my understanding it depends on the budget status - we can purchase devices,
put in requests depending on the budget. We investigate with peers and other libraries to

138
see what’s important. For example we’re working on a 3D printer project so we are
looking at the when, why, the costs, models depending on the individuals or requests or
who might be interested. It also requires a lot of paper work, at the end of the day.

7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?
We have a digital services group in the library consisting of library IT, e-resources.
Needs to be in consultation to discuss instruction, future patrons, teaching other
colleagues how to use the new technologies. Informally we can create our own
committees, so we’re sort of co-managing as a group.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?
So aside from those within the library, we do a lot of partnerships with 1) faculty as part
of their research; we are showcasing students’ posters in the library as if it’s a library
event as well, and, 2) we work with a lot of centers, such as special research centers in
engineering or business, it could be the entrepreneurship center. How the library can
work with that faculty and support their teaching needs.

9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services?

139
So traditionally I think students have been just consumers but in my role I formed a
student group – a focus group – that meets once per month; we talk about how they feel,
if they knew about a service or resource, and we get a sense of something, an app, to
really be part of the library development process. I recently developed a library
technology video; they liked it and didn’t know there was so much they could borrow
from the library. They give us feedback. With the 3D printer it will be interesting to see
what they can do with that.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
Things have changed a lot since five years ago. This position is a brand new conceived
position, a first-year librarian to help students. The roles of technology are emphasized
by the new university president, not just the library administration, and campus
leadership. We have special projects; for example we’re looking at mobile apps in
research – this is a presidential initiative. We’re looking at open education resources
(OER) and how the library can partner with open textbook resources in a cost effective
way. We are starting new projects because there is new vision, new assessment for
where we should be heading.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
There is more emphasis on technology and communication skills; you’re constantly
working with faculty, students, and peers, forming community, leading meetings, all

140
kinds of inputs to create an environment which is collegial and supports group work.
With technology there needs to be an awareness – you may or may not use it but have to
be aware. There is more awareness of diversity – a lot of campuses are going through
discussions about what it means to be diverse and multicultural.

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?
I think our professional development opportunities to go to conferences for trainings,
workshops, anything useful. We can craft our own educational profile, look at the skills
we need to address, see the gaps, in consultation with other people in the library; this
provides the opportunity for people to learn more about their profession.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

141
Interview with “Nora” from Gerritsen University
April 19, 2016

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

Innovation ideally should not just be occurring for itself. It should be about improving
the user experience; not just innovation for innovation’s sake. As an example we tried
using QR codes throughout the library – it’s not really a need. We’re more successful
when we are looking at what are the problems we’re solving. We could spend time and
money and not see results. Maybe it’s a more conservative view but we don’t just want
to spin our wheels. With students in mind we are improving their experience.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

We have a big tablet initiative. The new president wanted to get tablets to most students.
We have a discovery hub housed in the library, where students help with apps. In terms
of space we are looking to create space that is BYOD enabled (bring your own device).
Classrooms are being remodeled; students working in groups can collaborate on shared
screens. We have a big checkout program for technology: tablets, cameras, all kinds of
things like that. We have a maker space with small 3D printers and we plan to have a
pilot test with Google Cardboard. We try to provide technology – a lot of our students
come from very low-income backgrounds – so I think it’s important for us to provide
technology for checkout.

142
3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.
The checkout program – getting technology into the hands of students – and a major
website redesign which is mobile friendly. We hired a web designer dedicated to do new
things with our online stuff, such as new tutorials embedded in more classes rather than
discrete and standalone. We work on making information literacy a part of the
curriculum rather than something the librarians just do.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

We look at other libraries and keep track of what they’re doing, for example NCSU
(North Carolina State University). Our IT and public services have a very easygoing
relationship and are committed and receptive to new ideas and bringing new ideas from
conferences such as Code4Lib and general academic library conferences. We have a
Web Innovation Team that makes all decisions regarding the website and does usability
studies. The library dean is very receptive to new ideas and supportive of trying new
ideas.

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments?
We have emails, meetings, public services; we have a liaison program. We use our blog
to post things there. Our student assistants who work in public services are the front line.
The blog can be searched and we can use it as a repository of stuff about the library.

143
6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).
It kind of varies depending on what it is; depending on grants, campus departments can
make a proposal and this contributes to funding decisions. Technology ideas generated in
our web group – we communicate these ideas to the dean and big ideas go to the
leadership team and the dean. Then it’s decided who’s taking the lead.

7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?
Our web team has been fantastic with that. Public services people are also in that group,
too. Ideas are brought to the web team.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?
We have a technology innovation center for learning and teaching; it’s a campus
initiative. Instructional designers work on tutorial creation and this is housed in the
library. We have a nice working relationship. If we want to figure out how to get a
tutorial into Blackboard, for example, they are very helpful. We have a decent
relationship with our campus IT department; it could be better. The library is just such a
different entity – we’re always asking for exceptions. In the library we have a strong IT
head who is fantastic at getting people on board; he has good leadership. Library IT is so

144
different than IT anywhere else; the library website is a good example of this. It’s good
to have people – library IT - who are focused on the library.

9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services?
This is something we could do better. We have student assistants, they work on testing of
things, graphic design, and individual projects they work on. When we do usability
testing, students’ responses are incredibly enlightening. We could do more – we could
have focus groups to get student feedback, which would be more beneficial.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
This has been huge, we had a complete re-organization three or four years ago, and
people had to change quite a bit. I have worked here for seven years. Within the areas of
collection development, circulation, cataloging, technical services – there has been a lot
of change. We had a mini-re-org recently in which we pulled instruction, reference, and
the liaison program under the research services umbrella. We are constantly reevaluating. Change can make people uncomfortable, for sure.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
Technology proficiency is probably just as valued as it was five years ago; it doesn’t
change very quickly in academic libraries. We look at specific skills, for example

145
archives, web proficiency and there are positions with a technology component added.
We have not replaced the “traditional librarian” positions, like cataloging. I think that’s
true for all libraries.

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?
We are super lucky, we have tuition remission for all the state universities. I am
currently working on a second master’s degree in instructional design. Our dean even
helps pay for textbooks; he is very supportive of professional development. We receive a
good amount of funding compared to other libraries. It changes with the budget. We are
faculty and part of the tenure process; we are encouraged to present at conferences and
write papers. It is ingrained in our environment and we are encouraged to do this. If we
need to change our job description, learn new skills, he’s very supportive.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

146
Interview with “Alexandra” from “Burnett University”
Friday, March 4, 2016

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

In our last strategic plan, our strategic directions, innovation is one of our goals, not just
technology space. This needs a lens, microscope, better understanding. Libraries say
they’re doing “innovation” but what does it mean?
It’s coloring outside the lines, breaking with the norm to try something different. Not just
technology, but ideas, how it connects to an idea. You need to have space to have it
happen. It requires knowing through an ongoing, audience-based assessment program.
Knowing who your users are, how they function. I said to my staff, they are cultural
anthropologists. Observing behaviors, practices, making connections. I fundamentally
believe the role of an academic library is to collect and preserve the creative and
intellectual output of a society. We’ve always done that. We’re moving from collectioncentric space to connection-centric space. To connect people to format-agnostic
resources...to make their own meaning. Pathways, innovation happens along those
pathways. This is still our fundamental purpose.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

We have a fundamental shift in what you need to know to habits of mind - the focus is on
lifelong learning - not necessarily to acquire knowledge. For undergraduate students,
there is 1) the focus on lifelong learning, and 2) we led the reform of our core curriculum.
The librarians were all over the process. We lead, we initiated the process. I gave the

147
opening keynote for the gen ed reform committee. How we’re making a difference in
how the educational experience is delivered, how we’re deeply embedded in gen ed.
The AAC&U (Association of American Colleges & Universities) LEAP initiative,
greater expectations, desired learning outcomes, critical thinking cluster, information
literacy. Campus ownership. Clusters, undergraduate learning. Vertical gen ed
pathways. First year experience; (second year) writing, reading; (third year) major,
(fourth year) culminating experience. We have a place in the curriculum, learning
outcomes. We led curriculum reform. All new courses are designed in the library. To
ensure the skills of lifelong learning are embedded. Spaces in the library for faculty to
design courses. Skills, ability to continue to learn and that’s what 21st Century skills
really are. Today the pace is so fast. Skills they need to be successful.
The library’s closest colleague is the assessment and teaching and learning people. I did
this at (another university) with a $1 million Mellon grant. AAC&U course redesign.
standards.

3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.
First, gen ed. Second, space, everyone’s interested in space. I’ve been involved with
space planning for years. Every single year we’re always doing something new. About
fifteen years ago we got a beautiful new building. In regards to student learning and
environment - I call it the pedagogy of place - how do we create a space that supports
students to learn. Library as laboratory. Independent and group space. The intentional
design of space. Flexible seating, group seating, corners with white boards. We’re

148
working on an interesting space - we’re calling it “leisure reading” for now - space for
students to spend their time. We believe students come to campus and spend their time
doing different things, move around their day.
We have the center for academic success and coaching in the library. What does it mean
to have serendipitous learning in the 21st Century? In this leisure reading space, we have
curated content by students on monitors to showcase student research by the community.
We have a display exhibits committee; a celebration of students. There are different
types of seating: booths, coffee shop seating. We have a Press Reader. It’s sort of like
the Newseum cafe in Washington, D.C. Students can access thousands of international
newspapers. They can use the hotspot app while they’re in the space; it’s a fun way to
push newspapers. How do you push the concept of diverse views?
We have a tech corner/gadget corner - we circulate VR (virtual reality) goggles,
microscopes, molecular model kits, that kind of thing. It expanded to support group
learning.
Concepts - biggest thing -We’re a research aspirational, Carnegie high 1.
The research lifecycle: what does it look like for faculty, graduate students,
undergraduate students? It’s all about instruction. Creative output. Disciplines are
different, what does that look like?
We were gutting the library and designing the digital scholarship space. We did an
Ithaka survey. Edgar Schein model of leadership. Entrepreneurial. Pulse survey. We do
an internal climate survey every year.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

149
New ideas aren’t discovered. We make our own way, we don’t follow others. I’ve been
breaking molds. I want to create the research library of the future. The spirit, the thing
people value most; they generate ideas. Start with a premise: we don’t need to look at
what others are doing. We do look at others: we’re doing so much more. My campus
likes to see what our peer institutions are doing. I chat with other library directors. I
expect the librarians to be cultural anthropologists. I’m not even a member of ACRL.
Constant yakking to ourselves. I follow higher education very closely to make
connections; hooks. Look outside. Look at engineering. “I can help you do what you
do.” Making connections to helping them to produce their own.

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments?
We used to have a hot topics meeting but we stopped it because it became embedded in
all our communications. How do we communicate internally? We have a robust
committee structure, a staff wiki which we’re moving to Google sites.
We are very transparent. We have 130 staff with a middle managers group of 22. We
meet every other week in council. The meetings are open to all. Our agenda is open, all
topics are vetted. Any committee doing any work must have it vetted. The charges,
deliverables, timelines, input, results, recommendations.

6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).

150
This is a structural question. I started with the campus strategic plan and the library
strategic plan which is aligned with all five areas of the campus strategic plan. The
activities, user-based assessments, goals, biennial budget from the state. We made a one
year summary, a second year summary. All aligned.
Every year I do an open call...to be listed on a big spreadsheet: furniture, space,
equipment. I ask, how does it support our strategic directions? Plus one-time projects.
For example, we have a backlog of special collections and want to get part-time help.
They can ask for anything they want. It inspires them to be creative. Limitations are
low. For the project-based, one-time money: for example we had fellows in special
collections. As people start doing more, they see each others’ projects. They ask, could I
have some funding. They start getting really creative. Money plus the frame in front of
them. What’s the difference? What’s the impact? What’s the budget? What happens?
How does it fit? The technology corner: the goal is for students to experiment, with
peripherals like VR goggles. To involve them through social media, to collect
information, create a learning community. Tough: we ask how. Outcomes must be
written in a user-centered way. “Students will…” How will you measure it? They must
think through proposals. There is shared ownership in Council. All at the table ask
questions. Your job is to know the whole, to understand the organization, the energy. At
our organization you must have a high tolerance for ambiguity.
Another way we get funding is through donor funds. Passion and clear vision. The
library did not have a development office when I got here.

151
I have a board. Not a friends of the library. They each pay $1,000 per year. There are
about 20 members. I’ve been bringing in about $400,000-500,000 each year. There are
twelve estate gifts.
Instead of me spending it, I give it back to the board. I’ll do a call for projects to the
organization. It’s an opportunity for creativity. Another pathway for staff. The board is
more engaged, and proud of their projects. They say, we’ll make up the difference, we’ll
raise the money. Ideas come from my people, the board steps up. Partnerships.

7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?
We charge a task force, we try not to have ongoing committees. We had RFID but
decided to stop. We always put groups together. People who are functionally
responsible. Usually it’s in our strategic plan. Assigned responsibility. We get the
stakeholders in a room.
One example is digital wayfinding in the library (maps like at the mall), or finding
available computers.
Another innovation is an 11-foot wall of monitors - MultiTaction wall. They’re about
$20,000 per monitor. This is in a donor-funded gallery. We took about 60,000 images
from our Special Collections and designed the interface. You can see a word cloud of
metadata and select. Multiple people can use it at once. There is information and QR
codes. We are looking for an instructional application. Architectural drawings, in our
high-tech digitization lab ($100,000) - cameras same as LC (Library of Congress) uses.

152
The resolution is awesome. Video, Internet, write with smart pen, tools. Health sciences
library, we are starting a medical school. Modeled on Yale’s digital scholarship center.
We use drones, too. Drone video of library. Time lapse showing bodies coming and
going. Tableau visualization data.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?
Innovation is not an end, it’s a means to an end. You probably read that in our vision
statement. We interact and collaborate with everyone, literally. We have liaisons. You
name a department, we’re there. Online education, diversity, civic engagement, career
services, residence life. We have undergraduate peer research coaches embedded; they
give us further reach.
Kids that work for us do better. They have other adults in their lives. Learning skills participating in a workshop series is part of their job, to learn difference skill sets. First
generation students and students who are statistically at risk for success. We intensely
mentor them, pay them more, pay them what they need for their education, have them
become peer mentors. $1 million. The students thrive. They’re in the dorms,
orientation, serve as ambassadors, help the librarians with instruction. “The highest form
of learning is to teach.” We have six students endowed, and now we have pushed this to
all student employees; we have 120 student employees. We partner with everybody.

153
Within higher education, shows the whole student learning model as a temple. What we
teach (content), how we teach, engagement, intentional design of co-curricular activities).
Contribute to learning outcomes. The library is the only one that functions in all spaces.
Peer coaches, student workers, library responsible for planning, co-curricular experience
they organize.
We brought in therapy dogs. Why? How does it contribute to student learning? We
developed a de-stress program with yoga, snacks. We are framing it within a conscious
way. This enables us to collect data through the swipes, retention and completion. Data
on instruction, interventions correlated to performance, gathering data to show impact.
Everywhere.

9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services?
We’re not real strong here. We don’t have a student advisory group. We do surveys
constantly. We do observational studies. We used cameras to watch students moving
around, creating spaces. Peers asked them questions and gave them gift cards. They took
them to the research consultation room. Information gathering technique: go broad and
deep. IT is our close friend. We did an Ithaka survey. What are the tools they need and
want? All my staff had iPads from the start to keep up with where technology was going.
If they want an iPad they get one. To play with apps. We have a teacher preparation
room. It’s only limited by people’s imagination. We are creative about budgets.

154
10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
People: Our permanent lines are all booked up. Every vacancy we discus and decide if it
will stay the same or change. Our organizational structure changes a lot. We have no
reference librarians at the reference desk. We have a help desk. We have a research
consultation space for half-hour 1:1 consultations in a room with glass, a wall-mounted
monitor, half-circle clusters.
We’re always making up titles. More data, more Open Access. In Circulation, there are
non-librarians; collection development is non-traditional; it’s the scholarly
communication lifecycle, educating people about scholarly communication, helping
people set up their ORCID IDs, helping faculty. Library science programs are slow. We
need people who understand data, what digital scholarship looks like. Help with media
production. Instructors with an interest in educational technology. Embed the library in
the learning management system (LMS) to make sure our resources are there.
Special collections, we have added six new people in the past two years; born digital,
digital forensics. One million photo images, rights management, MOUs. It’s different
than it used to be. A lot of data migration issues. VHS is dead; Canopy, Sage. Legacy
systems, dealing with media collection. We are dramatically weeding. Got rid of
government documents; we withdrew. Joined Hathi Trust. Get rid of print, add to the
body. We are always looking at job descriptions.
Our classified staff and library assistant structure; we found the library assistants were
not recognized for the skills they bring - they’re paid less, top out at a low salary. These
jobs are more technology based. We’re turning classified to “professional” level with

155
more of a technology skills set. This allows me to upgrade the positions. The ratio
elsewhere is 2:1, ours is 4:1. We have a lot of professional and librarian positions.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
(and)
12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?
In lean times, we were asked, What are you cutting? Others were cutting professional
development travel, exhibits. I’m used to being the only person in the room. I scrimp, I
save to put money into my people for professional development. This is for professional
staff and classified staff, too. If they want training, they can go to anything they want.
Maybe not all at once, but they go. Immersion, Harvard Leadership Institute. If they
want to learn Tableau advanced, cameras, we always say yes. They’re learning,
engaging, representing. We’re tenure-track faculty, we have a twelve-month contract.
We wanted to raise the bar. When I first arrived here there were no grants. We had five
last year. We look at the teaching load. We provide research leave up to six months. A
group of three are co-authoring a book. We carefully timed it and they each got 3-4
months out of it. You have to ask them, can you manage it? Now, they’re being asked to
be co-PIs by faculty.
My advice is to know why you’re doing them. For example the Read posters. I only hire
people from ALA accredited programs. I have issues with the profession. We have a
professional classified Administrative Faculty. Represented by faculty senate. For

156
example if I want a Drupal developer or a data analyst. The library faculty hold the line.
Too many webinars. We’ll pay for it. Archive them. Lynda.com, self-directed learning.
We bring consultants in. Project Information Literacy. Talk about the results.
Management competencies. Department heads. What are the outcomes? Who is the
audience? Read posters. Why? What does success look like? How do you know what
success looks like?

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

Interview with “Juliana” from “Burnett University”
Tuesday, April 19, 2016

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

That’s an interesting question. My first thought about innovation as I think of it in my
profession as an academic librarian, I am thinking about the evolution of the profession,
and how the profession changes to translate to meet the needs of modern day users. We
are not only keeping our library going…We’re thinking about the library as a healthy
organization that’s functional but also encouraging it to thrive, beyond basic services.
We are going above and beyond just functioning, thinking about the health and culture of
the organization, one that is oriented toward problem solving beyond satisfying needs.
How the organization can reach out beyond what’s expected.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

When I came to UNLV there is a very sort of direct acknowledgement that we’re not just
a traditional research library. I was very struck by how much people referred to the
library and the university as “entrepreneurial”. We acknowledge that the community
may be unique and we are supporting the students in the community beyond
traditional…2) We study and gather data about and by students. 3) Leading to action.
How we implement strategy with a responsibility to our students and what we are hearing
from our students.

158
3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.
So many - The way our library faculty are really embedded with general education
initiatives on campus - this is important and may be unique. Innovation in information
literacy programs – we are partnering closely with faculty. We have a structured way of
implementation in faculty course design and assignment design. Information literacy is
part of the curriculum, all the way through their graduation, career. We see ourselves as
part of the educational mission; this makes us unique, innovative. Our faculty are
engaged in looking at the co-curricular needs where we support students for success,
gathering life skills. For student employment we offer certificates they can earn, we do a
lot of mentoring and we have a leadership program. We have well-supported technology
- the area I am in - technology initiatives are well-supported. Getting new technology,
trying new technology, encouraging experimentation. We have digital exhibitions, with
touchscreen monitors. A research project that later became a full-blown initiative - we
are working on with linked open data - we’re not seeing other libraries really supporting
this. Encouraging to experiment with a tool.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

People are the key here. There are so many bottom-up initiatives - so many it is
bordering on almost becoming a challenge - simultaneously we have so many talented
people bringing new ideas, going to conferences. Sometimes I think we may be a little
too ambitious, trying to do everything all at once. The staff is being encouraged to look
for things, try things. We have good support for professional development, good support

159
for opportunities to network, trainings, where we constantly get new ideas. By having
ambitious, talented staff who are following those ideas and bringing their ideas to the
organization.

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments?
I think that this has changed over time. When we were a smaller organization, innovation
happened in technology formally. As we began growing, more people were working
across departments on innovation projects and there is a more formal way to document
what is going on. Our dean does a blog which provides us with a unique perspective, we
receive an email notification when she has published a blog post. We have had a staff
wiki for about ten years where we throw a lot of information like formal communication
and meeting notes, investigation, project reports, things that you may not want to be
immediately a part of but want to keep an eye on. We have town hall meetings where
people will present on a topic; anyone can join. You could go on a Friday afternoon.
Researchers and fellows are coming to use our collections on (specific topic) because we
are based in (specific geographic area). It’s great to learn about things and get a different
perspective. We started a few years ago with scholarship colloquium, where we have
five-minute presentations, where faculty give lightning talks. We have a way of
communicating that is really successful. It gives insights into what is going on with
faculty and opens up possibilities for collaboration. We learn about new ideas and trends,
and to communicate with faculty internally before it turns into a project.

160
6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).
A lot comes from bottom-up in our library. Our library is responsive to things coming up
from staff and ideas are report to the dean. Good communication. Bringing ideas up
through the hierarchy.
There is an exciting call for projects. During that call, staff are able to suggest all kinds
of projects. Some projects involve hiring temporary staff, space renovation, and new
technology. Anyone in the library who has an idea can conceptualize what they want to
do, get an idea of the staff and funding that would be required. The ideas are discussed in
a group meeting of the dean’s council. It’s an interesting discussion, it’s a nice balance
of getting new ideas in front of people. There is a sense that it’s okay to experiment there’s no sense that you have to be successful at any cost. We tried a 3D printer project.
We’re constantly pushing new ideas forward. This flattens the organization in that you
don’t have to go through your department director, you can go directly through the
hierarchy. I love hearing the ideas from other people.

7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?
There are permanent departments and groups; the library technology division has the
systems department, network computing, department of web and application
development services. This is a permanent, functioning unit that brings new technology
into the libraries. There is the dean’s council, where you can bring an initial, small scale

161
pilot project. If it becomes long term and sustainable it can become a functional unit to
maintain and sustain. We have tried various representation groups to make decisions.
Committees come together, do some work, dissolve, and re-form in different ways. A
committee was formed to look at the Integrated Library System, discovery services, web
technology, and digital exhibits. In addition to the permanent committees, amorphous
functions of committees come and go depending on the needs of the organization.
Lately, there are more people owning those decisions; I think that’s an interesting
direction that we’ve gone in. We have gone from a group decision-making structure to
people owning the decisions. We needed people to have permanent responsibility for
maintaining. Discussion and evaluation is happening across the whole staff. This is my
perspective.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?
This is a hot issue in academic libraries. We have our own IT department in our library.
We’re not under the larger, university IT department. People really value this; in order to
make decisions more quickly, it really helps to have our own IT infrastructure. I should
make note of the (specific geographic area) community is making strides to become a
technology hub. We as a university community take note of this. We are looking at
offering technology incubator initiatives, meetups to partner with the technology
community to support their needs in terms of innovation. We see that economic

162
diversification is happening in our area; diversification beyond the (specific industry of
the geographic region).

9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services?
There has been evolution in this area as well. The library always had someone working
on assessment. We have expanded this component for things like getting student
feedback, surveys, white boards in public areas with a question, have a free coffee and
chat. For new programs that we want to try out we don’t always go through the
assessment person, we have a usability committee and user feedback group. It has been
consistent that we always have gone directly to students for feedback. If there is
something we want to implement - a need that is documented...just because the librarians
want it doesn’t mean we should do it. Once it’s implemented we do testing.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
Yes, it has changed. The library organizational structure has experienced changes in
various ways. I have been here ten years. Sometimes it seems that many things do a 180
turn and circle back. Things like, what do we call technical services, where do people
perform different functional pieces of the organization? What do we call public services?
In technology, digital collections, library technology, special collections; there has been
some discussion about putting them all under technical services. There is always the
sense that we can’t expect it to stay the same forever, and that is a good thing. As we

163
have had new leadership, it has not been difficult to evolve… it doesn’t matter what your
job title is, or your department, as there is so much collaboration. People are always a bit
fearful or apprehensive when there is a new leader. We have the sense that we’re flexible
in order to sustain the life of the organization, we may need to change things around.
There was a boom in the early 2000s, a bust, a hiring freeze, early retirement offered.
There has been an evolution of positions filled, vacant, renamed, new hires. There is a
great emphasis on developing non-traditional research services. Data, open access,
partnering with faculty - this type of project. Digital discovery services, new areas. The
liaison program is evolving…The key point is that it hasn’t been extremely painful, we
have welcomed the opportunity to grow and change, we have a commitment to change
and growth - otherwise it would have been more painful.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
The ability for new librarians to come in and communicate their new ideas...There is an
expectation that if you join this organization, you’ll be responsible for communicating
ideas. You are expected to be able to present your personal vision of innovation and how
you will be taking part in collaborative innovation. Reflecting how to articulate...when
they see things, where things are going in the future. We have a job, do the job as if it’s
tomorrow.

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?

164
We do have as faculty members $2,100 for professional development to attend
conferences, opportunities for networking. As a manager if I ask for something it is often
supported. We are encouraged to develop staff in ways to keep them challenged. As a
manager I feel good about my ability to evolve staff to meet the needs of the department.
This is an important aspect when it comes to innovation. As our organization evolves we
have been able to cultivate an environment where people trust each other. People are not
able to innovate unless trust is there. It does scare me as we are getting bigger - if we
will lose that trust. I don’t see it now, but it’s always a risk with more people and
overhead. There is that risk that we could lose that close-knit aspect. It’s hard to
quantify.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

165
Interview with “Charlotte” from “Stuart University”
Thursday, March 3, 2016

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

Simplistically I think it’s paying attention to what’s developing.. in the publishing
industry, education - higher education and K-12 as that’s where our students are coming
from. Being creative with how we develop new services and how we exceed their
expectations and give them new opportunities.
It’s being flexible enough to try things out and willing to say THAT didn’t work without
people feeling as though they’re getting punished. It’s about experimenting.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

We gather a lot of information from our current students. As we were beginning to plan
our renovation, we had focus groups and the Student Advisory (group), which is made up
of undergraduate students and graduate students. We draw from those and in planning
projects, we are staying up with what they want.
We also rely on the Library Advisory Council, which is a donor council made up of
businessmen and lawyers, who don’t know much about libraries except what we tell
them. We ask them what they’re looking for in graduating students.
As we were developing the (digital scholarship program) we were informed by that.
They told us, for example, that they look to hire graduates who know how to gather
information and find specific types of data related to their business, like when a business
should tock a certain product related to the weather and climate for a particular area.

166

3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.
The (digital scholarship program) opened three years ago (you can see our website for
more details as you seem to have done research on our website). We shamelessly
modeled the (digital scholarship program) after other institutions. We looked at other
institutions. The (digital scholarship program) was not innovation in the library world
but certainly for this institution at the time; for where the priorities are.
Other initiatives might be related to innovation… Before the renovation, when we were
considering the master plan and study space was a part of that. We have something we
call the “fish bowl”, which is a glass-walled room with a variety of seating. We observe
how the students gather in the space and how they use the space. So, renovating space as
an experiment.
It is important that we have demonstrable results; when we are considering the traffic and
use of library space we learned that both dramatically increased when we put in fresh
furniture that drew people in.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

Related to beginning to renovate the interior space, we went on benchmarking trips; the
whole steering committee, which included student representatives, the associate provost,
associate deans, representatives from student affairs, representatives from IT. We visited
six libraries in four states in three days. It was an excellent way of helping those who

167
don’t live and breathe libraries to see. In a relatively short time, we gathered a lot of
ideas and information about trends, space AND services. It gave us a good, fresh picture.

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments?
The library faculty have a listerv we use administratively to share articles and
information they come across. For example, there are a few who are interested in
scholarly communication; those people who are tuned in and focusing on these topics are
screening and sharing, for example, “The best articles I’ve read…” - they share trends
and new ideas.

6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).
It’s sort of a tiered process depending on scope and level. The goal is for decisionmaking to happen at the appropriate level. Technology unit decides the type of computer
to place at the workstations; they have a budget and they stay within it.
But the (digital scholarship program) is a much broader implementation of services. This
initiative was out of my administrative group. They got start-up funds from the
university to create the spaces and services. The decision-making is much broader. We
led the development, the major parts. Now that the program is in place, the program
director has an operating budget and authority to make decisions about services and
equipment. Decisions about priorities and direction are made at the administrative level.

168
Then it is my job to figure it out how to obtain the needed resources, often by a proposal
to the provost and/or working with University fundraisers.

7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?
For new technology across the library, the process begins with the library cabinet - the
direct reports, two assistant university librarians, budget officer, communications
director, program directors; 13-14 people total. We meet once each week, plus we have a
planning retreat twice each year. We started by developing a strategic plan with five
goals and strategic areas of focus. Every six months we look at what strategic initiatives
we can undertake to move our goals and strategic areas of focus forward.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?
The office of IT we worked with as we were launching our IR (institutional repository).
What we wanted to do is be in charge of the IR but didn’t want to manage the storage.
It’s an institutional level need so IT will own it. The OIT has a shared service model for
basic computing, desktop support; the OIT provided equipment to the library; providing
staff for technology guidance next to the reference and circulation areas.
We work very closely with the campus development office; they are a great partner.
Fundraising is very centralized; we don’t go out on our own to do it.

169
The university HR (human resources) group is invaluable as we’ve reorganized,
regarding changing expectations and skill levels. We work closely with the University
Libraries Committee (made up of faculty representatives from each school and college,
plus student government representatives) regarding library policies, programs, and
services.

9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services?
We have student advisory groups. We’re developing graduate student fellowships in the
(digital scholarship program). The opportunity would be for them to work on their own
projects while learning more about the technology available. We start to expand the
capacity; it’s sort of the train the trainer model. This is how we involve students in the
process.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
Pretty dramatically. You should add our organizational development librarian to your list
to interview.
Once we developed our strategic plan in my first year as the director, we needed to be
organized in such a way to move forward these goals. We went from three associate
directors, 23 department heads to 2 assistant university librarians, 7 program directors,
more broad in scope.

170
Positive - The reason was to break down the siloes. Some small, some big. Our
guidelines were to aim for 4-8 direct reports, no 1:1 direct reporting. Two to three people
is not a department. It needs a hierarchy. This enables more natural communication
across the libraries. One negative is: we’ve created such broad portfolios, it’s hard to
recruit; acquisitions librarians are not catalogers, but we have these functions together in
one program or portfolio. Initial directors were chosen out of present department heads.

For questions 11 and 12, Charlotte suggests I speak with the Organizational Development
Librarian. See interview with Claire from Stuart University.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

171
Interview with “Claire” from “Stuart University”
April 18, 2016

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
In 2011-2013 we went through a major restructuring when (the university librarian)
arrived. In 2011 the university said we’d like all departments to come up with a new
strategic plan…in two months! They said we will offer a retirement incentive – half
retirement savings, half to university… “All right, we’ll do it,” she said. The libraries
were one of two departments that heeded that call; we were one of the first. As for
structure, as we moved from four…and from “director” of the library, (she) became the
university librarian. She set a new tone for the libraries and for the campus. Now, there
is more collaboration and cross-collaboration. It used to be siloed then it became two
divisions. Fewer restraints.. The message is, “we need you to work together” – that
message has continued to this day. There are two associate university librarians, and 54
supervisors and managers, and 200 staff members. After the re-organization, we can say,
okay, we’re one department and within that department there are seven program areas,
with one program director each. We have a library cabinet which makes up the
leadership. The biggest change is the structure. Titles – the managers, or “unit heads”,
the terminology preferred by librarians. In the digital, technology areas, there were no
title changes because that is a new area. Part of the re-organization was to enhance our
digital footprint. We didn’t have staff before to do that. Some staff retired and we were
able to do that, some positions did change.

Before the re-organization there were ten

172
people in technology positions, one program with twenty developers. Before the reorganization we were not sure what all of the librarians did. We made an effort to change
and move away from strict subject specialties; librarians would also be a curator,
cataloger, be involved with digital humanities – do something else in addition to their
subject specialty. This helps in adding accountability to subject specialists. They are
expected to teach (specific title of writing class) classes, usually 15 classes during the fall
and 15 during the spring semester. Some subject specialists are really embedded and
teach 50 classes throughout the academic year. Some provide instruction as requested,
and more librarians are teaching for-credit classes. As for groups, the units within the
programs are grouped traditionally by function. We were thoughtful and did
benchmarking. We looked at trends and issues like scholarly communication and we
look ahead to see what’s coming down the pike. If you look at our organizational chart
on the web you can see it.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
I help out some with staffing mostly faculty positions. I continue to see in the profession
we’re asking for Ph.D.s, if they have an M.L.S. even better. For tenure track faculty we
require a Ph.D. but don’t always require an M.L.S. Last year we hired two new subject
librarians; one with a Ph.D. and one with an M.L.S. For example, it’s so important in the
case of (one of the recently hired librarians) because she can hit the ground running. In
the other librarian’s case, he knows what he’s doing, the M.L.S. is the missing piece with
his librarian colleagues. Experience – I don’t think that has changed, generally 2-5 years

173
for librarians although there are a few librarians we hired with less than two years’
experience; we hit it out of the ballpark with (them). We also have a librarian-inresidence program, they do a 2-year rotation. This is our ninth year of doing this.
Twenty-two librarians took the buyout; 49% still have 20+ years’ service, there’s not a
lot of turnover. In the technology area, they’re often two years and out, some stay longer.
They didn’t make enough money, they can move on and become developers for Google,
who can pay more. A lot of librarians were unit head level and in positions of leadership;
some don’t want to do it anymore. We look for librarians who are willing to take on
leadership, this is now a question we ask candidates. We also ask if they have any
project management experience. We created a project management office last year. We
hired someone to lead that office. No one else had prior experience in project, end date,
steps, and so much of what we do is project management. When people have this
experience it translates.

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?
One of the goals of the re-organization was to specifically focus, we knew the new roles,
skills, expertise, experience people would want to try out. People who moved from
cataloger to whole new areas gained experience in the newly developed area. For
example how the LIS works together with other technology systems, served on
committees really started to build that area of expertise in the newly created unit, which is
really exciting. “Doesn’t matter if I’ve worked here twelve years, I can have a new
opportunity”. We bring in training in-house, anyone can sign up for a class. People can

174
work toward a project management certification, business analyst, technology
certification. We offer people time to get those certifications, we pay for them. They can
show their supervisors they will gain skills and expertise, we don’t make any promises
but it helps to say at least ‘take a look at me’ for new roles. We offer generous
professional development support, approximately $2,000 per year per librarian. We are
in our second cohort for our leadership development program; faculty and staff can apply,
again we make no promises but it helps prepare them for a supervisory or leadership role.
In the leadership development program they focus on communication, team building,
influencing, change management, strength finding, and continuous improvement. All
leadership comes to talk to the cohort about what it is like to be a leader. We encourage
people to not be boxed in, if you have the desire, you can look at new opportunities, we
can help you. The program is 8 months with 14 people in each cohort, 1 session per
month; they receive a mentor. Out of the first cohort, ten are now new supervisors or
leading a team; others are happy to be influencing. We bring in people like (specific
thought leader name), people who are already leaders, for people to see, what would that
be like?

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

Conferences, trendwatcher.com, we don’t necessarily look at library trends – we look at
any trend – just a cool thing. Anything that our users may be wanting, creating an app.
We look at the Future of Libraries, Pew Research reports, Ithaka reports. The UL looks
at the library in broad terms and doesn’t get down in the weeds, looking at the whole
organization and ensuring we are being transparent, meeting our goals, and assessing.

175
We love getting feedback and we do a lot of assessment. We make sure we’re not just
sitting back, saying well we did it, and getting into old habits. We do a re-org assessment
and a climate survey of the whole university. I’m writing a book about changes in
academic librarianship. In the early 1990s libraries had positions within organizational
development and human resources (HR). With budget cuts in the late ‘90s these
positions went away. Of the 126 ARL libraries, ten have a position with “organizational
development” in the title. There was an organizational development librarian for two
years leading up to the re-organization. We see that we need someone to pay attention to
OD (organizational development), so that it doesn’t fall into the cracks. Back then people
said there was no future for libraries, and in that time things started to turn around. I
want to look at why that happened, what changed.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

Interview with “Ethan” from “Stuart University”
March 8, 2016
Contains email response and phone interview notes.

Email response:
As promised, some cursory responses to help me think through your questions and to
seed our discussion.

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

Two of the acknowledged challenges facing academic libraries as we move into the 21st
century, particularly as they touch on my job as an emerging technologies librarian, are
centered around emphasizing the library’s value proposition as a provider of information
content and services, especially as libraries compete with the burgeoning array of public
and open source digital services such as social and other electronic media and common
search engines such as Google, etc. Innovation, then, with regard to libraries, should
address the changes to physical and virtual spaces in answer to (in part) these questions:

•

How can we transform libraries physically to effect a mental shift in the way
patrons see libraries and make libraries spaces for two types of related
relationships—librarians as helpful guides who exist in and of library spaces as
communities of practice. To set up both asymmetrical relations of authority,
where necessary, but in parallel, more horizontally constituted relations of

177
authority, as in communities of practice where librarians work with patrons and
leverage their expertise, etc.
•

How can we leverage [emerging] technologies and technologically-skilled library
personnel to best serve library content and services to a demographic of
increasingly digitally-native, increasingly mobile patrons?

•

How can we [re-]brand and [re-]market libraries in ways that [re-]affirm our
uniqueness and relevance as information and service providers for such patrons?
Moreover, how might we best assert our claim to be a central hub of intellectual
and research activity (especially at this university)? How can the Libraries
establish itself as a technology center on campus?

The innovation, then, in my opinion is getting all of the patrons at the library (typically
but not limited to faculty, staff, and students) to see the library as a central partner in any
research process, as a place they want to be b/c they get the freedom where necessary to
explore and experiment, and the guidance when they need it to take that further. To
accomplish this, I think you need a complex and dynamic articulation of what, since
coming to (this university) a year ago, I shorthand as new spaces, new faces, and new
inter-faces. This shorthand emerged as I looked at the ways the library is addressing
innovation, which is the question you ask in #2.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

Per question 1, (this library system) has really invested in new spaces, faces, and
interfaces. The library is currently undergoing a multi-year and multi-million dollar

178
structural renovation in which sweeping changes are being made, such as…well, see my
answers to the next question, I guess.

3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.

I have been at (this university) for little over a year, but these are a few of the initiatives I
know about. I want to stress that innovation is often understood as founded on the
introduction of new technologies which “change everything” (technological
determinism). But I understand the relation of culture and technology as deeply
imbricated and the library seems to understand it this way too. In that sense, I see them
taking a multifaceted approach to changing the way the library is seen by changing the
culture on campus.

•

The revision of the library itself will get students to see the library as a nice space
to be in. We’ve totally redone the graduate student offices in the library and
they’re gorgeous spaces to work in, now.

•

The redesign and expansion of our (digital scholarship program) (thanks to a
multimillion dollar donation) will hopefully centralize the center/library in
students’ minds as and space for emerging tech (3D and line printing, Arduino,
robots soon?, design workstations, the assistance of experts in GIS and other, and
hopefully a more “community of practice” feel.

•

Hiring at least 4 positions (all PhDs), that I know of, in non-standard disciplines
(non library-degree holders) in the area of digital services and specific content

179
areas, including an economics subject librarian, a GIS librarian, a digital
humanities librarian, and an emerging technologies librarian (my position).
Several of these positions did not exist before. We’ve also hired a user experience
staff member to help with the next bullet.
•

The foregrounding (soon to be a strategic initiative) to redesign the webpage (I sit
on the [web presence innovation and sustainability] team).

•

A student library hackathon to leverage the students’ creativity in building the
interfaces and services they want and need

•

Our (specific title) library research and information literacy tutorial, which we are
redesigning.

As I say, I’m sure there are others.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

Not sure about this one. We have 200 employees, 50 subject librarians, and 8 branch
libraries. Professional development is handled per person in each division. Cross
department/division and cross campus collaborations happen frequently with others doing
similar work, making for a nice cross-pollination and resulting in diverse teams of
increasingly t-shaped people. Obviously I’ll bring what I learned at Computers and
Libraries this week back and share it with my colleagues, for example. We regularly hold
offerings such as a digital humanities lunch and learn series, an instruction group—there
are many various groups which meet approximately monthly, with the goal of developing
interest and skills in certain broad areas (e.g., digital humanities, etc.).

180

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments?

We have various Google Groups/listservs under which we gather interested individuals
together. We also use HipChat to communicate with likeminded colleagues. As I said,
interest groups meet regularly. This is probably the biggest area where faculty are
encouraged to be bold in creating these relationships and making themselves as t-shaped
as they can.

6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).

Not sure about this either. Above my station. However, I do know that we have a cabinet
made up of the director and the heads of the various departments and the cabinet decides
yearly on the strategic initiatives. Those receive funding and are allocated resources.
Beyond that, each division’s director has discretion to take up various projects. Our
recent hackathon is an example of something that was approved and funded fairly
quickly—never rising to the level (small enough that it wouldn’t, of course) of a strategic
initiative. But we had a really diverse team of leaders who brought all their diverse
skillsets to the table and got the thing done quickly.

181
7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?

I’m only aware of the groups I sit on, for the most part. Since I began a year ago,
however, because I’m fairly t-shaped, I’ve been attached to most of these groups to help
out. But there are others, such as the open science group, and others working on things
that I’m not even aware of. The digitization and exhibits groups have worked with our
new Library IT people to build a new digital exhibits platform. As for me, I serve on the
web stewardship team, served on the hiring committees for the UX person and now for
our new blended/instructional design librarian, the digital signage group, the hackathon
planning team, etc.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?

We regularly work with entities across campus such as:

•

(Specific office that addresses undergraduate student engagement) (they partner
frequently with our (digital scholarship program) to drive digital information
initiatives on campus)

•

Graduate School (I was asked to give a speech on Big Data Ethics)

•

Faculty for (specific writing department title) (I am a liaison to the department
and I work on special projects.

182
•

I work with the (teaching and learning center) frequently on things like our new
(specific program title for library research and information literacy) and a new
(specific title) teaching and learning multimedia portal.

There are other partnerships, such as my colleague’s work on dissertation camp (a
weeklong camp — this week, actually). And (oh!) I did the poster for and helped out
technically with the Black Faculty and (specific event related to Black Lives Matter
awareness and education) this past week and I’ll be working with students in a Native
American Studies class to host a (specific event related to Native American Studies
awareness and education). I’m pretty t-shaped, so I basically help out where I can with
anything from leading projects and writing project plans, graphic design,
instruction/web/multimedia design, etc.

9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services?

The library employs students, but I’m not sure exactly how in other departments, other
than to say I see some student workers acting to reshelve books; some serve to do a little
hacking work in Library IT services; our grad students at the reference desk are amazing
and well-trained. I sometimes leverage the graduate students who serve on the reference
desk to do some design work for me—but it’s really only grunt work. For example, I had
a student help me brute force the conversion of 31 a la carte guides to our new LibGuides
platform. He ported much of the content based on my design and I cleaned it up

183
afterward. The teamwork thing is really big here at (this university). Everybody brings
their skills to the potluck and things get done.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?

I do know that the library has had two reorgs in the last 5 years, since the library director
came on board. They have the employees self-assess and then move people to where they
request to be and/OR where they might better serve. They also have created a yearly
leadership cohort which does Six Sigma training. I’m in this now and it’s actually been
really awesome. Our big project will be to redesign the process for scanning articles for
ILL and doc del using the six sigma methodology. So there’s lots of change. This doesn’t
make everyone happy, but I will say the second reorg was a lot more voluntary (I believe)
and they’re using it now in a really positive way—to find and focus on people’s
strengths, rather than weaknesses. Seems positive to me.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?

I’m not sure. I can point out, as I did above, that many of the last hires have been people
without traditional library degrees and instead with PhDs in certain areas. My hunch is
that (forward-thinking?) libraries are trying to effect tighter relationships/partnerships
with faculty and staff across campus. In key positions such as those held by my

184
colleagues and me, I will say that it helps to have a degree at the same level as the faculty
we’re working with to combat that prejudice (even as it, sadly, reifies it to some degree).
But it’s a start? That’s my guess, at least. In my case, I think it’s more that I had all the
skills they were looking for and b/c it was a new position, they threw everything in the
mix and I’m representative of the new t-shaped information worker of today so I fit the
bill.

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?

Not sure exactly. I know that new employees are given funds for professional
development. This year I was given enough to attend three fairly distant conferences. We
all have access to Lynda . com, of course, through a partnership with the (specific public
library). And my memberships to ALA, etc. are paid. I also took a few online courses.
We travel together to regional and smaller conferences, colleagues and I, as well. All
employees, within the scope of their job, are encouraged to seek professional dev. We are
all required to write up a yearly progress report of the things we’d worked on. For my
annual review, I built a little webpage with links to the digital projects I’d worked on.
You can find it here: (specific website address). My designation is Special Professional
Faculty, which means I’m not tenure-track faculty, but I do have a 3 year review in which
I am reappointed. Most of the same criteria for advancement apply to my position—
meaning I can get credit for publishing, for service to the community and profession, etc.

185
Phone interview notes:
In the (digital scholarship program) we have 3D printing, GIS, digital humanities, big
data, digitization of materials. A librarian stated, I’m retiring, but you should replace my
line with an emerging technologies librarian who does academic outreach, including
teaching, research, user engagement, workshops – all under the guise of outreach, helping
people to articulate and connect with the library. It is particularly innovative to do, for a
library to hire Ph.D.s and not library degrees. We are recognizing that we can drill down
in specific fields across campus. This connects to the innovation question. We can be
the central intellectual hub and get rid of one-shots and replace with an embedded
approach. We are hiring non-MLIS/MLS but we are encouraged to get education to
make that bridge. We will be holding our first hackathon – emerging technologies and
marketing. We look at, can you get the job done? And perform cross-pollination. We
have the opportunity to fail – if I have an idea, I can write up a project plan, and let’s talk.
During the re-organization there were some shake-ups. We are working on renovations;
we post renovation alerts on our website. There will be some new office space – not just
cubicles, we fought for offices. The director and the cabinet looked at other universities,
like North Carolina State University, and looked at some of the new things they were
incorporating, like game rooms, media, ways of showing data, working with data,
wanting to be collaborative and innovative. We renovated the graduate students study
area; it is now glassed-in and has much more light and is more airy. We improved the
space to be more current and modern; we cut the first and second floors to allow in more
natural light – this changes everything. We received a big grant for the (digital
scholarship program), to use the library to do more technology stuff. It began as a pilot

186
and is now perpetually funded. It should be a community of practice in which people are
helping each other in a more open environment; it won’t be quiet and it will offer the
latest applications. We will soon hold our inaugural hackathon for which we wrote up a
project plan which I will send to you. We want people to see the library as technology
and culture are deeply imbricated; it’s more than just helping people to find information,
it’s a central, intellectual hub – the home of the apparatus for all you need to do. In
innovation, you see angel investors bring all these amazing people together to find great
solutions; there are a lot of things that are problematic, social crisis, privacy – there are a
lot of lines of force at work; libraries can work to change the nature of that connection…I
see libraries as the perfect place with technology and information resources to help
people best collaborate and bring together people to have those conversations. The
hackathon is aimed not necessarily at coders but all people – people with ideas – graduate
and undergraduate coders, designers, to re-think out of the box, to re-imagine the library
web page as a customizable dashboard rather than just as a home page. It should be
about the library web presence. Information architecture writing for the web. Design and
design patterns you can apply to visually take 4-5 pages into 1 totally accessible content.
We just hired a UX person (user experience), a nod to the importance of our web
presence. We developed a style guide for our LibGuides, to think about it as tasks; it can
be organized better and use the affordances (tabs, etc.) – bringing together subject matter
experts, designers in a kind of cross-pollination – this is something that our university
does really well. Libraries need to be encouraged to develop interdisciplinary efforts; for
example, data scientists to work with librarians – this cross-pollination leads to
innovation. It needs to connect itself up to hard core data scientists and smart librarians

187
about library scholarship, talking about UX in ways that didn’t make it really accessible
to their audience. We need to consider, how do we get the information into libraries?
We have brilliant librarians but we don’t have a content manager to take advantage of the
subject matter expert. “We need to hire UX people, content manager…people who are
skilled because it’s its own discipline.” Innovation is to hire all these people, go to
conferences, hire the professionals – this gets back to funding these librarians – people
can’t be all things – they’re all doing 2 or 3 jobs. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel.
Students are awesome, they know their stuff.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

Interview with “Gregory” from “Stuart University”
Wednesday, March 9, 2016

1. How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?
Notes: New ways of approaching a service people, process, or technology; or provide
new service. Does not have to be just in a heavy R&D area like digital humanities,
scholarship or digital libraries.

Interview: I was thinking about the way we approach not just technology but also a
process, service related to technology. Emerging or new need that wasn’t there. Not
necessarily R&D heavy like digital libraries. Could be how we approach writing support
at the writing center. Innovate along these lines.

2. How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?
Notes: Electronic resources available through E-Reserve, digitize videos for courses, we
launched our (digital scholarship program) in 2013 with various offerings on GIS, text
mining, data management. Our digital repository allows sharing and publication. Our
group also developed systems like (writing for first year students program) that is a
digital publishing site for best compositions from first year students. We work closely
with campus partners.

Interview: Sure, this is a wide variety of things. One, the electronic resources available
through our catalog, some licensed titles available through ebooks on demand that we

189
don’t necessarily pay for until a title is viewed 2-3 times. The E-Reserve model, videos
required for courses; will digitize those so that they can be streamed. We follow fair use
carefully with regard to how the digitization happens, more rigorously than others on
campus. We are good friends with our General Counsel. We launched the (digital
scholarship program) in August 2013. It was originally conceived not as one service in
particular but what … are all services… We would add and remove services as needs
change over time. For example GIS, in-house consultants for text mining support, data
management. Working with faculty to benefit students, for example in the freshman
writing program. Best composition from 1st year student; not only text based but also
multimedia. A group in the library worked with the faculty. “Composition” was not just
text. Published at end of year.

3. Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past
five years.
Notes:
(Institutional repository)
(Digital collections and projects)
(Open science initiative)

Interview: Our institutional repository; we didn’t have the IR front end until early 2015,
although we had a digital repository since 2010. It took 1-1/2 years to move toward the
IR front end. We approached it by thinking about who are our main contributors in the
library? and campus partners. Team-oriented structure in how we approach initiatives.

190
Diverse members, campus partners. Library metadata specialists, catalogers, developers,
subject specialists, digital production. Analogous to how … we manage the collection on
the shelves. Approach with the same focus. Collaborate on the (specific title) Project.
30 partners (specific institution). How the group operated changed over time. It went
from being a small to a large group. Much more divided up focus rather than centralized
focus. We work very closely with campus partners. (Specific title) digital library for
(specific infectious disease) related resources. How could data from running simulations
help to eradicate (specific infectious disease)? (if you perform various interventions)
Coordinate activities. Similar to Omeka digital exhibit tool integrated with IR. (The
(digital scholarship program) is a huge one. Lots of different events with campus
projects. Open science initiatives. Strategic/services. A lot of different tools to use for
researchers while they’re working. If our charge is preservation and access we need to be
engaged while it’s happening, not just retrospectively. Fairly. Researchers move on the
their next project. Process tightly knit. Gather metadata while researchers are working.
Press button “I want to archive this”. Open, closed.

4. How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?
Notes: Keep track of Horizon report, follow colleagues closely at other institution
through blogs, plugged in at multiple levels in conferences and larger collaborations. The
suggestion of new technologies is both top-down and bottom-up with regular assessment
at the associate university librarian and program director levels while we have also given
unit managers and individual contributors a great deal of freedom to propose and
implement solutions. We also look internally where we have now conducted three

191
different internal hackathons where developers plus librarians work together on an idea
for a day and then present on them the next day. The winner gets to hold onto our
hackathon statue mascot until the next one. Keep it fun. At least 5 ideas have made their
way into production since then.
Also investment in newer roles like Emerging Tech Librarian.

Interview: We check up on the Horizon Report, spec kits, diverse interests across the
libraries. Follow blogs, forums. There is generous support for attending conferences.
We submit requests to attend conferences. Suggest new ideas. This happens top-down
and bottom-up. I sit two levels below the University Librarian. We speak a lot with the
associate university librarian about trends, priorities, making sure we’re steering in the
right direction. Instead of what should the solutions be… Unit leaders, individuals.
Give freedom to see what is the best solution. Mix of vended tools, community sources
tools, those we create ourselves. Internal hackathons, we’ve had three so far. It has been
one year since we started. It came from an idea – training we had on campus. What
motivates people? Five ideas moved into production, a wide variety. Try to make it fun.
Try to… have a winner, group gets to hold on to (the mascot statue). People (staff) take
ownership. We will hold our first hackathon by students next week. Investment in newer
roles. Recently hired an emerging technologies librarian. Involved in direct
student/faculty interaction.

5. How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and
developments?

192

Notes: Town halls, open forums, segments for weekly newsletter, visiting unit meetings,
within library cabinet (leadership group consisting of program directors, AULs, ULs,
other direct reports to UL)

Interview: We do a variety of things, and it’s something we’re constantly trying to get
better at. With communication, it’s never at the right amount, and they never understand
as much as we want them to. We hold library town halls from University Librarian
down; two Assistant University Librarians speak at one level down. We don’t have
official departments, there are two divisions in library. Seven programs, which make up
the department. A department could be the entire library. This is a recent change dating
to 2012. We hold open forums where people come to listen to updates; our campus
partners attend as well. We also have a weekly newsletter that goes out with small little
articles about projects. We never know how much people are reading them. We try to
visit other units across programs in the Libraries. We’re finding conversations don’t
happen that need to happen in the forums. The Library cabinet group that consists of the
University Librarian, two Assistant University Librarians, the seven program directors,
and the direct reports to the University Librarian - that’s fourteen people. Discussions
commonly on leadership group, policy, things happening in various groups, final
decisions made by the University Librarian. We have the meeting minutes from these
meetings. Direct verbal communication. We try to hit all the bases.

193
6. Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new
technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).
Notes: Mix of looking to vended solutions and community solutions, and ultimately want
to find a solution that will meet needs opposed to settling for an insufficient solution.
From the time I arrived at (this library system) eight years ago there was the idea that in
some cases investment in community source and collaborations is equivalent to money
that could be invested in a software license, and as such we were able to gain support to
spend funds that would have been directed towards licenses into community
collaboration and partnership meetings. That model has since shifted to funding through
a common development/travel pool where partnership related meetings are funded first.
With emerging areas, in many cases there is no vended solution and we can do far more
working with our peers. Research in general is also a very difficult thing to serve with a
one-size fits all solution, as by its very nature it can be new and experimental.
Investment in people.

Interview: Some of it is keeping track of a new need or an improvement that is needed.
If it’s just technology, we look at a vended solution, community solution, or if it’s
something we can do ourselves. We look at what solutions are available. We look at
whether our internal technology group can do customization for a vended tool or if it
could just be integrated with another tool. For funding support, I arrived eight years ago
and there is a mindset that regardless of whether something is a vended tool or
community sourced, it’s necessary to invest similar amount of money. It’s often the same

194
price for something community sourced as vended. There is also the cost of travel to
attend partner meetings. We have been able to make some traction. Either vended tools
haven’t evolved enough to meet the need, we can often do far more. We’re in the same
business. There are opportunities to work together. The critical main advantage is that
we’re close for meetings, as opposed to a vended tool. Research support by nature is
experimental. Vended tools tend to be one size fits all, depending on the research tool.
It’s possible to flourish in the academic environment…investment in people.

7. What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation
of new technologies and services in the library?
Notes: Since 2012 we have had the idea of forming teams around initiatives or projects
that involve people that cross programs and units (ones that do not are more the exception
nowadays). They are given a charge with bounded outcomes. This was in some ways a
reaction to a committee culture that existed previously where committees would live on
beyond the original need. Also, with services like (the IR) that are not just an initiative,
but really a new library service we are forming new cross unit teams that support aspects
like support. Another example is one we have formed recently around data mgmt
consulting. Normally, this could be done through formal organizational restructuring.
However, because these involve people across so many different specialties, this would
be impossible to do so.

Interview: We went through a restructuring in 2012. We moved away from the idea of
committees toward a more team-oriented culture. “Working group” is the best way to

195
describe it. Some committees outlived their purposes, they met specific outcomes and
deliverables. We are fortunate to have the marketing director in library technology - it
essentially enables and leverages for how we communicate about projects at the strategic
level as well as contribute to the success of the project as well as how it can be conveyed.
With services, typically we might form a unity for services. We might form virtual teams
to support a service that crosses multiple programs, a diverse group that has the diverse
abilities to meet that need.

8. What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,
faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?
Notes: Campus IT; We work very closely with our (research computing center) on
research data related projects, esp. ones that involve a digital library and preservation
need. We also have collaborated with the academic technologies unit in campus IT as
well as (specific teaching and learning center) that is focused. We are very outward
focused where there is strong belief we can do far more working with and learning from
our peers than we can do by ourselves (we are all in the same business). (Lists specific
projects).

Interview: We’re pretty active locally and externally in terms of collaboration. Campus
IT handles all our support - our servers, storage environment, network. We have our own
IT development, systems administration. We work with the (specific research computing
center) for high performance computing support, simulation; we’ve started to be pulled

196
into projects such as the (open science initiative). We collaborate with different
organizations such as academic technologies where we invest in and experiment with
new technology for the classroom; the “one-button studio”, a video recording room
where people just have to push one button, there is a USB drive, they record, and they’re
done. This is coordinated through (digital scholarship program); (digital scholarship
program) is the locus for a lot of these things. Just by having the center created we have
more opportunities. Many were already here, but the (digital scholarship program)
created traction. We have a partnership with (specific scholarly archiving initiative)
working on adding an extra layer of preservation. We’re working on the open science
framework. I’m pulled in a few directions at once, helping coordinate the activities and
thinking. The community is a big part of our strategy and long-term sustainability model.

9. How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and
services?
Notes: could do more. we have 1st ever student hackathon in 9 days, engaging through
students working in (specific areas listed).

Interview: We probably could be doing more. We thought of having interns. The
(digital scholarship program) is staffed almost exclusively in the evenings by students.
They work on projects. The students are very driven. There are visual resources. There
are 2 or 3 student employees. They create derivatives of images for art history and
classroom use. Students are helping with digital production. We will hold our first hack
a thon soon. We are trying to get more engagement, and offer opportunities for students

197
to work on technology ideas related to libraries. I am very curious to see what will come
out of that. We are hoping to have more opportunities to have student interactions.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
Notes: Restructuring in 2012 around programs and units -> library cabinet -> shift of
people according to interests as there was a match for need.

Interview: In 2012 we had a complete restructuring. We started with three different
divisions with departments. There was no direct correlation in terms of size; a
department could be two to twenty people. People were pulled from across departments
not just ….Day to day, direct interactions with patrons. The idea was formed to have six
main programs. My program didn’t exist before the restructuring. Digital initiatives.
We are continually restructuring. We’re not done. Digital production broke off yet we
have a close relationship, we’re still operating as if we’re in the same program. They still
come to program meetings to make sure communication is going well. Special
collections is in process. Job responsibilities how we approach…We did a survey and
assessment to match needs and made quite a few changes. It’s almost easier to do a lot of
changes at once rather than one here, one there. We had the luxury of a fairly
competitive salary pool. There were some voluntary retirements that allowed us to create
new positions, like the emerging technologies librarian. We are trying to hire a copyright
librarian. There is a heavy emphasis on the virtual teams aspect. We moved from three
divisions to two divisions. We made sure there are no reporting lines that are 1:1

198
reporting except marketing. The guideline is for at least four people to report to a
supervisor.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
Notes: Less important for someone to specifically have a library degree, and specialized
experience is equivalent and in some cases more important. Especially with those
specialized skills extending beyond library science.

Interview: One change is that there is less emphasis on having a library degree, and more
emphasis on having a specialization and experience. A Ph.D. in a specific subject area is
very much equivalent. For example I don’t have a library degree. I’m seeking a library
degree not necessarily just because there are opportunities for more leadership but more
opportunities in terms of working with some of the library based technologies and
extending my skills, for working better collaboratively and to facilitate interdisciplinary
conversation, so as to make more individual contributions in scholarship, not just my
regular job, so to speak. There’s an interesting mix going on right now - a mix of
technology…with more and more non-librarians; we have 5-6 software developers,
project managers, testing. Movement to consolidate services we’re trying to maintain.
There’s always a chance you might break something by adding something so we are
doing testing…. Testing, the user experience, emerging technology, (digital scholarship
program). We pair different concentrations with more than traditional roles. The English

199
literature librarian has a digital humanities focus. The informatics librarian, data science,
e-research librarian, data concerns. Humanities degree but doing a lot of biology work.

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?
Notes: Professional development requests are sought every year for conferences etc, also
org dev librarian supports some webinars, other local training. There is strong
encouragement to attend training on campus that largely is geared towards developing
skills for communication, leadership, collaboration.

Interview: We have support to go to conferences and professional development; our
requests to attend PD and conferences are sought at least once a year. Rolled into that in
terms of money we spend on partnerships, money for partnerships and travel
opportunities. Maybe not the whole team, at once. We receive $1,500 per year for travel
for librarians. Same for high level staff. We have strong encouragement to attend
training on campus, skills like communication, formal programs that last a whole
semester or just a day, webinars; if there is a specialized need for training on an archival
practice for example. Amazon web services. Wide variety of services.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.

Interview with “Miranda” from “Stuart University”
March 11, 2016

1.

How do you define or consider “innovation” as it pertains to academic libraries?

To me this is to recognize library patrons have very different research and technology
needs than they did five to ten years ago. Keeping abreast of what those needs are, and
considering the physical aspects of the library. When our students work abroad, what
skills will they need? Part of (this university’s) education model involves study abroad –
over 50% of students study abroad before graduation.

2.

How does your library support the needs of 21st Century students?

I work with different units; the (digital scholarship program) was funded four years ago
by the president’s office; clearly articulated with equivalent technology skills from our
(peer institutions). We found technology skills were a problem for students, they were
underprepared for job hunting upon graduation. This was a non-academic democratized
need. It was decided that the library would be a good organization to help fulfill this
need. The (digital scholarship program) has a digital production unit which helps us
digitize and disseminate the collection that is unique to (this university). We do have a
lot of local needs. We bundle that work with paleography of the university, and use
digital surrogates to look at manuscripts which causes less damage to the original objects
and documents. Our digital exhibitions and collections help us to manipulate library
digital content and drastically increased the number and visibility of people that support
these services. We put eight stations on the first floor that support digital scholarship;

201
this was intentional in its prominent placement. We are looking to change the perception
of the library and demonstrate the library is evolving to meet the needs. In the past, the
book collection was all patrons could search.

3.

Please describe the major initiatives related to innovation in your library in the past

five years.
The thing that kicked it off was (the new university librarian), which was the impetus we
had been waiting for. She was so far ahead to start these initiatives and push forward.

4.

How does the library discover new ideas, trends, and developments?

The university librarian probably touched upon this but we have 55+ librarians at (this
university), who are non-tenure track faculty with publishing expectations and expected
to be involved with travel. We receive $1,500-2,000 per fiscal year for conference travel,
which is a benefit that people think is important to professional development; you then
share with your colleagues what you have learned.

5.

How does the library staff communicate internally about new ideas, trends, and

developments?
Once a month we have a brown bag lunch and we come prepared to talk about what
sessions we attended and what we learned. For example we have a visualization space –
what manifests in the library is what people come into contact with and introduced to
concepts. We are expected to be at monthly faculty meetings; this is a central point for

202
dissemination. We discuss new jobs, retirees, modernizing positions, bigger initiatives.
Once a year the provost comes and talks about his vision for the library.

6.

Please describe the decision-making process regarding the implementation of new

technologies and services (i.e., selection of a new technology or initiative; funding and
resource allocation; responsibility; procedure).
So, first of all we collected a list of feedback, especially in technology-rich spaces we
made the decision early on we wouldn’t have it operate without someone who works for
us. There is a student there to collect statistics once per hour; they take a read of the
room – how many patrons are using Macs or PCs, are they working collaboratively or are
they single studiers? Because we knew we’d open a temporary space and there are a
number of campus providers that offer technology space. We want to test the waters
before we implement office of information technology – academic technology initiatives
milieu – there is a lot of crossover. For example in digital learning, MOOCs and online
content. There are a number of these units and we are careful not to overlap. For
budgeting, sometimes we’re asked for these and we can’t accommodate and they’re put
on the back burner. Data visualization packages can cost about $10,000 per year and
require specialized hardware. We also have to consider who the staffing support would
be. We try not to launch new services without someone behind it with the right
technology training.

7.

What committees or groups are in place to assist in the planning and implementation

of new technologies and services in the library?

203
The university librarian has an overall university committee on libraries with
representatives from all over the libraries. Within the libraries we’re much better when
we’re planning to start projects, maybe 12-18 months in advance, so that the right kind of
dependencies can be lined up, for example software licensing and hardware acquisition;
the time that we need; who is in charge of implementation; who’s paying for it. The
implementation could be a five-person working team that works for 3-4 months. The
library is under construction; the second floor will be all technology-rich spaces. We
look at what is feasible, and what can the library support.

8.

What partnerships or relationships does the library have with other entities (i.e.,

faculty; other departments or groups at the university; external organizations; private
entities) related to innovation?
We have some brown bag lunches with people from various units; for example, the office
of information technology, the (teaching and learning center) that supports teaching, and
better teaching, the office of digital learning. This helps us to keep informed; the lunches
provide a place for people to discuss things that are going on.

9.

How are students involved in the process to implement new technologies and

services?
Primarily in two ways – we get feedback from the workshops that we offer in the (digital
scholarship program); participants get a feedback form. When we first opened we had a
3D printer; some graduate students stepped up and said they’d teach it. We have formal
student focus groups what meet once a semester to talk to the university librarian about

204
what works and what doesn’t work. We have undergraduate and graduate student focus
groups. With the renovation the groups help us understand what students need to see.

10. How has the library organizational structure changed in the past five years (i.e., job
responsibilities, titles, groups, reporting structure)?
All of the above. The university librarian will be entering their sixth year and was just
reappointed for another five years. We went through our biggest re-organization in
which a lot of people moved, some departments disbanded, and job responsibilities
changed. We’re not unionized so it’s a little easier to modernize job responsibilities.
There were 27 managers; we concatenated employees under less managers. Now there is
a minimum of four individuals reporting to one manager. Management received more
training which has been extremely helpful. We just did another re-organization; once it’s
done you keep going. Not as many technology staff moved; more subject librarians
moved.

11. How has the hiring process changed during the past five years related to education,
experience, and skill requirements?
I don’t know if the hiring process has changed; I have been here for ten years. The most
recently hired subject librarians don’t have an M.L.S., they have a Ph.D., and external
experience to graduate school that applies to librarianship. This helps to increase the
(university’s) research profile. In the job market there are deeply qualified people; there
are not traditional skills, like tracking large amounts of data, managing data, presenting
content.

205

12. In what ways are existing employees encouraged to pursue further training,
education, and skill enhancement?
The organizational development librarian also has funding for group training, funding for
webinars; large scale funding, for example for a Society of American Architects two-day
class for librarians who have an interest in archives. We push people out to conferences.

Note. To preserve confidentiality, university and library names, names of people, names
of jobs/positions, exact dates, and other identifying information have been changed.
