The Framework for Information Literacy:
Academic Librarians' Perceptions of Its Potential Impact on

ABSTRACT
The Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education ("the Framework")
may serve to influence academic library praxes. A total of 138 academic librarian
participants were randomly selected (32 deans and 106 non-deans) from public and
private institutions. The institutions spanned across six accrediting regions recognized by
the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Participants completed a 22-item survey
designed to elicit their perceptions of the Framework's impact. Professional position
(deans or non-deans) was significantly correlated with the perceived level of impact that
the Framework might have on library praxes. That is, deans tended to rate the Framework
at a higher level of impact than non-deans. The final question on the survey was openended, asking participants to explain their rating of overall impact the Framework may
have on library practices at their institutions. Qualitative coding of responses to the final
question revealed three themes indicating advantages of the Framework, and twelve
themes indicating challenges of the Framework. Findings from this study may be useful
to academic librarians, discipline faculty, and other institutional stakeholders in
determining how information literacy instruction is defined, promoted, and taught in

higher education. Findings may also serve to initiate and illuminate conversations around
the Framework, and how to approach possible implementation.

Chapter One
Introduction
To ask why we need libraries at all, when there is so much information available
elsewhere, is about as sensible as asking if roadmaps are necessary now that there are so
very many roads.
—Jon Bing
That which today calls itself science gives us more and more information, an indigestible
glut of information, and less and less understanding.
—Edward Abbey

In a daily flood of information from social media, television, radio, the Internet,
and more traditional information sources, information literacy (IL) is a survival skill that
keeps us from "drowning in the abundance of information that floods [our] lives"
(Breivik & Gee, 1989, p. 12). Anyone with access to the Internet, a minimal amount of
literacy skills, and the ability to tap out words on a Google search can find information
within seconds. However, the emphasis in our information society has changed from
simply finding information to more critical evaluation and selection. From the vast array
of information available at our fingertips, evaluation and selection involves
understanding how, when, and what to select and then how to use it appropriately
(Marshall, 2006). The Final Report of the American Library Association’s (ALA)
Presidential Committee on Information Literacy (1989) defined an information literate
person in this way:
Ultimately, information literate people are those who have learned how to learn.
They know how to learn because they understand how information is organized,
how to find information, and how to use information in such a way that others can
learn from them. They are people prepared for lifelong learning, because they can

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

2

always find the information needed for any task or decision at hand. (p.1)
People who are information literate also have developed information technology skills—
the ability to use the Internet, computer software, databases and other technologies to
achieve personal, professional, and educational goals (ALA, 2000).
Researcher Background
I earned a Master of Arts in Educational Media in 2004 that allowed me to spend
the latter part of my career in K-12 public schools as a library media specialist, where I
became familiar with IL standards and library instructional practices specific to the K-12
student population. In 2008, I completed a Master of Science in Library and Information
Science (MLIS), where I was introduced to IL standards specific to the higher education
student population. The primary result of my studies in library science was an increased
awareness of IL standards and their implications in higher education. In 2009, I was
accepted into the doctoral program of Organizational Learning and Instructional
Technology (OLIT). Prior to my completing all Program of Studies coursework in 2013,
OLIT transitioned from the University of New Mexico's (UNM) College of Education to
the College of University Libraries. The transition resulted in a name change from OLIT
to Organization, Information, and Learning Sciences (OI&LS) as well as change in
physical location. OI&LS is located on the second floor of Zimmerman Library. The new
location as well as the new name (i.e., the inclusion of the word "information")
reestablished my interest in IL as an intrinsic and essential goal of higher education—not
just an interest, but a passion to study IL in higher education.
Background of the Study
The research process began by searching for current documentation from the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

3

Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL). This was a logical place to start
because the ACRL Information Literacy Standards Committee (ILSC; one of many
committees that sit under the umbrella of the ACRL and, in turn, the American Library
Association) oversees all activities involving the creation, reviews, and revisions of the
current IL standards for higher education. Searching the ACRL website revealed that a
change initiative was taking place.
As of 2010, the ACRL ILSC put a task force in place to review the IL
Competency Standards for Higher Education (hereafter referred to as "the Standards")
that had been originally adopted in 2000. The appointed ACRL IL Competency
Standards Review Task Force, after an extensive review of the Standards, recommended
to the ACRL Board of Directors in a June 2, 2012 document to the ILSC that the
Standards "should not be reapproved as they exist but should be extensively revised"
(Association of College and Research Libraries, June, 2012, p. 1). The ACRL Board
approved the recommendation that the Standards should undergo significant revision. For
this revision process, the Board agreed that a Task Force be created for the purpose of
drafting the Framework for IL for Higher Education, hereafter referred to as "the
Framework" (with the exception of the specific language used in the research questions).
The Task Force began its work in March of 2013. They released two parts of the
first draft. Part one was released in February of 2014 and part two was released in April
of 2014. A completed second draft was released in June of 2014 and a third draft was
released in November of 2014. The final draft was first approved by the ILSC in midJanuary of 2015 and then unanimously approved by the ACRL ILSC and subsequently
submitted to the Board of Directors for final review at the ALA mid-winter conference

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

(January 30-February 3, 2015). On February 2, 2015, the Board of Directors took positive
action and "accepted the Framework and it will assume its place among the constellation
of documents used by information literacy practitioners" (Williams, 2015).
Although the Board filed the Framework, during the Board of Directors' meetings
I and II, that took place on Saturday, January 31st, and Monday, February 2, 2015
(Payne, 2015, January 31; Payne, 2015, February 2) certain points of contention were
recognized and voiced by the board members. The following were the most relevant
controversial issues discussed at these meetings:
 Opportunities for feedback from key stakeholders, over the course of multiple
drafts of the Framework, produced differing opinions that were challenging to
incorporate into the Framework.
 There were conflicting opinions regarding the Standards coexisting with the
Framework; i.e., some board members were in favor of sunsetting the
Standards, while others were not—additional time would be needed to adopt
the Framework.
 There was concern about the small amount of feedback responses from ACRL
members relative to overall ACRL membership.
These issues revealed a need for more feedback regarding the Framework from academic
librarians. Because a level of controversy existed around the Framework, there was also a
need to study it further.
Statement of the Problem
Within the Action Form (Association of College and Research Libraries, January,
2015) that the chair of the ILSC submitted to the Board of Directors on January 16, 2015,

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

5

the following assertion was made:
ACRL recognized early on that the effect of any changes to the ILCSHE [the
Standards] would be significant, both within the library profession and in higher
education more broadly. (p. 4)
This assertion led to one major unanswered question. What specifically are the potential
significant effects that the change will make on the library profession and in higher
education? This led to the first problem statement:
 The significant effects (i.e., impact) of changes to the IL Competency Standards
for Higher Education on the library profession and in higher education have
yet to be determined.
Although descriptive statistics from multiple surveys and open forums and blogs about
the Framework reflected its controversial nature, there remained a need to more
rigorously study the perceptions of academic librarians regarding the Framework. This
led to the second problem statement:
 The perceptions of academic librarians regarding the level of impact that the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education will have on
academic library praxes have yet to be studied.
Purpose of the Study
This study was not intended to evaluate the Framework itself or the
implementation of the Framework. Due to the Framework's reconception of the way IL is
addressed in higher education (e.g., IL instructional methods), the implementation is
going to be a lengthy process for many institutions (Association of College and Research
Libraries, January, 2015). Also, since the Framework had just been approved by the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK
ACRL Board of Directors, at the time of this research it was not possible to study its
implementation because it had yet to be implemented (at least not in any large scale
effort).
This study was designed to investigate the perceived level of impact (or the
significant effects) that the Framework could have on academic library and higher
education praxes (see Definitions of Terms). More specifically, the purpose of this study
was to determine, through a multiple regression analysis, the best predictor variables for
the perceptions of the Framework's level of impact, i.e., the perceptions of library deans,
assessment librarians, and instructional librarians.
Significance of the Study
As stated by Susanna Boylston, Chair of the ACRL Standards Committee, in the
January 16, 2015 Board of Director's Action Form:
The Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, adopted
by ACRL in 2000, have become an essential document related to the emergence
of information literacy as a recognized learning outcome at many institutions of
higher education. (p. 1)
In the same Board of Director's Action Form, Boylston asserted that any changes to the
Standards would have a significant effect "both within the library profession and in
higher education more broadly" (2015; see Statement of Problem). This contention was
well-reasoned, considering that the Standards adopted in 2000 had significant impact on
how IL was defined, how IL competencies were defined and measured, and on how
library instruction produced measureable student learning outcomes at higher education
institutions across the United States.

Just as the Standards have influenced or otherwise generated educational reform,
the Framework will also be important in educational reform. Just how much it may
impact, change or influence the field of IL depends in part on understanding the
perceptions of those most affected by the change. Jansen (2000) underscored a more
general idea of the importance of understanding individuals' perceptions of change.
"Readiness for change considers an organization's capacity for making change and the
extent to which individuals perceive the change as needed" (p. 53).
As stated in the Purpose of the Study, a multiple regression was conducted in
order to determine the best predictor variables for the perceptions of the Framework's
level of impact. The primary purpose for a regression analysis is to develop an equation
in order to predict the values on a dependent variable in a specific population (Mertler &
Vannatta, 2010). The use of a multiple regression was especially important to the
significance of this study for the following reason: if significant predictors can be
determined, then people who make decisions can minimize risks and maximize the odds
of advantageous results (Siegel, 2000).
Determining the best predictors of perceived impact of the Framework on higher
education library praxes through a regression analysis may help to inform decisions about
how to use the new Framework. If institutions want to implement the Framework, then
those engaged in the change process will need findings to inform their decisions—they
will need a deeper understanding of the perceptions of academic librarians regarding the
Framework's impact on their praxes and the predictors of this perceived impact. They can
then use the predictors to help make informed decisions.
In simpler terms, discovering the perceptions that individuals have about the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

Framework was important as a first step. However, simply studying the perceptions gave
only part of the picture. Discovering relationships between variables and the best
predictors of impact gave a more defined picture, providing more specific information.
Determining or discovering reasons (i.e., predictor variables) that might contribute to
those individual's perceptions was a much larger step towards informing potential
directions that institutional leadership may take. This was a leap in understanding, instead
of a single step.
This study was intended to offer a contribution to the available literature about (a)
how the new Framework may serve to influence the ways academic libraries function in
delivering information literacy instruction and (b) the best predictor variables for
perceived level of impact. It may be of interest to stakeholders who are looking at ways
that IL is defined, promoted, and taught in higher education academic libraries. The
results of this study may also serve to initiate and illuminate conversations around the
Framework and how to approach possible implementation.
Research Questions
Three main research questions were addressed in this study:
1. What level of impact on academic library praxes do library deans, assessment
librarians, and instructional librarians perceive that the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education will have?
2. What are the best predictor variables for the perceived level of impact on
academic library praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education will have?
3. How do academic library deans, assessment librarians, and instructional

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

9

librarians explain their perceptions of the level of impact on academic library
praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education will
have?
Summary of Research Methods
After selecting participants using a stratified, random sampling method, 186
academic librarians were surveyed to determine the level of impact they perceived that
the Framework will have on library praxes (i.e., the dependent variable or DV). In order
to answer this study's research questions, the survey was designed using specific
assertions and suggestions contained within the Framework (see Chapter Three for
definitions of assertions and suggestions). An example of an assertion in the Framework
is: "The Framework redefines the boundaries of what librarians teach and how they
conceptualize the study of information within the curricula of higher education
institutions" (Association of College and Research Libraries, January, 2015, p. 14). The
key words that make this an assertion are "The Framework redefines..." Question 20 on
the survey asked: "Do you think the Framework will redefine the boundaries of what
librarians teach and how they conceptualize the study of information literacy within the
curricula at your institution? Yes or No." An example of a suggestion in the Framework
is: "ACRL encourages the library community to discuss the new Framework widely and
to develop resources such as curriculum guides, concept maps, and assessment
instruments to supplement the core set of materials in the frames" (Association of College
and Research Libraries, January, 2015, p. 14). The key word that makes this a suggestion
is "encourages." Question 18 on the survey asked: "Do you think the Framework will
encourage the library community at your institution to develop resources such as

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

10

curriculum guides, concept maps, and assessment instruments to supplement the core set
of materials in the frames? Yes or No."
After survey data was collected, a multiple regression was conducted to determine
if any of the following seven independent variables (IVs) significantly predicted the DV:
1. Professional position or titles of participants within the library setting;
2. Whether or not the institution offers an American Library Association (ALA)
accredited program of study in Library Science;
3. Whether or not regional accreditation agencies use the term IL in their
assessment guidelines;
4. Current context of library instructional practices;
5. Current use of the IL Competency Standards for Higher Education;
6. Institutional membership in the Association of Research Libraries (ARL);
7. Individual membership in the Association for College and Research Libraries
(ACRL).
Qualitative data consisted of answers to an open-ended question on the survey that asked
participants to explain and provide examples of why they think the Framework will have
an impact on the library praxes at their institution. Excerpts from these answers were
chosen to best illustrate the range of rationales offered by participants, providing a
deeper understanding of the participants' perspectives.
Limitations and Delimitations
Some of the limitations of this study were as follows:
1. This study did not take into account the enrollment size of institutions. It may
be that librarians in smaller institutions perceived a certain level of impact

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

11

because of a low student-librarian ratio, and the same could be said of larger
institutions, with a higher student-librarian ratio. Also, the allocation of library
funding differed at each institution, and differences in institution size can also
affect the integration of IL (Weiner, 2012), thereby impacting librarians'
perceptions of the Framework. It could be that larger institutions had more
funding, thereby compensating for their larger student-librarian ratio. If this
study had only used institutions of a specific enrollment, it would have
significantly limited the sample size. Therefore, enrollment size and library
funding complexities were not accounted for in this study, thus somewhat
limiting its generalizability.
2. Social desirability bias can be explained as a participant's effort to answer
questions the way they think others would answer or possibly the way they
think others would want them to answer (Cozby, 2009). The opposite may hold
true as well. Participants may answer questions the way they think others
would not answer or possibly the way they think others would not want them
to answer. Social desirability bias can be described as a way of conforming or
not conforming. In most cases, social desirability bias is something a
researcher hopes to avoid. In the case of this study, it was something that was
taken into consideration through the identification of the IVs. For example,
whether or not a participant is biased to answer a certain could have been
relative to their position within the organization (IV 1). The primary goal of
this study was to identify relationships between the IVs and the DV; in other
words, to see if the IVs influenced the DV. Influence could be considered a

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

12

source of bias. Again, bias is generally undesirable. However, the research
design allowed for the parsing out of some sources of bias—bias as defined to
be the influences on a participant's perceived level of impact on academic
library praxes that the Framework will have. However, it was not possible to
identify and account for all sources of bias due to the countless differences
between individuals.
3. The population of academic library deans, instructional librarians, and
assessment librarians working within higher education institutions in the
United States is substantial, so only a small sample of this population could be
surveyed. This limited the generalizability of study results to the larger
population.
4. This was a self-administered survey—that is, after receiving an email invitation
containing an online link that provided access to the survey, participants
decided whether or not to accept the invitation. This meant that the sample was
biased towards participants who were motivated to complete the survey.
5. When data is collected via the Internet, there is the possibility of participant
misrepresentation (e.g., age, or whether or not they have read the Framework—
see Delimitations below). However, this was a relatively minor limitation. As
Cozby (2009) stated, "for most research topics it is unlikely that people will go
to the trouble of misrepresenting themselves on the Internet to a greater extent
than they would with any other method of collecting data" (p. 133).
Some of the delimitations of this study were as follows:
1. Participants recruited for this study were limited to academic library deans,

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

13

assessment librarians, and instructional librarians. Faculty members from other
disciplines and students were not surveyed. Although the Framework asserts
that it will affect the broader population of academic institutions (e.g., faculty
from other disciplines and students), the impetus of the change will begin in
the academic library. Until there is a general understanding of how the
Framework will impact library praxes, it would have been premature to include
faculty members from other disciplines and students.
2. Question 8 of the survey asked if participants had read the Framework. If they
indicated that they had, then the survey continued. If not, they were
automatically taken to the End of Survey page. After receiving each
participant's survey responses, the data showed that participants were
"disqualified" if they answered no to Question 8. However, the data from
participants' responses to Questions 1-8 was still available for analysis.
3. This study was limited to academic deans, assessment librarians, and
instructional librarians working in higher education institutions with a Carnegie
Classification (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching,
February, 2012) of very high research activity (RU/VH), high research activity
(RU/H), and Doctoral/Research Universities (DRU). All RU/VH, RU/H, and
DRU universities necessarily offer graduate studies. The Framework states that
it "can guide the redesign of information literacy programs for general
education courses, for upper level courses in students' major departments, and
for graduate student education" (Association of College and Research
Libraries, November, 2014, p. 2). Even though some institutions offer graduate

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

14

programs, they may not offer doctoral programs. The sample for this study
ensured that institutions that have doctoral programs were included. However,
because the minimum sample size requirements (120 participants) was not met
using only the RU/VH, RU/H, and DRU universities, the sample was extended
to include universities with the following Carnegie Classifications: Master's
Colleges and Universities, larger programs (Master's L), Master's Colleges and
Universities, medium programs (Master's M), and Master's Colleges and
Universities, small programs (Master's S).
4. The study did not include participants who were serving (at the time the study
was being conducted) on the ACRL Board of Directors, on the ACRL IL
Competency Standards Review Task Force and/or the ACRL IL Competency
Standards Task Force. Membership in these groups may have had the potential
of creating a conflict of interest.
Definitions of Terms
Information Literacy: "The set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective
discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued,
and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in
communities of learning" (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2015, p. 3).
Level of impact: How much or how little key assertions that the Framework makes will
determine changes on academic library praxes.
Academic library praxes: Existing practices or methods for addressing IL, including, but
not limited to integrating IL in curricula and assessment, developing resources, designing
instruction, collaborating with discipline faculty as well as with other academic librarians

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK
to design IL programs.
Perceive: In this study, perceptions (or what people perceive) refer to attitudes and
beliefs—how "people evaluate and think about issues" (Cozby, 2009, p. 124).

Chapter Two
Literature Review
In 1992, after interviewing ARL librarians about the quality of library and
information science literature, Hernon and Metoyer-Duran stated that, "If library and
information science is to advance as a scholarly field, and further justify the position of
its programs within college and university graduate schools, the quality of the research,
theoretical, and scholarly literature of the field must increase" (p. 501). Twenty-two years
later, Hollister (2014) completed a content analysis of papers submitted to the journal,
Communications in Information Literacy, between the years 2007-2013. According to
Hollister, common reviewer criticisms of these articles were: (a) poor presentation and
development of ideas, (b) the lack of significant contribution or scientific validity, (c)
problems in methodology, and (d) the anecdotal (e.g., non-empirical) nature of the
articles. I hope to make a significant and empirical contribution to the library and
information science literature through this study, and, with that aim, present the following
review of literature to support the methodology described in Chapter Three. The literature
review will cover IL and its importance in higher education, how the Standards translated
IL into measurable learning outcomes and the importance of the Standards in higher
education, and finally, how the Standards have evolved into the most current articulation
of IL—the Framework.
Origins of Information Literacy
Cowan (2014) and many others credited the work of Paul Zurkowski as being the
"formative moment for information literacy in the United States" (p. 24). Zurkowski
(1973) gave the following charge to librarians, who he envisioned at the center of the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

17

establishment of a major national IL program:
A word to individual librarians, to you who devote your lives to making
information available to users: ours is a populist industry. We share your
commitment to the open marketplace of ideas and its continual and fearless sifting
and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found. (p. 258)
Zurkowski (1974) further advanced the position that IL was a programmatic goal and his
vision of librarians, as devoted to the democratization and ceaseless "winnowing" of
information in order to find the truth, is one that has inspired decades of library
professionals. Over the past forty years, IL has evolved from a proposition to a welldeveloped science of information. Originally defined by the ALA as "the ability to
recognize when information is needed and to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
needed information" (American Library Association, 1989, para. 3), IL has become an
important part of the instruction and assessment of students in higher education.
Importance in higher education. By making sure that students develop critical
thinking and reasoning skills, and by assisting them in the construction of a framework
for lifelong learning, colleges and universities supply a solid base for sustained
development throughout their academic and professional careers. IL is an essential part of
becoming a lifelong learner (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000).
Teaching students to critically assess, evaluate, and use information is now viewed as
essential to student success and has become a central component of library instruction.
There are numerous studies (e.g., Hardesty, 2007) that speak to how academic librarians
can help to increase IL skills among adult learners, and, in so doing, increase student
retention.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

18

Importance in student retention. Hagel, Horn, Owen, and Currie (2012)
suggested five ways that university libraries can increase student retention. "The
literature reviewed suggests several key means by which libraries can contribute to
retention" (p. 218). Perhaps the most important or relevant finding of Hagel et. al is that
libraries can help students become more academically engaged by providing access to
information services. Students tend to use the library more when they are enrolled in
rigorous academic programs. This necessarily involves a collaborative working
relationship between librarians and instructors—especially instructors from rigorous
academic programs. Librarians need to educate instructors on IL strategies so that
students know how to effectively locate, utilize, and discriminate among information
sources.
Importance in academics. IL is an essential skill for students in today's academic
world. As Breivik (1991) stated, IL skills allow students to:
...verify or refute expert opinion and to become independent seekers of truth. By
letting students experience the excitement of their own successful quests for
knowledge, this kind of literacy creates the motivation for pursuing learning
throughout their lives. In our efforts to combat illiteracy, information literacy—
not just teaching people to read—should be our goal. (p. 87)
Many studies have assessed students' demonstration of IL skills. These studies have
evaluated IL skills in four different ways (Mahmood, 2013). One method uses the ACRL
Standards to create an instrument for assessing IL (cf. Marshall, 2006). Secondly,
researchers have used achievement tests to measure IL. For example, Ali, Abu-Hassan,
Daud and Jusoff (2010) asked 49 engineering students in Malaysia to complete an

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

19

information skills test (a multiple-choice test on the information research process).
Results from this study showed that the students did not have the knowledge and skills
necessary to assess information on the Internet, to find and apply effective search
strategies, to use academic resources and databases, and to use information ethically and
responsibly.
A third group of studies used a qualitative method to assess IL skills. The
researchers who conducted these studies analyzed citations or bibliographies in student
assignments (Mahmood, 2013). For example, Ali et al. (2010) triangulated the data from
an achievement test with a citation analysis in 19 essays written by Malaysian
engineering students. The researchers found that students used a total of 32 scholarly
works (journals, conference proceedings, books, and government documents) and a total
of 35 non-scholarly works (websites/blogs, reports, handbooks, magazines and
newsletters).
Finally, there are studies that demonstrated a significant correlation between
students' evaluation of their IL skills and their academic skills (Mahmood, 2013). Caspers
and Bernhisel (2007) surveyed 246 entering students, asking them to rate their IL skills
and also administering a test to measure their IL skills in gathering information. Most of
the students judged their IL skills to be less than "excellent"—62% of them thought their
skills were "good," 16.7% thought their skills were "excellent," 19.5 % rated themselves
as "fair," and 1.6% evaluated their skills as "poor." On the skills test, the mean score was
72.4%--an average of 15.2 correct answers out of 21 questions. After running a
correlative analysis, Caspers and Bernhisel found a significant relationship between the
"Total Score" (on the IL skills test) and students' GPA (r = 0.242 p < 0.001). This

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

20

suggests that the higher the students' IL skills, the higher their GPA and vice versa.
Importance in accreditation. The fundamental requirement for students to be able
to locate, manage, analyze and use information is now accepted by some regional
accreditation associations as a key learning objective for college students (Association of
College and Research Libraries, 2000). In addition to defining IL, accreditation standards
also incorporate learning outcomes for IL and highlight the need for collaboration
between library and faculty (Samson, 2010).
An example of the importance of including IL terminology in accreditation
standards comes from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). A
draft revision of the MSCHE accreditation standards (Middle States Commission on
Higher Education, 2013) removed all references to the library or IL as a learning
outcome. According to Steven Bell (2014), ACRL Past-President, this came as a shock to
many librarians who worked in the mid-Atlantic region because MSCHE was one of the
first to specifically address IL as a learning outcome in its standards. Bell also stated, "It
was MSCHE that set the bar for the recognition of information literacy by accreditors"
(para. 3).
After the presentation of the November, 2013 draft revision at the MSCHE
Annual Conference, academic librarians began writing letters to the ACRL and the
MSCHE, expressing a concern voiced by Bell (2014):
The concern is that just eliminating the language about information literacy and
libraries will send a symbolic message that it either no longer needs our attention
or is so well embedded in our curriculums that it requires no further mention in
the standards. Neither of those perceptions is an acceptable proposition for many

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

21

academic librarians. (para. 4)
According to Bell (2014), academic librarians flooded MSCHE with comments about the
exclusion of any reference to IL and libraries. In June of 2014, just four months after Bell
wrote a blog for the ACRL Insider encouraging librarians to continue expressing
concerns about the lack of IL language in the MSCHE accreditation standards, the final
MSCHE draft of their accreditation standards (Middle States Commission on Higher
Education, 2014) used the term "information literacy" exactly one time as part of their
third standard.
Library instructional practices. The rapid evolution of technology necessitates
library instructional programs be crafted in order to teach individuals how to quickly and
effectively find the necessary information (Cowan, 2013). Because of their role in the
creation, maintenance, and provision of research tools and acquisitions, librarians are in a
good position to provide IL instruction. Hardesty (2007) presented numerous studies that
speak to how academic librarians can help to increase IL skills among adult learners
(particularly first year college students). In a nutshell, library instruction should include,
but not necessarily be limited to:
 helping students with the hows and whens of using the library resources;
 helping make the library environment "user-friendly";
 developing tutorials for students (both online and face-to-face) that concentrate
on how to navigate through the cataloguing system;
 designing and developing orientation courses;
 designing assignments and co-curricular activities in close collaboration with
instructors and departments;

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

22

 helping to reduce "library anxiety" by presenting students with library
orientations that center on "real-life" applications (careers, entertainment,
community resources, etc.).
In these ways, library instruction has been shown to lead to higher levels of IL skills.
There are three main contexts for library instructional programs. Some of these
contexts may overlap. For example, library orientation can take place in a "one-shot"
session, in a credit-bearing course throughout the year, or in an orientation a few weeks
before the semester begins.
"One-shot" sessions. The typical context for library instruction is the "one-shot"
session, where librarians have a limited window of time to give students instructions on
how to complete their assignments. Because of time limitations, library instruction is
usually restricted to the hows of using research tools, rather than on the whys of using
them (Adyelott, 2008). One-shot sessions generally rely on faculty members inviting the
librarian to teach a session for their class. In this context, the librarian is little more than
an assistant to the course instructor, a visitor who seldom gets to see how students apply
the skills they are attempting to teach (Fister, 2008). Within these limitations (e.g., time
constraints and the librarian's primary role as guest lecturer), it is difficult for librarians to
develop a comprehensive program for IL.
Credit-bearing general education requirement. In her article, Fister (2008)
discussed political and economic reasons why one-shot sessions are used more
commonly than credit-bearing courses. First, the acceptance of a proposed course is
dependent upon the political climate—how IL is valued within a particular institution or
region—and on the economic environment—there may not be enough funding to pay

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

23

instructors and market course offerings. Next, offering a credit-bearing course in IL as an
elective may not be economically feasible because students may choose not to enroll in it.
For these reasons, it may be better to require an IL course for graduation. This would
impact all students, but it requires a great deal of time and money to negotiate the
curriculum and provide staff to support the requirement. Finally, librarians may think it is
a better use of their time to conduct one-shot sessions with a large number of students in
a variety of settings instead of spending a few hours a week with only a limited amount
of students. All that being said, many librarians would agree that it is preferable for
students to learn IL skills in the context of a course instead of as an isolated skill removed
from meaningful content.
Orientation for incoming first-year students. Librarians often use orientations to
introduce incoming students to the library. They instruct students on fundamental library
skills, requiring students to focus on skill practice instead of on the valuation and critical
analysis of content. At large universities (that typically have the most complicated library
systems), a single orientation session may be the only time that students have contact
with librarians (Fister, 2008).
Professional positions in the library. IL is most commonly taught by the
instruction librarians, sometimes under the supervision and guidance of assessment
librarians who are, in turn, supervised by the library dean. Research suggests that
organizational positionality, or "the differing relations of authority embedded in
organizational structures" (Brubaker, 2011, p. 242), can impact worker satisfaction and
this, in turn, is correlated with job performance which is related to job stress (Brubaker,
2011; Jamal, 1984; Judge, Thoresen, Bono, & Patton, 2001). Job stress is linked to the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

24

perceived organizational readiness for change, defined as "organizational members'
beliefs, attitudes, and intentions regarding the extent to which changes are needed and the
organization's capacity to successfully make those changes" (Armenakis, Harris, &
Mossholder, 1993, p. 681).
Titles of professional library positions may vary from institution to institution.
For the purposes of this study, the titles "library deans", "assessment librarians", and
"instruction librarians" were used. The following job descriptions of these positions were
derived from the ACRL 2009 CUPA-HR (College and University Professional
Association for Human Resources) Position Description Task Force and can be found on
the ACRL's website under "New Academic Library Position Descriptions" (Association
of College and Research Libraries, n.d.).
Library deans. Library deans, library directors and, at some institutions,
university librarians, provide "strategic leadership for all functions of the library in
collaboration with other academic units and in support of the mission of the
College/University. Serves as primary advocate for the library and able to articulate and
implement a vision for the future of academic libraries. Degree requirement: ALA
Accredited Masters."
Assessment librarians. Assessment librarians play a critical role in IL instruction.
The individual in this role "provides general and virtual information, research and
reference services; plans, teaches and assesses information literacy instruction in
collaboration with faculty; develops web and print based materials; serves as liaison to
academic departments. Provides continuing education on pedagogy for all teaching
librarians. Locates and creates digital content to support academic instruction; explores,

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

25

evaluates and encourages deployment of emergent technologies into library programs and
services. Position may include Information Literacy/Instructional Design responsibilities.
Generally this individual has 3-5 years of experience in the field. Degree requirement:
ALA Accredited Masters."
Instruction librarians. The instruction and/or reference librarian, who is not in a
supervisory role, "provides general and virtual information, research and reference
services. Plans, teaches and assesses information literacy instruction in collaboration with
faculty and/or Department Head. Develops web and print based materials. Serves as
liaison to academic departments. Locates and creates digital content to support academic
instruction. Explores, evaluates and encourages deployment of emergent technologies
into library programs and services. Generally this individual has 0-1 year of experience in
the field. Degree requirement: ALA Accredited Masters."
The Standards
The ACRL is a professional association with a current membership of more than
12,000 academic librarians and other interested people. The largest division of the ALA,
ACRL is committed to improving the capacity of academic library and information
professionals to meet the needs of higher education and to enhance learning, teaching and
research (Association of College & Research Libraries, n.d.). In 2000, the ACRL adopted
the Standards "as a framework for assessing the information literature individual" (para.
12).
They were as follows:
Standard 1: The information literate student determines the nature and extent of
the information needed.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

26

Standard 2: The information literate student accesses needed information
effectively and efficiently.
Standard 3: The information literate student evaluates information and its sources
critically and incorporates selected information into his or her knowledge base
and value system.
Standard 4: The information literate student, individually or as a member of a
group, uses information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose.
Standard 5: The information literate student understands many of the economic,
legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses
information ethically and legally.
In addition to the five standards, there were 22 performance indicators. An example of a
Performance Indicator for Standard One is: "The information literate student defines and
articulates the need for information." The Standards also listed outcomes for assessing
student progress toward IL, intended to be guidelines for developing methods of
assessing student learning at the local, institutional level. An example of an outcome for
the first performance indicator is: "Develops a thesis statement and formulates questions
based on the information need" (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000).
Importance in higher education. Doing a search for ACRL IL Standards as a
search string resulted in 524 peer-reviewed articles in libraries worldwide, using
WorldCat. Narrowing the search to UNM Libraries resulted in 466 peer-reviewed
articles. This simple search alone revealed the impact that the Standards have had on the
world of higher education. They have served to promote discussions about IL as an
instrument of educational reform and have made it possible for colleges, universities, and

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

27

regional accrediting bodies to incorporate IL as a necessary learning outcome
(Association of College and Research Libraries, February, 2014). Since their adoption in
2000, the Standards have been used in a wide variety of contexts. Examples of how the
Standards have been used in higher education include:
 Assessing university library instruction programs (Davidson, McMillen, &
Maughan, 2002);
 Comparing the Standards with evidence-based practice (Adams, 2014);
 Developing modular critical-thinking-based IL tutorials (Adyelott, 2008);
 Connecting the Standards with the teaching approach of Problem-based
Learning (Holler, 2009);
 Redesigning introductory courses for first-year students (Karshmer & Bryan,
2011);
 Infusing the Standards into a doctoral program (Grant & Berg, 2004);
 Creating assessment instruments (Samson, 2010);
 Integrating the Standards into introductory management courses (Leigh &
Gibbon, 2008);
 Developing and implementing undergraduate research methods courses
(Marfleet, Dille, & Dille, 2005).
Marshall (2006) created a 40-item self-report survey to assess IL skills based
primarily on a synthesis of the Standards. The survey asked participants to rate 10
statements (e.g., "I feel confident determining what topic I need to search") on a sevenpoint, Likert-scale (1 = strongly agree, 7 = strongly disagree). Marshall administered the
survey to 520 students who also rated their GPA on a scale from one to five (1 = 2.0 or

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

28

below, 2 = 2.01-2.49, 3 = 2.5-2.99, 4 = 3.0-3.49, and 5 = 3.5-4.0; M = 3.62). The survey
significantly correlated with students' self-rating of their GPAs (r = .109, p < .05).
"The times they are a-changin'." While the Standards have had an enormous
impact on the development of IL as a disciplinary science, they were written in a simpler
time. Since 2000, there have been significant shifts in higher education, including an
increased emphasis on students as information producers who create online content in the
form of videos, podcasts, blogs, etc. Other examples of significant shifts discussed in the
first draft of the Framework (Association of College and Research Libraries, February,
2014) are: (a) integrative learning programs that focus on interdisciplinary critical
thinking and communication skills; (b) an increase in professional master's degrees where
the typical student has a full-time job while finishing their degree requirements and so
need efficient methods for locating and creating information; (c) blended learning, a
combination of face-to-face and online instruction; (d) Massive Open Online Courses, an
online course offered to a large number of students who respond to instructional materials
"freely" available online; and (e) the "flipped classroom," in which students get course
content outside of class through videos and readings, and use class time for discussion
and the completion of collaborative assignments. "The changes in higher education,
coupled with a more complex information ecosystem than existed at the end of the last
century, demand new engagement with the concept of information literacy." (Association
of College and Research Libraries, February, 2014, p. 1).
Wiggins and McTighe (2005) identified three problems with content standards.
They are paraphrased below:
1. The overload problem: the large number of content standards exceeds the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

29

amount of time needed to study them.
2. The Goldilocks problem: Just like Goldilocks and the beds and chairs of the
three bears, some standards are too big while others are too small.
3. The nebulous problem: Standards are so nebulous that they are almost certain
to be interpreted in multiple ways; they are therefore not achieving one of the
goals of the standards movement—to articulate clear and cogent learning
outcomes.
Looking at the Standards through the lens of the Wiggins and McTighe criteria, these
three problems are evident throughout. First, the overload problem exists because of the
large volume of content—5 standards, 22 performance indicators, and over 90 learning
outcomes. It is not possible to cover all this content, even in the context of an IL course
that lasts a semester. The Goldilocks problem can be seen in the extensive differences
between the learning outcomes. And, since many of the outcomes are too broad—not
specific, measurable, or connected with the content of the relevant standard—the
Standards are nebulous (Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011).
Because of the problematic nature of the Standards and the shifts in higher
education, the ACRL IL Competency Standards Review Task Force, after reviewing
literature on IL, information technology, and critical theory, decided that the Standards
"should not be reapproved as they exist but should be extensively revised" (Association
of College and Research Libraries, June, 2012, p. 1). They recommended these revisions:
1. The Standards must be simplified as a readily understood model for greater
adoption by audiences (both disciplinary and collegiate) outside of ALA.
2. The Standards must be articulated in readily comprehensible terms that do not

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

30

include library jargon.
3. The Standards must include affective, emotional learning outcomes, in addition
to the exclusively cognitive focus of the current standards.
4. The Standards must acknowledge complementary literacies.
5. The Standards must move beyond an implicit focus on format.
6. The Standards must address the role of the student as content creator.
7. The Standards must address the role of the student as content curator.
8. The Standards must provide continuity with the American Association of
School Librarians' Standards for the 21st Century Learner. (pp. 4-6)
The remaining section of the literature review presents the theoretical underpinnings of a
framework that allows IL to be seen "in a more holistic way" (Malenfant, 2014).
The Framework
In the January 7, 2015 "Open Letter Regarding the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education," Berg et al. stated that, "the Task Force has created a new
document that establishes a theoretical basis for information literacy." It is important to
note that this open letter was authored by 14 academic librarians, all of whom were either
members of the New Jersey Chapter of the ACRL and the College and University Section
of the New Jersey Library Association User Education Committee and/or the Virtual
Academic Library Environment Shared Information Literacy Committee. The contention
the authors made, that the Framework is a theoretical basis for IL, seems sound and
reasonable, given that the Framework (Association of College and Research Libraries,
2015) stated that it:
...has been conceived as a set of living documents on which the profession will

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

31

build. The key product is a set of frames, or lenses, through which
to view information literacy. (p. 14)
The Framework is a different approach to IL than the Standards. Intentionally called a
framework, it relies on a conceptual approach rather than being prescriptive, allowing for
greater flexibility in implementation. Central to the Framework are conceptual
understandings that consolidate multiple ways of thinking about information, research,
and scholarship into a comprehensible model (Association of College and Research
Libraries, 2015). The paradigmatic shift from a standards-based approach to the
conceptual approach the Framework offers is a change that will have a significant effect
on the library profession and in higher education (see Chapter One). A closer look at the
key conceptual elements of the Framework reveals the substantial departure it takes from
the Standards.
The theory of threshold concepts is the fundamental departure point from the
Standards to the Framework. Originating from the work of Meyer and Land (2003),
threshold concepts are foundational ideas and processes in any discipline that, once
grasped, lead to the transformation and integration of the student's understanding and
practice of that discipline (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2015;
Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011). Meyer and Land advanced five criteria for
threshold concepts:
1. transformative—cause an important shift in the learner's perspective
2. irreversible—the learner does not forget this change in perception
3. integrative—synthesizes separate ideas into a coherent whole
4. bounded—delineates the borders of a specific discipline

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

32

5. troublesome—contains ideas that are stumbling blocks, or conceptual
understandings that students have a hard time with
On the surface, threshold concepts might be seen as similar to standards.
Townsend et al. (2011) stated that the similarity lies in the fact that, when correctly
applied, they can ground instructors in the central concepts of their discipline, provide
pedagogical strategies for instructional and curriculum design, and be used as a possible
tool for measuring learning objectives or competencies. The Framework does not contain
specific objectives or competencies. Instead, it provides knowledge practices and
dispositions (see end of "Searching as strategic exploration" section for a discussion of
these). Unlike Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, on which the learning
outcomes of the Standards were based (Association of College and Research Libraries,
2000), the knowledge practices and dispositions provided in the Framework are not based
on "higher order" or "lower order" thinking skills. Instead, these practices and
dispositions are based on threshold concepts. These conceptual understandings are
intended to be doorways for student learning, that, once entered, transform the learner's
frame of reference (Townsend et al., 2011). This is a conceptual approach versus a
prescriptive approach to learning outcomes. Because threshold concepts are the basis for
the Framework, it can be said that the departure the Framework takes from the Standards
is, at its root, theoretical.
According to Townsend et al. (2011), threshold concepts are especially appealing
to instruction librarians (and instructors from all content areas) because they are free of
educational jargon and, therefore, easy to use with a variety of instructional approaches
and disciplines. Instead of having to pledge allegiance to a particular pedagogical theory,

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

33

librarians can use classroom observation and their knowledge of IL to make instructional
decisions. Current research has indicated that IL instruction typically consists of
embellished bibliographic instruction. Librarians who wish to teach more complex IL
skills often wrestle with how to and what to teach. Threshold concepts can guide the
struggling instruction librarian because they can help answer the "why" questions that
students often ask: Why is it important to cite this article properly? Why do I need to take
this course? Instruction librarians who use threshold concepts to design their instruction
can answer these procedural questions in a more meaningful context (Townsend et al.,
2011).
Townsend et al. (2011) first came across threshold concepts while they were
teaching a required course in IL at California State University-East Bay. Examining their
course content through the lens of threshold concepts, Townsend et al. began the lengthy,
iterative process of formulating thresholds unique to IL. For months they searched for
inconsistencies and weak spots in their IL instruction, and reflected on concepts that were
consistently troublesome for students. This process transformed their own understanding
of IL. The transformation led to clearly communicating concepts they had known before
but had not otherwise shared with students.
Townsend et al. (2011; Townsend, Hofer, Hanick, & Brunetti, 2016) are involved
in an ongoing Delphi study, the purpose of which is to continue the process of identifying
and refining threshold concepts in IL. In a Delphi study, a moderator collects and
summarizes written responses from a small group of experts, who answered questions on
a topic anonymously. The experts then have the opportunity to read the responses of their
peers and adjust their own answers accordingly (Brunetti, Hofer, Lu, & Townsend,

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

34

2014). While relying on the threshold concepts identified in the Delphi study, "the
Framework has been molded using fresh ideas and emphases" for the thresholds,
organizing them into six "Frames" (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2015,
p. 2). What follows are shortened, paraphrased descriptions of the six Frames for the
purpose of illuminating the threshold concepts theory as it applies to IL.
Authority is constructed and contextual. The first frame addresses the need for
learners to critically examine and evaluate the authority (e.g., the expertise and
credibility) of an information source. Authority does not necessarily mean scholarly
authority. It is "constructed" because different groups of people acknowledge varying
kinds of authority. It is "contextual" because the context for the information may help to
decide what kind of authority is needed. For example, Farmer Green has not received a
formal education, but he is a fifth-generation farmer who has been growing and selling
chile peppers for the past 20 years. He has written a blog about growing the best chile in
New Mexico. A biologist reads the farmer's blog to find out which chile seeds are the
hottest ones to grow. The farmer does not have scholarly authority, but he has
experiential authority.
Information creation as a process. Many students are confused by the format of
information. For example, they cannot tell the difference between a journal and a website.
They call everything that shows up in a browser window—news articles, blogs—a
website, meaning they found it online. They fall back on old modes of locating
information (e.g., "Googling it") and do not realize they lack skills in recognizing what
they have found (Townsend et al., 2011). Experts understand format as the outcome of
different processes, and this understanding helps them select the resources best needed

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

35

for the product they are creating.
Information has value. In an age where the most frequently used IL strategy is to
"just Google it," where information on a multiplicity of topics is accessible to anyone
with Internet access, it is not surprising that most students think that all information is
free for the taking. Is it any wonder then that students express shock or anger when they
bump into a paywall after finding the perfect article? Or that they are confused by their
instructor's insistence on the need to cite their sources (Townsend et al., 2011)? When
students traverse this particular threshold, they realize that information has value, either
as a product that can be bought and sold, or as a method for educating oneself,
influencing others, and negotiating with the world.
Research as inquiry. IL is commonly thought of as "learning how to do
research." This frame addresses research skills, including the formulation of research
questions, the collection of information using diverse research methods, the organization
and synthesis of ideas, and the ability to interpret and form conclusions based on the
gathered information. However, this frame is about more than learning research skills.
Novice learners need to understand that research is an inquiry process focused on finding
answers to questions that have not yet been answered or are unresolved. Inquiry is an
iterative process—a problem-solving procedure that involves breaking down complex
questions into simple ones, reformulating research questions based on the available
information, and engaging in dialogue and debate with others about differing answers to
their questions.
Scholarship as conversation. When the ENG 101 freshman is trying to complete
her research paper, she may become frustrated, unable to find a simple answer to her

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

36

research question. For example, while researching the "cause" of learning disorders, she
finds that one scholar definitively states that dyslexia is the result of visual difficulties
while another completely refutes the visual hypothesis, asserting that dyslexia is the
result of a defect in phonetic processing. The student who has crossed the threshold of
this frame has discovered that scholars are involved in an ongoing debate and dialogue.
Instead of avoiding other perspectives, the student participates in the scholarly
conversation by seeking out divergent ideas in the literature and engaging in
conversations with peers and instructors that enlarge their understanding of an issue.
They also recognize that participating in the conversation means providing citations to
the work of others.
Searching as strategic exploration. Novice learners usually have only a limited
set of search strategies. They look up answers to research questions on Wikipedia, but do
not check the references at the end of the Wikipedia article in order to verify the
information. They may search the World Wide Web, but are not able to evaluate
information sources. For example, when their dog gets sick, they are not able to
distinguish between advice offered by a medical expert and advice offered by another
dog owner. Experts, on the other hand, are able to search strategically, evaluating a wide
range of sources and identifying those sources most relevant for their research need.
Each description of the Frames in the Framework is followed by a list of
knowledge practices and dispositions. Knowledge practices are the resulting skills that
learners may develop as a result of mastering a threshold concept/Frame. An example of
a knowledge practice is the ability to "define different types of authority" (Association of
College and Research Libraries, 2015, p. 5). Dispositions address the affective

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

37

component of learning. In contrast to the Standards, that focused almost exclusively on
cognitive learning outcomes (Association of College and Research Libraries, February,
2014), the Framework was conceived to encourage a more holistic approach to the design
of learning outcomes or objectives—one that includes student preferences and attitudes.
An example of a disposition is the ability to "develop and maintain an open mind when
encountering varied and sometimes conflicting perspectives" (Association of College and
Research Libraries, 2015, p. 6). These knowledge practices and dispositions are not
intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive. Instead, they are intended to promote a
collaborative effort between stakeholders at the local, institutional level for the codevelopment and co-writing of learning outcomes (Association of College and Research
Libraries, January, 2015, Board of Directors Action Form).
In addition to threshold concepts, two other terms important to understanding the
Framework's theoretical approach to IL are metaliteracy and metacognition. Metaliteracy
proposes a transformed vision of IL as an all-encompassing set of skills whereby students
use and produce information and engage effectively in collective environments
(Association of College and Research Libraries, 2015). "Metaliteracy empowers learners
to participate in interactive information environments, equipped with the ability to
continuously reflect, change, and contribute as critical thinkers." (Jacobson & Mackey,
2013, p. 86). This emphasis on the individual as an information producer can be seen in
the Framework's use of words like "collaborate," "produce," and "share" in the writing of
the Frames, knowledge practices, and dispositions. Metacognition, or the awareness of
one's own thought processes, has been shown by research to be important in cognitive
development and academic learning (Paris & Winograd, 1990). This emphasis on the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

38

importance of metacognition can be seen in the Framework's use of phrases like "develop
awareness" and "are conscious." The concepts of metaliteracy and metacognition are also
important in the Framework's new proposed definition of IL.
The Framework's definition of IL. The definition of IL adopted by the ALA in
1989 was "the ability to recognize when information is needed and to locate, evaluate,
and use effectively the needed information" (Association of College and Research
Libraries, 1989, para. 3). Subsequently, the definition was used as part of the introduction
to the Standards (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000). In the first draft
of the Framework (February, 2014), the Task Force asserted that the Standards' definition
of IL described it as a skill set identical for all learners, based on a fixed conception of IL
as a hierarchy of proficiencies, presumed to be the same across all disciplines and
contexts. Additionally, the Task Force asserted that the Standards envisioned the
information literate student as "a construct of imagined accomplishment, at the endpoint
of a set of learning experiences, without the involvement of peers, tutors, coaches, faculty
advisors, or other collaborators" (p. 3). This focus on discrete skills acquired in isolation
has been replaced by a socio-constructivist perspective on learning in more recent
definitions of IL. The findings of Limberg, Alexandersson, Lantz-Andersson, and
Folkesson (2008) indicated IL pedagogy is moving in the direction of determining the
value of students' research questions, creating an avenue for teachers and learners to
negotiate instructional goals, and critically evaluating information sources in the various
contexts of student assignments. Limberg et al. (2008) provided a valuable bridge
between the traditional IL skill-centered approach to a pedagogy more in tune with what
the Framework offers.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

39

Based on the work of Limberg et al. (2008) and other researchers, the Framework
provides an expanded definition of IL that attempts to move beyond the Standards'
limited and formulaic approach to IL (Association of College and Research Libraries,
February, 2014):
The set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of
information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued, and
the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in
communities of learning. (p. 3)
In contrast to the Standard's limited definition of IL, the Framework moves beyond the
acquisition of abilities to include references to threshold concepts ("the understanding of
how information is produced and valued"), metaliteracy ("creating new knowledge") and
metacognition ("reflective"). It focuses on collaboration ("communities of learning"),
student creativity and ethical participation ("creating new knowledge and participating
ethically"), and individual growth ("discovery of information").
ARL membership. The ARL and the ALA are two organizations that are
especially important in the world of academic libraries. Their visions of IL, as expressed
in their mission statements, are very similar to the Framework's conceptions of IL. The
ARL is a nonprofit association of 125 research libraries in the United States and Canada.
Its member libraries spend more than 1.4 billion dollars every year on library materials.
Like the Framework, collaboration is an important theme in the ARL's vision
statement, guiding principles, and its proposed Strategic Framework 2015. In its June,
2014 "Report of the Association of Research Libraries Strategic Thinking and Design
Initiative," the ARL's vision statement is that, "in 2033, the research library will have

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

40

shifted from its role as a knowledge service provider within the university to become a
collaborative partner within a rich and diverse learning and research ecosystem" (p. 1).
This statement, in addition to emphasizing the importance of collaboration, also echoes
other ideas in the Framework—the need for librarians to move away from teaching IL as
a set of discrete skills ("the research library will have shifted from its role as a knowledge
service provider"), and the diversity of the information environment or "ecosystem."
Other guiding principles of the ARL are their commitment to the open access of
information and their ongoing promotion and advocacy of intellectual freedom in public
policy.
ALA accreditation. Founded in 1876 during the first official World's Fair in
Philadelphia, the ALA is the oldest and largest library organization in the world. It has
accredited 63 master's programs in library and information in the United States, Canada,
and Puerto Rico. Attaining an ALA-accredited master's degree is a requirement for most
professional librarian positions in higher education or public libraries. Like the ARL,
ALA is also committed to ensuring the open access of information, promoting intellectual
freedom, and advocating for state and national legislation helpful to libraries and users of
libraries. Like the Framework, themes of library transformation and the dynamic nature
of the information environment are evident in the ALA's key action areas. "ALA provides
leadership in the transformation of libraries and library services in a dynamic and
increasingly global digital information environment" (American Library Association,
n.d.). Like the Framework, it maintains that its standards for accreditation are not
intended to be prescriptive, but instead are intended to promote merit by developing
criteria for the evaluation of educational efficacy (American Library Association, 2008).

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

41

It is also important to note that the ACRL is the academic arm of the ALA.
Feedback on the Framework
Since the Framework has only recently been accepted by the ACRL Board of
Directors, no current instruments exist to specifically measure the potential perceived
impact the Framework may or may not have on higher education library praxes. It is
important to note, however, that throughout the process of revising the Framework, each
draft contained questions for stakeholders to answer that were directly related to the
content of the drafts. The first draft of the Framework asked for stakeholders to respond
to a survey containing these questions (Association of College and Research Libraries,
February, 2014):
1. In what ways will the focus on threshold concepts help you to generate
conversations with other campus stakeholders (such as disciplinary faculty
partners, members of the general education curriculum committee, and
academic support services staff)?
2. How do the sections for knowledge practices and assignments/assessments
provide helpful guidance when considering implementing the new Framework?
What else would you want to see in these sections?
3. We plan to include additional materials in a subsequent phase. What other
elements would you find helpful that aren't mentioned in our plans?
The results of the survey were described in the ACRL Interim Report (Association of
College and Research Libraries, March, 2014). Twenty-one people responded to the
survey. In the summary of the survey findings, some of the more pertinent observations
were:

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

42

 "Threshold concepts can facilitate cross-disciplinary discussion."
 "These concepts may be too theoretical for some instructors."
 "If librarians don't understand threshold concepts, it will be hard to talk with
others about them."
Some of the participants' recommendations, as summarized in the Interim Report were:
 "Simplify language and shorten document."
 "Incorporate benchmarks."
The results of this initial survey, albeit from a very small sample, revealed a concern with
the language of the document and a desire to return to a more prescriptive and formulaic
approach (e.g., "incorporating benchmarks").
Creed-Dikeogu (2014), Director of Library Services at Ottawa University, also
expressed misgivings about the Framework's theoretical approach in an article entitled
"Exploring the Revision of the ACRL Information Literacy Standards." She stated that
some might find the Framework's philosophy to be "entirely alien." She also said that
librarians who wish to adopt the Framework's teaching philosophy would have to accept
the whole "theory-practice package," and this might involve abandoning their own ideas.
Like the respondents to the first draft's survey, Howden (January 23, 2015),
Assistant Dean of the library at El Centro College, in a comment about the blog post,
"ACRL board update on the proposed Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education," also expressed dislike of the wording in the Framework: "The high flown
phrases are empty and meaningless." In addition, he acknowledged doubts about the
Framework's conceptual approach. "This Framework represents an attempt to ditch
learning outcomes and any ability to deal with professional accountability."

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

43

In the third draft of the Framework (Association of College and Research
Libraries, November, 2014), the Task Force asked stakeholders to respond to the
following questions:
1. How satisfied are you with the new definition of information literacy?
2. How satisfied are you with each of the six Frames?
3. How satisfied are you with the opportunities to provide feedback to the task
force on drafts of the Framework?
4. How satisfied are you that the task force has been responsive to feedback
provided on previous drafts of the Framework?
5. OVERALL, how satisfied are you with the third draft of the proposed
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education?
The results of this survey appeared in the Board of Directors Action Form (Association of
College and Research Libraries, January, 2015). Of the 206 people who responded,
67.4% said they supported the new Framework, 63% were satisfied with the new
definition of IL, and the "majority were satisfied with the new Frames" (p. 2). It is
important to note that these questions are attempting to assess stakeholder satisfaction,
and not the perceived impact that the Framework may or may not have on library praxes.
In this same document (Association of College and Research Libraries, January,
2015), the Chair of the ACRL Standards Committee, Susanna Boylston, reported on the
Task Force's rationale for not addressing some of the feedback it received. While many of
the stakeholders had asked for the mapping of the Framework to the Standards, the Task
Force decided that it would be counterproductive to link the conceptual approach of the
Framework to the prescriptive approach of the Standards. The Task Force also decided

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

44

against providing explicit learning outcomes and a sequencing of the Frames, again in the
hopes that not providing a rigid, formulaic approach would stimulate more collaborative
conversations at the local, institutional level.
At the end of the Board of Directors Action Form (Association of College and
Research Libraries, January, 2015), Boylston, on behalf of the Standards Committee,
recommended that the ACRL Board of Directors:
Sunset the Information Literacy Competency Standards of Higher Education in
July 2016,1 allowing for one full academic year for institutions to transition to the
Framework. The Framework better reflects the changed education and
information environment than the Standards, and the Task Force feels strongly
that it is inadvisable to have two documents available from which a choice can be
made but recognizes the need for a transition period as identified above. (p. 2)

Chapter Three
Methods
The final draft of the Framework, accepted by the ACRL Board of Directors in
February, 2015, redefines IL, moves away from the Standards, and gives librarians a new
lens through which to view academic library instruction as well as library praxes in
general. This chapter will present the purpose and significance of this study, the research
design, the measure, the participants, the variables, the procedures, and the how data was
analyzed.
This study was designed to investigate the perceived level of impact that the
Framework might have on academic library and higher education praxes. More
specifically, the purpose of this study was to determine, through a multiple regression
analysis, the best predictor variables for the perceptions of the Framework's level of
impact, i.e., the perceptions of library deans, assessment librarians, and instructional
librarians.
As stated in the first two chapters, the Standards had a tremendous impact on
library instruction in higher education. Just as the Standards have influenced or otherwise
generated educational reform, the Framework will also be important in furthering
educational reform in the 21st century. Just how much it may impact, change or influence
the field of IL depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of those most affected
by the change. To that end, the following research questions were developed to guide the
study:
1. What level of impact on academic library praxes do library deans, assessment
librarians, and instructional librarians perceive that the Framework for

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

46

Information Literacy for Higher Education will have?
2. What are the best predictor variables for the perceived level of impact on
academic library praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education will have?
3. How do academic library deans, assessment librarians, and instructional
librarians explain their perceptions of the level of impact on academic library
praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education will
have?
Conducting a multiple regression determined the best predictor variables of
perceived impact of the Framework on higher education library praxes. Determining or
discovering reasons (i.e., predictor variables) that might contribute to individuals'
perceptions is a large step towards informing potential directions that institutional
leadership and key stakeholders might take.
This study was intended to offer a contribution to the available literature about (a)
how the new Framework may serve to influence the ways academic libraries function in
delivering information literacy instruction and (b) the best predictor variables for
perceived level of impact. It may be of interest to stakeholders who are looking at ways
that IL is defined, promoted, and taught in higher education academic libraries. The
results of this study may also serve to initiate and illuminate conversations around the
Framework and how to approach possible implementation.
Research Design
This was a mixed methods study. Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) recommended
the use of a notation system to communicate the complex nature of a mixed methods

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

47

design. Using the notation system of Creswell and Plano Clark, this study's research
design was QUAN (+ qual). This means that quantitative and qualitative data was
collected at the same time (concurrent), but there was more quantitative data collected
than qualitative data. The qualitative data served as a further explication of the larger
collection of quantitative data. See Figure 1 below for an overview of the research design

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

49

Using a two-stage, stratified random sampling method, 186 participants were
recruited. The sample was then surveyed on their perceived impact of the Framework on
library praxes. After survey data was collected, a multiple regression was conducted to
determine possible significant correlations between the DV (perceived impact of the
Framework on library praxes) and the seven IVs: (a) professional position or titles of
participants within the library setting, (b) whether or not the institution offers an ALA
accredited program of study in Library Science, (c) whether or not regional accreditation
agencies use the term IL in their assessment guidelines, (d) current context of library
instructional practices, (e) current use of the IL Competency Standards for Higher
Education, (f) institutional membership in the Association of Research Libraries, and (g)
individual membership in the ACRL.
Measure
According to Yin (2009), surveys answer: who, what, where, how many, and how
much. Surveys do not "require control of behavioral events" and "focus on contemporary
events" (p. 8). According to Creswell (2009), the advantages of using surveys or
questionnaires are "the economy of the design" (simplicity), "rapid turnaround in data
collection" (expedience), and "identifying attributes of a large population from a small
group of individuals" (generalizability) (p. 146).
As of its February 2, 2015 ACRL Board of Director's action to accept the
Framework, no current instruments existed to specifically measure the potential
perceived impact the Framework may or may not have on higher education library
praxes. To that end, an instrument (in the form of a survey) was designed for the purposes
of studying said potential perceived impact. The survey allowed me to make inferences

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

50

about the perceptions of the sample and generalize those inferences to the population
(Creswell, 2009). This was a cross-sectional, self-administered survey; that is, as opposed
to a longitudinal survey, participants will only take it one time and will complete it on
their own (Creswell, 2009).
When writing questions for surveys, Cozby (2009) recommended that a
researcher first consider how each question connects to the research question. Cozby has
three general recommendations for the types of questions a survey should contain:
1) Attitudes and beliefs (perceptions)
2) Factual questions
3) Questions about past and future behaviors
In addition to the specific content considerations, questions need to be simple, using
wording that is easily understandable. Simple wording should result in a participant's
ability to easily respond. This survey included closed-ended and one open-ended
question. Closed-ended questions are used to elicit yes/no responses, multiple choice
responses, or Likert scale indications (in the case of this survey, 7-point scale ranging
from "strongly agree to strongly disagree"). The open-ended question allowed for
participants to respond however they liked within the limit of 500 words per answer.
In order to answer this study's research question(s), the survey was designed
primarily around the language contained within the Framework. The final accepted draft
of the Framework presents assertions and suggestions about how it can be used to guide
changes of higher education library praxes. An assertion is "a firm statement of belief"
(Dictionary of Information and Library Management, 2006) and a suggestion is "an idea
or plan put forward for consideration" (Oxforddictionaries.com, n.d.). An example of an

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

51

assertion in the Framework is: "The Framework redefines the boundaries of what
librarians teach" (Association of College and Research Libraries, January, 2015, p. 14).
An example of a suggestion in the Framework is: "The Framework encourages thinking
about how librarians, faculty, and others can address core or portal concepts"
(Association of College and Research Libraries, January, 2015, p. 14).
The exact wording of assertions and/or suggestions from the Framework was used
in the questions of the survey. The following contains a series of assertions presented in
one complex sentence from the Framework (Association of College and Research
Libraries, January, 2015):
The Framework opens the way for librarians, faculty, and other institutional
partners to redesign instruction sessions, assignments, courses, and even curricula;
to connect information literacy with student success initiatives; to collaborate on
pedagogical research and involve students themselves in that research; and to
create wider conversations about student learning, the scholarship of teaching and
learning, and the assessment of learning on local campuses and beyond. (p. 1)
The following example survey question was derived from the above assertions. It fell
under the beliefs and attitudes (Cozby, 2009) category of questions.
"Please indicate the extent (1 being the lowest, 7 being the highest) you think the
Framework will open the way for librarians, faculty, and other institutional
partners to connect information with student success initiatives at your institution:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7"
An example from the survey that tied in with Cozby's factual questions was: "Does your

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

52

institution offer an American Library Association (ALA) accredited program of studies in
Library and Information Science?" Cozby's past and future behavior type question is
illustrated in the following survey question: "Do you use the ACRL's Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education?" (For the full survey, see
Appendix A). The majority of the closed-ended questions fell under Cozby's beliefs and
attitudes category.
The open-ended question was asked after participants completed the last closedended question on the survey. The last closed-ended question asked participants to rate
the overall level of impact that they perceived the Framework may have on their
institutional library praxes. The open-ended question then asked participants to explain
why they selected that level of impact and to provide examples supporting their answer.
Questions specifically derived from the language of the Framework were used to measure
the DV (the participants' perceived level of impact of the Framework on library praxes).

Validity and reliability. Validity is a broad term referring to the best practices
necessary for the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data (Merriam,
2009). Validity also depends on whether or not a measure does what it is supposed to do
and produces worthwhile inferences from its scores (Creswell, 2009; Powell &
Connaway, 2004; Rosnow & Rosenthal, 2008). Content validity, more specifically,
addresses the actual items being measured—they need to measure what they were
designed to measure. That is, the content of the survey meets the study objectives or
answers the study's research questions (Creswell, 2009; Sproull, 2002). Due to the design

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

57

of the survey, content validity was addressed by using the specific language of the
Framework in the formulation of survey questions—not a reconstruction, rewording, or
reinterpretation of the Framework's language. In order to be confident of validity, a field
test was conducted. Field testing a survey "is important to establish the content
validity of an instrument and to improve questions" (Creswell, 2009, p. 150).
Another important aspect of validity is referred to as face validity. Although often
defined in loose terms, the general idea behind face validity is that the research apparatus
gives the impression that it measures what it claims to measure. Face validity can be
determined by experts in the field of study who are asked to provide opinions regarding
the measurement tool (Powell & Connaway, 2004). For the purposes of determining face
validity, content experts (e.g., library deans, assessment librarians, and instruction
librarians) were asked to field test the survey.
Reliability refers to the internal consistency of a behavioral measure. Reliability
can be assessed by calculating correlation coefficients, a measure of the strength of two
variables' relationship. To test for reliability, two scores from two separate items on the
same measure are correlated. If the items are similar (e.g., assessing the same construct),
the Pearson correlation coefficient should be both high and positive (Cozby, 2009;
Powell & Connaway, 2004). Because the survey for this study assessed perceptions of a
document and not a particular construct (e.g., optimism or creativity), it was anticipated
that content on items would not be completely similar and, therefore, correlation
coefficients between survey items would most likely be moderately related (.50-.70).
Participants
This study sampled 186 academic librarians from higher education institution

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

58

libraries from each of the six accrediting regions. In order to provide a reliable multiple
regression equation, Mertler and Vannatta (2010) recommended a ratio of 15 participants
for every predictor variable (n/k). This study focused on seven variables: (a) positionality
in the library (library deans, assessment librarians, and instruction librarians), (b) whether
or not the institution has a program of study in library science, (c) whether or not regional
accreditation agencies recognize information literacy in their guidelines, (d) current
context of library instructional practices, (e) current use of the former Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, (f) institutional membership in the
Association of Research Libraries (ARL), and (g) individual membership in the
Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL). Therefore, using the n/k
formula proposed by Mertler and Vannatta, a minimum of 105 participants needed to be
recruited.
Variables
The following were the IVs used for the multiple regression analysis:
IV 1: ProfPos: The professional position or titles of participants within the

Study Procedures
While awaiting IRB approval, a directory listing of public and private higher
education institutions within the United States was constructed. The directory listing was
created in the form of a spreadsheet divided into six categories (columns) that

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

60

corresponded to each of the six regional accrediting organizations acknowledged by the
Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Each regional column listed all
public and private institutions categorized according to three Carnegie classifications:
 Research Universities—very high research activity (RU/VH)
 Research Universities—high research activity (RU/H)
 Doctoral/Research Universities (DRU)
Each institution was linked to a subsheet including contact information, website,
Carnegie classification, control (public or private), enrollment, ARL membership, and
degree levels offered. (See Appendix B for an example.) This spreadsheet was used for
the random selection of institutions that were included in the study.
After obtaining permission to conduct the study from the UNM IRB, the
following events took place (Figure 2 at the end of this section provides a high-level view
of the order of study events):
1) A field study was conducted to determine the simplicity, expedience, efficacy,
and internal reliability of the survey instrument. Eight academic librarians from
six institutions (three public and three private) completed the Information
Literacy for Higher Education Survey along with a questionnaire affording
them the opportunity to provide feedback regarding the relevance of the survey
questions and the overall quality of the survey design (see Appendix C). Three
self-identified as library deans, two self-identified as instruction librarians, one
self-identified as a director of library publications, and one self-identified as a
user services librarian. Responses to survey questions were correlated in order
to arrive at an estimate of the survey's reliability.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

61

2) Institutions were randomly selected using a directory listing constructed in the
form of a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet listed all public and private higher
education institutions within the United States, categorized as RU/VH, RU/H
or DRU according to Carnegie Classification. First, public and private
institutions from each of the six accrediting regions were numbered (e.g., if
there were 17 public institutions in the Middle States Commission on Higher
Education accrediting region, those institutions were listed alphabetically and
numbered from 1 to 17). Then a random number generator was used to select
institutions (public and private) from each of the six accrediting regions.
3) To meet the requirements of this study, library deans, assessment librarians,
and instruction librarians were selected for recruitment as potential
participants. They were identified using websites, organizational charts, and
staff listings from the library of each randomly selected institution. When
deans, assessment librarians, or instruction librarians were not listed with
corresponding professional titles on the library websites, organizational charts,
or staff listings, the library was contacted via email or phone call.
4) I forwarded a link to the survey by email to library deans, assessment
librarians, and instruction librarians from the randomly selected institutions. In
the event that participants had questions or concerns, the email invitation
included my contact information. The link provided access to a secure online
survey. Participants opened the link and read a consent form. At the end of the
consent form, they chose whether or not they wanted to participate in the study.
If subjects agreed to participate, they completed the survey.

Data Analysis
Quantitative analyses consisted of the multiple regression and reliability
calculations. The qualitative contribution to the study consisted of the collection and
hallmarking of participants' explanations that they provided to support an overall rating
of perceived impact of the Framework on their institutional library praxes.
Quantitative. Using SPSS, a stepwise multiple regression using forward selection
was conducted using the seven IVs: ProfPos, ALALSci, ILRegAcc, LibPracs, ILStands,
ARLMemb, and ACRLMemb. The DV was PercImp. After calculating bivariate
correlations between the IVs and the DV, the IV with the highest correlation to the DV
was entered first into the analysis. Then the variable with the next highest correlation to
the DV was entered into the analysis, and its contribution to the prediction of the DV was
calculated by measuring the increase in R2. This stepwise process continued until the IVs

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

63

no longer significantly predicted the DV (Mertler & Vannatta, 2010).
Qualitative. Although summaries of the quantitative data revealed general group
findings regarding perceived impact of the Framework on library praxes, they may have
fallen short in communicating individuals' specific rationale—which varied from one
person to another (Thomas, 2003). For the purpose of elucidating these potential
differences, an additional chapter was included in this study. Chapter Five provides
excerpts from the answers given to the open-ended question (Appendix D includes
responses, in their entirety, of all the participants' answers to the open-ended question).
The excerpts were chosen to best illustrate the range of rationales offered by participants.
Excerpts were coded using Wiggins and McTighe's (2005) three problems with content
standards: the overload problem, the Goldilocks problem, and the nebulous problem.
Open coding was also used in order to discover other emerging themes. In so doing, I
gained a more in-depth understanding of participant perceptions. The qualitative data
served to provide further insight for the quantitative analysis and findings.

Quantitative Results
In this chapter I will first provide a brief summary of the quantitative methods
used to analyze the data collected from participants who responded to the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education Survey. Second, the field study results will be
discussed. Third, rationale for making the a priori decision to merge library positionality
into two main categories will be provided. Finally, descriptive statistics and the results of
the multiple regression will be provided.
Summary of Quantitative Research Methods
After selecting participants using a stratified, random sampling method, 186
academic librarians were surveyed to determine the level of impact they perceived that
the Framework would have on library praxes (i.e., the dependent variable or DV). After
survey data was collected, data screening led to the elimination of 26 surveys with
missing data. Then a multiple regression was conducted to determine if any of the
following seven independent variables (IVs) significantly predicted the DV:
1. Professional position or titles of participants within the library setting;
2. Whether or not the institution offers an American Library Association (ALA)
accredited program of study in Library Science;
3. Whether or not regional accreditation agencies use the term IL in their
assessment guidelines;
4. Current context of library instructional practices;
5. Current use of the IL Competency Standards for Higher Education;
6. Institutional membership in the Association of Research Libraries (ARL);

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

65

7. Individual membership in the Association for College and Research Libraries
(ACRL).
Field Study
A field study was conducted to determine the simplicity, expedience, efficacy,
and internal reliability of the survey instrument. Eight academic librarians from six
institutions (three public and three private) completed the survey for Information Literacy
for Higher Education Survey and the feedback survey. Three self-identified as library
deans, two self-identified as instruction librarians, one self-identified as a director of
library publications, and one self-identified as a user services librarian.
In order to test the survey instrument for internal reliability, scores from separate
questions were correlated (e.g., all of the participants' answers on one question were
correlated with all of their answers on another question). On the Likert questions,
correlations ranged from .181 to .872 with a mean of .665 and a median of .703. The
mean indicates that, on average, there were strong correlations between Likert survey
questions, demonstrating good reliability on the Likert items. On the Yes/No questions,
correlations ranged from -.333 to 1.0 with a mean of .439 and a median of .467. The
mean here indicates that, on average, there were moderate correlations between Yes/No
questions, demonstrating moderate reliability on these questions.
There were four questions on the feedback questionnaire included at the end of
the Framework for Information Literacy Survey used for the field study. One participant
did not answer the feedback questions. The first question asked if the Survey was simple
to understand. Of the seven responses, none of the participants chose the response
"Strongly Agree," two chose "Disagree," one chose "No Opinion," three chose "Agree,"

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

66

and one chose "Strongly Agree." One of the participants who chose "Disagree" added a
comment that was about the language of the Framework itself and not about the survey.
"I hate the jargon of threshold concepts and if librarians try to use it with faculty it will
set the profession back professionally a decade..." However, the majority of the
respondents (4/7) agreed that the survey was simple to understand.
The second feedback question asked how long it took to complete the Framework
for Information Literacy Survey. Three participants answered "5 minutes" and three
participants answered "10 minutes." One person answered "Other" but did not specify a
time amount. For six participants, the survey was expedient; it only took between 5-10
minutes to complete.
The third feedback question asked participants to rate the Framework for
Information Literacy Survey's overall quality of design (1 being the lowest, 7 being the
highest). Six people answered this question. One person chose 2; one person chose 4; two
people chose 5; two people chose 6 (M = 4.67). One person who chose 6 as an answer
wrote that "questions were easy to understand and answer." The person who gave it a 2
commented that "design wasn't the issue...focus was wrong...We need assessment
tools..." The high mean on this answer indicated that most participants found the survey's
design effective.
The last question asked participants to add any comments about the Framework
for Information Literacy Survey that they thought might be helpful. Only one person
wrote a comment, and it was not relevant to the survey: "It will be most helpful for
librarians own curriculum doing one shots..." In summary, the majority of the
respondents in the field study found the survey simple, expedient, and effective. Pearson

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

67

correlations determined that the internal reliability of the survey ranged from moderate to
high.
Current Study
Merging positionality categories into "dean" and "non-dean." Thirty-eight
participants out of the 138 participants who read the Framework self-identified as "other".
Twenty-two of the participants who self-identified as "other" did not fit the position of
instruction librarian or assessment librarian or had multiple roles (see Table 2).

Because these 22 participants did not fit into the categories of instruction or
assessment librarian, I was faced with one of three choices. First, I could have created a
fourth category of "other." However, creating a fourth category was not congruent with
Chapter Two, in which it was hypothesized that organizational positionality could impact
perceived organizational readiness for change. The category of "other" does not
necessarily contain information about the participant's position within the hierarchy of
their institution. In #10 of Table 1, the description "Head of Reference Department"
implied a higher position within the institutional hierarchy, but it did not fit into the
definitions of assessment librarians or instruction librarians provided in Chapter One. So,
I would have had to make an arbitrary decision on whether to categorize this participant
as an assessment or instruction librarian. These limitations are further discussed in
Chapter Seven.
My second choice was to eliminate this data, which I did not want to do for two
reasons. First, because of recruitment limitations (the study enrollment limit was 180), I
would not have been able to recruit any more participants. Second, I did not want to
throw this data out because it contained valuable information about the perceptions of
academic librarians who did not fall into the category of assessment or instruction
librarians. Therefore, the third option was chosen. This option entailed making an a priori
(before the analysis) decision to include the data from these 22 surveys by re-categorizing
positions into deans and non-deans.
Quantitative Research Questions
Two quantitative research questions were addressed in this study:
1. What level of impact on academic library praxes do library deans, assessment

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

69

librarians, and instructional librarians perceive that the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education will have?
2. What are the best predictor variables for the perceived level of impact on
academic library praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education will have?
Sample description. A representative sample was randomly selected from the
population of academic librarians. Of the 160 surveys without missing data, 138
participants had read the Framework; 22 had not. Of the 22 respondents who had not read
the Framework, 12 were deans, and 10 were non-deans. Of the 138 participants who had
read the Framework, 32 were deans, and 106 were non-deans. Participants were recruited
equally from both public and private institutions; 80/160 (50%) surveys came from public
institutions and 80 (50%) came from private institutions. Participants were recruited
across the six accreditation regions (see Table 3).

program of science; 135 (84%) currently used the Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education; 19 (12%) worked at an institution with membership in
the Association of Research Libraries (ARL); 113 (71%) were members of the
Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL; see Table 4 for a sample

Note. This table includes data from participants who have not read the Framework.
Out of the 138 participants who read the Framework, and thus were included in
the multiple regression, 11 (29%; 2 deans and 9 non-deans) worked at an institution that
offered an ALA accredited program of science; 121 (88%; 28 deans and 93 non-deans)
currently used the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education; 16
(12%; 2 deans and 14 non-deans) worked at an institution with membership in the ARL;
101 (73%; 25 deans and 76 non-deans) were members of the ACRL. In summary, the
majority of respondents came from institutions that did not offer an ALA accredited
program of science, currently used the IL Competency Standards, did not work at
institutions with an ARL membership, and were members of the ACRL.
Out of the 160 participants who completed surveys without missing data, 125
(78%) worked at institutions where the majority of IL instruction was offered in the
context of "one-shot" sessions; 11 (7%) offered IL in the context of an orientation for
incoming first-year students; 11 (7%) offered IL in the context of both one-shot sessions
and orientation; 13 (8%) offered IL in the context of a credit-bearing general education
requirement.

Note. This table includes data from participants who have not read the Framework.
Out of the 138 participants who read the Framework, and thus were included in
the multiple regression, 107 (78%; 23 deans and 84 non-deans) worked at institutions
where the majority of IL instruction was offered in the context of one-shot sessions; 10
(7%; 3 deans and 7 non-deans) offered IL in the context of an orientation for incoming
first-year students; 10 (7%; 1 dean and 9 non-deans); 11 (8%; 5 deans and 6 non-deans)
offered IL in the context of a credit-bearing general education requirement. It is clear that
the majority of IL instruction—in the institutions where these surveys originated—was
offered in the context of one-shot sessions.
Descriptive statistics. There has been considerable controversy in the literature
about how to analyze Likert scales. Jamieson (2004), the author of a widely-quoted
article, argued that Likert scales are ordinal, that is, "the intervals between values can not

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

73

be presumed equal" (p. 1217). Therefore, means, standard deviations, and parametric
tests (e.g., correlations, ANOVAs, multiple regressions) are inappropriate, only the
median and mode should be given in descriptive statistics, and only nonparametric tests
(e.g., chi square) should be used. Other researchers, like Carifio and Perla (2008),
reasoned that while Likert questions may be ordinal, Likert scales that are summed over
many items can be considered as interval and analyzed as such. Then there are
researchers like Norman (2010) who stated that if "numbers [on a Likert scale] are
reasonably distributed, we can make inferences about their means, differences, or
whatever" (p. 629). Norman argued for the robustness of parametric tests, or the degree
to which a test will provide the correct answer even when there are violations of
assumptions. Norman also recently confirmed the results of Havlicek and Peterson's
(1976) simulation study with theoretical distributions. Havlicek and Peterson concluded
that "the Pearson r is insensitive to rather extreme violations of the basic assumptions of
normality and the type of scale" (p. 1332). In due respect to all camps, I presented the
mean, standard deviation (SD), mode and median for both individual Likert questions and
scales in the following tables and figures. Mean is the average score; SD is the square
root of the variance, or the mean of squares of deviations from the mean; mode is the
number that appears most frequently in a number set; and median is the middle value in a
number set.
Table 6 presents descriptive statistics for three Likert scales in the survey—Likert
questions that are summed over several items.

The first scale in Table 6 sums six of the Likert questions; it does not include
question 21 on the Framework's overall impact. Possible high for this total scale of Likert
questions is 49). The second scale sums all of the assertions, or statements of belief.
There were four assertion Likert questions. Possible high for the assertion scale of Likert
questions is 28. An example of an assertion in the Framework is: "The Framework
redefines the boundaries of what librarians teach" (Association of College and Research
Libraries, January, 2015, p. 14). The third scale sums all of the suggestions, or ideas
presented for consideration. There were two suggestion Likert questions. Possible high
for the suggestion scale is 14. An example of a suggestion in the Framework is: "The
Framework encourages thinking about how librarians, faculty, and others can address
core or portal concepts" (Association of College and Research Libraries, January, 2015,
p. 14).

There were seven Likert and six Yes/No questions on the survey. Each Likert
question asked participants to "indicate the extent (1 being the lowest, 7 being the

overall extent (1 being the lowest, 7 being the highest) you think the Framework will
impact library practices at your institution." Yes/No questions on the survey all started
with: "Do you think the Framework will..." A "No" answer was scored as "1" and a "Yes"
answer was scored as "2." The following Figures (3 through 28) present response
summaries and response percentages for each question asked in the survey.

**Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).
Two IVs were significantly correlated with each other: ARLMemb and ALALSci
(r = .311; p < .01). Those institutions with an ARL membership were more likely to also
have an accredited ALA program of study in Library Science. One IV was significantly
correlated with the outcome variable: Professional position in the library setting or
ProfPos (r = - .185; p < .05). This correlation is negative because the dean position was
given a value of one and the non-dean position was given a value of two; so, the dean
position (with a lower numerical value) was negatively correlated with higher perceived
impact of the Framework on library praxes. ALALSci, or whether or not the institution
offers an ALA accredited program of study in Library Science, was the next variable
most highly correlated with PercImp, or the perceived impact of the Framework on

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

91

library praxes (r = -.095; p > .05). This is also a negative correlation because institutions
without a library science program were given a value of zero, while institutions with a
library science program were given a value of one; so, institutions without a library
science program (with a lower numerical value) were negatively correlated with higher
perceived impact of the Framework on library praxes.
Multiple regression. A stepwise multiple regression using forward selection was
conducted to determine whether or not using the seven IVs (listed at the beginning of this
chapter) significantly predicted participant answers to Question 21 on the survey about
the overall impact of the Framework on library praxes [PercImp]. ProfPos was the only
independent variable that was significantly correlated with PercImp (r =-.185; p < .05)
and so was entered into the analysis. However, this correlation, while significant, was
still very small, indicating a very weak linear relationship. Regression results indicated
that ProfPos significantly predicted perceived impact of the Framework on library praxes,
R2 = .034, R2adj = .027, F(1, 136) = 4.853, p < .03, but it only accounted for a very small
amount of the variance—3.4%—in perceived impact of the Framework. Thus, the
multiple regression did not answer the second research question (the best predictor
variables for the perceived level of impact on library praxes that the Framework will
have) and, as such, was dropped from the analysis.
Summary of Quantitative Results
A representative sample was randomly selected from the population of academic
librarians. Participants were recruited equally from both public and private institutions
and from six accreditation regions. The majority of the participants came from
institutions that did not offer an ALA accredited program of science, currently used the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

92

IL Competency Standards, did not work at institutions with an ARL membership, were
members of the ACRL, and worked at institutions where IL instruction was mainly
offered in the context of one-shot sessions.
Descriptive statistics for Questions 9 through 20 showed that the level of impact
chosen most frequently (i.e., the mode) was moderate to moderately high (i.e., a "4" or a
"5") for the Likert questions and "Yes" for the Yes/No questions. The significant
correlation between profession position and the Framework's perceived impact (Question
21) indicated that deans are more likely to give the Framework a higher level of overall
impact than non-deans. On average, deans gave the Framework a moderately high rating
on level of overall impact, and non-deans gave the Framework a moderate rating of
overall impact. However, if the entire sample is included, the average participant
perceived the Framework to have a moderately high level of impact on their library
praxes.

but the top hat on my head is all you see
And the wire seems to be
the only place for me...
—Leon Russell
In this chapter, I will address the qualitative research question posed for this
study:
How do academic library deans, assessment librarians, and instructional
librarians explain their perceptions of the level of impact on academic library
praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education will
have?
Qualitative data consisted of answers to Question 22. While this question was
open-ended in the sense that participants were free to say what they wanted about the
Framework, it was bounded by the question preceding it. Question 21 asked participants
to indicate the level of overall impact the Framework would have on library praxes at
their institution. Question 22 then asked participants to explain and provide examples of
why they selected that particular level. Placing the question at the end of the survey may

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

94

have primed participants to use the words and concepts of the Framework and/or the
survey in their answers to Question 22. For example, one participant wrote: "How would
you assess a student's ability to 'understand that many disciplines have acknowledged
authorities in the sense of well-known scholars and publications?' This problem is
rampant in the Framework whether the focus is on knowledge practices or dispositions
[emphasis mine]." The exact words "knowledge practices or dispositions" can be found in
Question 17 of the survey, as well as in the Framework. So, it can be surmised that this
participant was either very well-acquainted with the Framework or had been primed to
use the specific language that s/he chose to use for Question 22. Further examples of how
participant responses echo specific words and phrases from the Framework and/or the
survey are provided in Chapter Six.
The story of this qualitative data is one of characters without names, without
sexes, and without ages. It is a simple story of academic librarians—of deans and nondeans. All we really know about these characters is that they must have had some interest
in the Framework, or they would not have taken the time to answer the survey. The
quantitative story in Chapter Four was rather dry—a story of numerical values and
correlations. Perhaps the reader will allow me to move away from those numbers, at least
for a little while, and concentrate instead on words. It stands to reason, considering that
the qualitative data was, simply put, words. These were words written by characters
without names, without faces, without sex, and without age. Much like the bones an
archaeologist meticulously dusts off, the words used by the participants to answer the last
survey question were the artifacts that I examined and analyzed.

Content Analysis
The process of content analysis—of searching for meaning in qualitative data
(Merriam, 2009)—is similar to the analysis of a poem.
so much depends
upon
a red wheel

—William Carlos Williams
A "simple" poem like this can be interpreted in an endless variety of ways. It could be
presented to a panel of scholars who have devoted their entire careers to the interpretation
of poetry and, after discussing it for hours on end, may or may not end up agreeing on its
meaning. The poem could be presented to children who, much like the scholars, may
have completely different responses to it. Someone could read and reread this poem over
the course of a lifespan, interpreting it differently each time.
Perhaps a resolution to this question of the poem's meaning could be achieved if
William Carlos Williams was alive and able to dialogue with his readers. However, even
if Williams was still with us, he may not agree with anyone's interpretation, as the work
of a poet is so very personal. The reality is that he is dead and unable to either agree or
disagree with his readers' differing interpretations. The poem remains, nevertheless, as a
disembodied message from the poet. It will likely continue to be a source of lively
discussion for centuries to come.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

The participants in this study are all, hopefully, alive and well. Their responses
are, nonetheless, disembodied. From across the United States, from institutions large and
small, public and private, their responses reflected thoughts and opinions tapped out on
keyboards connected to computers and sent through the ether to a disembodied
researcher. My analysis of their responses was like a séance of sorts, but not in a morbid
sense. It was necessary for me to raise these voices from the disembodied bare text, to
converse with them, and hear them talking to each other in order for me to better
understand the meaning of their responses.
The conversation begins. Open coding is a process described by Merriam (2009)
as "having a conversation with the data, asking questions of it, making comments to it,
and so on" (p. 178). Granted, a conversation with the data would eventually occur. But,
like any other conversation, someone had to be the initiator. In this case, I initiated the
conversation by emailing invitations to potential participants who worked at institutions
that had been randomly selected for this study.
Because I am aware of the oftentimes seemingly cold and impersonal nature of
email correspondence, I carefully worded the invitation to impart, as best as possible, a
high level of collegiality, friendliness, openness, and trustworthiness. The invitation
included an introduction of myself as a doctoral student, investigating the impact that the
Framework may have on academic library practices. I provided specific contact
information for myself, as well as the Office of the Institutional Review Board, in the
event that participants had any questions regarding the study. I assured potential
participants that this would be an anonymous survey and any identifying data would be
kept completely confidential. The invitation also contained information about how the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

97

results of the study would be used in my dissertation and possible future publications.
Knowing that the potential participants were fellow librarians, I attempted to engage
them through the prospect of a shared interest; I indicated that the findings from this
project would, hopefully, inform academic librarians and other stakeholders about how
the Framework may influence academic library practices.
Unlike celebratory invitations to birthdays, weddings, graduations, etc., that one
might still find, even today, in their home mailbox, email invitations designed to recruit
participants to take an online survey are often immediately deleted, saved for another
time, lost in junk mail, seen as a burden, or simply forgotten in the rush of the day's
activities. Being aware of these pitfalls is essential when wording the subject line for a
survey on which so much depends. The subject line I ended up using was informed by
my knowledge that academic librarians across the United States probably had a great deal
of familiarity with, and interest in, information literacy. I also knew that academic
librarians would be inclined to help a student pursue scholarly goals. So, my subject line
was: "Please Help Me Complete My Dissertation: Information Literacy Survey." I
wanted the subject line to grab their attention so that they would actually open the email
and read my invitation. I knew that if the email was opened, it would create an
opportunity for me to "break the ice" and begin the conversation.
The conversation develops. The conversation began as an invitation to take the
Framework for Information Literacy Survey. However, at this point in the process, it was
only a one-sided conversation. That is to say, I opened the conversation but potential
participants had to click the link provided in my email to accept my invitation. The only
way I knew that the conversation was going to become two-sided was by going to the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

98

survey site to see if any new surveys had been completed. Every day, I checked my email
to see if anyone had contacted me and then I checked the survey site to see if I had any
new surveys. It was a constant, day-to-day process. Sometimes I would see that someone
had begun a survey, but had then stopped at a certain point before completing all the
questions. Sometimes I got an email from a potential participant, asking me about my
deadline and if they could fill out the survey the next day. It was very rare that I got any
emails and I never got any phone calls. There was very little interaction between myself
and the participants, beyond whether or not they had completed the survey. This whole
process lasted about six weeks—of sending out invitations and then seeing if they wanted
to continue the conversation by completing the survey. When I finally reached my sample
size, I stopped sending invitations, closed the survey, and was ready to begin looking at
their side of the conversation.
The dangling conversation.
It's a still life water color,
Of a now late afternoon,
As the sun shines through the curtain lace
And shadows wash the room.
And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference,
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs,
The borders of our lives.
—Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel
I thought that once I had finished data collection and the quantitative analysis was
complete, I could finally find out what participants thought of the Framework. While I
looked forward to reading words instead of crunching numbers, I did not realize initially
that I was approaching the qualitative data in the same way that I had approached the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

99

quantitative data. I checked and rechecked my data to make sure that I had entered it
correctly. I went back to the survey site to see if the identifying information matched the
quantitative answers and the qualitative responses. I counted and recounted my
qualitative responses to make sure that I had not left any out. This quantitative approach
continued throughout the coding process (see Appendix E for the quantitative approach to
the qualitative data); I was preoccupied with tallying up and counting the number of
responses for each theme. How many deans said this? What percentage of non-deans said
that?
Then it gradually dawned on me that I was not conversing with the data, as
Merriam (2009) recommended, during the process of open coding. This was not a
conversation or a "meeting of the minds"; this was more like Simon and Garfunkel's
dangling conversation. There was no give-and-take here; the participants' responses were
just a bunch of answers to a question, each one dangling in the spreadsheets I had so
carefully constructed and checked many times for accuracy. Simon and Garfunkel's
phrase "couched in our indifference" described me as a researcher at this point.
I began to realize that there needed to be a shift or transition from the quantitative
way of looking at things—from the impersonal world of proliferating numbers, lengthy
equations and sterile statistical tests, from the third person point of view where the
researcher is an objective observer, far removed from the data. This realization or
transformation was not a "top-of-the-mountain," "struck-by-lightning" experience of
sudden insight. It was a gradual realization, one that continued throughout the qualitative
analysis. Unlike my distant stance during the quantitative analysis, I slowly began to
understand that I needed to immerse myself into the data. I had to separate myself from

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

100

the sterile statistical world and immerse myself in the very personal world of words and
sentences. I had to leave the black-and-white world of Dorothy's Kansas and plunge into
the colorful Land of Oz, with its poetry, song, and rich detail.
I thought about Simon and Garfunkel's lines, "Like shells upon the shore, you can
hear the ocean roar." I recognized that all of my participants were like shells upon the
shore. To interact with a shell, a person has to hold it up to their ear, listen carefully, and
then they can hear the ocean roar. I realized that, up until now in the data analysis, I had
not been listening carefully to the participants—that this was a dangling conversation
because I was not personally involved.
Listening to the participants. To understand how I could have a conversation
with the data, I went back to Merriam (2009):
The process begins with reading...the first document collected in the study. As
you read..., you jot down notes, comments, observations, and queries in the
margins. These notations are next to bits of data that strike you as interesting,
potentially relevant, or important to your study. Think of yourself as having a
conversation with the data, asking questions of it, making comments to it, and so
on. This process of making notations next to bits of data that strike you as
potentially relevant for answering your research questions is also called coding.
(p. 178)
And so I began my conversation with the data with a simple, symbolic response to the
participant's answers. I put pluses and minuses after each response to indicate if it was
positive or negative about the Framework's impact. For example, the first response I
coded was a plus: "The framework has already impacted how I work with the first year

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

101

writing faculty and how the library fits into their curriculum and outcomes." The next
response I read was a minus: "The institution does not have much appetite for
requirements and standards when it comes to IL." I continued until I had assigned a plus
or minus to each of the responses.
Development of themes. "After working through the entire transcript in this
manner, you go back over your marginal notes and comments (codes) and try to group
those comments and notes that seem to go together" (Merriam, 2009, p. 179). During my
next reading, I examined the responses more closely, looking for similarities and
dissimilarities. I began to group the participant's answers, creating codes or themes to
organize them.
The germination of many of the themes came directly out of the participant's
actual responses. This is also known as in-vivo coding, or the practice of coding a short
excerpt with a word or phrase from the data. For example, the code "jargon" came from
one participant's use of the word. "The framework uses a lot of education jargon. I am
still trying to make sense of the document and jargon, so I can imagine the difficult time a
non-education faculty member will have." Other respondents used words or phrases
similar to jargon (e.g., "wordy overblown document," "the language used in the
Framework alienated many librarians," and "It's just a bunch of words that make no sense
to most people") and so their excerpts were also coded as "jargon."
Seeing qualitative responses as dialogue. There were some responses that
puzzled me because the meaning of the participant's words was unclear. For example, this
participant wrote:

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

102

I think the librarians at my institution, as well as elsewhere, have long known
information literacy doesn't need to be taught in the very structured Standards and
that the Framework is really just describing the sea [of] change of thinking about
these things that has already occurred.
I wondered what this participant was saying about the Standards and the Framework.
Were they criticizing the "very structured Standards" and implying that the Framework
needed to replace the Standards? What exactly was the "sea [of] change of thinking" that
the Framework described?
It was at this point in the analysis that I began to become frustrated. To see into
the hearts and minds of academic librarians looked like it was going to be impossible due
to the non-personal and non-interactive nature of the communication. One of the
limitations of this study was the inability to do member checking. Because of the
protocol, I could not follow up with the participants on their responses—to ask them, "Is
this what you were saying?"
So, I felt as if there was no way to communicate with these disembodied voices.
The conversation had begun with my invitation; it became a two-sided conversation when
participants completed surveys; it developed as I interacted with the data, reading and
coding their responses, but now—because I could not go outside the confines of the study
to further contact these people—I felt like the conversation had come to a dead halt.
Once again, the conversation seemed to be dangling. Just like the blinking text
cursor on my computer screen as I read and reread the data, the responses seemed to be
waiting for me to interact with them. And just like the last words someone said in a
conversation often repeat themselves over and over in the mind, taking on ever-deeper

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

103

layers of meaning, I began to hear the many voices of the participants. Their voices, at
this point, were like cobweb whispers in the corners of my mind that I could barely hear.
I decided it was time to go back to the responses. The first time I had read them, it
seemed like all the participants were expressing either like or dislike of the Framework.
During this reading, I began to wonder—is the data really as dichotomous as this? When
I reread the participants responses, they were not just positive or negative comments
about the Framework's impact; many seemed to contain both positive and negative
statements. I also began to realize that this was not the best way to analyze them—as
stand-alone responses. These people had answered the survey because they were
interested in the topic and had probably already participated in conversations with their
colleagues about the Framework. The sentences they wrote in their answers to Question
22 were most likely very similar to opinions they had already voiced to other librarians.
They participated in the survey, taking the time to write out their thoughts, because they
knew their words might possibly be read by other librarians someday. They wanted to
contribute to the national conversation among academic librarians about the Framework.
So, I started to read the responses aloud (to the chagrin of my wife who woke up
to hear her husband talking to the computer on many a late evening or early morning). I
discovered when I read them aloud, the responses took on the quality of a dialogue in a
face-to-face environment—like students in a class, discussing an important concept. Or
like professionals in a lounge, talking during a coffee break, discussing this thing called
the Framework.
Then I began to rearrange the participant's responses in relation to each other.
Here was where the séance truly began. I raised these disembodied voices from the white

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

104

screen of my computer into a virtual chat room so that the participants could begin to
converse with each other. Arranging their responses in this manner allowed me to
become a part of the conversation, almost as if I were a moderator, facilitating a forum or
discussion. Now I could see there were two groups of participants; one group was having
a discussion about the advantages of the Framework, and one was conversing about the
Framework's challenges. I went from one group to the other, listening to the conversation
and pointing out to the participants that some of them were discussing some of the same
advantages or challenges. After a while, the conversation seemed to, once more, grind to
a dead halt. There did not seem to be anything else to say.
It felt like something was still dangling, something was still missing. I could look
at my coding now and see the large themes and subthemes that had emerged. I could
explain why some responses were coded as advantages and why some were coded as
challenges. But what did it all mean? What was the data really saying? How does a
qualitative researcher know when to stop the analysis? I thought the process would be
over when thematic analysis was complete. But something was still missing—the biggest
theme of all.
Once again I read the responses aloud, now arranged as an ongoing dialogue
between librarians. Something new began to emerge. I started to notice opposing ideas
and themes. I became aware that some of the librarians were saying exactly the opposite
of each other. I perceived also that some of the participants spoke of both advantages and
challenges, and not just one or the other.
And that is when the dialectic occurred to me. I remembered that when I taught
Honors English to ninth graders years ago, I had often discussed the dialectic with my

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

105

class. In every story, in every poem, and in every play that I had read and talked about to
my students, the dialectic was there. I assigned Bob Dylan's song "Isis" to my class,
asking them to find and discuss the dialectic in his lyrics; "I came to a high place of
darkness and light..." I used the dialectic to explain the tragic relationship of Romeo and
Juliet. This theme appears throughout classic literature, even in the simple poem of "Jack
and Jill." Things contain opposites—both between individuals and within them.
Everything contains conflict. These were concepts with which I was very familiar.
The definition of the word dialogue is "a discussion or series of discussions that
two groups or countries have in order to end a disagreement" (www.merriamwebster.com, n.d.). Thus the use of the word "dialogue" implies disagreement, or the
dialectic. So, if I created a dialogue between participants, then there must be a dialectic.
Ultimately the synthesis of the qualitative data brought me to an understanding of the
overall thematic pattern in my qualitative data—the discovery of the dialectic.
The dialectic. The dialectic is the "tension or opposition between two interacting
forces or elements" (www.merriam-webster.com, n.d.). The dialectical process is most
commonly attributed to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, an eighteenth-century
philosopher of the Enlightenment. For Hegel, the progression of human thought and
consciousness depended upon the dialectic—a philosophical process of investigating
opposing ideas wherein first the thesis (a statement or theory) arises, and then the
antithesis—which contradicts the thesis—follows. Tension between the two ideas is
resolved by way of synthesis, which is then contradicted by another thesis, and the
process continues until the final truth is realized (Morrell, 2008).
The dialectic in the qualitative data can be seen in the two overarching themes

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

106

that emerged in my analysis: Advantages and Challenges of the Framework. Figure 29
illustrates a balance between these two themes in the amount of participant responses. 73
of the responses referred to perceived Advantages of the Framework, and 77 of the
responses referred to perceived Challenges of the Framework.

Figure 30 presents the number of deans and non-deans who perceived Advantages

while 59 non-deans and 18 deans wrote about Challenges. Here again there is a balance
between both the total numbers of each group (57 and 59; 16 and 18). Yet, it is not a
perfect balance; both groups wrote a little bit more about the Challenges of the
Framework than the Advantages.

Figure 30. Perceived Advantages and Challenges of the Framework according to library
position.
Perhaps one explanation of why there was a roughly equal division of responses
about advantages and challenges was because the survey did not ask the participant if
they liked the Framework or if they were satisfied with it—it just asked benign questions
about its potential impact. Social desirability bias, or a participant's effort to answer
questions the way they think others would answer or possibly the way they think others
would want them to answer (Cozby, 2009) was not much of a limitation in this study.
Maybe participants felt they could answer honestly because they were assured that their
responses would remain anonymous, allowing them to freely express an opinion about
their own rating.
Thematic exemplars of the dialectic in responses. After coding all of the
responses, I noticed the total number of Advantage responses and Challenge responses
(see Figures 29 and 30). I did not have 150 participants, so some of their answers must
have contained both advantages and challenges. This was more than a simple

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

108

dichotomy—a static polarization or division between two opposing groups. Responses
that contained both advantages and challenges represented the dialectic.
In China, the concept of the dialect is known as yin-yang, and is graphically
represented by the familiar yin-yang symbol wherein the dark contains a small circle of
light, and the light contains a small circle of dark. The two opposing forces are balanced,
complementary, and interconnected (see Figure 31).

Figure 31. Yin-yang as representation of the dialectic.
Here are two examples of responses that contain the yin-yang; they reference both
advantages and challenges of the Framework. One person wrote: "The recent wellpublicized critiques of the framework have led some of my colleagues to be skeptical
about the framework's utility, though we did use it to redesign the course objectives for
our credit bearing IL course." This excerpt was coded as the Advantage theme Helps
Academic Librarians Design IL Instruction/Programs and as the Challenge theme Lack
of Commitment from Academic Librarians. The tension between opposing sides of the
yin-yang is balanced in this response because there is one advantage and one challenge.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

109

Another person wrote:
The framework repositions information literacy as transferable skills. Most of our
faculty are not aware of the many topics we teach, presuming that we only cover
"how to search." The new framework enables faculty to envision research as a
critical thinking process rather than a set of procedural tasks. That being said, our
library developed an instructional program that follows the new framework a few
years ago, so it may not change our instructional approach as much as it will
legitimize our instructional approach.
This excerpt was coded with three Advantage themes (Conceptual Lens, Supporting
Philosophy, and Currently Integrating) and one Challenge theme (IL is Separate from
Disciplines). So, in this response, there is a small circle of Challenge within the larger
spiral of Advantages.
The end of the analysis. I began this analysis with simple plus and minus
symbols, and I ended the analysis with the yin-yang symbol. While the dialectic and the
yin-yang provided the closure I needed for the analysis, it also created the vehicle needed
to present the findings. Like the lines in William Butler Yeats' poem, "The Second
Coming":
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer,
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.
The yin-yang symbol can be considered a design of two interlocking spirals. In Yeats'
poem, the center of the gyre or spiral "cannot hold." It curves in toward the center point
until it can go no further, and then it begins to spiral out. So too did my analysis. I
proceeded with the coding until I reached a synthesis—the one, overarching thematic

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

110

pattern in my data was the dialectic. Now that I have reached that point, I will begin to
spiral out again, like the arms of the Milky Way galaxy, presenting the star clusters or
themes along the way as I return to the infinity of the universe.
The Findings
Up until this point in the séance, I had raised the participants' voices from the
computer screen so that they could talk first with me and then with each other. Now it is
time for the participants' voices to be heard by the reader. It is time for the reader to hear
the voices that spoke most loudly to me. The remainder of this chapter is a presentation
of findings, the themes I discovered in the analysis along with exemplars of the theme—
an entire response or an excerpt from a response that I chose because it laid the
foundation for the building of the theme. Each Advantage theme is juxtaposed with one
or more Challenge themes. In other words, after the presentation of each Advantage
theme and its exemplars, I will present one or more Challenge counter themes. This gives
the reader a front row seat, as it were, to listen as the participants speak to one another
about the Framework. (See Appendix E for numbers and percentages of deans and nondeans whose excerpts were coded with specific themes.)
Advantage: Helps academic librarians design IL instruction/programs.
Imagine yourself, reader, sinking into your virtual seat, a comfortable one with velveteen
cushions and armrests. Put your feet up on the footstool in front of you. Now, listen to the
participants. Under the cloak of anonymity, their voices all sound alike. Their names,
their ages, their sex, and their positions cannot be determined. Every voice is of equal
weight, of equal merit. Only their message, presented in the black-and-white silence of
the computer screen, can be heard in your imagination on the pages that follow.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

111

You will also hear my voice as the moderator who introduces, explains,
illuminates, and connects the voices with each other. Sometimes, in order to enhance the
feeling of being in a conversation, I will refer to gestures that I imagine the participants to
be making, such as nodding or shaking their heads. I will also place them in the
imaginary setting of a cafeteria, where the librarians sit around tables and talk to each
other while they drink coffee or eat their lunch. Since this is a cafeteria big enough to seat
138 people, there is also a microphone set up for participants who want to address the
whole group.
The first voice I introduce to you is talking about two theoretical constructs that
are important in the field of information literacy. One of them is a key conceptual
element of the Framework. This voice tells us that threshold concepts are helping their
institution redesign an orientation course, "Folks interested and involved in redesigning
our first year experience course are all about threshold concepts. They want to include
'critical information literacy' into this curriculum, and using the Framework as a way to
do this work makes sense."
Critical information literacy is the second theoretical concept mentioned by this
participant. This is an approach that examines the underlying power structures of the
production of information (Matthews & Swanson, 2015). The term critical information
literacy is not specifically referenced in the Framework. However, in an interview about
the value of critical IL, Troy Swanson, a member of the ACRL Task Force, stated his
opinion that the Framework is more "in line with critical practice than most other
definitions of IL" (para. 16). Apparently, as evidenced by this participant's response,
there are institutions using the Framework to integrate critical pedagogy into their IL

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

112

curriculum.
A chorus of voices now join in with this participant, intoning that the Framework
has helped redesign their curriculum and plan their instruction. As the chorus ends, one
voice can be heard saying clearly, "The faculty in the library department at my institution
are already rethinking their approaches to instruction based on their exploration of the
Framework. This will continue to happen going forward."
Challenge: Fundamental skills first. In contrast to the many voices who said the
Framework helped with the design of IL programs, three voices now speak, expressing
the idea that fundamental skills need to be addressed before the Framework can be
implemented into IL instruction. The first voice says simply, "Since my library mostly
teaches 'one-shot' sessions, we only have time to cover the most basic concepts about
using the library." In "one-shot" sessions, as discussed in Chapter Two, the librarian is
little more than an assistant to the course instructor, a visitor who seldom gets to see how
students apply the skills they are attempting to teach. Within these limitations (e.g., time
constraints and the librarian's primary role as guest lecturer), it is difficult for librarians to
develop a comprehensive program for IL.
Now listen to a voice that expresses the idea that undergraduates are not ready to
understand the abstractions of the Framework:
The Framework is an abstract concept, and you have to be fairly adept as a
researcher before you can understand the abstraction. An undergraduate is
not going to connect with the concepts of the framework. So, what do you have to
do in order to help them make that connection? You have to help them learn the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

113

fundamental research skills before they will be able to think of research at a
higher level.
And a third voice also speaks to the concern that librarians are spending most of their
time trying to get students to master fundamental research skills:
Individual librarians may find a few receptive faculty to work on a broader
integration of the framework and its threshold concepts, etc., but most of the
librarians are still trying to get our students to the most basic level of info lit. I
don't think the framework will have much impact here.
While few in numbers, these three voices are strong, articulating a very practical
argument against the Framework's potential impact. Librarians, especially those who
spend the majority of their time teaching "one-shot" sessions, are struggling to teach
students simple research skills, such as how to find and use the databases their library
provides.
Challenge: Difficulty with "one-shot" instruction. Two voices now queue up to
the microphone, both wanting to add to the discussion of another challenge. How can
they implement the Framework into "one-shot" sessions, where, due to time limitations,
library instruction is usually restricted to the hows of using research tools, rather than on
the whys of using them. The first librarian echoes what other voices have already said
about the need to address fundamental skills first, "I think that our librarians will use the
new Framework to guide our instruction practices, but the nature of our instruction (one
shots) means that most instruction is still skill-based." The second voice speaks about
feeling a little overwhelmed by the challenge of integrating the Framework into their oneshots:

We are not yet sure how we could use the Framework to support our one-shot
instruction sessions. The Framework is a little overwhelming and intimidating,
so I am unsure that it will really be embraced or change how we do our one-shot
classes.
Challenge: Minimal impact on instruction. Unlike the last voice, who sounds
willing to try integrating the Framework into their one-shot sessions, but unsure as to
exactly how to do this, the next voices do not communicate either a willingness to
implement the Framework or an optimism that it will have anything but a minimal impact
on instruction. "The Framework is really of very little use at our institution," says one
voice. Another voice chimes in, "I think it will impact some librarians, but I don't think
the institution, in general, cares at all about information literacy." A third voice seems a
little more reflective, "Initial conversations with my colleagues, as well as my in-depth
reading and thinking about the Framework, do indicate it has some potential to adjust
some instruction, but overall not with all librarians or not in large ways." A last voice
speaks about how the Framework promoted the value of IL and their institution was
currently integrating it into their library practices, "but will not significantly change
them."
Advantage: Encourages discussion. Now, listen as these people speak about
another advantage of the Framework. In contrast to those who said they thought the
Framework would have a minimal impact on instruction, this voice says, "The
Framework will have some influence on directing the discussion of and in planning for
information literacy instruction." Other voices now begin to speak of the Framework's
usefulness in encouraging conversations on how to interpret and integrate the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

115

Framework. "The Framework helps us talk with faculty and students about the
complexities of information and the skills needed to navigate an information-laden
world," says one voice. Nodding in agreement with this participant, another voice adds,
"The Framework offers worthwhile discussion points and serves as a useful document to
contextualize the foundation of what we are talking about when we talk about
information literacy."
Challenge: Translating theory into practice. While the last two people spoke,
other participants shook their heads, disagreeing with the idea that the Framework helped
them talk with faculty and students about IL. "The framework is very theoretical and hard
to explain to faculty in a 'sound bite' which is about all they have time to listen to," says
this voice. The next voice both agrees and disagrees with the idea that the Framework
encourages discussion, revealing the dialectic in their response, "While the Framework
and its underlying theories are excellent discussion topics for professional librarians and
disciplinary faculty, they do not translate information literacy concepts to students any
better than the standards already do." These librarians are expressing a common theme—
one of the challenges of implementing the Framework is that it is difficult to translate
theory into practice. A last voice speaks to this theme, saying that the Framework "is
great idealistic theory but does not seem to translate effectively into actual instruction."
Advantage: Supports academic librarian collaboration with discipline
faculty. Ignoring these voices of dissent, other librarians want to return to the previous
theme of how the Framework was useful in encouraging discussion with discipline
faculty. They disagreed with the idea that the Framework's language was too theoretical
to explain. This voice says the Framework "enlivens librarian discussions about what

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

116

we're doing. Gives us an opportunity to discuss IL on campus in a language that some
departmental faculty are familiar with." Another voice also speaks about how the
the helpfulness of the Framework language—in contrast to the Standards—was useful in
supporting collaboration with discipline faculty:
The Framework gives us language to talk about information literacy beyond
the standards which were almost more of a process - if you do step one, step
two, and so on, you are information literate.
One last voice speaks with enthusiasm about how the Framework had made it possible
for them to share ideas with discipline faculty:
It's already made an impact, we've designed our curriculum around it, and we use
it in our assessment practices, and it came at a time when the University as a
whole was working on these things, so librarians have been invited to speak to
other faculty about how we are using this framework, and those talks have been
well received.
Challenge: Collaboration between academic librarians and discipline faculty.
Other voices want to join the conversation now. These voices are not sure how much the
Framework will impact their institution because it would depend on collaboration
between academic librarians and discipline faculty. "I think the Framework has the
potential to transform information literacy instruction, but the incorporation at the
institution will depend on the willingness and openness of teaching faculty," says one
voice. Agreeing with this person, another participant says, "The overall extent of impact
directly ties to whether or not librarians make it their top priority when working with
teaching faculty."

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

117

Challenge: Lack of collaboration. While these last voices were unsure about
future collaboration between academic librarians and discipline faculty, the next librarian
expresses a feeling of marginality at their institution—a perception that information
literacy is not considered an important part of the curriculum and that librarians are seen
as secondary or peripheral. That sense of marginality can be heard by this participant,
"It's not easy to engage faculty in discussions about information literacy because many
perceive it as an education fad, or they are trying to cover content and don't see librarians
as partners with their curriculum." The next person also speaks about a lack of
collaboration with faculty, but for a different reason (perhaps a reason best described as
too much on all of our plates):
Pitched as a tool for helping librarians collaborate with faculty, I think the FW
[Framework] fails to account for the difficulties many of us have in getting
faculty to work with us, not because of the failure of our imagination, but because
of the intense demands on teaching faculty, librarians, administrators, and others
in a struggling higher ed institution.
Challenge: Disinterested in Framework. Other participants stand now, hoping
to add their voices to this thread of conversation about the difficulty of working with
discipline faculty and about the feeling of marginality they share. "I don't think the
institution, in general, cares at all about information literacy," laments one person.
Another voice says the Framework would impact their own instruction and assessment
practices, but they did not think it was valued by their librarian colleagues. "Nor do I
believe that the university administration or majority of faculty will appreciate the
significance or potential impact of the Framework," this person concludes.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

118

Another voice agrees that discipline faculty are disinterested in the Framework
because they were busy doing other things:
With multiple planning and assessment strategies going on all over campus our
ability to engage faculty in looking at, or thinking about, the framework will, in
my opinion, be very limited. They may impact our development of hybrid
learning materials but I am not sure we'll get much traction from anyone outside
the library.
Challenge: Not committed to Framework. This topic of conversation—the
challenge of working with discipline faculty—seems to have struck a chord in many of
the participants. Now many of them are speaking about discipline faculty's lack of
commitment to the Framework. One voice says that, while the Framework was useful in
helping academic librarians think about IL, it would have less of an impact on faculty. "I
am not sure the extent to which faculty will embrace the framework itself; rather it will
impact how librarians think and work with faculty." Another voice doubts the
commitment of their institution to the Framework. "Applying the Framework means
adopting change. There is still a lot of resistance to change within this organization."
Challenge: Framework not understood. Adding to the conversation about
discipline faculty, other voices now talk about the Framework not being understood by
colleagues outside of the library. The first person says that the Framework will encourage
discussion among academic librarians, enhancing their thinking, "but it is not necessary
to bring it directly to others at our institution. It will only confuse them." Another person
agrees that the Framework would be difficult to explain to the faculty:
I think the way the framework is formatted does not easily translate into 'library

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

119

practices' in a way that the faculty will understand. Due to the lack of concretes,
we are going to spend most of the conversation around the new framework trying
to defend the library's place in the curriculum and any new practices the
framework inspires.
Advantage: Promotes value of IL. In opposition to those who thought that
faculty would not understand the Framework, other voices now interrupt, needing to
describe a different perspective. "The language is more transparent to faculty and other
non-librarian stakeholders," is the proclamation of one. Another person, responding to
and agreeing with the previous librarian, says, "I think the Framework is a powerful
document that brings information literacy instruction out of the library and back into the
campus more widely, as it was always meant to exist." A third person also speaks about
how the Framework helps them promote the value of IL when communicating with
discipline faculty. "...Librarians have been invited to speak to other faculty about how
we are using this framework, and those talks have been well received."
Challenge: Unfamiliar with Framework. This conversational thread about the
challenges of working with discipline faculty is like a long stanza in a poem, a stanza that
includes many lines about faculty's lack of collaboration with librarians, and their
disinterest in, lack of commitment to, and their understanding of (or lack of
understanding) the Framework. There are a couple more lines in this stanza. Two voices
speak now about the faculty being unfamiliar with the Framework. "It is a useful
document, but really doesn't change anything for us, and is not known among any of the
non-librarian communities with which we interact," the first voice begins. The next voice
joins in:

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

120

Our faculty and administration have no idea what this Framework is and are not
interested in librarians being more involved with the curriculum than we already
are. They have other priorities.
Challenge: IL is separate from disciplines. Now that the stanza has ended, a
chorus of voices begin speaking about IL being viewed as separate from other disciplines
by faculty members. The minor tones of this chorus create feelings of melancholy and
loneliness as librarians voice a common feeling of marginality; they speak about how
discipline faculty think of IL as separate from the disciplines in which they are immersed.
"The institution does not have much appetite for requirements and standards when it
comes to IL," says one voice.
Another person begins speaking on a very positive note, "I think the Framework
is a huge leap forward for library instruction and I think it will open doors and start
conversations with our disciplinary collaborators." After this burst of enthusiasm, the
dialectic is revealed as the response continues, "But in general library instruction is still
seen as moot or quaint by many faculty."
Other participants chime in, many of whom had already spoken about discipline's
lack of interest, commitment, and familiarity with the Framework. A new voice adds,
"Faculty are uniformly reluctant to turn over any part of their curriculum to librarians to
design or teach."
The chorus concludes with the words of a participant who thinks the Framework
has several advantages, including its supporting philosophy for a new vision of IL.
"The new Framework enables faculty to envision research as a critical thinking process
rather than a set of procedural tasks." However, the voice continues, a significant

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

121

challenge to the implementation of the Framework's concepts outside of the library is that
"most of our faculty are not aware of the many topics we teach, presuming that we only
cover 'how to search.'"
Advantage: Helps academic librarians think about IL. Some of the
participants became restless during the long verse about discipline faculty, jiggling their
feet and tapping their fingers as they waited for the chorus to end. Now they rise to their
feet, eager to speak about how the Framework helps academic librarians think about IL.
"Many of my colleagues are already rethinking practice based on the Framework," says
one person. The next two people stand up together; one voice says the Framework is
"shifting how we think about this topic" and the other says it will "lead to long-term
thinking about information literacy." Another participant, referring back to the challenge
of working with discipline faculty, says slowly, "I think the framework will have more
impact on how librarians think about information literacy and how they introduce the
subject with faculty." Then the voice repeats a sentence it said earlier, "I am not sure the
extent to which faculty will embrace the framework itself; rather it will impact how
librarians think and work with faculty."
A fifth participant wants to contribute to this conversational thread and explain
the overall level of impact they gave the Framework:
Some may be ready to embrace a new way of thinking about information
literacy, which is how I think of the Framework. Those who embrace it will make
changes and that will impact library practices at our institution; however, some
may not and so I can give it only a 5.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

122

Challenge: Lack of commitment from academic librarians. This last
participant, while saying that some of their colleagues may be "ready to embrace a new
way of thinking," also indicated that "some may not." People begin to nod at the last part
of this sentence, and raise their hands because they also want to speak to a lack of
commitment from academic librarians. "We have many librarians who resist change and
don't want to understand the effectiveness and purpose of the Framework to help in
collaborative efforts with 'subject-specific' teaching faculty (and vice-versa)," says one
librarian, passing a cup of coffee to the person who has come to sit next to them. Taking
the styrofoam cup, this next person adds, "The recent well-publicized critiques of the
framework have led some of my colleagues to be skeptical about the framework's utility,
though we did use it to redesign the course objectives for our credit bearing IL course."
Challenge: Pedagogy differs among academic librarians. Skepticism from
academic librarians about the Framework's usefulness may be due to differing
pedagogical practices. As coffee is poured and passed around a table, participants become
more comfortable in talking about some of the differences between themselves and their
colleagues. "I think that for my personal use (my subject specialties, online learners, etc.)
it will have a big impact," says one participant, stirring artificial cream into their cup.
"However, our librarians have a lot of latitude in how they handle instruction, and many
are happy with the way they have always done things." Another participant smiles,
nodding their head, and then speaks, echoing the same idea:
Librarians at my institution are faculty and free to teach utilizing whatever
pedagogy they are comfortable with. A few of us are using the frames, as we had

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

123

used the standards, but most are still doing BI [bibliographic instruction]
sessions...we do what we can with what we have.
Advantage: Promotes value of library. There is a short break in the
conversation as people get up to stretch their legs and someone starts to make more
coffee. It is clear that there are many librarians who see advantages in implementing the
Framework, and there are many who see challenges. One voice begins to speak quickly
and enthusiastically about how the Framework has helped them promote the value of the
library:
Our library has recently completed a comprehensive library renovation project
that includes the construction of two large, very high-tech active learning
classrooms. Those classrooms were planned to address new ideas and practices
consistent with standards created in ACRL's newest Framework, and I think that
they—along with the guidelines of the Framework itself—will be absolutely
transformational in the ways that we teach our students to obtain information.
Another person, not as enthusiastic or as voluble as the first person, but agreeing with the
idea that the Framework helps to promote the library, says this about the Framework's
impact:
We'll see a minor shift in practices, but have been advancing many of the
concepts in the frames for quite a while. Primary benefit will be in promoting the
value of information literacy and the library with faculty and administrators.
Challenge: Library not valued. While some participants said the Framework
was useful for enhancing the library's value on their campus, other voices now want to
talk about how the library is not valued at their institution, thereby reducing the impact of

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

124

the Framework. The first voice returns to the earlier conversation on the difficulty of
collaborating with discipline faculty because they need to be committed to the library and
see it as a valuable part of their institution:
The success of such initiative depends on the level of faculty's commitment,
image of the library, and value they place on the library. The way I see it, most
libraries don't work at the partnership level with faculty. We are seen as mere
service providers and collaborators. Some libraries do work on the embedment
level. For this to work, faculty need to be engaged as partners. Ours certainly
don't do that, and obviously, is our fault and lack of commitment towards the
partnership approach.
The next person is ambivalent about the Framework's impact. They explain the "4" they
gave as the Framework's overall level of impact in this way:
I know that the Framework will affect how some individual librarians teach (me
being one of them), but I don't think that it will prompt any shift in the larger
conversation on our campus. People don't pay enough attention to the
library/librarians for that to happen. So, that's why I put it in the middle.
Advantage: Higher level of understanding. Talking about the challenges of the
Framework stimulates the opposite or dialectical point of view in other participants.
Unlike the previous voice that said the Framework will probably not "prompt any shift in
the larger conversation on our campus," the next voice is effusive in its praise for the
Framework's impact on IL instruction and discussion:
The move away from 'bullet point' learning outcomes and toward a richer
conceptual understanding of the context in which information literacy

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

125

operates is a huge step forward. As an example, I can now show students
results from a single Google Scholar search that illustrate the 'back and
forth' of research replication and the notion of 'scholarship of conversation'
to show more richly the function of a scholarly research study and where it
fits in to advance human understanding. There was no room in the former
competencies to have this type of rich discussion.
The voice that follows agrees that the Framework will enrich higher levels of
understanding, but is more conservative about its impact on library practices. "I think the
framework is a good disciplinary document but it mostly help[s] higher level
understandings of what we do, not really change[s] the amount or level of what we are
already doing."
Challenge: Complexity. Six participants shake their heads during the speeches of
the last two voices. Another person begins to speak now, repeating what they said earlier
because they wish to agree with the former voices and also disagree:
While the Framework and its underlying theory are excellent discussion topics for
professional librarians and disciplinary faculty, they do not translate information
literacy concepts to students any better than the standards already do. The
Framework is an abstract concept, and you have to be fairly adept as a researcher
before you can understand the abstraction.
Normally, repeating sentences in a conversation is annoying, but repetition is sometimes
necessary in this dialogue because it allows the participants (and the reader!) to reflect
more deeply upon the speaker's words and to think of the words in a different context.
The next speaker agrees with this voice, "This [the Framework] is all too complex." One

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

126

person, after spilling their powdered cream and sweeping it up into their hand, and
tossing it in a trashcan, draws a conclusion to this topic. "No matter what structure ACRL
develops, librarians overall will struggle with it until they have learned and internalized
pedagogy and educational theory."
Advantage: Currently integrating. Again a reflective silence settles in on the
group. Somebody gets up and pulls some water bottles out of a refrigerator in the nearby
kitchen, coming back to the cafeteria and passing the bottles around. Someone else
laughs about the desiccated sweet rolls on the tables. Eventually, a soft whispering can be
heard around the table as heads bend together to talk about the integration of the
Framework at their institution. One person comes up to the microphone and says to the
whole group, "The Framework has already impacted how I work with the first year
writing faculty and how the library fits into their curriculum and outcomes." Another
person speaks simply and directly, "I'm in charge of instruction and I will implement it."
Someone else says that librarians at their institution were already using the Framework as
a guide for developing one-shot sessions and assessments. Two or three tables of
librarians seem to be nodding their heads in agreement; they are currently integrating the
Framework. One voice adds that since they had already implemented much of
Framework, "there will not be much future impact."
A last voice brings a new term into the conversation. "We are using the
Framework as a tool for scaffolding online lessons to teach metaliteracy skills across
multiple institutions." Here is another reference to an important idea or conceptual lens of
the Framework—metaliteracy—or the emphasis on the individual as an information
producer.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

127

Challenge: Not using it. One person is bold enough to speak now in
contradiction to the many voices who spoke about how they were integrating the
Framework. This voice says they are not using the Framework at their institution. "My
impression here is that we don't really make decisions based on the Framework—that is,
we don't have copies of it up to refer to, and we don't use it in making decisions about our
teaching."
Challenge: Takes time. Another voice speaks up to support the previous voice
and explains that they were not using the Framework because its implementation would
take time:
My institution is slow to catch on the any form of change. We spend a lot of time
talking about things before we actually make any attempt at implementing
something. We talked about the Framework as a group of instruction librarians
about 7 months ago, but then never spoke of it again as a group.
Advantage: Standards coexisting. Again, there is a pause as participants search
their minds for other ways that the Framework may or may not impact their practice.
Some of the participants are signaling me over to their table, letting me know that they
have been waiting patiently to discuss a very hot topic—can the Framework coexist with
the 2000 standards? This issue—whether or not to sunset the Standards—has been a
controversial one. Some ACRL Board members wanted to sunset the Standards
immediately, while other Board members wanted to wait and give institutions time to
adopt the Framework. People now get up from their seats to talk about how the Standards
were coexisting with the Framework in their programs. The first person says, "We are
currently using both the Framework and the earlier Standards..." After a long swallow

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

128

from a water bottle, a second voice says, "We are presently reviewing our current IL
program to incorporate all/part of the Framework along with the old ACRL standards into
the program." A third voice expresses the opinion that the Framework should not "replace
the old Standards outrightly." Instead, the voice continues, "the Frames will serve as an
enhanced 'layer' that provides better context surrounding the ACRL IL Standards from
2000."
Challenge: Currently teaching Standards. As the preceding people talked about
how they thought the Framework could coexist with the Standards, a number of
participants seem to be whispering amongst themselves. When I bend down to hear what
they are saying, I hear one voice saying quietly to the librarian next to them:
The Standards have been the standard for info lit at our institution since 2009.
There is no reason to rock the boat. The librarians will use the ideas in the
framework to enhance their thinking, but it is not necessary to bring it directly to
others at our institution. It will only confuse them.
Their companion whispered back about how they thought the Framework encouraged
discussion. "However, I do not think that we will do away with many of the lessons
developed out of the Standards, nor do I think the Framework and the Standards are
necessarily contradictory documents."
Challenge: Assessments based on Standards. Noticing that I was listening to
their conversation, the participants talking about the Standards begin to speak in louder
voices. One person talks about several advantages of the Framework, including helping
academic librarians design IL programs and think about IL. But their institution had
already adopted IL Student Learning Outcomes based on the Standards and their faculty

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

129

had embraced them. However, the person adds, the Framework "can help us shape our
future policy progress...It will take time and is a process not just flipping a switch."
Challenge: Standards preferred over Framework. Two people step up to the
microphone, willing to share their thoughts with the whole group. They say they prefer
the Standards over the Framework. The first voice says, "The Framework is really of very
little use at our institution. The 2000 Standards resonated more with our library faculty
and with our partner faculty members in the departments." A second person also has a
strong opinion about the Standards. This librarian says that their IL goals were based on
the Standards and had been part of their curriculum since 2006, expressing a preference
for the "well-written outcomes" of the Standards:
So while we talk about the Framework at our institution because there is a lot of
talk beyond at conferences and such, the usefulness of the Framework at an
institution that concentrates on assessment of student learning of information
literacy outcomes is little to none.
Advantage: Will affect overall curriculum. Two faces register disbelief at the
last two people's statements that the Framework was "of very little use" at their
institution. These new voices want to talk about how the Framework will affect their
overall curriculum. "We have created institutional outcomes based on the Framework.
These are likely to become implemented across the curriculum, which is a change to
library practices at our institution thus far," says the first librarian. Giving a fresh roll to
this first person, a second person says, "The frameworks provide a different, big picture
of contextualizing the work we already do. It will allow us to integrate ourselves further
into the curriculum..."

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

130

Challenge: Does not affect overall curriculum. In response to the last two
participant's views, another group of people rise to their feet; they do not think that the
Framework will affect the overall curriculum. One person states that they think the
Framework will help design IL instruction, but "the larger conversation about integrating
information literacy concepts across the curriculum is a long-term effort that the
framework will not change." The second voice agrees with the first—things were going
to stay the same because "practices are so ingrained within the library department and we
don't have much influence on curriculum." A third person also had little hope for change.
"We are an extremely top heavy institution and as such have very few young librarians at
our institution. Until the guard changes, I don't think much will change."
Challenge: Does not affect current practices. Elaborating on this theme that not
much was going to change at their institution, a chorus of sixteen begins to intone how
the Framework does not affect current practices. Sometimes a solo voice speaks out over
the chorus. "It will take more than the Framework to impact library practices at my
institution," says one person. Another person also thinks the Framework will have little
impact. "Most of us will continue to teach practical search strategies and introduce library
tools and concepts just as we did before." A third librarian tells us they are busy building
an IL program, but did not rule out the possibility that the Framework would have impact
later on down the road:
We are at the beginning of building a comprehensive information literacy
program at [name of institution] so the process is a bit slow going. We are
enhancing the current staff with new librarians who have experience with heavy
teaching loads and are very familiar with the framework, so as we gain some

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

131

ground with fostering stronger teaching relationships with our faculty, the
framework is taking a bit of a backseat. We first need to assess what has been
taught in the past year or so before we can begin to establish common goals (like
for the freshmen writing course) or look into course mapping. All in time.
Other participants wait for the chorus to end, wanting to dialogue with each other about
why the Framework was not currently being used at their institution. "I think that the
librarians at my university will take a while to assimilate the framework concepts into
their own teaching," says one librarian to another sitting across the table. Someone is
popping popcorn in the kitchen's microwave. "The framework is good but I think that
librarians may have a difficult time developing concrete experience and having the
confidence to move outside the 2000 definitions," offers the second person. A third
person in this dialogue offers their input. "We are a small school and [the] library is
understaffed. We can be aware of the Framework and communicate it but whether or not
we'll have the funding or staff to make major changes is doubtful."
Challenge: Does not offer anything new. There are a lot of people sitting around
this table, participating in the conversation about why their institution was not using the
Framework. Many of them are saying that the Framework does not offer anything new.
"The Framework is not that different from what we already do. Librarians at this
institution are full members of the faculty and there is already a good level of
collaboration on research and instruction," says one of these people. Echoing the word
"holistic" from Question 19 in the survey, another person agrees with the first speaker:
Since we already had developed a holistic information literacy program at our
institution we do not think the framework will impact our practices because we

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

132

have been able to create great collaboration within our institution that maybe
others have not.
Advantage: Conceptual lens. The aroma of scorched popcorn wafts out over the
crowd. Some wrinkle their noses in disgust; others make jokes about the ubiquitous smell
of burned popcorn in work settings. Then another participant stands up to address the
room, proposing a new topic: Another advantage of the Framework is that it can serve as
a conceptual lens that provides potential to change the way information literacy is
interpreted and taught. Turning away from their private conversations, participants begin
to speak. "The language is more transparent to faculty and other non-librarian
stakeholders," says one person again, adding, "It's easier to use e.g. 'scholarship as a
conversation' as a metaphor that faculty will understand, and thus see value in." Another
person chimes in, "It is in a language that is clear and easy to implement." Voices begin
to whisper again; sometimes the words threshold concepts and metaliteracy can be heard.
One librarian clears their throat and speaks to the surrounding participants:
The framework resonates with the faculty in our Writing & Rhetoric program. It
closely mirrors their own framework. In subject areas, the Framework will help
librarians find the various 'thresholds' students must cross to be information
literate in their chosen area of study.
Heads nod and people start talking with excitement about how the conceptual lens of the
Framework had caused a paradigm shift in their practice. "We've started examining our
work in light of Concepts instead of Tool Use," pipes up one voice. Another enthusiastic
librarian joins in:
I have already introduced the framework to my faculty. It is in language that is

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

133

clear and easy to implement. Many said they could or already did include IL in
their coursework...the framework would make it easier to know which concepts
should be included.
A third person contributes a more reserved and ambivalent viewpoint. "It will open the
eyes for the librarians. I can't promise it will with faculty."
Advantage: Supporting philosophy. Two people put their hands up to indicate
they want to add something to the current topic—that the Framework is a supporting
philosophy for their current conceptual lens. One person speaks up. "...It may not change
our instructional approach as much as it will legitimize our instructional approach."
Smiling in agreement the other person says, "I think the Framework provides a lot of
possibilities for new directions that librarians can take this. It's a tool they can use and a
supporting philosophy."
Challenge: Nebulous. After the words "transparent" and "clear" were used to
describe the Framework's language, a surge of muttering arose around the room. Since
this happened while other librarians were still speaking about the Framework as a
conceptual lens, the mutterers got some dirty looks and an admonishment to wait their
turn. Now, I tell these people that they can speak, and they do so, telling us they think the
language of the Framework is not clear or transparent, but nebulous, or certain to be
interpreted in multiple ways. I interrupt the speaker to tell the reader that "nebulous" is
one of Wiggin and McTighe's (2005) three problems with content standards. Then I nod
at the person I interrupted, who resumes:
Many of my colleagues are already rethinking practice based on the Framework.
At the same time, it gums up the work of assessment, giving us almost nothing

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

134

concrete to report on/back to our Dean in the tightening race for resources at my
university.
I ask the reader to note the dialectic in this person's statement. They acknowledge that the
Framework will help them redesign IL programs and think about IL, but it makes the
process of assessment more difficult.
I notice another participant nearby who seems to be deep in thought. I ask them if
they would like to say anything about why the Framework may not be useful for
assessment. Rising slowly from their chair, this librarian speaks deliberately and clearly:
A major objection to the Framework is that the outcomes and proficiencies
are poorly written. They are not written for assessment activities. For example,
what outcome would you be able to assess from the following: Understand that
many disciplines have acknowledged authorities in the sense of well-known
scholars and publications that are widely considered standard. How would you
assess a student's ability to 'understand that many disciplines have acknowledged
authorities in the sense of well-known scholars and publications?' This problem
is rampant in the Framework whether the focus is on knowledge practices or
dispositions. I really hate to say this, but the entire Framework seems to have been
developed without any context of the previously well-written outcomes that many
institutions embedded within the university curriculum.
Challenge: Overload problem. In the silence that ensues after the last person
stops speaking, I ask the participants if anyone has anything to say about Wiggin and
McTighe's (2005) second problem with content standards—the overload problem—the
large number of content standards exceeds the amount of time needed to study them. One

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

135

person asks if they can repeat what they said earlier. "Sure," I say. "Feel free." And they
repeat, "The Framework is a little overwhelming and intimidating, so I am unsure that it
will really be embraced or change how we do our one-shot classes."
Challenge: Goldilocks problem. "And does anyone have anything to say about
the Goldilocks problem, the third of Wiggin and McTighe's (2005) problems?" I ask. I
explain this problem briefly. "Just like Goldilocks and the beds and chairs of the three
bears, some standards are too big while others are too small." One person raises their
hand and states, "The Framework is a nice bit of guidance, but is too broad to cause a rethink and overhaul of information literacy teaching that we have been doing for some
time now."
Challenge: Jargon. I sense that you, the reader, are getting a little restless. I tell
the participants it is almost time to wrap up the discussion. "Is there something else to say
about the language of the Framework?" I ask. Several of the participants nod, indicating
they would like to speak. "The framework uses a lot of education jargon. I am still trying
to make sense of the document and jargon, so I can imagine the difficult time a noneducation faculty member will have." I respond to this person by reminiscing about how
the ACRL had wanted to avoid using jargon in the Framework. "When the ACRL
decided that the Standards needed to be extensively revised (Association of College and
Research Libraries, June, 2012, p. 1), they recommended that 'the Standards must be
articulated in readily comprehensible terms that do not include library jargon,'" I say.
Three people tell me they think the ACRL was not successful in this goal. "The
language used in the Framework alienated many librarians. Good concept, poor
execution," the first person remarks. Another one says, "We'll use the Framework

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

136

because it is the new model. I don't really like it though. It is a wordy overblown
document that looks impressive but isn't."
And the last person closes our dialogue with the following:
It's just a bunch of words that make no sense to most people. If you have to attend
workshops and seminars and training sessions just to be able to understand what
the document is supposed to do, it is a failure.
Summary of Most Frequent Themes
As truth is gathered, I rearrange,
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,
Perpetual change.
—Jon Anderson and Chris Squire
In Chapter Four, we saw the quantitative data from the "outside in." In this
chapter, I attempted to help you, the reader, hear the voices of the participants from
"inside out" by rearranging the qualitative responses as a dialogue. There are, no doubt,
an infinite amount of ways to assemble the responses I gathered, but I chose this
particular arrangement so that the theme of the dialectic, of "perpetual change" and
interchange between opposing ideas, could be seen.
But now it is time for our voices to go back to their places in Appendix D,
assuming once again the context of their position and their participant numbers. They will
speak again in Chapters Six, but this time it will be to the quantitative data. As
participants leave the cafeteria, nodding to each other and saying goodbye for now, I
would like to summarize the major themes of our conversation.
Many of the participants thought that the Framework was especially
useful in helping academic librarians design IL instruction/programs and they were
currently integrating the Framework. Implementation concerns about collaboration

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

137

between academic librarians and discipline faculty and issues regarding discipline
faculty's apparent perception that IL is separate from other disciplines were perceived as
significant challenges. It is hoped that this dialogue will contribute to the dialectical
process—the discussion of opposing ideas that may bring about a synthesis of thought
regarding the Framework.

Chapter Six
Merging of Quantitative and Qualitative Results
In this chapter, the participants will be speaking—not to me, not to each other, not
to the reader—but to the quantitative results. I will enable this conversation to happen by
merging the quantitative and qualitative results. I will place the quantitative results and
relevant qualitative themes for each of the survey questions (Questions 9 through 21) side
by side in order to compare and contrast the results. At the close of this chapter, I will
discuss the quantitative and qualitative results regarding one-shot instruction and the
Standards. Because of their conclusive nature, the summary of the merged results is
included in Chapter Seven.
Cresswell and Plano Clark (2011) suggested that quantitative and qualitative data
can be merged in several ways—one of which is to report the results together in the
discussion of a study and another of which is to use tables or figures that display the
results side by side. Both of these methods will be used, beginning with tables that
summarize the quantitative data for each survey question along with relevant qualitative
themes. This type of mixed methods data analysis is used to evaluate whether or not the
quantitative and qualitative results are convergent or divergent with respect to the
research questions (Ivankova, 2014). Merging of findings also provides a deeper layer of
insight and understanding and aids in the interpretation of the results (Morales, 2012).
In Tables 10 through 22, the quantitative results for each survey question
(Questions 9 through 21) appear on the left side of each table. The question appears first,
followed by a figure (also included in Chapter Four) displaying the percentage of

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

139

responses for each question for deans and non-deans. The mean, standard deviation (SD),
mode, and median is included after the figure. On the right side of each table are themes
relevant to the question. For example, Question 9 asks the participant to rate the extent
that they think the Framework "will open the way for librarians, faculty, and other
institutional partners to redesign instruction sessions, assignments, courses, and curricula
at your institution." A theme from the qualitative data that is relevant to this question is
Advantage: Helps Academic Librarians Design Information Literacy
Instruction/Programs. The number of dean and non-dean responses that were coded as
the theme is then given. Finally, exemplars of the theme are provided—an entire response
or an excerpt from the response that exemplifies the theme—along with the subject's
position, participant number, and the Likert rating given by the participant for that
particular question. I chose exemplars that resonated with survey questions, and used
them to further illustrate how a participant's qualitative response corresponded to or
contrasted with the quantitative results of the survey question. In some cases, a
participant's response appeared to correspond to a specific question, however, their
answer to the survey question was the opposite of what would have been expected given
their qualitative response. Many of the exemplars appeared in Chapter Five; however,
additional exemplars have been included in this chapter to further illustrate the
association between the themes and the survey questions.
Advantage and Challenge themes are given for each survey question. In some
cases, additional phrases have been added to the Advantage and Challenge themes listed
in the table. For example, in Chapter Five, one of the Challenge themes is Minimal
Impact on Instruction. In Table 10, the phrase "the Framework will have" was added to

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

140

the theme (The Framework Will Have Minimal Impact on Instruction) for purposes of
clarity.
Table 22 contains the quantitative data for Question 21 (the overall impact of the
Framework on library practices). Unlike the tables preceding Table 22, qualitative
responses on the right side are presented in the order of Likert ratings participants gave
(except for "1" because only non-deans gave the Framework this rating). The discussion
that follows Table 22 will help to answer the second research question of this study:
2. What are the best predictor variables for the perceived level of impact on
academic library praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education will have?
For purposes of interpretation, a "1" rating on the Likert scale is interpreted in this
chapter as "very low impact"; a "2" is "low impact"; a "3" as "moderately low impact"; a
"4" as "moderate impact"; a "5" as "moderately high impact"; a "6" as "high impact"; a
"7" as "very high impact."
After each table, I will compare and contrast the quantitative and qualitative
findings for each question, and how they help to answer the following research questions:
1. What level of impact on academic library praxes do library deans, assessment
librarians, and instructional librarians perceive that the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education will have?
3. How do academic library deans, assessment librarians, and instructional
librarians explain their perceptions of the level of impact on academic library
praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education will
have?

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

Question 9: Redesigning IL Instruction
The mean for the deans is a little higher than the mean for the non-deans in this
question, indicating that, on average, deans perceived that the Framework would have
more impact on redesigning instruction sessions, assignments, courses, and curricula at
their institution than non-deans did. Six non-deans gave a very low Likert rating ("1") to
this question; there were no deans who gave a very low rating on this question. This
pattern continues throughout the Likert questions; deans never gave an impact rating of
"1" to any of the Likert questions. However, the mode for Question 9 (the number that
appears most frequently in a number set) for both groups was moderately high ("5") so
there is not a great deal of discrepancy between the groups on this issue.
Looking at the theme Advantage: The Framework Helps Academic Librarians
Design Information Literacy Instruction/Programs and its opposite theme Challenge:
The Framework Will Have Minimal Impact on Instruction, there were more participants
who thought the Framework would have an impact on IL instruction/programs than those
who thought it would have minimal impact on instruction. This is consistent with the
quantitative results. Dean participant #127, who said they "completely redesigned" an IL
course based on the Framework, gave both Question 9 and Question 21 a very high Likert
rating ("7")—which is consistent with their qualitative response. Non-dean participant
#28, who thought the Framework would affect "some instruction" but not "in large
ways," gave Question 9 a moderate Likert rating ("4") and a moderately low rating ("3")
for overall impact in Question 21. Dean participant #42 gave a moderately high rating
("5") to Question 9, but was doubtful that the Framework would have much
impact. The rest of Dean participant #42's response (not included in Table 9) specifies

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

144

that the Framework might not have much future impact because their institution was
already "using both the Framework and the earlier Standards to do many of the things
you ask about in previous questions." Thus, the quantitative and qualitative results for
Question 9 indicate that most participants (both deans and non-deans) think that the
Framework will have a moderately high impact on redesigning IL instruction.

"The Framework is an abstract concept, and you have to be
fairly adept as a researcher before you can understand the
abstraction. An undergraduate is not going to connect with
the concepts of the Framework. So what do you have to do in
order to help them make that connection? You have to help
them learn the fundamental research skills before they will be
able to think of research at a higher level. The cognitive
threshold theory on which the Framework is based was
intended to explain the moment one understands a pivotal
concept within a discipline. Information Literacy is not a
standalone discipline. Information Literacy over-arches all
the disciplines. We want our students to be information
literate in their discipline." (Non-dean participant #66: gave
Question 10 a "2)

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

146

Question 10: Student Success Initiatives
This is the third lowest mean for the non-deans' ratings of Likert questions
indicating that, on average, non-deans tended to believe that the Framework would have
less impact on connecting information with student success initiatives at their institutions
than it might have on issues discussed in the other survey questions. However, deans on
average still thought that the Framework would have a moderately high impact (the
deans' mean rounded up to "5") on student success initiatives.
While the phrase "student success initiatives" did not appear in the participants'
responses, there were two themes that related to the increase of student success at the
institutional level: Advantage: The Framework Promotes Value of Information Literacy
and Challenge: Fundamental Skills First. As stated in Chapter Two, research has shown
that IL is important in student retention and academic success, allowing students to
become "independent seekers of truth" (Breivik, 1991, p. 87). Given that IL is important
to student success, as Non-dean participant #44 stated, the Framework is powerful
because it brings IL instruction "out of the library and back into the campus more widely,
as it was always meant to exist." This participant gave a moderately high rating ("5") for
Question 10 and a high overall impact ("6") for Question 21, which is consistent with
their qualitative response. Non-dean participant #66 did not think that undergraduates
would "connect with the concepts of the Framework" because it was too abstract, and
fundamental research skills needed to be taught first. Non-dean participant #66 gave a
low Likert rating ("2") for this question and a very low overall impact ("1") for Question
21, which is consistent with their qualitative response. Thus, there is somewhat of a
contradiction between the quantitative and qualitative data for Question 10 here. The

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

147

quantitative data indicates that participants thought the Framework would have a
moderately high impact on student success initiatives, while the qualitative data's lack of
themes directly related to student success initiatives suggests that this issue may not be as
important to participants as other issues discussed in the Framework.
The next table (Table 12) displays the descriptive statistics for Question 11 and
the corresponding qualitative themes.

"We are looking for ways to be more involved in the research
process for our institution and help with information literacy
understanding across the curriculum. I have already
introduced the Framework to my faculty. It is in language that
is clear and easy to implement. Many said they could or
already did include IL in their coursework...the Framework
would make it easier to know which concepts should be
included." (Non-dean participant #85: gave Question 11 a

Question 11: Collaboration on Pedagogical Research
This is one of the two Likert questions where the dean's mode is lower than the
non-dean's mode. Twenty-eight percent of the deans thought that the Framework would
have a moderate impact ("4") on collaboration on pedagogical research and involving
students in that research at their institution, and 25% of the non-deans thought it would
have a moderately high impact ("5") on this issue. This is consistent with the amount of
non-deans whose response was coded as Advantage: The Framework Supports Academic
Librarian Collaboration with Discipline Faculty (1 Dean, 11 Non-deans). Non-dean
participant #85 wrote that the Framework's concepts "work extremely well" in producing
research, and they had already shared the Framework with faculty. This non-dean's
ratings were consistent with their qualitative response, giving Question 11 a very high
rating ("7") and their overall impact rating for Question 21 was high ("6"). Also
consistent with the quantitative data was the small amount of participants whose
responses were coded Challenge: Lack of Collaboration (0 Dean, 2 Non-deans). Nondean participant #89 did not think the Framework accounted for the difficulty that
academic librarians had "in getting faculty to work with us…because of the intense
demands on teaching faculty, librarians, administrators, and others in a struggling higher
ed institution." This participant gave a low impact ("2") for Question 11 and a moderately
low impact ("3") for overall impact. Accordingly, the quantitative and qualitative results
for Question 11 indicate that the issue of collaboration on pedagogical research is more
important to non-deans, who also think the Framework will have a greater impact on
collaboration than non-deans.

"We've designed our curriculum around it, and we use it in our

librarians have been invited to speak to other faculty about
how we are using this Framework, and those talks have been
well received." (Dean participant #134: gave Question 12 a

"The Framework gives us language to talk about information

Question 12: Creating Wider Conversations
The descriptive statistics for this question are unique in two ways. First, the nondean's mode is the highest one for all the Likert questions and the dean's standard
deviation (SD) is the lowest one for all the Likert questions. A low SD indicates that the
deans' ratings were close to the mean—in other words, the deans were the most in
agreement on this question. The non-deans' mode suggests that non-deans believed—out
of all the issues in the Likert questions—that the Framework would have the most impact
on creating wider conversations about student learning, the scholarship of teaching and
learning, and the assessment of learning at their institution. The qualitative data is
consistent with the quantitative data for Question 12. Twelve non-dean responses and
only two dean responses were coded as Advantage: The Framework Encourages
Discussion. Non-dean participant #65 wrote that "the Framework helps us talk with
faculty and students about the complexities of information and the skills needed to
navigate an information-laden world." This participant gave a very high rating ("7") for
both Question 12 and Question 21. A smaller amount of non-dean responses were coded
as Challenge: Discipline Faculty Unfamiliar with Framework and Challenge: Discipline
Faculty Disinterested in the Framework. If discipline faculty are not familiar or
interested in the Framework, then wider conversations about student learning and
assessment will not be created. The complete response of dean participant #119, who
gave a moderate rating ("4") on Question 12 and on the overall impact of the Framework,
said the Framework's impact "will be modest at best" because it "is not known among any
of the non-librarian communities with which we interact." Non-dean participant #12, who
gave a moderate rating ("4") to this question and a moderately low ("3") overall impact

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

154

for Question 21, did not "believe that the university administration or majority of faculty
will appreciate the significance or potential impact of the Framework." Thus, the
quantitative and qualitative results for Question 12 indicate that non-deans think the
Framework will have a greater impact on creating wider conversations about student
learning, scholarship, and assessment than the deans.
Next, Table 14 displays the descriptive statistics for Question 13 and the

Question 13: Development of IL
The mean for both groups is the highest mean for all of the Yes/No questions
indicating that, on average, more participants chose "Yes" on this issue—that the
Framework would guide the development of IL at their institution—than on any other
Yes/No question. Consistent with the quantitative results for Question 13, 7 dean
responses and 18 non-dean responses were coded as Advantage: The Framework Helps
Academic Librarians Design Information Literacy Instruction/Programs. Dean
participant #39, who answered "Yes" to Question 13 and gave a high rating ("6") to the
Framework's overall impact, wrote that the Framework was "a benchmark for us to
design and implement our information literacy program in the future." However, nondean participant #43's response was not consistent with their "No" answer to Question 13
and their low rating ("2") of the Framework's overall impact. This participant's complete
response explains the contradiction. "The recent well-publicized critiques of the
framework have led some of my colleagues to be skeptical about the framework's utility,
though we did use it to redesign the course objectives for our credit bearing IL course."
This non-dean's answer is a reflection of the dialectic discussed in Chapter Five.
Also consistent with the quantitative data is the percentage of deans and nondeans who chose "No" on this question (22% of the deans and 21% of the non-deans) and
the percentage of dean and non-dean responses coded as Challenge: The Framework
Does Not Affect Current Practices (19% of the deans and 13% of the non-deans). Nondean participant #124, who answered "No" to Question 13 and gave a moderately low
rating ("3") to the Framework's overall impact, described that "practices are so ingrained
within the library department and we don't have much influence on curriculum."

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

However, dean participant #21's response is not consistent with their "Yes" answer to this
question and their moderately high rating ("5") of overall impact. Their complete
response was: "The Framework is not that different from what we already do. Librarians
at this institution are full members of the faculty and there is already a good level of
collaboration on research and instruction." This response contradicts the participant's
moderately high rating of the Framework's overall impact, perhaps indicating that this
dean, while agreeing with the Framework's concepts, feels that they have already "been
there, done that." So, the quantitative and qualitative results for Question 13 indicate that
a strong majority of participants in both groups think that the Framework will impact
development of IL at their institution.

Question 14: Promote Discussion of Key Concepts
There is much more disagreement on this issue than in the previous question. The
results show that 53% of deans and 64% of non-deans think that the Framework will
promote discussion of key concepts in information in general education and disciplinary
studies at their institution, while 47% of deans and 36% of non-deans think that it will
not. The deans are almost evenly divided on the issue, while a greater percentage of nondeans chose "Yes" on this question. This division among deans is reflected in the
qualitative themes, where 4 dean responses were coded as Advantage: The Framework Is
a Conceptual Lens That Provides Potential to Change the Way Information Literacy Is
Interpreted and Taught and 3 dean responses were coded as Challenge: Information
Literacy Is Separate from the Disciplines. Also reflecting the quantitative data for this
question, more non-dean responses (11) were coded as an Advantage theme than a
Challenge theme (6 non-deans). Non-dean participant #13, who answered "Yes" to this
question and gave a moderately high rating ("5") for the Framework's overall impact,
thought the Framework would "help us to shift the emphasis of our instruction away from
tool use and towards bigger concepts." However, dean participant #62's response reveals
the dialectic in that they answered "No" to this question but thought the Framework
"enables faculty to envision research as a critical thinking process rather than a set of
procedural tasks." In their complete response, the dean wrote that they had already
developed a program based on the Framework so "it may not change our instructional
approach as much as it will legitimize our instructional approach." Non-dean participant
#81, who answered "No" to Question 4 and, correspondingly, gave a low rating ("2") to
the Framework's overall impact, did not think the institution had "much appetite for

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

162

requirements and standards when it comes to IL." It may be assumed, then, that the
quantitative and qualitative results for Question 14 indicate this issue—the Framework
will promote discussion of key concepts—is bone of contention among academic
librarians.

Question 15: Will Encourage Thinking about Core or Portal Concepts
This is the only Likert question where the mode for both groups is the same and
the mode is "4" or moderate impact instead of a "5" or moderately high impact. So,
overall, both groups do think the Framework will have only a moderate level of impact
on encouraging thinking about how to address core or portal concepts at their institution.
But, as their lower SD indicates, the deans are more in agreement about this issue than
the non-deans. The median (middle number for the number set) for the non-deans shows
that half of the non-deans think the Framework will have moderate-very low impact on
thinking about core/portal concepts, and half of the non-deans think it will have
moderately high-very high impact. The qualitative data is consistent with this division: 10
non-dean responses were coded as Advantage: The Framework Helps Academic
Librarians Think about Information Literacy and 10 non-dean responses were coded as
Challenge: The Framework Does Not Offer Anything New. Non-dean participant #23,
who gave a very high rating ("7") for Question 15 and a moderately high ("5") impact for
Question 21, wrote that Framework was "a new way of thinking about information
literacy" and that some would "be ready to embrace" but "some may not." Non-dean
participant #29, who gave a low rating ("2") to both Question 15 and 21, expressed the
view that "the new Framework doesn't offer much new above what we currently are
doing."
In contrast to the quantitative data for Question 15, which indicates that most
deans thought the Framework would have a moderate level of impact on thinking about
core or portal concepts, the qualitative data shows that the deans did not have much to
say on this issue. Thus, the quantitative results for Question 15 indicate that deans think

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

165

the Framework will have a moderate impact on this issue—encourage thinking about core
or portal concepts—but the qualitative data indicates that this issue is not necessarily at
the forefront of their thinking (at least in this sample). Quantitative and qualitative data
indicate that non-deans are divided on this issue.

it will be helpful when discussing instructional assessment

Question 16)

Question 16: Help to Contextualize and Integrate IL
Descriptive statistics for this question show that an equal percentage of deans and
non-deans chose "Yes" (75%) and an equal percentage of both groups chose "No" (25%).
The qualitative data is consistent with these results, showing that more dean and nondean responses were coded as Advantage: The Framework Is Currently Being Integrated
than as Challenge: The Framework Is Not Being Used. Dean participant #70 indicates
some contradiction within their response. "So the Framework does impact library
practices, but will not significantly change them. But, it will be helpful when discussing
instructional assessment and accreditation." However, despite the belief that the
Framework would not significantly change library practice, this dean answered "Yes" to
Question 16 and gave a high rating ("6") to the Framework's overall impact.
No dean responses were coded as Challenge: The Framework Is Not Being Used.
Non-dean participant #138, who answered "Yes" to Question 16 but gave a moderately
low rating ("3") for Question 21, wrote that "we talked about the Framework as a group
of instruction librarians about 7 months ago, but then never spoke of it again as a group."
Perhaps the contradiction in this non-dean's answer to Question 16 and their qualitative
response can be explained as the tension between an ideal state (the Framework will
impact IL integration) and the existing state of affairs at their institution. Consequently,
the quantitative and qualitative results for Question 16 indicate that the majority of the
participants agree on this issue—that the Framework will help to contextualize and
integrate IL at their institution.

Advantage: The Framework Creates a Higher Level of
Understanding (O Dean, 2 Non-Deans)
"The move away from 'bullet point' learning outcomes and
toward a richer conceptual understanding of the context in
which information literacy operates is a huge step forward.
As an example, I can now show students results from a single
Google Scholar search that illustrate the 'back and forth' of
research replication and the notion of 'scholarship of
conversation' to show more richly the function of a scholarly
research study and where it fits in to advance human
understanding. There was no room in the former
competencies to have this type of rich discussion." (Non-dean
participant #121: answered "Yes" to Question 17)
Challenge: The Framework Contains Jargon

trying to make sense of the document and jargon, so I can

will have." (Non-dean participant #14: answered "No" for

Question 17: Encourage Deeper Understanding of Knowledge Practices and
Dispositions
The majority of deans (72%) and non-deans (75%) thought the Framework would
encourage a deeper level of understanding of what knowledge practices and dispositions
an information-literate student should develop at their institution. Even though most
participants answered "Yes" to this question, and the Framework provides a list of
knowledge practices and dispositions for each of its six frames, no deans used the terms
"knowledge practices" or "dispositions" in their qualitative responses. One non-dean used
the terms. Two non-dean responses were coded as Advantage: The Framework Creates a
Higher Level of Understanding, a theme which echoes the word "understanding" in
Question 17. Non-dean participant #121, who answered "Yes" to this question and gave a
moderately high rating ("5") for Question 21, wrote that "the move away from 'bullet
point' learning outcomes and toward a richer conceptual understanding of the context in
which information literacy operates is a huge step forward." This response, while
demonstrating that the Framework does create a higher level of understanding, seems to
denigrate (or at least, imply that they are not necessary) the "bullet point learning
outcomes" provided as knowledge practices and dispositions in the Framework.
Four non-dean responses were coded as Challenge: The Framework Contains
Jargon. Instead of encouraging a deeper understanding of IL practices, "the language
used in the Framework alienated many librarians," wrote non-dean participant #30. This
non-dean's qualitative response contradicts the "Yes" answer to Question 17, but is
consistent with their moderately low rating ("3") for the Framework's overall impact.
This is explained by the non-dean's last sentence in their response: "Good concept, poor

execution." So, the quantitative results for Question 17 indicate that the majority of the
participants agree that the Framework will encourage a deeper understanding of
knowledge practices and dispositions, but the qualitative results show that the participants
in this sample are not thinking about or using the Framework's knowledge practices or
dispositions.

Question 18: Encourage the Development of Resources
In this Yes/No question, there is a greater percentage of deans (38%) and nondeans (40%) who answered "No" and a lower mean than in Question 17, indicating
greater disagreement on this issue—that the Framework will encourage the development
of resources such as curriculum guides, concept maps, and assessment instruments to
supplement the core set of materials in the frames. Even though the six frames are an
essential part of the Framework, no deans mention the frames in the qualitative data
while the non-deans mention them six times. And, while 63% of the deans and 60% of
the non-deans answered "Yes" on this question, there were no dean responses whose
answers were coded either Advantage: The Framework Will Affect Overall Curriculum or
Challenge: The Framework Does Not Affect Overall Curriculum. In contrast, two nondean responses were coded with this table's Advantage theme and five non-dean
responses were coded with the Challenge theme. Non-dean participant #26, who
answered "Yes" on Question 18 and gave a high rating ("6") for Question 21, wrote that
they had "created institutional outcomes based on the Framework." Non-dean participant
#115, who answered "No" for Question 18 and gave a moderately low rating ("3") for the
Framework's overall impact thought the opposite: "The larger conversation about
integrating information literacy concepts across the curriculum is a long-term effort that
the Framework will not change." However, the majority of the participants thought the
Framework would encourage the development of curriculum guides, concept maps, and
assessment instruments, but only the non-deans discuss this in their responses.

Question 19: Encourage Librarians to Work with Others to Design IL Programs
This is the only question where the deans' mode is higher than the non-dean's
mode. The results show that 34% of the deans thought the Framework would have a
moderately high impact ("5") on encouraging librarians to work with faculty,
departmental or college curriculum committees, instructional designers, staff from
centers for teaching and learning, and others to design information literacy programs in a
holistic way at their institution, while 23% of non-deans thought it would have only a
moderate impact ("4") on this issue. However, even though the quantitative data suggests
that the majority of deans answered "Yes" to this question, none of the dean responses
were coded with the theme Advantage: The Framework Supports Academic Librarian
Collaboration with Discipline Faculty. In contrast, 11 non-dean responses were coded
with this theme. Non-dean participant #131, who gave a high rating ("6") to both
Question 19 and Question 21, wrote "I think the Framework is a huge leap forward for
library instruction and I think it will open doors and start conversations with our
disciplinary collaborators." However, the remainder of the response indicates a presence
of the dialectic, again. "But in general library instruction is still seen as moot or quaint by
many faculty." So, while this participant thinks that the Framework supports
collaboration with discipline faculty, there is the challenge of how IL is perceived by
discipline faculty.
An equal number of dean and non-dean responses were coded as Challenge:
Discipline Faculty Not Committed to the Framework. Dean participant #4, who gave a
moderately high rating ("5") to Question 19 and a moderate rating ("4") to Question 21,
wrote that "applying the Framework means adopting change. There is still a lot of

resistance to change within this organization." The quantitative data indicate that the
deans think the Framework will have a moderately high impact on collaboration with
non-librarians, while the non-deans think it will only have a moderate impact on this
issue, but the issue seems to be more important to non-deans because more of them wrote
about it in their qualitative responses.

This is the only Yes/No question where the mode is a "1" instead of a "2" and
where there is almost an equal split between the "Yes" and "No" answers. Results show
that 47% of deans and 50% of non-deans answered "Yes" and 53% of deans and 50% of
non-deans answered "No." These results indicate that there is a division of opinion on
this issue for the participants of this sample. However, the division is not reflected in the
qualitative data. No dean responses and 11 non-dean responses were coded with the
theme Advantage: The Framework Helps Academic Librarians Think about Information
Literacy, while only one dean response and three non-dean responses were coded with
the theme Challenge: Lack of Commitment to the Framework by Academic Librarians.
Non-dean participant #96, who answered "Yes" to Question 20 and gave a very high

is a controversial issue for academic librarians, but the qualitative data suggests that this

"The Framework is very theoretical and hard to explain to
faculty in a 'sound bite' which is about all they have time to
listen to. We are entirely dependent on the faculty for access
to their classes, and almost all of our classes are one-shot
deals. The previous competency standards were succinct and
easy to explain. We were and are still struggling to reach all
the students on this campus who need this most basic
instruction. The new standards may be useful in the context
of libraries that have credit bearing instruction programs
where they meet the students multiple times. Our faculty do
not want to give up more than one class in a semester for
library instruction if that, so the Framework is just too hard to
articulate and to incorporate. That being said, it may be that
individual librarians may find a few receptive faculty to work
on a broader integration of the framework and its threshold
concepts, etc., but most of the librarians are still trying to get
our students to the most basic level of info lit. I don't think the
framework will have much impact here." (Dean participant
#137; Likert rating given for Question 21 [overall impact]
was "2")

"In our broad programming and learning outcomes we don't
focus on information literacy at our institution as it is an outdated mind set and mode of thinking about how we engage
with information both at the academic and societal levels. It is
unfortunate that ACRL clung to the concept of information
literacy when investigating a way to replace the Standards.
Also, librarians with master's degrees are not taught to a
sufficient level pedagogy and educational theory. No matter
what structure ACRL develops, librarians overall will
struggle with it until they have learned and internalized
pedagogy and educational theory." (Non-dean participant
#54; Likert rating for question 21 [overall impact] was "2")
"Our programme is well established, and while we look
carefully at it annually, the new Framework is great idealistic
theory but does not seem to translate effectively into actual
instruction." (Dean participant #74; Likert rating for Question
21 [overall impact] was "3")
"I think it will impact some librarians, but I don't think the
institution, in general, cares at all about information literacy."
(Non-dean participant #133; Likert rating for Question 21
[overall impact] was "3")
"The institution is fairly large, and we have a lot of
competing initiatives. Outreach and engagement being a top
priority will naturally help to advance the framework, but the
overall extent of impact directly ties to whether or not
librarians make it their top priority when working with
teaching faculty." (Dean participant #95; Likert rating given
for Question 21 [overall impact] was "4")
"It will take more than the Framework to impact library

practices at my institution." (Non-dean participant #31; Likert
rating given for Question 21 [overall impact] was "4")
"I think that the librarians at my university will take a while
to assimilate the Framework concepts into their own
teaching." (Dean participant #64; Likert rating given for
Question 21 [overall impact] was "5")
"Librarians at my institution are faculty and free to teach
utilizing whatever pedagogy they are comfortable with. A
few of us are using the frames, as we had used the standards,
but most are still doing BI [bibliographic instruction]
sessions...we do what we can with what we have." (Non-dean
participant #76; Likert rating given for Question 21 [overall
impact] was "5")
"The Framework already guides library faculty in the
development of their courses. So the Framework does impact
library practices, but will not significantly change them. But,
it will be helpful when discussing instructional assessment
and accreditation." (Dean participant #70; Likert rating given
for Question 21 [overall impact] was "6")
"The language is more transparent to faculty and other nonlibrarian stakeholders. It's [the Framework] easier to use e.g.
"scholarship as a conversation" as a metaphor that faculty will
understand, and thus see value in." (Non-dean participant
#57; Likert rating given for Question 21 [overall impact] was
"6")
"We completely redesigned the required, one-credit course
librarians teach at our institution based on the Framework."

Question 21: Overall Impact
Questions 9 through 20 answered the first research question about levels of
impact for specific issues discussed in the Framework. In addition, quantitative results
gleaned from Question 21 can be used to answer the first research question about the
level of overall impact of the Framework:
1. What level of impact on academic library praxes do library deans, assessment
librarians, and instructional librarians perceive that the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education will have?
Qualitative responses to Question 22, an open-ended question asking participants to
explain and provide examples of why they thought the Framework would have an impact
on library praxes at their institution, were coded and themes were used to answer the third
research question:
3. How do academic library deans, assessment librarians, and instructional
librarians explain their perceptions of the level of impact on academic library
praxes that the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education will
have?
Unlike the tables preceding Table 22, the right side provides exemplars of qualitative
responses in the order of Likert ratings participants gave.
In Question 21, the mean for the deans is 4.78 and the mean for the non-deans is
4.14. If these means are rounded off to the nearest whole number, the mean for the deans
is "5" (moderately high impact) and the mean for the non-deans is "4" (moderate impact).
The grand mean (the mean of both means) is 4.46 or "5" if it is rounded off. So, the
answer to the first research question is that, on average, academic librarians in this

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

184

sample perceived that the Framework would have a moderately high level of impact on
their library praxes.
While the quantitative results indicate that the average participant perceived that
the Framework had a moderately high level of impact on their library praxes, the
qualitative results suggest that participants perceived an almost equal amount of
Framework Advantages (73 responses were coded with Advantage themes) and
Challenges (77 responses were coded with Challenge themes). 57 non-deans (66%) and
16 deans (62%) wrote about Advantages, while 59 non-deans (67%) and 18 deans (69%)
wrote about Challenges. Looking through the exemplars of each level of Likert rating, a
progressive change from Challenges to Advantages can be seen. Non-dean participant
#60, who gave the Framework a very low level ("1") of overall impact, wrote:
The Standards have been the standard for info lit at our institution since 2009.
There is no reason to rock the boat. The librarians will use the ideas in the
Framework to enhance their thinking, but it is not necessary to bring it directly to
others at our institution. It will only confuse them.
Dean participant #31, who gave the Framework a moderate level ("4") of overall impact,
had a more "middle-of-the-road" response: "The overall extent of impact directly ties to
whether or not librarians make it their top priority when working with teaching faculty."
Dean participant #127, who gave the Framework a very high level ("7") of overall
impact, wrote that "we completely redesigned the required, one-credit course librarians
teach at our institution based on the Framework." So, the quantitative results for Question
21 demonstrate that the average participants perceived the Framework to have a
moderately high level of impact on library praxes; this moderately high level of impact

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

185

(as opposed to a low or high level of impact) is explained in the qualitative responses as
being due to an almost equal amount of Framework Advantages and Challenges.
"One-shot" Instruction
Out of the 160 participants who completed surveys without missing data, 125
(78%) worked at institutions where the majority of IL instruction was offered in the
context of "one-shot" sessions; 11 (7%) offered IL in the context of an orientation for
incoming first-year students; 11 (7%) offered IL in the context of both one-shot sessions
and orientation; 13 (8%) offered IL in the context of a credit-bearing general education
requirement. Out of the 138 participants who read the Framework, 107 (78%) worked at
institutions where the majority of IL instruction was offered in the context of one-shot
sessions; 10 (7%) offered IL in the context of an orientation for incoming first-year
students; 10 (7%); 11 (8%) offered IL in the context of a credit-bearing general education
requirement. It is clear that the majority of IL instruction in this sample was offered in the
context of one-shot sessions.
In one-shot sessions, as discussed in Chapter Two, the librarian is little more than
an assistant to the course instructor, a visitor who seldom gets to see how students apply
the skills they are attempting to teach. Within these limitations (e.g., time constraints and
the librarian's primary role as guest lecturer), it is difficult for librarians to develop a
comprehensive program for IL. The Framework recognized that many academic
librarians were currently meeting with students in one-shot sessions and that these were
important in an IL program if there was a systematic integration of them into the
curriculum. But the Framework (Association of College and Research Libraries, January,
2015) stated:

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

186

It is important for librarians and teaching faculty to understand that the
Framework is not designed to be implemented in a single information literacy
session in a student's academic career; it is intended to be developmentally and
systematically integrated into the student's academic program at a variety of
levels. This may take considerable time to implement fully in many institutions.
(p. 15)
In the qualitative responses, the term "one-shot" is used seven times, once by a
dean and six times by non-deans. Non-dean participant #101 wrote that librarians at their
institution were already using the Framework as a guide for developing one-shot sessions
and assessment. One of the Framework Challenge themes was Difficulty with "one-shot"
instruction. Six participants (5 non-deans or 6% and one dean or 4%) wrote about the
challenge of implementing the Framework with "one-shot" sessions, where, due to time
limitations, library instruction is usually restricted to the hows of using research tools,
rather than on the whys of using them. Non-dean participant #86's response stated that
they only had time to cover basic concepts about library use because they offered the
majority of IL instruction in the form of "one-shot" sessions. Non-dean participant #32
wrote:
We are not yet sure how we could use the Framework to support our one-shot
instruction sessions. The Framework is a little overwhelming and intimidating,
so I am unsure that it will really be embraced or change how we do our one-shot
classes.
So, while the quantitative results demonstrate that the majority of IL instruction in this
sample was offered in the context of one-shot sessions, the qualitative results show that

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

187

only a small percentage of respondents in this study (4%) wrote about the challenge of
implementing the Framework with one-shots.
The Standards
Out of the 160 participants who completed surveys without missing data, 135
(84%) currently used the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education. Out of the 138 participants who read the Framework, 121 (88%) currently
used the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, indicating
that the majority of institutions represented by this sample were currently using the
Standards.
One of the Advantage themes was Standards Coexisting. Five participants (4 nondeans or 5% and 1 dean or 4%) expressed the belief that the Framework can coexist with
the 2000 standards. This issue—whether or not to sunset the Standards—has been
controversial. Some ACRL Board members wanted to sunset the Standards immediately,
while other Board members wanted to wait and give institutions time to adopt the
Framework. Dean participant #42 gave the Framework a "4" in terms of overall impact
because their institution was already using both the Framework and the Standards. Nondean participant #41 said they were presently trying "to incorporate all/part of the
Framework along with the old ACRL standards" into their IL program. Non-dean
participant #109 did not think the Framework should replace the Standards. Instead, "the
Frames will serve as an enhanced 'layer' that provides better context surrounding the
ACRL IL Standards from 2000."
One of Challenges themes was Standards Issues and it had three grandchild

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

188

codes (See Appendix E for explanation of grandchild codes): Currently Teaching
Standards, Assessments Based on Standards, Standards Preferred over Framework. Nine
participants (8 non-deans or 9% and 1 dean or 4%), wrote that they were currently
teaching the Standards. Non-dean participant #102 did "not think that we will do away
with many of the lessons developed out of the Standards, nor do I think the Framework
and the Standards are necessarily contradictory documents." Three non-deans (3%) wrote
about basing their assessments on the Standards, and two non-deans (2%) preferred the
Standards over the Framework. Non-dean participant #16 said, "The Framework is really
of very little use at our institution. The 2000 Standards resonated more with our library
faculty and with our partner faculty members in the departments."
It can be surmised, then, that while the majority of the institutions represented in
this sample are currently using the Standards, none of the participants expressed the
specific opinion that the Framework should outright replace the Standards.

Chapter Seven
Discussion and Conclusion
In this chapter, I will first summarize the study goals, methods, and the results of
the qualitative and quantitative data analysis, discuss the implications of the results and
lessons I learned during the process of conducting this research, address the limitations of
this study and future research directions, and conclude with some final thoughts.
Summary of Study Goals
Information literacy (IL) is a survival skill that keeps us from drowning in the
daily flood of information from social media, television, radio, the Internet, and more
traditional sources of information. Anyone with access to the Internet, a minimal amount
of literacy skills, and the ability to tap out words on a Google search can find information
within seconds. However, the emphasis in our information society has changed from
simply finding information to more critical evaluation and selection. From the vast array
of information available at our fingertips, evaluation and selection involves
understanding how, when, and what to select and then how to use it appropriately
(Marshall, 2006).
The IL Competency Standards for Higher Education have had an enormous
impact on the development of IL as a disciplinary science, serving to promote discussions
about IL as an instrument of educational reform and have made it possible for colleges,
universities, and regional accrediting bodies to incorporate IL as a necessary learning
outcome. The Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, written after
the ACRL IL Competency Standards Review Force recommended that the Standards
"should be extensively revised" (Association of College and Research Libraries, June,

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

190

2012, p. 1), was accepted by the ACRL Board in February, 2015. The ACRL recognized
that "the effect of any changes to the ILCSHE [the Standards] would be significant, both
within the library profession and in higher education more broadly (Association of
College and Research Libraries, January, 2015, p. 4). This led to the first problem
statement for this study:


The significant effects (i.e., impact) of changes to the IL Competency Standards
for Higher Education on the library profession and in higher education have yet
to be determined.

Although there are a variety of non-empirical surveys, open forums and blogs about the
Framework, there remained a need to more rigorously study the perceptions of academic
librarians regarding the Framework. This led to the second problem statement:


The perceptions of academic librarians regarding the level of impact that the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education will have on academic
library praxes have yet to be studied.
The purpose of this study was not to evaluate the Framework itself or the

implementation of the Framework. This study was designed to investigate the perceived
level of impact (or the significant effects) that the Framework could have on academic
library and higher education praxes. The significance of this study is this: Just as the
Standards have influenced or otherwise generated educational reform, the Framework
will also be important in educational reform. Just how much it may impact, change or
influence the field of IL depends in part on understanding the perceptions of those most
affected by the change.
This study was intended to offer a contribution to the available literature about

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

191

how the new Framework may serve to influence the ways academic libraries function in
delivering information literacy instruction. A content analysis of IL papers submitted to
the journal, Communications in Information Literacy, between the years 2007-2013,
found that common reviewer criticisms were: (a) poor presentation and development of
ideas, (b) the lack of significant contribution or scientific validity, (c) problems in
methodology, and (d) the anecdotal (e.g., non-empirical) nature of the articles (Hollister,
2014). I hope this study will make a significant and empirical contribution to the library
and information science literature. This study may also be of interest to stakeholders who
are looking at ways that IL is defined, promoted, and taught in higher education academic
libraries. The results of this study could serve to initiate and illuminate conversations
around the Framework and how to approach possible implementation.
Summary of Methods
After selecting participants using a stratified, random sampling method, 138
academic librarians (32 deans and 106 non-deans) were surveyed from public and private
institutions. The institutions spanned across six accrediting regions recognized by the
Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Participants completed a 22-item survey
designed to elicit their perceptions of the Framework's impact. Qualitative data consisted
of answers to an open-ended question on the survey that asked participants to explain and
provide examples of why they thought the Framework will have an impact on the library
praxes at their institution.
Summary of Merged Quantitative and Qualitative Results
Participants were recruited equally from both public and private institutions and
from six accreditation regions. Descriptive statistics and corresponding qualitative themes

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

192

from survey Questions 9 through 20 suggest that, on average, participants agreed that the
Framework will have impact on redesigning IL instruction, the development of IL at their
institution, and the contextualization and integration of IL. The merged data also
indicates there may be differences of opinion between deans and non-deans on the
amount of impact the Framework will have on creating wider conversations about student
learning, scholarship, and assessment. The merged data also points to the following
issues as possibly being controversial amongst academic librarians (deans and non-deans,
alike): whether or not the Framework will promote discussion of key concepts, encourage
thinking about core or portal concepts, redefine the boundaries of what librarians teach
and how they conceptualize the study of IL, and how much it will impact collaboration
with non-librarians. The qualitative data suggests that the Framework's impact on the
development of curriculum guides, concept maps, and assessment instruments may be
more important to non-deans than to deans and that student success initiatives,
knowledge practices, dispositions, and frames may not be at the forefront of academic
librarians' thinking.
The majority of institutions represented in this sample offer IL instruction mainly
in the context of one-shot sessions and are currently using the Standards. Qualitative data
indicates that only a small percentage of participants in this study wrote about the
challenge of implementing the Framework with one-shot sessions, and none of the
participants expressed the opinion that the Framework should replace the Standards.
The descriptive statistics from Question 21 and the results of the correlation
analysis indicate that deans are more likely to give the Framework a higher level of
overall impact than non-deans. On average, deans gave the Framework a moderately high

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

193

rating on level of overall impact, and non-deans gave the Framework a moderate rating of
overall impact. However, if the entire sample is included, the average participant
perceived the Framework to have a moderately high level of impact on their library
praxes. This moderately high level of impact (as opposed to a low or high level of
impact) is explained in the qualitative responses as being due to an almost equal amount
of Framework Advantages and Challenges.
Implications
A year ago, when the first three chapters of this dissertation were written, the
Framework was filed as one of many documents "among the constellation of documents
used by information literacy practitioners" (Williams, 2015). A year later, it appears that
the Framework is now not just a member of a constellation of IL documents. At its ALA
Midwinter meeting on January 11, 2016, the ACRL Board adopted the Framework in
order to "clarify the misunderstanding by members regarding the parliamentarian action
to file at Midwinter 2105" (Association of College and Research Libraries, January,
2016, p. 7). The Board will also be deciding what the future holds for the current
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education at the upcoming ALA
Annual Conference in June of 2016.
Additionally, a reference to the Framework appears in the New Media
Consortium's most recent Horizon Report. The New Media Consortium (NMC) is an
international consortium of more than 250 colleges, universities, and other organizations
devoted to the exploration and development of new media and technologies. According
to the NMC's 2016 Horizon Report, the ACRL's Framework "has established a set of
interconnected core concepts to help campuses better organize ideas about information,

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

194

research, and scholarship into a comprehensive whole" (Johnson et al., 2016, p. 20). This
has had a rippling effect on how the Framework is seen by not just academic librarians,
but also to discipline faculty who read the Horizon Report to "keep up" with the latest
trends and future directions media and technology are taking in higher education. At the
very least, mention of the Framework in the Horizon Report will bring it to the attention
of those who may yet to have even heard about it.
In Chapter One, I wrote about certain points of contention that were recognized
and voiced by ACRL board members during the Board Directors' meetings I and II, that
took place on Saturday, January 31st, and Monday, February 2, 2015 (Payne, 2015,
January 31; Payne, 2015, February 2). Some of the most relevant controversial issues
were the differing opinions from key stakeholders. The varying opinions of what should
or should not be included in the Framework posed a number of challenges. Conflicting
opinions in regards to the Standards coexisting (or not coexisting) with the Framework
were also voiced by many librarians and stakeholders. Because there exists a level of
controversy around the Framework, I concluded in the "Background of the Study" section
of Chapter One that there is a need to study it further. This still holds true as the
Framework continues to gain momentum throughout academia. Indeed, there is plenty of
fertile ground for more research of the Framework's interpretation, integration, and
implementation.
The quantitative results of this study indicate that deans had a tendency to rate the
Framework's impact as higher than non-deans on specific issues (e.g., the redesign of IL
instruction and student success initiatives) as well as on its overall impact. And the
deans—unlike the non-deans—never gave a very low impact rating ("1") to any of the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

195

seven Likert questions. This points to what was written earlier in the literature review—
that organizational positionality impacts worker satisfaction which ultimately impacts job
stress and perceived organizational readiness for change, or "organizational members'
beliefs, attitudes, and intentions regarding the extent to which changes are needed and the
organization's capacity to successfully make those changes" (Armenakis et al., 1993, p.
681). Evidence of job stress appears in this non-dean's response, who gave the
Framework an overall impact of "1":
It's just a bunch of words that make no sense to most people. If you have
to attend workshops and seminars and training sessions just to be able to
understand what the document is supposed to do, it is a failure. I teach 8590 "one-shot" sessions per year, and the framework is not useful to me at
all. I don't know anyone who hasn't expressed frustration with trying to
force it to be of some use.
A non-dean who gave the Framework an overall impact of "3" said, "As a coordinator, it
is a problematic document at best, and looks to make my work life much more difficult
for the next decade, until the next round of hot new things becomes the professional
standard."
This last quote reminds me of my experience as a teacher in K-12. Administrators
were always telling teachers about some "new and improved" way to do things. They
often mandated us to attend workshops and training sessions and then evaluated us on
our incorporation of the "hot new thing" into our lesson plans. For example, when the
standards-based education reform movement began in the nineties, administrators asked
us to write our daily objectives on the board for students. Like a good employee, I wrote

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

196

my objectives on the chalkboard every day, until I realized that the language of the
objectives made no sense to students. So, instead of writing objectives on the board, I
wrote the daily agenda instead—this communicated the daily "objectives" in a way that
was meaningful to students.
Deans wishing to implement the Framework at their institution need to realize that
their employees may have differing perspectives of the Framework. Some—as in this
study—may be very enthusiastic about implementing the Framework. Others may be
more reluctant to embrace it because they have seen a lot of "hot, new things" come and
go. These reluctant employees may also be a valuable source for ideas about how to
integrate the Framework's concepts into their present IL program.
The qualitative results of this study demonstrated the presence of the dialectic.
That is, just as there were differences of opinion in the ACRL Board of Directors'
meetings in 2015, there were also differences of opinion in the qualitative responses of
the participants in this survey. Some of these differences may originate from the
Framework itself, due to some of its own internal contradictions (Seale, 2016). For
example, the Framework rejects the Standards, asserting that "it is based on a cluster of
interconnected core concepts, with flexible options for implementation, rather than on a
set of standards, learning outcomes, or any prescriptive enumeration of skills” (p. 2).
However, within each frame, there is a list of knowledge practices and dispositions:
The lists of knowledge practices and dispositions, which are actions and
behaviours performed by individual learners, are quite lengthy and detailed.
Despite the extensive verbiage in the Framework’s introduction, the knowledge
practices and dispositions appear as standards, learning outcomes, and

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

197

prescriptive enumerations of skills. If the knowledge practices and dispositions
are not intended to be prescriptive, why are they necessary? If they are not
intended to be exhaustive, why are there so many of them, and why are they so
carefully and specifically articulated? The rhetoric of the Framework ultimately
forces it to function as a standard....Moreover, it is a wholesale replacement of
the Standards (which acknowledges its standardness). (p. 84)
The internal contradictions of the Framework may contribute to the differences of
opinions held by respondents of this survey; some wrote that the Standards were
Coexisting with the Framework while others wrote that the Standards were Preferred
over the Framework. This is the tension of the dialectic discussed in Chapter Five. It is
hoped that the presentation of the participants' perceptions of the Framework's assertions
and suggestions and the qualitative Advantage and Challenge themes will contribute to
the ongoing discussion of opposing ideas in order to bring about a synthesis of thought
regarding the Framework.
When I began writing the proposal for this research, the Framework had not yet
been adopted by the ACRL Board of Directors. After a year from proposal to defense, the
"Big So What" (as one of my colleagues phrased it) is about the Standards. Sunsetting the
Framework will be decided at the annual ALA conference this June (2016). My study
results indicated that 88% of the participants were currently using the Standards. Only
one participant indicated that they preferred the Framework over the Standards. "While
our formal instruction and assessment model was built on the standards, our instruction
and teaching efforts emphasize concepts that are defined in the Framework. It serves as a
better description of what we already do. " Five participants expressed the belief that the

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

198

Framework can coexist with the 2000 Standards, and three preferred the Standards over
the Framework. Based on my findings, I will make this prediction: the ACRL Board of
Directors will decide not to sunset the Standards.
Lessons Learned
There are a couple of things that I will do differently when conducting another
study. First, I will never offer "other" as a choice to a question on a survey—at least not
as an answer to a question that I am using as a variable for a quantitative analysis. The
category of "other" has no meaningful "weight." That is, what weight (or score) does one
assign the answer "other" that has meaning in relation to the construct of organizational
positionality? In my survey, the answer "dean" was weighed as "1," the answer
"assessment librarian" was weighed as "2," and the answer "instruction librarian" was
weighed as "3." These weights made sense because they represented the participant's
position within the hierarchy. However, weighing "other" as "4" made no sense because it
implied that those who chose "4" were at the lowest position in the hierarchy.
I have also learned to be more careful when defining critical terms in a study. I
used the ACRL's (n.d.) descriptions of academic library positions when defining the roles
of deans, assessment librarians, and instruction librarians. Since no definition of
assessment librarians was provided, I used the ACRL position description for "Head of
Reference and Instruction—Reference Level II" for assessment librarians and "Reference
and Instruction Librarian—Reference Level I" for instruction librarians. "Reference
Level II" implied a higher place in the hierarchy than "Reference Level I." Definitions of
the two positions differed in these ways: The "Head of Reference and Instruction"
description included the phrases "provides continuing education on pedagogy for all

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

199

teaching librarians," and "position may include Information Literacy/Instructional Design
responsibilities" while the "Reference and Instruction Librarian" description did not
include those two phrases. The "Head of Reference and Instruction" description also
included the phrase "generally this individual has 3-5 years of experience" while the
"Reference and Instruction Librarian" "has 0-1 year of experience."
In my original proposal, I included the phrase "Head of Reference and
Instruction" in the description of the assessment librarian. One of my committee members
commented that "Head of Reference" is not necessarily synonymous with "assessment
librarian," so, I took out the phrase. During the recruitment phase, I searched websites,
organizational charts, and staff listings for assessment librarians, and not Heads of
Reference (it should be noted that only one person who chose "other" described
themselves as a Head of Reference). Perhaps I could have avoided some of the
difficulties I had trying to decide which category (assessment or instruction librarian) to
place the 22 participants who self-identified as "other" if I had done some things
differently. First of all, I should not have used "other" as an answer, and secondly, I
needed to locate and use a definition specifically for assessment librarians.
Limitations
In addition to the limitations previously discussed in Chapter One, an additional
limitation of this study is that deans and non-deans were not equally represented. Of the
138 survey respondents who had read the Framework, 32 (23%) were deans, and 106
77%) were non-deans. If this study is replicated, researchers should attempt to collect
data from an equal amount of deans and non-deans.

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

Future Research Directions
The findings from this study help to contribute to "a big picture" of academic
librarians' perceptions of the Framework's impact. Future research could explore these
findings more in-depth and more holistically. For example, a bounded case study of the
Framework's implementation could explore student perceptions of the Framework,
academic librarians' presentation of the Framework to administrators and discipline
faculty, and instruction librarians' assessment of the six frames at an institution where the
Framework is being implemented. Another case study could compare and contrast two
institutions: one that has replaced the Standards with the Framework, and another
institution that is mapping the Framework to the Standards. Interviews in both case
studies could be conducted with key stakeholders—students, academic librarians, and
discipline faculty—in order to further illuminate participants' perceptions of the
Framework and the impact it has had on information literacy instruction.
Other research could explore the impact of Framework implementation on student
outcomes like IL skills, academic performance, and student retention. A follow-up study
to this research could explore changes in perceptions over time. Given the same survey,
how do the results of the follow-up study compare and contrast to the results of the
present study?
Finally, while the single significant correlation was very weak and the R2 from the
multiple regression accounted for only a small amount of the variance, it should be noted
that the model was still significant. A replication of this study with larger samples and a
more equal proportion of deans and non-deans could determine if these relationships still
held true, but with a larger correlation and a greater R2.

Conclusion
The Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education is represented as a
significant departure from the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education. While many of the participants in this study agreed that the Framework would
have a moderately high impact on their current library praxes, there was a great deal of
disagreement about its challenges and advantages. The ongoing contribution of the
Framework rests upon the dialogical interaction of academic librarians, administrators,
and discipline faculty who are committed to the improvement of information literacy
programs. In order to advance information literacy as an educational reform movement
that improves students' lives by enabling them to critically evaluate and select
information, academic librarians must continually dialogue with those who disagree with
them in the hopes of resolving the conflict of opposing ideas through a reconciliation of
their common truths. This can be accomplished through further study and analysis of the
Framework and information literacy in general. To that end, we can hope that, in the
immortal words of Neil Young:
"Someday,
you'll find
everything you're looking for."

Complete Responses to Open-ended Question by Participant Number
These are the responses to Question 22 of the survey. Responses are given in their
entirety. It should be noted that some participants did not answer Question 22, and those
are indicated by "No answer" as the response. Bracketed numbers indicate the rating
participants gave for the overall level of impact asked in Question 21.
Participant #1:
(Non-dean)

"It has already prompted some conversations about what we will
be doing in changes within those sessions. However, many of those
conversations were already in process - so it will help impact and
build our future information literacy practices, but some of the
process is already taking place." [5]

Participant #2:
(Non-dean)

"The framework resonates with the faculty in our Writing &
Rhetoric program. It closely mirrors their own framework. In
subject areas, the framework will help librarians find the various
'thresholds' students must cross to be information literate in their
chosen area of study." [5]

Participant #3:
(Non-dean)

"We are a consortial library and serve four different institutions."
[4]

Participant #4:
(Dean)

"Applying the framework means adopting change. There is still a
lot of resistance to change within this organization." [4]

Participant #5:
(Non-dean)

"I know that the Framework will affect how some individual
librarians teach (me being one of them), but I don't think that it
will prompt any shift in the larger conversation on our campus.
People don't pay enough attention to the library/librarians for that
to happen. So, that's why I put it in the middle." [4]

Participant #6:
(Non-dean)

"I think my institution bases decisions on the Framework and I
don't really see any change in that." [4]

Participant #7:
(Non-dean)

No answer [6]

Participant #8:
(Non-dean)

"The Framework will be discussed and lead to long-term thinking
about information literacy. I don't think anything at our institution
will change rapidly as it took many years to get the 2000 standards
into discussion and implementation. I do discuss the Frames main
concepts in my IL classes with students in the context of life-long
learning." [4]

Participant #9:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #10:
(Non-dean)

"About five years ago, the Hesburgh Libraries went through a
reorganizational process that essentially "upgraded" our Teaching
& Learning Services." [7]

Participant #11:
(Non-dean)

"I'm in charge of instruction and I will implement it." [7]

Participant #12:
(Non-dean)

"While it will impact how I instruct and assess student learning, I
do not believe that all of my librarian colleagues will feel the same.
Nor do I believe that the university administration or majority of
faculty will appreciate the significance or potential impact of the
Framework." [3]

Participant #13:
(Non-dean)

"I think the framework will help us to refocus our efforts to
implement information literacy instruction. It will help us to shift
the emphasis of our instruction away from tool use and towards
bigger concepts." [5]

Participant #14:
(Non-dean)

"The framework uses a lot of education jargon. I am still trying to
make sense of the document and jargon, so I can imagine the
difficult time a non-education faculty member will have." [4]

Participant #15:
(Non-dean)

"While librarians are fully engaged in this conversation here at
[name of institution], working on interpreting the framework and
integrating it into instruction, our library instruction program will

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

213

keep on doing what it does: trying to be as purposeful and
proactive as possible but in reality responding to whatever needs
come from faculty (who are quite variable in their understanding of
information literacy and its place in our curriculum.)" [4]

Participant #16:
(Non-dean)

"The Framework is really of very little use at our institution. The
2000 Standards resonated more with our library faculty and with
our partner faculty members in the departments. What we are
doing still ties into the standards and the framework is a
supplement that may or may not be helpful in some areas." [3]

Participant #17:
(Non-dean)

"We've started examining our work in light of Concepts instead of
Tool Use." [5]

Participant #18:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #19:
(Non-dean)

"Most of us will continue to teach practical search strategies and
introduce library tools and concepts just as we did before." [2]

Participant #20:
(Dean)

"At present, the organization is simply trying to keep up with
current demand. This is a temporary situation that should stabilize
within 12 months." [4]

Participant #21:
(Dean)

"The Framework is not that different from what we already do.
Librarians at this institution are full members of the faculty and
there is already a good level of collaboration on research and
instruction." [5]

Participant #22:
(Non-dean)

"It will depend on new leadership in the library as well as new
initiatives (buildings, gen ed, and strategic planning) across
campus." [4]

Participant #23:
(Non-dean)

"Some may be ready to embrace a new way of thinking about
information literacy, which is how I think of the Framework.
Those who embrace it will make changes and that will impact

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

214

library practices at our institution; however, some may not and so I
can give it only a 5." [5]

Participant #24:
(Non-dean)

"It's just a bunch of words that make no sense to most people. If
you have to attend workshops and seminars and training sessions
just to be able to understand what the document is supposed to do,
it is a failure. I teach 85-90 'one shot' sessions per year, and the
framework is not useful to me at all. I don't know anyone who
hasn't expressed frustration with trying to force it to be of some
use." [1]

Participant #25:
(Non-dean)

"We'll use the Framework because it is the new model. I don't
really like it though. It is a wordy overblown document that looks
impressive but isn't." [4]

Participant #26:
(Non-dean)

"We have created institutional outcomes based on the Framework.
These are likely to become implemented across the curriculum,
which is a change to library practices at our institution thus far."
[6]

Participant #27:
(Non-dean)

"Because I don't find that neither the Instruction Librarian nor the
Dean of Libraries are interested. Furthermore, this is all too
complex. It has to be a two way street. The success of such
initiative depends on the level of faculty's commitment, image of
the library, and value they place on the library. The way I see it,
most libraries don't work at the partnership level with faculty. We
are seen as mere service providers and collaborators. Some
libraries do work on the embedment level. For this to work, faculty
need to be engaged as partners. Ours certainly don't do that, and
obviously, is our fault and lack of commitment towards the
partnership approach. It looks like you are asking the wrong
questions to start off with. I have a feeling that a better approach
would be to ask what librarian's think about this 2015 Framework.
You are already assuming that libraries are using it." [1]

Participant #28:
(Non-deans)

"Initial conversations with my colleagues, as well as my in-depth
reading and thinking about the framework, do indicate it has some
potential to adjust some instruction, but overall not a with all
librarians or not in large ways." [3]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

215

Participant #29:
(Non-dean)

"In a practical sense, the new framework doesn't offer much new
above what we currently are doing." [2]

Participant #30:
(Non-dean)

"The language used in the Framework alienated many librarians.
Good concept, poor execution." [3]

Participant #31:
(Non-dean)

"It will take more than the Framework to impact library practices
at my institution." [4]

Participant #32:
(Non-dean)

"We are not yet sure how we could use the Framework to support
our one-shot instruction sessions. The Framework is a little
overwhelming and intimidating, so I am unsure that it will really
be embraced or change how we do our one-shot classes." [4]

Participant #33:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #34:
(Non-dean)

"We have written program-level outcomes based on the framework
for our instruction program so I think we have opened the door to
shifting how we think about this topic. Time will tell how much is
put into practice." [5]

Participant #35:
(Non-dean)

"Our faculty and administration have no idea what this Framework
is and are not interested in librarians being more involved with the
curriculum than we already are. They have other priorities." [1]

Participant #36:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #37:
(Dean)

"I think it has great potential, and I know we are familiar with it.
However, I am uncertain that our particular institutions will be able
to develop this potential. We have a small staff, and it is often
difficult for us to work on the big picture." [4]

Participant #38:
(Non-dean)

"Colleagues and I have already shared the framework with a
number of faculty members, and the concepts work extremely well
with developing critical thinking, being able to aggregate

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

216

information, produce research, as well as assist students after they
leave the university. Many of these concepts have inspired those in
the library to produce research concerning how students gather
information and what we can do with the faculty to encourage
students to evaluate, aggregate, and produce information." [6]

Participant #39:
(Dean)

"It's a bench mark for us to redesign and implement our
information literacy program in the future." [6]

Participant #40:
(Dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #41:
(Non-dean)

"We are presently reviewing our current IL program to incorporate
all/part of the frameworks along with the old ACRL standards into
the program." [6]

Participant #42:
(Dean)

"I'm not sure how much impact it will have, as we are currently
using both the Framework and the earlier Standards to do many of
the things you ask about in previous questions. For example, we
are already heavily invested in the assessment of learning with
regard to Information Literacy. I'm not sure it is likely to have
much impact." [4]

Participant #43:
(Non-dean)

"I think that the librarians at my institution are somewhat skeptical
about the overall impact of the framework on information literacy
instruction. The recent well-publicized critiques of the framework
have led some of my colleagues to be skeptical about the
framework's utility, though we did use it to redesign the course
objectives for our credit bearing IL course." [2]

Participant #44:
(Non-dean)

"I think the Framework is a powerful document that brings
information literacy instruction out of the library and back into the
campus more widely, as it was always meant to exist." [6]

Participant #45:
(Non-dean)

"I think the Framework has the potential to transform information
literacy instruction but the incorporation at the institution will
depend on the willingness and openness of teaching faculty." [4]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

217

Participant #46:
(Non-dean)

"While our formal instruction and assessment model was built on
the standards, our instruction and teaching efforts emphasize
concepts that are defined in the Framework. It serves as a better
description of what we already do." [5]

Participant #47:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #48:
(Dean)

"The framework is good but I think that librarians may have a
difficult time developing concrete experience and having the
confidence to move outside the 2000 definitions." [5]

Participant #49:
(Non-dean)

"Not sure yet." [4]

Participant #50:
(Non-dean)

"Framework provides ideas/language that will help librarians do
what we already do." [4]

Participant #51:
(Non-dean)

"I think that [name of institution] is very slow to integrate new
ideas into the curriculum. We are an extremely top heavy
institution and as such have very few young librarians at our
institution. Until the guard changes, I don't think much will
change." [4]

Participant #52:
(Non-dean)

"Our librarians have no formal connection into the curricular
structure of the institution or of departments." [3]

Participant #53:
(Non-dean)

"The framework has already impacted how I work with the first
year writing faculty and how the library fits into their curriculum
and outcomes." [7]

Participant #54:
(Non-dean)

"In our broad programming and learning outcomes we don't focus
on information literacy at our institution as it is an out-dated mind
set and mode of thinking about how we engage with information
both at the academic and societal levels. It is unfortunate that
ACRL clung to the concept of information literacy when
investigating a way to replace the standards. Also, librarians with
master's degrees are not taught to a sufficient level pedagogy and

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

218

educational theory. No matter what structure ACRL develops,
librarians overall will struggle with it until they have learned and
internalized pedagogy and educational theory." [2]

Participant #55:
(Non-dean)

"The Framework will be influential in impacting practice to the
extent non-library faculty engage with the standards. If it remains a
'domain' of librarians - then the IL work will not find a wider
distribution." [5]

Participant #56:
(Non-dean)

"My impression here is that we don't really make decisions based
on the Framework--that is, we don't have copies of it up to refer to,
and we don't use it in making decisions about our teaching.
Individually, though, I think we're all doing somewhat frameworky things on our own--but that's only because the Framework is so
open to interpretation and because some of it (like its emphasis on
the value of critical thinking and collaboration) is obvious and
accepted practice in education." [2]

Participant #57:
(Non-dean)

"The language is more transparent to faculty and other nonlibrarian stakeholders. It's easier to use e.g. 'scholarship as a
conversation' as a metaphor that faculty will understand, and thus
see value in." [6]

Participant #58:
(Non-dean)

"We first need to figure out how we will apply the framework to
our instruction and then agree on it. It's not easy to engage faculty
in discussions about information literacy because many perceive it
as an education fad, or they are trying to cover content and don't
see librarians as partners with their curriculum. I think it will have
limited impact in the near future." [5]

Participant #59:
(Dean)

"Just because librarians understand the importance of the
framework for information literacy doesn't mean the administration
will change their view of the library's role in supporting the
curriculum." [4]

Participant #60:
(Non-dean)

"The Standards have been the standard for info lit at our institution
since 2009. There is no reason to rock the boat. The librarians will
use the ideas in the framework to enhance their thinking, but it is
not necessary to bring it directly to others at our institution. It will
only confuse them." [1]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

219

Participant #61:
(Non-dean)

"The Framework is a useful way of looking at things and can help
us shape our future policy progress as we have already adopted IL
SLOs based on the ACRL IL Standards that our faculty have
embraced and are required for General Education SLO outcomes
and units. It will take time and is a process not just flipping a
switch." [4]

Participant #62:
(Dean)

"The framework repositions information literacy as transferable
skills. Most of our faculty are not aware of the many topics we
teach, presuming that we only cover 'how to search.' The new
framework enables faculty to envision research as a critical
thinking process rather than a set of procedural tasks. That being
said, our library developed an instructional program that follows
the new framework a few years ago, so it may not change our
instructional approach as much as it will legitimize our
instructional approach." [5]

Participant #63:
(Dean)

"Our instruction librarians are currently writing/revising our IL
plan and the Framework will influence that; it will also influence
an IL OA text currently in beta." [5]

Participant #64:
(Dean)

"I think that the librarians at my university will take a while to
assimilate the framework concepts into their own teaching." [5]

Participant #65:
(Non-dean)

"The framework gives us language to talk about information
literacy beyond the standards which were almost more of a process
- if you do step one, step two, and so on, you are information
literate. The Framework helps us talk with faculty and students
about the complexities of information and the skills needed to
navigate an information-laden world." [7]

Participant #66:
(Non-dean)

"While the Framework and its underlying theory are excellent
discussion topics for professional librarians and disciplinary
faculty, they do not translate information literacy concepts to
students any better than the standards already do. The Framework
is an abstract concept, and you have to be fairly adept as a
researcher before you can understand the abstraction. An
undergraduate is not going to connect with the concepts of the
framework. So what do you have to do in order to help them make
that connection? You have to help them learn the fundamental
research skills before they will be able to think of research at a

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

220

higher level. The cognitive threshold theory on which the
Framework is based was intended to explain the moment one
understands a pivotal concept within a discipline. Information
Literacy is not a standalone discipline. Information Literacy overarches all the disciplines. We want our students to be information
literate in their discipline." [1]

Participant #67:
(Non-dean)

"I think the Framework provides a lot of possibilities for new
directions that librarians can take this. It's a tool they can use and a
supporting philosophy." [6]

Participant #68:
(Non-dean)

"We are at the beginning of building a comprehensive information
literacy program at the University of Rochester so the process is a
bit slow going. We are enhancing the current staff with new
librarians who have experience with heavy teaching loads and are
very familiar with the framework, so as we gain some ground with
fostering stronger teaching relationships with our faculty, the
framework is taking a bit of a backseat. We first need to assess
what has been taught in the past year or so before we can begin to
establish common goals (like for the freshmen writing course) or
look into course mapping. All in time." [5]

Participant #69:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [6]

Participant #70:
(Dean)

"The framework already guides Library faculty in the development
of their courses. So the framework does impact library practices,
but will not significantly change them. But, it will be helpful when
discussing instructional assessment and accreditation." [6]

Participant #71:
(Non-dean)

"Folks interested and involved in redesigning our first year
experience course are all about threshold concepts. They want to
include 'critical information literacy' into this curriculum, and
using the framework as a way to do this work makes sense." [4]

Participant #72:
(Non-dean)

"I think the framework is a good disciplinary document but it
mostly help higher level understandings of what we do, not really
change the amount or level of what we are already doing." [4]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

Participant #73:
(Dean)

No answer. [6]

Participant #74:
(Dean)

"Our programme is well established, and while we look carefully
at it annually, the new framework is great idealistic theory but does
not seem to translate effectively into actual instruction." [3]

Participant #75:
(Dean)

"It will open the eyes for the librarians. I can't promise it will with
faculty." [6]

Participant #76:
(Non-dean)

"Librarians at my institution are faculty and free to teach utilizing
whatever pedagogy they are comfortable with. A few of us are
using the frames, as we had used the standards, but most are still
doing BI sessions...we do what we can with what we have." [5]

Participant #77:
(Non-dean)

"I think the librarians at my institution, as well as elsewhere, have
long known information literacy doesn't need to be taught in the
very structured Standards and that the Framework is really just
describing the sea of change of thinking about these things that has
already occurred." [2]

Participant #78:
(Dean)

"I WANT it to work, but I am very afraid it is too ephemeral, hard
to pin down, difficult to work with and talk about. It will be a real
challenge but it is an opportunity to make needed changes. Not
sure whether to trumpet it as a big huge change or quietly make
modifications at my institution. The uncertainty and ambiguity is
disconcerting, but we'll do what we can with it. Conversations with
new librarians about it is tough and even tougher with experienced
librarians." [4]

Participant #79:
(Non-dean)

"Faculty are uniformly reluctant to turn over any part of their
curriculum to librarians to design or teach. Only small inroads with
administrators is likely to change." [4]

Participant #80:
(Non-dean)

"I think the way the framework is formatted does not easily
translate into 'library practices' in a way that the faculty will
understand. Due to the lack of concretes, we are going to spend
most of the conversation around the new framework trying to

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

222

defend the library's place in the curriculum and any new practices
the framework inspires." [5]

Participant #81:
(Non-dean)

"The institution does not have much appetite for requirements and
standards when it comes to IL." [2]

Participant #82:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #83:
(Non-dean)

"I think the framework will have more impact on how librarians
think about information literacy and how they introduce the subject
with faculty. I am not sure the extent to which faculty will embrace
the framework itself; rather it will impact how librarians think and
work with faculty." [5]

Participant #84:
(Dean)

No answer. [6]

Participant #85:
(Non-dean)

"We are looking for ways to be more involved in the research
process for our institution and help with information literacy
understanding across the curriculum. I have already introduced the
framework to my faculty. It is in language that is clear and easy to
implement. Many said they could or already did include IL in their
coursework...the framework would make it easier to know which
concepts should be included." [5]

Participant #86:
(Non-dean)

"Since my library mostly teaches 'one-shot' sessions, we only have
time to cover the most basic concepts about using the library." [2]

Participant #87:
(Dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #88:
(Non-dean)

"Eventually it will impact our practices since the Frames 'go
further' than the current standards." [5]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

223

Participant #89:
(Non-dean)

"Many of my colleagues are already rethinking practice based on
the Framework. At the same time, it gums up the work of
assessment, giving us almost nothing concrete to report on/back to
our Dean in the tightening race for resources at my university.
Pitched as a tool for helping librarians collaborate with faculty, I
think the FW fails to account for the difficulties many of us have in
getting faculty to work with us, not because of the failure of our
imagination, but because of the intense demands on teaching
faculty, librarians, administrators, and others in a struggling higher
ed institution. For some individual librarians, the FW can spark
things. As a coordinator, it is a problematic document at best, and
looks to make my work life much more difficult for the next
decade, until the next round of hot new things becomes the
professional standard." [3]

Participant #90:
(Non-dean)

"I think the framework will facilitate better conversations with
faculty across disciplines. The more fundamental challenge of
bringing the larger institution to adopt a culture of assessment and
to think programmatically must happen first." [5]

Participant #91:
(Dean)

"We are using the framework as a tool for scaffolding online
lessons to teach metaliteracy skills across multiple institutions." [6]

Participant #92:
(Non-dean)

"I think there are many factors involved in changing library
practices. So, overall, it will have an impact, but there are always
other forces at work against change." [4]

Participant #94:
(Dean)

No answer. [4]

Participant #95:
(Dean)

"The institution is fairly large, and we have a lot of competing
initiatives. Outreach and engagement being a top priority will
naturally help to advance the framework, but the overall extent of
impact directly ties to whether or not librarians make it their top
priority when working with teaching faculty." [4]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

224

Participant #96:
(Non-dean)

"The faculty in the library department at my institution are already
rethinking their approaches to instruction based on their
exploration of the Framework. This will continue to happen going
forward." [7]

Participant #97:
(Non-dean)

"More explicit impact in documentary evidential disciplines, less
so in object evidential disciplines. English lit studying Shakespeare
will engage more than biology students studying crickets." [5]

Participant #98:
(Non-dean)

"We have already implemented much of the Framework into our
information literacy. So it has changed it, but there will be not
much future impact." [4]

Participant #99:
(Dean)

"The Framework will have some influence on directing the
discussion of and in planning for information literacy instruction."
[5]

Participant #100
(Non-dean)

"The content of IL is the same. This provides a new POV.
Currently librarians at my institution are not willing to change their
own POV to the framework's. It will provide some language to
outreach with faculty -- new conversation piece -- but not a
revolutionary one." [3]

Participant #101:
(Non-dean)

"I selected this overall extent because librarians are already using
the Framework as a guide for one-shot instruction sessions and
assessment practices." [6]

Participant #102:
(Non-dean)

"I think that the Framework offers worthwhile discussion points
and serves as a useful document to contextualize the foundation of
what we are talking about when we talk about information literacy.
However, I do not think that we will do away with many of the
lessons developed out of the Standards, nor do I think the
Framework and the Standards are necessarily contradictory
documents." [3]

Participant #103:
(Non-dean)

"I think that our librarians will use the new framework to guide our
instruction practices, but the nature of our instruction (one shots)
means that most instruction is still skill-based." [5]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

225

Participant #104:
(Non-dean)

"We have an extensive one shot program, 350 sessions and 2,000
consultations per year. The elements of the earlier standards and
the philosophical discussion of the newer framework are implicit
in our work without our dwelling or focusing on either." [2]

Participant #105:
(Non-dean)

"Since we already had developed a holistic information literacy
program at our institution we do not think the framework will
impact our practices because we have been able to create great
collaboration within our institution that maybe others have not."
[3]

Participant #106:
(Non-dean)

"Our Library is moving in many of the directions outlined in the
Framework, but the majority of our present Library faculty will be
eligible for retirement in the next five years. The continuation of
these initiatives will depend in large part on remaining and new
academic librarians at our institution." [4]

Participant #107:
(Dean)

"We are a small school and library is understaffed. We can be
aware of the Framework and communicate it but whether or not
we'll have the funding or staff to make major changes is doubtful."
[5]

Participant #108:
(Non-dean)

"Enlivens librarian discussions about what we're doing. Gives us
an opportunity to discuss IL on campus in a language that some
departmental faculty are familiar with." [5]

Participant #109:
(Non-dean)

"The Frames will serve as an enhanced 'layer' that provides better
context surrounding the ACRL IL Standards from 2000. Although
I do not think the Frames should replace the old Standards
outrightly." [5]

Participant #110:
(Non-dean)

"At [name of institution], information literacy is one of three
foundational goals along with critical thinking and communication
(oral and written) that are a part of our university studies goal
strands and proficiencies. These are a part of both our general
education curriculum and upper division and graduate curriculum.
The information literacy goals and proficiencies were based on the
ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education in 2000. They have been a part of our curriculum since

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

226

2006. We currently base a major assessment component for our
institution on our information literacy proficiencies. A major
objection to the Framework is that the outcomes and proficiencies
are poorly written. They are not written for assessment activities.
For example, what outcome would you be able to assess from the
following: Understand that many disciplines have acknowledged
authorities in the sense of well-known scholars and publications
that are widely considered standard. How would you assess a
students ability to 'understand that many disciplines have
acknowledged authorities in the sense of well-known scholars and
publications?' This problem is rampant in the Framework whether
the focus is on knowledge practices or dispositions. I really hate to
say this, but the entire Framework seems to have been developed
without any context of the previously well-written outcomes that
many institutions embedded within the university curriculum.
So while we talk about the Framework at our institution because
there is a lot of talk beyond at conferences and such, the usefulness
of the Framework at an institution that concentrates on assessment
of student learning of information literacy outcomes is little to
none." [1]

Participant #111:
(Dean)

"The framework is an inbred process that has left little room for a
grassroots student-faculty-new literary dyad that is needed for a
real open conversation on the definition of literacy teaching in the
21st century." [2]

Participant #112:
(Non-dean)

"I am an idealist and would like to think that our instructional
librarians will keep an open mind to the framework. However, we
have many librarians who resist change and don't want to
understand the effectiveness and purpose of the framework to help
in collaborative efforts with 'subject-specific' teaching faculty (and
vice-versa)." [5]

Participant #113:
(Non-dean)

"I don't think much will change." [3]

Participant #114:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [2]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

227

Participant #115:
(Non-dean)

"I think that the framework will help librarians think more about
designing their own assignments and activities, but I think the
larger conversation about integrating information literacy concepts
across the curriculum is a long-term effort that the framework will
not change." [3]

Participant #116:
(Non-dean)

"Some will be more 'on board' than others." [5]

Participant #117:
(Dean)

"With multiple planning and assessment strategies going on all
over campus our ability to engage faculty in looking at, or thinking
about, the framework will, in my opinion, be very limited. They
may impact our development of hybrid learning materials but I am
not sure we'll get much traction from anyone outside the library."
[4]

Participant #118:
(Non-dean)

"We're moving even further away from teaching databases to
teaching lifelong critical thinking approaches to information, and
the threshold concepts in the Framework have provided ideas of
what those approaches might be. However, our one-shot system is
less conducive to developing these sorts of understandings, so it
will take some time to figure out how to more fully integrate those
into the institution. Also, the information literacy part of our
institution's core curriculum was developed based on the standards,
and we're still beholden to that, so we can't depart from that too
radically. We also need to work within the ideals of our accrediting
body." [5]

Participant #119:
(Dean)

"The framework is a nice bit of guidance, but is too broad to cause
a re-think and overhaul of information literacy teaching that we
have been doing for some time now. It is a useful document, but
really doesn't change anything for us, and is not known among any
of the non-librarian communities with which we interact. Impact
will be modest at best." [4]

Participant #120:
(Non-dean)

"The overall institution will struggle to support these new
framework, with too many part time faculty and budgetary cuts."
[3]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

228

Participant #121:
(Non-dean)

"The move away from 'bullet point' learning outcomes and toward
a richer conceptual understanding of the context in which
information literacy operates is a huge step forward. As an
example, I can now show students results from a single Google
Scholar search that illustrate the 'back and forth' of research
replication and the notion of 'scholarship of conversation' to show
more richly the function of a scholarly research study and where it
fits in to advance human understanding. There was no room in the
former competencies to have this type of rich discussion." [5]

Participant #122:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [2]

Participant #123:
(Non-dean)

"My opinion of the Framework is that it is a logical tool for
instruction design. I do not perceive it as a radical change in how
we do things." [5]

Participant #124:
(Non-dean)

"Practices are so ingrained within the library department and we
don't have much influence on curriculum. I believe things will stay
as is despite the new framework." [3]

Participant #125:
(Non-dean)

"The framework provides a different, big picture way of
contextualizing the work we already do. It will allow us to
integrate ourselves further into the curriculum, but the essential
methods we use are unlikely to change based on the Framework."
[4]

Participant #126:
(Non-dean)

"We'll see a minor shift in practices, but have been advancing
many of the concepts in the frames for quite a while. Primary
benefit will be in promoting the value of information literacy and
the library with faculty and administrators." [2]

Participant #127:
(Dean)

"We completely redesigned the required, one-credit course
librarians teach at our institution based on the Framework." [7]

Participant #128:
(Dean)

"I know we will use the framework for our instruction and
designing our curriculum." [6]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

229

Participant #129:
(Non-dean)

"I think the framework will help us connect what we do and the
needs of the teaching faculty." [6]

Participant #130:
(Non-dean)

"We spent many years educating faculty and working internally
with the standards. We are prepared to update and revise that work
based on the Framework." [6]

Participant #131:
(Non-dean)

"I think the Framework is a huge leap forward for library
instruction and I think it will open doors and start conversations
with our disciplinary collaborators, but in general library
instruction is still seen as moot or quaint by many faculty. We'll
start with our historical partners and work out from there." [6]

Participant #132:
(Non-dean)

"Our library has recently completed a comprehensive library
renovation project that includes the construction of two large, very
high-tech active learning classrooms. Those classrooms were
planned to address new ideas and practices consistent with
standards created in ACRL's newest Framework, and I think that
they--along with the guidelines of the Framework itself--will be
absolutely transformational in the ways that we teach our students
to obtain information." [5]

Participant #133:
(Non-dean)

"I think it will impact some librarians, but I don't think the
institution, in general, cares at all about information literacy." [3]

Participant #134:
(Dean)

"It's already made an impact, we've designed our curriculum
around it, and we use it in our assessment practices, and it came at
a time when the University as a whole was working on these
things, so librarians have been invited to speak to other faculty
about how we are using this framework, and those talks have been
well received." [6]

Participant #135:
(Non-dean)

No answer. [5]

Participant #136:
(Non-dean)

"I think that for my personal use (my subject specialties, online
learners, etc) it will have a big impact. However, our librarians
have a lot of latitude in how they handle instruction, and many are
happy with the way they have always done things." [5]

PERCEPTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK

230

Participant #137:
(Dean)

"The framework is very theoretical and hard to explain to faculty
in a 'sound bite' which is about all they have time to listen to. We
are entirely dependent on the faculty for access to their classes, and
almost all of our classes are one-shot deals. The previous
competency standards were succinct and easy to explain. We were
and are still struggling to reach all the students on this campus who
need this most basic instruction. The new standards may be useful
in the context of libraries that have credit bearing instruction
programs where they meet the students multiple times. Our faculty
do not want to give up more than one class in a semester for library
instruction if that, so the framework is just too hard to articulate
and to incorporate. That being said, it may be that individual
librarians may find a few receptive faculty to work on a broader
integration of the framework and its threshold concepts, etc., but
most of the librarians are still trying to get our students to the most
basic level of info lit. I don't think the framework will have much
impact here." [2]

Participant #138:
(Non-dean)

"My institution is slow to catch on the any form of change. We
spend a lot of time talking about things before we actually make
any attempt at implementing something. We talked about the
Framework as a group of instruction librarians about 7 months ago,
but then never spoke of it again as a group." [3]

Appendix E
Figures and Tables for Chapter Five
There are three types of codes in the code hierarchy. "Parent" codes represent the
overarching and conceptually distinct themes of this study, while "child" codes delineate
sub-themes within the larger themes and provide more details about their parent codes.
"Grandchild" codes further elaborate the child codes, breaking them into sub-themes and
providing the richest level of detail. For example, in the parent code Advantages there are
three child codes (Useful, Implementation Achievements, and Conceptual Lens), the first
two of which have grandchildren codes (e.g., Encourages Discussion is a grandchild of
Useful).
In Chapter Five, there is a pair of figures about the two parent codes—Advantages
and Challenges. In this appendix, there are pairs of figures illustrating data about the
Advantages child codes, after which come the grandchildren codes for these Advantage
child codes. In each pair of figures, the total amount of answers for each code is
presented in the first figure (purple and/or orange), and, in the next figure, the number of
answers by position (deans and non-deans) are presented. For example, in Figure E2, the
blue bar next to Useful represents the total amount of non-dean answers containing this
theme (45) while the red bar underneath represents the total amount of dean answers (10).
At the end of this appendix are two tables describing the percentage of responses for
child and grandchild codes by position (deans and non-deans).

The revised draft minutes of the midwinter ACRL Board of Directors Meeting II, on
Monday, February 2, 2015, stated that:
There was some support from the Board for sunsetting the standards immediately,
but overall the Board felt that people need additional time to adopt the framework.
The Board would like to review sunsetting the standards in eighteen months at
Annual Conference 2016. (p. 6)
