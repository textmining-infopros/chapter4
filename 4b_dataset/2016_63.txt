ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Measuring Information Appetite:
The Desire to Spend Time with Information, Engaging in Consumption, Dissemination,
and Creation of Information for Personal Reasons
by SOO-YEON HWANG

Dissertation Director:
Daniel O. O’Connor

This dissertation stemmed from the question about when individuals are satisfied
with information. It attempts to answer the question from the perspective of information
appetite, i.e. the desire to spend time with information, expressed in the amount of time
spent engaging in personal information practices (PIPs: consumption, dissemination, and
creation of information for personal reasons).
Studied here are the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) dataset collected by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and a survey dataset collected on Amazon Mechanical
Turk (MTurk). This dissertation presents analyses and a discussion of findings of the
ATUS dataset, a description of the method of collecting the MTurk dataset, and analyses
and a discussion of findings of the MTurk dataset.
Two propositions about information appetite (IA) were made, and both were
supported by the datasets. The first proposition was that individuals have varying degrees
of IA, as measured by the amount of time spent engaging in PIPs, which was supported
ii

by the ATUS and the MTurk data. The second proposition was that an individual has
different IAs for different topical areas, which was supported by the MTurk data.
The study identified a small group of people who spent much time for PIPs,
namely a high IA group. In addition to PIPs, the high IA group spent more time with their
interested topics than the regular group did. As for what affects spending time for PIPs,
having free time (e.g. not working/not having a job, or evenings and weekends) was
found to be an important factor.
The dissertation ends with a discussion of implications, limitations and
suggestions for future studies.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Information seekers often exhibit different reactions to a search that, for example,
results in twenty pages. Some might be happy with whatever is on the very top of the first
page, some might check the first few pages, and some might end up reading through the
entire twenty pages of results. One question asked of this is: when are they satisfied with
the information they have and would stop searching?
One way this question was tackled in the past is studying relevance in information
retrieval. The idea is that people seek information that maximizes the relevance via an
evaluation of the match between the search query and the result. This could be viewed as
a rational actor model of human behavior: it assumes that people are rational and make
optimal choices based on their objectives in order to maximize utility – which is
relevance in this case. So, according to this model, users will continue to search until the
most relevant result is found, or if there is time constraint, will settle with the result that
is the most relevant enough (Zach, 2005).
Another approach is information overload in that people would stop information
seeking when they reach a state of information overload at some point (Savolainen, 2006,
pp. 116–118). Information overload is an individual’s state when there is excessive
communication and information input (Rogers, 1986, p. 181). One popular method to
determine the state of information overload is by the amount of information and the
available time to process: It is a simple rule-based model in that if an individual cannot
process all the required information in the given time period, that person is in a state of
information overload (Eppler & Mengis, 2004, pp. 326–328). This model may not
explain the whole picture, though. There are more causes to information overload, such

2
as personal attributes (e.g. skills, experience, and motivation), the nature of information
itself (e.g. diversity, ambiguity, novelty, complexity, etc.), the type of tasks to be
completed, the design of the organization one works in (if the information seeking is
work-related), and the information technology used (Eppler & Mengis, 2004, pp. 335–
336).
In another view of information overload, when an individual feels like being
overloaded with information, a selective consumption of information begins: what
someone “needs to know” takes priority over what is “nice to know” (Paisley, 1993, p.
232). From the perspective of a behavioral model, however, the boundary between “need
to know” and “nice to know” starts to blur. A behavioral model recognizes that actions
such as decision-making are often highly influenced by irrational and contextual factors
such as emotion (Naqvi, Shiv, & Bechara, 2006). For example, addiction portrays an
individual’s inability to admit and/or stick to optimal choices. In terms of information
seeking, this explains why some people simply cannot stop consuming information (e.g.
reading), spending more time and energy than they can afford.
In light of the above and the advent of mobile information communication
technologies, the question of when individuals are satisfied enough with information
takes a new twist. We now live in an age of almost infinite amount of information at our
fingertips thanks to portable, ubiquitous, and networked technologies. Therefore, when
there is no limit to the amount of information one can consume, studying when users feel
content with information, their “information appetite” in other words, offers a new
perspective for understanding information behavior.

3
Appetite is defined as “the desire to eat” according to the Encyclopedia Britannica
(“Appetite (diet),” 2015). Britannica also says the following about appetite:
Appetite is often associated with the desire to eat particular foods based on their
smell, flavour, appearance, and appeal; this is a primary factor separating appetite
from the primary motive of hunger. In addition, a person may be totally filled
with food from a meal and still have an “appetite” for dessert. Furthermore,
appetite may be increased or diminished depending on pleasant or unpleasant
experiences associated with certain foods.
From the quote above, it is easy to find the parallel between food and information
in terms of appetite. Just as appetite is different from hunger, information appetite is not
the same as hunger for information: it is triggered more by pleasurable appeal (e.g.
personal hobby) than by required needs (e.g. work assignment). In addition, one can
argue that those with voracious information appetite on a certain topic would keep
consuming information on the topic, sometimes spending more time than they can afford,
unlike those with lower appetite levels. Moreover, an individual’s information appetite on
a particular topic may increase or decrease over time for various reasons.
Studying information appetite offers several new academic and commercial
research opportunities. First, it may explain the individual differences in emotional
response to information overload in that arrival of new information causes anxiety in
some, but it fills the need for stimulus with others (Bawden & Robinson, 2009, p. 185;
Case, 2012, p. 119). Also, it would be interesting to see if there is any connection
between information appetite and productivity: would those with high information
appetite make more productive workers, or would they be viewed more as procrastinators?
In terms of information gatekeepers such as those who write stock newsletters or
bloggers offering product recommendations, would their information appetite affect what
they choose to write about? One may also consider the effect of one’s information

4
appetite on selective exposure (i.e. the tendency to favor information that reinforces preexisting viewpoints and avoid information that contradicts them) to political campaigns,
for instance. For online advertising agencies and ad-supported services, finding out
whether information appetite affects a user’s retention rate – the amount of time spent on
a website – would yield valuable marketing data.
Therefore, information appetite lends a new insight into the study of information
behavior. Some scholars posit that an individual has an implicit knowledge of his or her
cognitive capacity of information load (Case, 2012, pp. 97–98). In other words, just as
people start eating when they are hungry and stop when they are full, they would do the
same with information. However, it is also well known that when it comes to eating food,
not everyone behaves rationally every time. Decision making is often influenced by
irrational and contextual factors such as emotion (Naqvi et al., 2006) as shown in
emotional eating – eating for emotional reasons, not for physical hunger. Likewise,
information appetite may explain why some individuals tend to spend more time and
energy to seek out information than others do.
Furthermore, for those with higher information appetite, the amount of available
information (as discussed in determining the state of information overload) would be
irrelevant because the quantity of information to be consumed is virtually limitless in
today’s information environment. Such individuals would be able to keep consuming and
consuming information until time runs out. What is important here is that although a
quantity limit is subjective, time limit is not: time is the only finite currency of one’s life
because everyone is allotted the same 24 hours a day to spend (Kimmel, 2008). In this
context, if someone spends his or her time devouring information instead of doing

5
something else, it means that information is more important to that person than anything
else at that time. Hence, time is a good measure to compare the voracity of one
individual’s information appetite to the next. Just as Encyclopedia Britannica defines
appetite in diet as the desire to eat, I would define information appetite as “the desire to
spend time with information.” That is, the more time an individual spends seeking
information, the higher the information appetite the individual has.
In this study, I will focus on the following propositions about information appetite:
Proposition 1. Individuals have varying degrees of information appetite, as
measured by the amount of time spent engaging in personal information practices (PIPs).
PIPs encompass consumption, dissemination, and creation of information for personal
reasons.
Proposition 2. An individual has different information appetites for different
topical areas.

Chapter 2 Review of Relevant Works
2.1 Information Overload
Although having become a popular term with the digital revolution, the concept
of information overload has been around since the days of books: Diderot wrote in 1755
that “the number of books will grow continually, and one can predict that a time will
come when it will be almost as difficult to learn anything from books as from the direct
study of the whole universe” (Diderot, 1964, p. 299). As Diderot anticipated, the amount
of information available in the world kept growing, but with the advent of the Internet
and the world wide web, it has exploded exponentially.
Information overload is a state one falls into when there is excessive
communication and information input to be dealt with. To prevent being overloaded, one
makes various adjustments in dealing with the amount of information at hand (Jacoby,
1984; J. G. Miller, 1960). In addition, too frequent communications over digital
communication channels (i.e. “chronic interruptions” (J. Robinson, 2014)) may also
cause information overload (e.g. “tweet overload” (Sasaki, Kawai, & Kitamura, 2015)).
Rogers (1986) said that information overload “is the state of an individual or
system in which excessive communication inputs cannot be processed, leading to
breakdown” (p. 181). Eppler and Mengis’ literature review revealed more varied
definitions of information overload, as shown in table 2.1.

Table 2.1 Definitions of information overload (Eppler & Mengis, 2004, p. 328)
In the definitions above, the information-processing capacity of an individual is
featured in multiple definitions. Eppler and Mengis (2004) explained that it is “the
quantity of information one can integrate into the decision-making process within a
specific time period” (p. 326). What is important here is the time constraint. They
suggested a formula of information overload as “information processing requirements >
information processing capacities” (p. 326), measured in terms of how much time is
available to process information and the amount of information that could be processed in
the available period of time. In this view, if all the information could not be processed in
the available processing time, information overload occurs.
Time constraint, therefore, is an important factor of information overload.
Savolainen (2007) also acknowledged it and defined information overload as “a
subjective experience of the insufficiency of time needed to make effective use of
information resources available in specific situations” (p. 612). His work was a study of
information overload from an information science perspective. His interviews of
participants revealed two major strategies to cope with information overload: filtering
and withdrawal. The filtering strategy is filtering out useless information from the
sources, focusing on the content to avoid; and the withdrawal strategy is minimizing the

9
daily information sources, focusing on the information supply to avoid in order not to be
overwhelmed with information. He found that people use a mixture of both strategies to
cope with information overload.
Reactions to information overload may be varied. When a new piece of
information arrives in the inboxes of individuals with information overload, some may
feel anxiety whereas some others may feel stimulated. Anxiety stems from the worry that
the volume of information to process is too great, and in the midst of selecting which one
to process and which one to pass, one might miss an important piece of information
(Edmunds & Morris, 2000, p. 19). Savolainen’s study (2007) also acknowledged this
phenomenon, but he argued that such feelings tended to be brief without any lasting harm,
and often justified by the lack of time.
As for stimulation, the argument is that when new information fails to appear it
could cause boredom (Case, 2012, p. 119). This would be especially true for those with
high stimulation threshold such as sensation seekers (Zuckerman, 2009).
However, there is a disagreement as to whether information overload exists in
reality. Jacoby (1984) argued that individuals can be overloaded in theory, but may not be
overloaded in practice because they use various strategies to prevent themselves from
being overloaded in the first place. He pointed out that however much information is
available, individuals selectively choose the amount and kinds of information to use,
though sometimes resulting in missing key information due to such a compromise. The
two strategies revealed in Savolainen’s study (2007) coincide with his argument.

10
2.2 Desire
Dholakia’s (2014) review of desire in consumer behavior research revealed three
distinct concepts of desire. First is that desire motivates decision making and goaldirected efforts. In this viewpoint, desire operates in two ways: as a goal desire as in the
goal to be pursued, and as an implementation desire as in the specific means to reach the
goal. Second is that desire is a counter-force that opposes self-control. If a person follows
desire, in this viewpoint, it may result in short-term pleasure but long-term negative
consequences. Therefore, when desire is experienced, self-control kicks in to prevent a
negative outcome. Third is that desire is a sudden urge or craving to buy merchandise
impulsively, immediately produced upon encountering a temptation. If left unchecked,
this could lead to compulsive buying or hoarding.
The model of goal-directed behaviour represents the first view. In this model,
desire is “a state of mind whereby an agent has a personal motivation to perform an
action or to achieve a goal” (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2004, p. 71) and provides a direct
pathway to intentions and behaviors (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001). Perugini and Bagozzi
(2004) differentiate desire and intention as “desiring a goal and intending to achieve it” (p.
69). That is, unlike desire which is more abstract and less specific than intention,
intention leads to action. Also, compared to intention, people consider desire in a longer
term and think less of its feasibility. As shown in the figure below, desire is an important
predictor of intention which, in turn, is an important predictor of behavior. As there are
goal intentions and implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999), there are goal desires
and implementation desires that are precursors to the intentions respectively (Dholakia,
2014).

11

Figure 2.1 The model of goal-directed behaviour (Perugini & Bagozzi, 2001, p. 80)
In the second view of desire, the focus is on self-control, which is a constant
struggle between willpower and desire. Desire is something that needs to be resisted,
otherwise negative consequences would occur. Whether all desires are problematic,
however, is questionable. It is those desires that conflict with other goals that tend to
cause resistance (Hofmann, Baumeister, Förster, & Vohs, 2012).
The third view of desire casts it as a sudden buying impulse to acquire more.
Consumer research has focused on how to encourage buying impulse so that it can lead to
more profit, and then shifted to regarding the impulse as a psychological trait of
consumers (Dholakia, 2014).
A buying impulse has the following properties (Dholakia, 2014, p. 16):
1. It is experienced immediately when the consumer is exposed to the
desirable object.
2. It is intense and short-lived, manifesting as a burst of motivation, and
impelling the consumer to buy within a very short time period, usually a
few moments.
3. It may produce a state of psychological disequilibrium marked by
emotional conflict.
4. It discourages inaction or the status quo.
5. It may occur even in the absence of a deficit state such as physiological
deprivation or withdrawal.

12
This third viewpoint will be considered in this study. Compulsive acquisition
syndrome will be discussed later in this chapter under personality traits relevant to
information appetite.
2.3 Personal Information Practices
Time is an interesting construct because it is a limited resource with absolutely no
discrimination: everyone has the same 24 hours a day to spend regardless of one’s gender,
age, wealth, or social status (Kimmel, 2008). Therefore, spending time to seek
information rather than doing something else means that information seeking is more
appealing to the person than anything else. To understand time consumption for personal
information practices (PIPs) in everyday life, data from the American Time Use Survey
(ATUS) will be used, along with additionally collected data which will be discussed later.
ATUS is an ongoing time diary study conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) since 2003. Samples of the ATUS are randomly drawn from those who
participated in the Current Population Survey, which is jointly sponsored by the BLS and
the U.S. Census Bureau, and are adjusted to represent geographically the population of
the United States (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015b). Each record in the dataset
corresponds to an individual reporting how they spent their time in a 24 hour period. In
the years 2003 – 2014, there were a total of 159,937 participants, averaging about 13,328
participants per year.
Among over 470 coded activities in the ATUS dataset, eight activities were
identified as relevant to PIPs: taking class for personal interest, research or homework for
class (for personal interest), researching purchases, television and movies (not religious),
listening to the radio, computer use for leisure (excluding games), reading for personal

13
interest, and writing for personal interest. Examples of these eight coded activities are in
Appendix A (Hofferth, Flood, & Sobek, 2013; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015a).
TV and radio are included because according to St. Jean and others’ (2012) study
of online information activities, multimedia use was found to be one of the five major
groups of information behaviors. Another major group was content creation. Therefore,
the following list of PIPs was compiled for the purpose of this study. These activities
cover all gamut of PIP: consumption, dissemination, and creation of information for
personal reasons.
•

Taking/studying for a class on a subject of personal interest

•

Researching purchases

•

Computer use for personal interest (excluding games)

•

Reading/doing research for personal interest

•

Writing/blogging for personal interest

•

Listening/watching radio, podcast, TV, or videos for personal interest

•

Creating multimedia contents for personal interest

One thing to note is that computer use might seem redundant because all the other
activities can be done on a computer. However, they can be done offline, nonelectronically as well. Therefore, the question will be asked with an instruction for the
participants not to treat each activity as mutually exclusive: that is, if someone spent 30
minutes to do personal research on computer, the 30 minutes would count towards both
Computer use and Reading/doing research. This non-mutual exclusivity is another reason
why a traditional survey will be conducted instead of time diary to collect time use data
because duplicate entries of activities are harder to collect and manage in time diaries.

14
When the ATUS data was analyzed, it was found that the participation rate, i.e.
the percentage of those who spent time with information for a personal reason, was
extremely low except for TV and movies, as shown in table 2.2.

Table 2.2 Descriptive statistics of the eight PIP activities in the ATUS dataset
One possible scenario is that the ATUS might have failed to capture what people
actually do in idle times such as waiting in line or going to a place on public transit
because those idle times were recorded as individual events. With mobile devices being
so ubiquitous, idle times are rarely spent idle anymore; therefore, perhaps those who
cannot afford to carve out a separate time for PIPs may be satisfying their needs using
mobile phones or tablets during the idle times. This is another reason why the participants
will be asked not to treat the time use activities as mutually exclusive.
Table 2.2 also shows that 86.6% of the sample population engaged in at least one
of the eight PIP activities in a day. Among these, 58% were involved in one activity, 25.1%

n = Those who participated in the activity (Total sample size: 159,937)

15
in two activities, 3.4% in three activities, and 0.1% in four or five activities. This means
that individuals have a definite preference when it comes to the type of PIP activity they
engage in, and that the appetite in one might not translate into the appetite in another. It
would be interesting to see if this phenomenon is replicated in additional data collection
for this study.
HP1. Information appetite in one type of activity does not predict information
appetite in other types of activities.
The influence of personal characteristics on the time spent will be explored. These
independent variables include age, gender, and education level.
HP2. Individual characteristics such as age, gender, and education level affect the
time spent for PIPs.
Also, the time spent for PIPs is hypothesized to depend upon how much free time
an individual has. Work, domestic and family responsibilities take away what time one
can and/or is willing to spend on PIPs.
HP3. Time spent for PIPs is negatively affected by time spent for work, domestic,
and family responsibilities.
2.4 Time as a Matter of Context
Savolainen (2006) described three roles of time in the information studies
literature. First is time as a contextual attribute, integrated in the social and cultural
situation or context of information seeking. Second is time as a qualifier of access to
information: for example, time requirements (e.g. how soon information is needed) or
time limit (e.g. time pressure hindering information seeking). Third is time as a qualifier

16
of the information seeking process, as in information seeking behavior models that imply
temporal factors.
Of these three, perhaps the most studied is the second aspect of time: time
requirements and pressure affecting information seeking behavior (Allen, 2011; Chen &
Rieh, 2009; Crescenzi, Capra, & Arguello, 2013; Liu, Yang, Zhao, Jiang, & Zhang, 2014;
Slone, 2007). In such studies, time is seen as a frozen element, with no past or future.
However, time is constantly moving and evolving, from past to present to future
(Savolainen, 2006), and when considering the gamut of personal information practices –
creating, consuming, and sharing information – over one’s lifetime, this moving aspect of
time must be considered.
Sonnenwald and Iivonen (1999) acknowledged the moving aspect of time in their
human information behavior framework, and categorized time periods in three ways: a
short episode, a longer interval, and an eon which is a long continuous period of time.
Hartel (2010) shared a similar insight in her study of gourmet cooking hobbyists. In her
framework, there are three temporal arcs in a hobby: career (years/lifetime), subject
(weeks/months), and episode (a short episode). She summarizes that:
There is the long-running career arc that lasts for years or decades and represents
the cook's lifetime experience of the hobby. The subject arc is made up of shorter
periods (weeks or months) in which a topic organizes culinary activity. Then, the
episode arc entails distinct hands-on cooking projects that happen closer to realtime.

Figure 2.2 The hobby career arc (Hartel, 2010)

17

Figure 2.3. The subject arc (Hartel, 2010)

Figure 2.4. The episode arc (Hartel, 2010)
She argued that her framework reflects human information experience, as did
Sonnenwald and Iivonen (1999). This viewpoint merits attention. We experience some
information episodes that are short bursts (e.g. a quick search on a topic), some that last
months (e.g. planning a vacation), and some that last decades (e.g. a deeply-interested
topic such as a hobby). Along with information practices, it is assumed that information
appetite in a topic ebbs and flows on the same arcs as well.
To account for this moving aspect of time, participants will be asked for how long
they have been interested in the topics on which they had spent time with information. In
addition to measuring information appetite using the PIP activities, information appetite
(i.e. time spent) in multiple topics will be measured. The variables to investigate are the
topical information appetite, the topic’s temporal context and their relationships to the
activity-based information appetite.
RQ1. What are the relationships between the activity-based information appetite
and the topical information appetite along with the topic’s temporal context?

18
2.5 Personality Markers
Many of information behavior studies focus on the situation variable. For example,
the more studied topic of the time context as discussed before, time requirements and
pressure affecting information seeking behavior, is looking at time as a situation variable.
Another important focus in this study, however, is the person variable. Therefore, some
person variables related to information appetite need to be considered.
2.5.1 Intellectual curiosity
The question of when people stop searching can be rephrased as the question of
when people continue to search or not. The drive to do something, or in this case not to
do something, is referred to as motivation in psychology. It is defined as the “choice,
effort, and persistence to engage in a particular activity or task” (“Motivation: Research
starters topic,” 2015).
Motivation in information seeking behavior studies have been mostly studied as
information needs. Case (2012) explained that needs are “inner motivational state that
brings about thought and action” (p. 78). Information need is one of the causes of
information seeking, and is often defined as such. A reason why it does not have a clearer
definition in the field is because it is something inside one’s head and what the
researchers can observe and study is information seeking behaviors, from which the
needs must be inferred (Case, 2012, p. 87).
Hence, it is imperative to consider the psychological definition of motivation.
There are two types of motivation: intrinsic motivation which is doing something because
of inherent interest or enjoyment, and extrinsic motivation which is doing something
because of a certain separable outcome (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Information appetite works

19
as an inherent drive to seek out more information. To study this intrinsic motivation for
continued information seeking, intellectual curiosity of the research participants will be
investigated.
Intellectual curiosity, or epistemic curiosity, is viewed as a personality trait that
represents the curiosity (or desire) for knowledge (Berlyne, 1954). It is considered one of
the predictors of academic performances (von Stumm, Hell, & Chamorro-Premuzic,
2011), and is also counted as one of the desirable personality traits in job seekers
(Casserly, 2012; Shanker, 2015).
One of the recent measurements of intellectual curiosity is called the epistemic
curiosity (EC) scale (J. A. Litman, 2008; J. A. Litman & Spielberger, 2003). This scale is
particularly relevant to information behavior due to the way Litman defined two different
aspects of it (2008, 2010): I-type EC (I from interest) and D-type EC (D from
deprivation). The I-type EC is about positive feelings of interest: learning something new
is for pleasure, not necessarily for an obligation, and is a rewarding act. In information
behavior, this is akin to browsing. On the other hand, the D-type EC is about lacking
information, being uncomfortable about such a deprived state, and gathering new
information in order to escape the negative state. This is analogous to information
seeking in response to a task/problem or a recognized gap/uncertainty in one’s state of
knowledge (Belkin, 2005).
Although the D-type EC sounds like extrinsic motivation, the scale itself (J.
Litman, n.d.) shows that the D-type EC is still intrinsic in nature. In other words, it deals
with intrinsic values that will come into play when one is faced with an extrinsic

20
motivating factor. Hence, for information appetite, it is necessary to study both types of
EC and how they correlate with the time spent for PIPs.
HP4. Those with a higher epistemic curiosity score will spend more time for PIPs.
2.5.2 Compulsive acquisition
Another personality dimension that relates to information appetite is compulsive
hoarding, especially acquisition. There are three factors to compulsive hoarding as
measured by Frost, Steketee, and Grisham (2004): clutter, difficulty discarding, and
acquisition. Among these, of particular interests is the acquisition dimension and how it
relates to information appetite. Would those with extreme information appetite exhibit
compulsive acquisition symptoms? If so, maybe what matters to them is less what they
acquire but more the act of acquiring information. Also, although participants are not
asked how much information they consumed because the measure of how much can be
very subjective and individual, those with a higher compulsive acquisition score can be
assumed to have consumed more information than those with a lower score.
Listed below is the Acquisition subscale items from the Saving Inventory-Revised
(SI-R) (Frost et al., 2004, p. 1167) that will be used in data collection for this study. SI-R
has been developed specifically for hoarding, all three subscales (clutter, difficulty
discarding and acquisition) are found reliable, and it has demonstrated validity as well
(Pertusa et al., 2010, p. 380).

Chapter 3 Study 1: American Time Use Survey Analysis
In this chapter, American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data has been analyzed to
test the first proposition (Individuals have varying degrees of information appetite, as
measured by the amount of time spent engaging in personal information practices (PIPs)),
hypothesis 2 (Individual characteristics such as age, gender, and education level affect the
time spent for PIPs), and hypothesis 3 (Time spent for PIPs is negatively affected by time
spent for work, domestic, and family responsibilities.)
ATUS is an ongoing time diary study conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics since 2003. The dataset has been extracted using the ATUS-X American Time
Use Study Extract Builder service (Hofferth et al., 2013). Data collected from 2003
through 2014 were used (N = 159,937).
Here are some sample population characteristics in the ATUS dataset.
•

Gender: Male 43.7%, Female 56.3%

•

Average age: 47 years old

•

About 57% have some college education or hold a college degree.

•

About 63% are employed, and 6% hold more than one job.

The data analysis methods were the following. First, cluster analysis was
performed to segregate the high information appetite (IA) group, and various analyses
were performed to describe the characteristics of the high IA group. Then, multiple
regression, factor analysis, and canonical correlation analyses were conducted to
investigate the effects of personal and situational variables on the time spent for PIPs.

24
3.1 Information Appetite Levels
As discussed in 2.3, eight activities have been identified as relevant to PIPs:
taking class for personal interest, research or homework for class (for personal interest),
researching purchases, television and movies (not religious), listening to the radio,
computer use for leisure (excluding games), reading for personal interest, and writing for
personal interest. A PIP variable (total time spent in PIP) has been computed from the
sum of time spent on all eight PIP activities in the dataset. A Two-Step cluster analysis of
the PIP variable resulted in two clusters.
The Two-Step Cluster method was used for two reasons: First, it is based on the
Hierarchical cluster method, but unlike Hierarchical cluster analysis it can handle large
data files. Second, unlike K-Means cluster analysis where the number of clusters has to
be specified manually Two-Step cluster analysis can automatically determine the optimal
number of clusters. As for the distance measure, the Euclidean measure was chosen
because it is appropriate with continuous variables. The log-likelihood distance measure
assumes that continuous variables are normally distributed, but the PIP variable data is
positively skewed (skewness: 1.287).

The descriptive statistics of each cluster show that cluster 2 is a high information

label as well.
3.1.1 High information appetite cluster characteristics
The two tables below show that the high IA group tends to be statistically
significantly more male and older in age than the regular group cluster. The Pearson chisquare result in table 3.2 shows that males and females are significantly different between
clusters (x2 = 688.086, df = 1, N = 159937, p < .001). The effect size (shown in Cramer’s
V = .066) is quite small, though. The independent samples t-test results in table 3.3 show
that the age differences between clusters are also significant with larger than medium
effect size (t(18726) = -75.096, p < .001, d = .65).

Findings in the three tables below support HP3. The high IA group has
substantially more people not in labor force (x2 = 7592.531, df = 4, N = 159937, p < .001),
and less percentage of people holding more than one job (x2 = 7074.924, df = 2, N =
159937, p < .001). Also, the high IA group spent significantly less time for work,
domestic, and family responsibilities. The effect size (Cohen’s d) for the differences in
time spent working is large at 1.10, indicating a standardized difference between means
exceeding one standard deviation. One can assume that the high IA group would have
much more free time than the others, which could have led to more time spent in PIPs.

3.2 Variable Relationships to the Time Spent for PIPs
So far, the analysis showed the differences between clusters by comparing the two
groups (e.g. t-test). To find the strength of associations between variables, however,
associational inferential statistics such as correlation and regression are needed. This way,
one can predict another variable (dependent) with one or more variables (independent). A
multiple regression analysis was conducted with the time spent for PIPs as a dependent
variable to find out the relationships between personal and situational independent
variables and the time spent for PIPs.
The independent variables in the final multiple regression model were the
following.
•

Age

•

Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)

•

Time spent working in the reported day (in minutes, ranging from 0 to
1430)

•

Has more than one job (1 = yes, 0 = no/NA)

Several independent variables have been removed from the model. First, time
spent for household activities and time spent caring for/helping household members were
not included because the dependent variable (time spent for PIPs) could potentially affect
these two types of time expenditure (e.g. spending too much time reading while
sacrificing domestic activity time like cleaning). Allison (1999) pointed out that if the
dependent variable affects an independent variable, it might result in a bias of every
coefficient in the regression model (pp. 52-54). Therefore, these two independent
variables have been removed in the multiple regression model. It is assumed that time

31
spent working is not as affected by the dependent variable because most people are very
constrained in terms of the number of hours they work.
However, time spent working (in minutes) turned out to be highly correlated with
the “Employed - at work” category in the labor force status for 159,937 respondents (r
= .52, p < ,001). Between the labor force status and the time spent working, the model
with the time spent working turned out to have a higher explanatory power (higher
adjusted R2 = .19 vs R2 = .15), so it was decided to keep the time spent working variable
and remove labor force status from the model.
Lastly, highest level of school completed has been removed from the model
because it accounted for less than 1% of the variance and the tolerance values in
collinearity statistics were low in multiple categories.
According to Allison (1999), independent and dependent variables do not need to
be normally distributed in multiple regression (pp. 130-131). What needs to be normally
distributed is the disturbance term which cannot be directly observed, but even that is not
strictly necessary if the sample size is large (more than 200 cases). Since the total sample
size of the ATUS dataset is 159,937, the normality assumption was not considered
important in this case.
3.2.1 Multiple regression on time spent for PIPs
Multiple regression was conducted to determine the best linear combination of
age, gender, time spent working, and multiple job status for predicting time spent for
PIPs. The means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations can be found in the table
below.

This combination of variables significantly predicted time spent for PIPs, F(4,
159932) = 9402.04, p < .001, with all four variables significantly contributing to the
prediction. The adjusted R2 value was .19, indicating that 19% of the variance in time
spent for PIPs was explained by this model. The beta weights suggest that not spending
time working contributes most to predicting time spent for PIPs, and that being older,
being male, and not having multiple jobs also contribute to this prediction.

Table 3.9 Multiple regression analysis summary for age, gender, time spent working, and
multiple job status predicting time spent for PIPs (N = 159,937)
For each year increase in age, there was a 2.51 minutes increase in time spent for
PIPs. For each minute spent working, there was a .25 minute decrease in time spent for
PIPs. Males spent about 50 minutes more in PIPs than females. Those who have more
than one job spent about 26 minutes less in PIPs than those without multiple jobs.

33
The squared part correlations represent the strength of the unique predictive
contribution of each particular variable (Warner, 2013). It shows that time spent working
uniquely predicted about 9.5% of the variance in time spent for PIPs, when all the other
variables were statistically controlled. It also shows that multiple job status uniquely
predicted just 0.1% of the variance in time spent for PIPs, which is very low. Age and
gender uniquely predicted about 5.5% and 1.7% of the variance in time spent for PIPs,
respectively, when the other variables were statistically controlled.
3.2.2 Multiple regression in four groups (not worked/worked, cluster 1/2)
Next, multiple regression was performed on four different groups of respondents.
The frequency histogram of the time spent working (see the figure below) showed that
there was a large group of people who did not work in the reported day, which would
have affected time spent for PIPs. Therefore, the sample was first divided into a group of
those who did not work (0 minute spent working) and those who worked (more than 1
minute spent working), and then divided according to the clusters (the high IA group
(cluster 2) and the regular group (cluster 1)). Multiple regression was conducted on these
four different groups to find out how the independent variables predict the dependent
variable (time spent for PIPs).

In this group, for each minute spent working, there was about .1 minute decrease
in time spent for PIPs. Males spent about 19 minutes more in PIPs than females.
The squared part correlations show that time spent working is the biggest
predictor of the time spent for PIPs, the same with the worked/cluster 1 group.
3.2.3 Factor analysis
Factor analysis was performed to group the eight time use variables into a smaller
number of variables. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed because PCA is
useful when “one is simply trying to mathematically derive a relatively small number of
variables to use to convey as much of the information in the observed/measured variables
as possible” (Leech, Barrett, & Morgan, 2015, p. 68). Therefore, for the purpose of
running this analysis here (i.e. reduce the number of time use variables), PCA was
appropriate.
PCA with varimax rotation was conducted to assess how the eight time use
variables clustered. These variables were time spent for taking class for personal interest,
research or homework for class (for personal interest), researching purchases, television
and movies (not religious), listening to the radio, computer use for leisure (excluding
games), reading for personal interest, and writing for personal interest. Four components

40
were rotated, based on the eigenvalues over 1 criterion. After rotation, the four
components combined accounted for 51.8% of the variance; component 1 accounted for
13.4% of the variance, component 2 13%, component 3 12.8%, and component 4 12.5%.
The table below displays the items and component loadings for the rotated components.

Figure 3.5 Time use variables and component loadings for the rotated components (N =
159,937)
With this result, four new variables have been created. For each component, the
sum was computed from the variables (i.e. time spent in minutes) that loaded highly on
the component. The new variables are Classes (taking class, research/homework for
class), Computer/TV/Movies (computer use for leisure, TV and movies), Radio/Reading
(listening to the radio, reading for personal interest), and Researching purchases/Writing
(researching purchases, writing for personal interest).
3.2.4 Canonical correlations using the four component variables
Canonical correlation was used to investigate the relationships between the
independent variables and the four component variables. Canonical correlation is useful

41
when exploring how the differences in one set of variables relate to the difference in
another set of variables.
Since canonical correlation allows scale (numeric) variables only, the independent
variables were Age and Time spent working. The variables time spent for household
activities and time spent caring for/helping household members were not included
because canonical correlation is an extension of multiple regression (Leech et al., 2015):
they had been removed in the multiple regression model because the dependent variable
(time spent for PIPs) could have inversely affected them, which might result in a bias of
coefficients in the regression model (Allison, 1999).
First, canonical correlation was performed with all data in the dataset (N =
159,937) to assess the pattern of relationships between age and time spent working, and
the four component variables of time spent for PIPs. The first canonical correlation
was .437 (19% overlapping variance) and the second was .125 (1.6% overlapping
variance). With both canonical correlations included, x2(8) = 36445, p < .001, and with
the first removed, x2(3) = 2506.85, p < .001. The correlations and canonical coefficients
are included in the table below. Examination of the loadings suggests that the first
canonical correlation seems to involve a relation between age and time spent working,
and spending time on computer/TV/movies and on radio/reading. The second canonical
correlation loadings capture a similar relationship as well.

second was .079 (0.6% overlapping variance). With both canonical correlations included,
x2(8) = 912.85, p < .001, and with the first removed, x2(3) = 96.6, p < .001. The
correlations and canonical coefficients are included in the table below. Examination of
the loadings and coefficients suggests that the first canonical correlation involves a
positive relationship between age and time spent on radio/reading; whereas, the second

indicates a negative relationship between time spent working and time spent on
computer/TV/movies.

component variables in cluster 2 (high IA group) (N = 15,582)
3.3 Discussion
The first proposition was that individuals have varying degrees of information
appetite, as measured by the amount of time spent engaging in personal information
practices (PIPs). The distribution of the total time spent for PIPs was positively skewed in
that there were many people who did not spend time for PIPs, but at the same time there
were a small number of people that spent a lot of time in PIPs. In addition, cluster
analysis of the total time spent for PIPs resulted in identifying the high IA group. This
supports that individuals spent varying degrees of time in PIPs, reflecting their
information appetites.
As for hypothesis 2 (Individual characteristics such as age, gender, and education
level affect the time spent for PIPs), the high IA group tended to be more male and older
in age. Both the chi-square analysis and the multiple regression analysis support this
finding. The multiple regression findings suggest that males spend more time than female
in PIPs, and older people spend more time in PIPs as well. As for the education level

44
(highest level of school completed), it was not included in the multiple regression model
because it only explained less than 1% of the variance in time spent for PIPs and there
were multiple collinearity issues. When looked at the chi-square statistics of the high IA
group, however, although the effect size there was on the smaller side as well, the
education level turned out to be lower in the high IA group. This could mean that those
with lower education level compensate for their relative lack of knowledge with higher
IA levels and more time spent for PIPs.
Hypothesis 3, time spent for PIPs is negatively affected by time spent for work,
domestic, and family responsibilities, was investigated with a t-test (with the high IA
group vs the regular group) and multiple regression analysis. The high IA group spent
less time working, less time for household activities, and less time caring for/helping
household members. Times spent for domestic and family responsibilities were not
included in the multiple regression model because these variables can be inversely
affected by the dependent variable (e.g. neglecting to clean the house because of too
much time spent reading). Time spent working was included in the model, however, and
found to be the most powerful factor in predicting time spent for PIPs in a negative
direction. That is, the less time spent working, the more time one could spend for PIPs. In
addition, chi-square analyses of the high IA group reveal that the high IA group is mostly
not in the labor force, and if in the labor force does not tend to have multiple jobs, also
indicating that having more free time is an important factor in predicting time spent for
PIPs.
The multiple regression model for predicting time spent for PIPs included
predictors such as age, gender, time spent working, and multiple job status. However, the

45
four groups (not worked/worked in the reported day, cluster 1/2) multiple regression
analyses showed that this is not an effective model for predicting time spent for PIPs in
high IA groups, as evidenced by low R2 scores. In the worked/cluster 2 group, age and
multiple job status turned out to be non-significant predictors, leaving only gender and
time spent working as viable predictors. Time spent working was the biggest (negative)
predictor of time spent for PIPs in worked groups. Older respondents, males, and those
without multiple jobs spent more time for PIPs in all four groups.
The canonical correlation result for the high IA group showed that age and time
spent on radio/reading have a positive relationship (effect size = 5.1%), and
independently, time spent working and time spent on computer/TV/movies have a
negative relationship (effect size = 0.6%).
What is interesting here is the overall low effect size of the high IA group
analyses. This means that some other factor that is not investigated in this chapter is
operating in the high IA group, as the ATUS data analyses failed to capture all the
variances that affect the high IA group. What they are might be beyond the scope of the
ATUS dataset, however.

Chapter 4 Study 2: Method
4.1 Research Design
4.1.1 Research design of this study
The study design is based on the theoretical model presented in earlier chapters,
and encompasses the key concepts and variables to be explored in this research. The
design appropriate for this investigation attempts to explain information seeking behavior
with individuals’ allocation of their time. As such, this exploratory study will employ a
survey that may identify correlational relationships among the variables using simple and
multivariate models.
The survey was conducted online via Qualtrics, an online survey software system.
The survey link was provided in an Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) job. MTurk is an
online labor market that has become popular among social scientists for its large pool of
constantly available participants and the low cost (Paolacci & Chandler, 2014).
MTurk provides several notable advantages for this study:
•

Ease of reaching many participants online

•

Being able to reach individuals with wider demographic profiles than
college students

•

The speed with which data is collected

•

Ability to employ pre-tests quickly to apply any changes to the final
survey

•

Cost-effective and streamlined payment of participants based on work
performed

47
Although Amazon raised their fee from 10% to 40% (for participants more than
ten; 20% for less than that) in July 2015, it is still an economical way of gathering a large
amount of research data in a relatively short amount of time.
One drawback of using MTurk is that the method is mostly limited to quantitative
work. Qualitative techniques such as interviews or focus groups cannot be used, but the
possible methods are mostly surveys, experiments, or short essays. Hence, this study
consists of a survey questionnaire constructed for quantitative analysis with an optional
open-ended qualitative question at the end. It is cross-sectional with all the data being
collected at a single point in time. 7
Two preliminary tests with a small number of subjects (twelve and nine,
respectively) were conducted to test the survey procedure. The first preliminary test
resulted in a major revision of the research design and data collection procedures, and
will be discussed later. The second test was performed to make sure everything runs
smoothly before the survey was launched in full scale.
4.1.2 Study procedures
Here are the detailed survey procedures on MTurk:
1. Participant finds the job on MTurk.
2. Participant agrees to the consent form online.
3. Participant fills out the survey online.

7

Although it is theoretically possible to recruit participants in chunks over a longer period of time
(e.g. 100 people every day for six days), I decided not to because it is possible for someone to participate in
all six surveys and get paid, resulting in unknown duplicate entries which is problematic. There is a way to
prevent a previous survey-taker from taking subsequent surveys, but it requires assigning each previous
participant in a group manually which is very labor intensive to do in the current MTurk web interface.
Since this is not a critical issue for the purpose of this research, I decided to stick to cross-sectional data
gathering.

48
4. Participant receives a random code at the end of the survey, and enters it
in the MTurk job form to receive reward.
4.1.3 Alternative designs
A number of alternative designs are possible to investigate information appetite.
Some of these include participant observation, experiment, time diary, and experience
sampling method. Furthermore, each approach could be used to investigate participants
over time (i.e. longitudinal) or done as a snapshot of information behavior at a particular
time (i.e. cross-sectional). Each of these approaches comes with advantages and
disadvantages, and such an investigation presents challenges in terms of the extent of
effort to achieve a particular goal. Each of these alternatives will now be highlighted as
for how fit it is for an initial exploration of the concept of information appetite studied in
terms of the differences in the amount of time individuals spend with information.
4.1.3.1 Participant observation
Participants could be observed and records taken in terms of how much time they
spend for personal information practices (PIPs). There are three possible ways to
investigate this using such a method. One is to invite participants into a lab and observe
their behavior; second is to go to their homes and observe what they do at home; and
third is using software that monitors activities on their computer and their phone. The
first method is more convenient than going to someone’s home, but it creates an artificial
environment and it might be inappropriate to conclude that such observations represent
natural behavior. The second method, observing participants in their home, lets the
researcher observe more natural behavior in the most naturalistic setting, but the presence
of a researcher at home could create some bias and open up privacy issues. Alternatively,

49
the researcher could ask another member of the household to observe and record the
participant. This is much more naturalistic but requires extra training of the other
household member as a record-taker. The third method, monitoring with software,
requires that participants install a monitoring program on their computer and their phone,
and let the software record which websites they visited, which applications they used, and
how much time they spent on each activity. The advantage is that the researcher can get a
thorough picture of one’s online activities. Moreover, the software can be installed on
many computers and phones at the same time, so data collection can be done at a much
larger scale than the first two methods that require a record-taker’s presence. The
disadvantage is that the participants might not do what they normally do for fear of
invasion of privacy. In addition, this method records online activities only, so offline
activities are missed.
4.1.3.2 Experiment
An experiment has the advantage of controlling for extraneous variation by
limiting the variables under investigation. However, it may not be suitable for time spent
for PIPs because inviting people to a lab creates an artificial environment and it would be
harder to observe natural behavior. Nonetheless, for topic-related information appetite it
could be a useful method. Participants could be asked to pick two or three topics that they
are interested in, asked to indicate for how long they have been interested in them, and
then instructed to find the latest news on the topics. It could be hypothesized that the
amount of time spent in finding the news would be related to their information appetite
level in that those with high information appetite would spend more time finding the
news story to share, browsing more sources, and so on. A control group would be

50
assigned a search topic of the researcher’s choice. An experiment like this would require
an environment where individuals would not be limited by time, which could be
problematic to implement, however.
It was considered to run the experiment on MTurk, but the idea was rejected
because time spent can be largely impacted by concerns of money. MTurk participants
are strongly motivated by monetary compensation (Paolacci & Chandler, 2014), and for a
flat amount of compensation it is to their advantage to spend as little time as possible so
that they can finish one job quickly and move on to other jobs in order to earn more
money. Variable compensation depending on time spent can also skew the result because
the participants will be motivated to spend time not because of their information appetite
but because of monetary motives. Therefore, MTurk was rejected as a platform for an
experiment, but it was still left available for a survey.
4.1.3.3 Time diary
Time diary is a frequently used method for time studies. The biggest reason is that
it is hard to lie in time diaries because in order to change time spent on one activity, one
has to change the time spent on all the other activities surrounding it. Due to memory and
recall problems, past time diaries are usually kept for one day (Harvey, 1999; J. P.
Robinson & Godbey, 1999). Future time diaries can be used for more days than one in
that the participants are briefed on how to fill out a time diary and then asked to complete
it as their days go on. One-day diary has a potential pitfall of capturing a non-typical day,
and a week-long diary might solve the issue. However, week-long diaries have a
cooperation-rate problem. Other national studies of week-long diaries had a cooperation
rate of about 40 percent only (J. P. Robinson & Godbey, 1999, p. 62).

51
For the purpose of exploring information appetite and how individuals spend time
with information, the time diary method can be too complex and resource-consuming. It
is more suitable for getting a complete picture of how an individual’s daily activities went,
but this is not strictly necessary in exploring how much time an individual spends in PIPs.
It also does not capture topic interests, which necessitates a survey.
4.1.3.4 Experience sampling method
A beeper study, or Experience Sampling Method (ESM), is a way of sampling
human daily life by paging participants at various times of day and asking them to record
the nature and quality of their experience (Kubey, Larson, & Csikszentmihalyi, 1996). In
traditional beeper studies, participants carry a beeper and a protocol, and when the beeper
goes off they fill out the protocol (Harvey & Pentland, 1999, p. 4). With this method,
researchers can learn the participants’ behavior, feelings, and experience such as product
use. It provides a means of understanding human behavior in a contextual and quasinaturalistic setting, and the researchers can study a larger number of participants using
this method than using an ethnographic observation method.
It makes for a viable tool for a number of theoretical and applied questions in
social science, including library and information studies. Any research problem that deals
with understanding human behavior or emotion in daily life can be answered with this
method (Kubey et al., 1996). In information studies, it has been used to study how
individuals assess information credibility on the web (Kim, Rieh, Yang, & St. Jean, 2009;
Rieh, Kim, Yang, & St. Jean, 2010). Library professionals who would like to learn more
about their patrons’ experience with the library can also utilize this method to learn their
behavior and feelings in situ.

52
Yet, this method has not been used much in library and information studies in the
past. One reason would be its cost and logistical challenges. Beepers are almost obsolete
and hard to procure, and they need to be distributed and then collected after research is
done. If phone calls are used instead for the signal, it requires human resource, which is
costly.
Instead of beepers, many individuals carry smartphones nowadays. According to
Pew Research Center’s recent reports, 64% of American adults are smartphone owners
and 36% of smartphone owners use messaging apps (Duggan, 2015; Pew Research
Center, 2015b). Once a message is received on a messaging app, the smartphone notifies
the user, just as beepers would. It is the current century’s replacement of beepers in ESM.
Moreover, on messaging apps you can send a longer text message than with a
beeper, and when combined with mobile web, this means that researchers can send a link
to a mobile-compatible online survey that can then be quickly completed by the
participants. Instead of carrying a beeper and a protocol, participants will be notified (by
a messaging app) and surveyed (on the mobile web) on their smartphones. Many
smartphone messaging apps are also compatible with personal computers (PCs), which
facilitates a participant’s use of a computer to fill out the survey. Pew Research Center
(2015a) has employed the ESM with smartphones in nationally representative survey
studies, and others are showing an interest in incorporating smartphones in survey
research (e.g. Sonck & Fernee, 2013).
This method was tested in the first pretest of this study. Participants were asked to
complete an introductory survey, and then were signaled in a smartphone messenger app
(programmed using Telegram messenger app’s bot API system) on three randomly-

53
selected days to complete a follow-up survey where time use variables were asked. All
four surveys asked about time spent in the past three hours. As a result of this pretest, two
problems emerged. The first problem was with the participation rate. Of the twelve who
completed the introductory survey8, only eight people participated in the follow-ups, and
just five of them completed all three of the follow-up surveys, resulting in fragmented
data. The second problem was with the user interface of MTurk’s bonus payment system.
The introductory surveys were paid out as a job completed, but the follow-ups which
happened outside the MTurk eco-system (via signaling on a smartphone messenger app)
were paid for as bonuses on MTurk. The bonus payment system on the web was very
complicated to use, however, and required too much time and complex record-keeping to
deploy for hundreds of participants. Therefore, a decision was made not to use this
method but survey the participants for a single three-hour period of time use.
4.1.4 Working with time estimates
Robinson and Godbey (1999) listed multiple risks in asking participants “how
many hours do you work?” or “how many hours do you watch TV?” They argued that
this assumes that each participant (pp.58-59):
•
•
•
8

Interprets “work” or “TV” the same way.
Separates the most important activity (the primary activity) from other
activities that are taking place simultaneously but are ancillary or less
important (secondary activities).
Undertakes the work of searching memory for all episodes of work or
television yesterday or the last week.

The pretest was released for nine participants on MTurk, but twelve people ended up completing
the introductory survey, resulting in three people not being compensated for their work. I posted a question
on Reddit’s MTurk community, and the most plausible response was that it might be due to the survey link
being available in the job preview before the job is accepted by the participant. Therefore, in the second
pretest and the final survey I employed Javascript codes that display the survey link only after a participant
accepted to do the job. It seemed to have worked because the second pretest was released for nine and
completed by nine, and the final survey was released for 591 and was completed by 593 with only two
overages without compensation. I still do not have an answer why two more people did the work in the
final survey without reporting their completion for compensation, though.

Is able to properly add up all the episode lengths across the day yesterday
or across days in the last week.
Feels comfortable describing this duration to an interviewer when it may
not be a typical day or week.
Avoid reverting to social norms, stereotypes, or images of themselves
about how much a “normal” person ought to work, like the normal 40hour workweek. (p. 59)

The above list of problems for time-estimate questions is applicable to many
typical surveys. However, the survey method was selected instead of a time diary for the
second reason they list above in that a survey is more conducive to capturing ancillary
activities as discussed in chapter 2, section 2.3. Moreover, time use activities are not to be
treated as mutually exclusive in the survey for this study. This means that if someone
spent 30 minutes to do personal research on computer, the 30 minutes count towards both
Computer use and Reading/doing research, which is harder to accomplish with time diary.
The survey method facilitates asking about topic interests, temporal history of the interest
and time spent on topics.
In addition, for the third and fourth problems (memory and episode lengths),
instead of asking about a typical day or week, the survey asks specifically about the last
three hours, a very small time period that is the freshest in the participants’ minds. This is
done to minimize the impact of memory bias as an issue. Robinson and Godbey (1999)
call this a random-hour technique (p. 62). Calculating episode lengths would also be
easier with the small time period. Moreover, for time data entry method, a slider is
employed instead of text entry. This way, participants can visually add up episode lengths
using a slider instead of having to do the math in the head.

4.2 Participant
4.2.1 Amazon Mechanical Turk
Data was collected online using Qualtrics that can be used with an online sample
group such as MTurk. To establish similar parameters in MTurk demographics (i.e. those
living in the same country) and to limit the scope of time zones to a manageable size for
analysis, the sample was limited to the residents of continental U.S. (US/Eastern,
US/Central, US/Mountain, and US/Pacific time zones only). Age restriction was 18 years
of age or older.
One thing to note about MTurk is the population characteristics. It is unlikely to
be representative of the general population: previous studies using MTurk show that
Internet users are different from non-Internet users, and MTurk workers tend to be
“younger (about 30 years old), overeducated, underemployed, less religious, and more
liberal than the general population” (Paolacci & Chandler, 2014, p. 185). However,
because this study is not about generalizing the result over the US population but more
about understanding a human behavioral characteristic, as long as the sample population
can be well identified and described, it is not a deterrent enough to reject MTurk for such
research.

56
Amazon allows requesters (the ones settings up the jobs on MTurk) to set
participant parameters such as total number of jobs approved and job approval rate. In the
first pretest no parameters were set, and some participants were found to be obvious
beginners in using the system and did not follow instructions well. Therefore, from then
on, in order to avoid complete beginners, the parameters were set to 98% approval rating
and 1,000 jobs 9 approved.
4.2.2 Alternatives
An alternative to MTurk is using college students. College students are
convenient to access and can be recruited in a large mass. However, college students have
a limited generalizability and can overly emphasize a restricted range of individuals with
similar characteristics that afforded them an admission to a university. In addition, there
was a study where college student samples have been found unreliable and the findings
suspect (Peterson & Merunka, 2014).
Moreover, one recent study compared MTurk and college student populations in
terms of how attentive they are to instructions, and found that MTurk participants were
more attentive and responded more to small text manipulations than the undergraduates
(Hauser & Schwarz, 2015).
Another alternative is to use the general public. However, random sampling of the
general public population is particularly challenging and requires excessive time and
money for this exploratory study. Even if there were a way to identify and contact a
random sample of individuals from a general population, there is still the question of

9

MTurk workers can accept 100 jobs in their first 10 days, and then can do up to 3,800 jobs per
day afterwards.

57
what types of incentives would be ideal to get the most participation in this study. Hence,
for practical reasons, it was decided to use the MTurk instead.
4.2.3 Sample size
The sample size can be determined by use of a formula. The larger the sample
size, the more likely it is representative of the population characteristics (Salkind, 2012).
Qualtrics offers the following formula for an unknown or a very large population size
(Smith, n.d., p. 3):
Necessary Sample Size = (Z-score)² * StdDev * (1-StdDev) / (margin of error)²
Z-score corresponds to the confidence level, which means how confident one
wants to be that the actual mean falls within the confidence interval (also called margin
of error in this formula.) With 98% confidence level (z-score: 2.326), 0.5 standard
deviation and 95% confidence interval (+/- 5% margin of error), the sample size comes
out to 2.3262 * 0.5 * 0.5 / 0.52 = 5.410276 * 0.25 / 0.0025 = 1.352569 / 0.0025 =
541.0276. Considering there will be some missing and/or unusable entries, 600 is
appropriate given these parameters.
4.3 Measurement/Variables

•

Demographic: Gender, Age, Local time zone

2004)

•

[Optional] An open-ended question on the topic of interest and how the
participant spent time with information regarding the topic(s) in the last 24
hours

The optional open-ended question was designed to capture topic interests and
time use activities that may not have occurred in the last three hours since three hours is
such a small window of time.
The unit of analysis is the person. Although it is possible that epistemic curiosity
may occur at a topic level, Litman’s scale has been tested at a person level only, so it will
not be used for individual topics.
The complete questionnaire is in Appendix B.

Table 4.1 Hypothesis/research questions, and items on the survey (variables)
The number of variables used in this study has been kept purposefully small,
primarily in order to reduce the complexity of the information appetite model. Also, an
increase in the number of variables means potentially an increase in the sample size to
maintain the same level of statistical power as the power is a function of sample size and
is directly related to the number of variables investigated (Krathwohl, 1997). Finally, if
the number of variables is large, for example several dozen variables, it implies that,

60
independent of each other, they respectively explain only a very small percentage of the
overall variance or effect size.
The following explains each of the variables used in this study.
1. Demographic and socio-economic status (Gender, Age, Education level,
Labor force status): These are included as personal characteristic variables.
They are routinely investigated in time use studies (e.g. J. P. Robinson &
Godbey, 1999), as well as in ATUS.
2. Personality markers
2.1. Epistemic curiosity scale (J. Litman, n.d.; J. A. Litman, 2008; J. A.
Litman & Spielberger, 2003): This scale measures two types of
intellectual curiosity. One is I-type that is about the pleasure in learning
new ideas, which is similar to browsing in information behavior. The
other is D-type that is about spending time and effort to find a solution to
a problem, which is analogous to information seeking in response to a
task or a problem. The hypothesis is that those with a higher score on this
scale will spend more time for PIPs. Validity of the scale has been tested
by Litman (2008).
2.2. Acquisition subscale from the Saving Inventory-Revised scale (Frost et
al., 2004): This is a subscale about excessive acquisition in a measure of
compulsive hoarding. The assumption is that when an opportunity to
pursue information is present as a form of new desire, those with an
excessive acquisition characteristic would resist less. Hence, the
relationship with this individual characteristic and information appetite

61
level is a research question. Validity of the SI-R scale was tested by Frost,
Steketee, and Grisham (2004).
3. Time spent on responsibilities (work/domestic/family): Time spent working
has been termed “actually working” in the questionnaire in order to
differentiate it from time spent at work yet idly or doing things that are not
related to work as it is possible to do PIP activities at work. Time spent on
domestic/family responsibilities means time spent taking care of household
affairs and/or family members. All three of these represent time spent for
responsibilities that take away from one’s free time. Therefore, the hypothesis
is that time spent for these responsibilities affect time spent for PIPs
negatively.
4. Time spent on PIP activities: The previous chapter explained the PIPs
compiled for the purpose of this study. These activities cover all gamut of PIP:
consumption, dissemination, and creation of information for personal reasons.
They are the following.
4.1. Taking/studying for a class on a subject of personal interest: This is
different from taking/studying for a class for academic reasons. One may
be taking an online or offline class on a variety of topics of personal
interest, ranging from hobby to personal development to self-defense.
Learning new information and potentially sharing it with others are good
examples of PIPs.
4.2. Researching purchases: This involves mostly comparison shopping such
as browsing through circulars, comparing prices at different stores (online

62
and/or offline), reading product reviews, and so on. This also involves
learning new information and sharing it with others.
4.3. Computer use for personal interest (excluding games): All the other six
activities can be done on a computer, or not on a computer, therefore this
activity is asked separately. Because participants are asked not to treat
these PIP activities mutually exclusively in terms of time use, if someone
spent 30 minutes reading product reviews on the computer, the 30
minutes count for both Researching purchases and Computer use. Hence,
this covers all varieties of PIPs performed on the computer.
4.4. Reading/doing research for personal interest: This includes reading print
materials such as books, newspapers, and magazines, or reading materials
online, as well as doing research for personal interest. It is a classic
example of consuming information.
4.5. Writing/blogging for personal interest: This involves creating content
which is one of the major groups of information behaviors (St. Jean et al.,
2012), and is one of the three major activities in PIP (create, consume,
and disseminate). Blogging is also creating and sharing information
combined.
4.6. Listening/watching radio, podcast, TV, or videos for personal interest:
This is consuming multimedia contents on TV, radio, computer, or
mobile devices. Multimedia use is found to be one of the five major
groups of information behaviors (St. Jean et al., 2012). For example,

63
watching YouTube videos for instructions is consuming information and
falls under this category.
4.7. Creating multimedia contents for personal interest: As mentioned before,
content creation is one of the major groups of information behaviors (St.
Jean et al., 2012) and a major part of PIP, and here is multimedia content
creation separate from writing.
5. Topic interests (temporal context, time spent, optional open-ended question):
Temporal context of topic interest means for how long one has been interested
in a topic of personal interest. Temporal context and time spent on a topic of
interest are collected in two sets. The optional open-ended question asks about
topic interests and time use in the last 24 hours because three hours is a small
window of time and may not capture topic interests activity well.
4.4 Plan for Data Analysis
The actual steps for data analysis will depend on the results obtained from each
statistical analysis; the results would indicate the next appropriate test to employ.
However, this method still assumes an overall view of what could be applicable after
certain tests are run. The following represents a basic framework of key tests in the data
analysis plan. It has been informed by the analysis performed on the ATUS dataset in the
previous chapter. Statistical procedures are to be performed in SPSS and Statgraphics.
•

Report information about the population characteristic such as the number
of people in different time zones, gender, education level, and labor force
status.

64
•

Check descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of variables to
assess the measures of central tendency, variability, and so on.

•

Activity variables
o Sum up the activity-based time use variables to create a PIP time
use variable.
o Run cluster analysis on the PIP time use variable to identify the
high information appetite group.
o Perform factor analysis to reduce the activity-based time use
variables to a smaller number of dimensions.
o Conduct hypothesis driven analyses using assessments of basic
differences (e.g. t-test and chi-square) and multiple regression.

•

Topic variables
o Run tests that compare paired means (Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test)
to compare the means of time spent on topics.
o Assess whether there are information appetite level and topic
differences in time spent on topics (mixed ANOVA).
o Conduct hypothesis driven analyses using multiple regression.
o Analyze the open-ended question on how the participant spent time
with information regarding their topics of interest in the last 24
hours.

Chapter 5 Study 2: Results and Discussion
This chapter reports the results and findings of the study presented in the previous
chapter on Method. Discussed here are the results of the survey data gathering process,
the demographic profile of the participants, and review of the findings using the
propositions proposed in chapter 1 as well as the research questions and the hypotheses
proposed in chapter 2. The propositions, research questions, and hypotheses are the
following.
Proposition 1. Individuals have varying degrees of information appetite, as
measured by the amount of time spent engaging in personal information practices (PIPs).
PIPs encompass consumption, dissemination, and creation of information for personal
reasons.
Proposition 2. An individual has different information appetites for different
topical areas.
HP1. Information appetite in one type of activity does not predict information
appetite in other types of activities.
HP2. Individual characteristics such as age, gender, and education level affect the
time spent for PIPs.
HP3. Time spent for PIPs is negatively affected by time spent for work, domestic,
and family responsibilities.
RQ1. What are the relationships between the activity-based information appetite
and the topical information appetite along with the topic’s temporal context?
HP4. Those with a higher epistemic curiosity score will spend more time for PIPs.

66
RQ2. How do the participants’ reported compulsive acquisition symptoms relate
to the time they spent for PIPs?
5.1 Survey Data Gathering Process
The MTurk job with the Qualtrics survey link was posted on Amazon Mechanical
Turk on Friday, January 29, 2016 at 6:35pm EST, and was live until 9:20pm EST for 591
participants. 10 (Nine participants were pretested to make sure the survey process runs
smoothly, earlier in the same day from 5:28pm EST to 6:16pm EST.) The survey was
filled out by 593 participants 11, resulting in 602 total participants in the dataset when the
nine from the pretest were included. According to the MTurk system, the participants
took 15 minutes 36 seconds on average to finish the job, resulting in $15.385 average
hourly rate after their $4.00 compensation.
The pretest of nine participants had taken 48 minutes to complete. In the survey of
591 participants, as shown in the figure below, 99% of the survey was taken during the
first hour and a half, and then the rate of completion slowed down dramatically. How
exactly Amazon displays a job to a participant is not disclosed, but from this experience it
can be surmised that Amazon releases a larger job to a larger number of people, and as
the number of participants left for a job decreases, it is exposed to a smaller and smaller
number of people.

10

Given that the pretest of nine participants took 48 minutes to complete, at first it was assumed
that the full study of 600 participants would take several days to complete. Hence Friday was chosen to
include some weekdays and weekend days in the sample. The data collection on MTurk was completed
much faster than anticipated, however. Moreover, as mentioned in the previous chapter, it was decided not
to run the survey in chunks of smaller number of people due to technical difficulties. Hence the survey was
conducted in the one-time cross-sectional method.
11
This issue was discussed in the previous chapter.

67

Figure 5.1 Qualtrics survey start times (y axis: number of participants)

Figure 5.2 Qualtrics survey durations (y axis: number of participants)

68
According to the survey durations report from Qualtrics, the participants took
from around 2:30 to 55 minutes to complete the survey, with 86% of them in the 5 to
12:30 minutes range.
Although some answers turned out to be invalid (most notably, not indicating a
unit in the question “for how long you have been interested in the topic”), all respondents
who completed the survey received payment for their participation.

5.3 Data Analyses
5.3.1 Activity-based information appetite
First, a PIP variable was created from the sum of time spent in all seven PIP
activity categories: Taking/studying for a class on a subject of personal interest,
Researching purchases, Computer use for personal interest (excluding games),
Reading/doing research for personal interest, Writing/blogging for personal interest,
Listening/watching radio, podcast, TV, or videos for personal interest, and Creating
multimedia contents for personal interest. Then, another variable (PIP_count) was created
for hypothesis 1 (information appetite in one type of activity does not predict information
appetite in other types of activities), by counting the number of PIP activities that a
participant engaged in (i.e. spent more than 1 minute on the activity).
Unlike in the ATUS dataset, however, analysis of the PIP_count variable as
shown in the frequency table below suggests that hypothesis 1 is not supported. The
mean is 3.49 with the standard deviation of 1.84. Although in the ATUS dataset 83% of
the individuals engaged in one to two activities only, here the number of activities
engaged in is much larger and more dispersed. Also, it is notable that 11.6% participated
in all seven activities.

The table below shows participation rate of each of the PIP activities and
descriptive statistics of the time spent. Overall, the participation rates are much higher
than in the ATUS dataset (see table 2.2 for comparison). The highest participation rate is
in the computer use for personal interest category, followed by reading/doing research
and listening/watching multimedia contents. The highest participation rate category is
perhaps not surprising because the participants were working on MTurk when they took
the survey, which means they had already spent some time on the computer.

Table 5.8 Descriptive statistics of the seven PIP activities
5.3.2 MTurk and ATUS datasets
As shown above, the MTurk and the ATUS datasets paint very different pictures.
In this study, the statistical findings from the data collected on MTurk will not be
compared to the findings from the ATUS dataset for the following reasons. First, in this
study the ATUS dataset was not used to generalize findings, but instead as a way of
exploring hypotheses and the first proposition. The ATUS dataset was examined to
explain the presence of subgroup clusters (the high information appetite group vs. the
regular group), to generate a hypothesis, and to explore some research hypotheses and
proposition. It was not intended to provide benchmarks for comparable results between
the MTurk and ATUS samples.

12

The percentage of population that spent time on the activity. Participation rate percentage is
calculated as Doers / All persons * 100 (Harvey, 1999, pp. 32–36).
13
n = Those who participated in the activity (Total sample size: 602)

76
Second, the MTurk participants were already using a computer when they took
the survey, which can explain the reason behind the large participation rate in the
computer use activity category. This is a crucially different context than in the ATUS
dataset. Third, the ATUS dataset collected data on one full day, but the MTurk study here
collected data on three hours in the middle of a weekday. This is another contextual
discrepancy. These contextual differences make it hard to compare the two datasets.
5.3.3 High information appetite group
Cluster analysis was performed to segregate the high information appetite (IA)
group from the PIP variable (total time spent in PIPs). A Two-Step cluster analysis with
the Euclidean distance measure resulted in two clusters as shown below.

Since the size of cluster 2 was too small to conduct further statistical analyses, it
was decided to find an alternative approach to define the high IA group. This time, the
high IA group was defined as more than one standard deviation away from the mean
(total time spent in PIPs’ value greater than 121.7 + 114.898 = 236.598).

5.3.4 Variable relationships to the time spent for PIPs
Additional inferential statistics procedures were performed to find the strength of
associations between variables. A multiple regression analysis was conducted with the
time spent for PIPs as a dependent variable to find out the relationships between personal
and situational independent variables and the time spent for PIPs.
The independent variables in the final multiple regression model were the
following.
•

Time spent actually working and time spent for domestic/family responsibilities
have been removed from the model because the dependent variable (time spent for PIPs)
could potentially affect them (e.g. spending time on PIPs at work instead of actually
working, or spending too much time reading instead of cleaning the house.) According to
Allison (1999), if the dependent variable affects the independent variable it might result
in a bias of every coefficient in the regression model.
In addition, highest level of school completed was removed from the model
because it accounted for less than 1% of the variance (.001 in adjusted R2) and the
tolerance values in collinearity statistics were very low in multiple categories.
The combination of the independent variables listed above significantly predicted
time spent for PIPs, F(10, 591) = 4.061, p < .001, with three of the variables significantly
contributing to the prediction. The adjusted R2 value was .048, indicating that 4.8% of the
variance in time spent for PIPs was explained by this model. The beta weights suggest
that being employed at work contributes the most to predicting time spent for PIPs in the
negative direction, and that being younger and having the tendency to acquire things also
contribute to this prediction.

Table 5.18 Multiple regression analysis summary predicting time spent for PIPs (N = 602)
The squared part correlations represent the strength of the unique predictive
contribution of each particular variable (Warner, 2013). It shows that age uniquely
predicted about 1% of the variance in time spent for PIPs, when all the other variables
were statistically controlled. The rest of the variables predicted less than 1% of the
variance in time spent for PIPs.
Although a normal distribution is not strictly required in multiple regression
(Allison, 1999), to see if transforming the y variable (PIP) would yield a different result,
the PIP variable was transformed into a square root of it (SQRT(PIP) in SPSS). The
square root was chosen because it is a good transformation method for positively skewed
data. Another good method, a log transformation, was not selected because a log of zero
results in an undefined value, and yet zero is a meaningful value in total time spent for
PIPs. A square root of zero is zero.

Then, multiple regression was conducted with the same set of independent
variables to determine the best linear combination of the variables for predicting time
spent for PIPs. The combination of independent variables significantly predicted time
spent for PIPs, F(10, 591) = 4.889, p < .001, with four of the variables significantly
contributing to the prediction. The adjusted R2 value was .061, indicating that 6.1% of the
variance in time spent for PIPs was explained by this model. The beta weights suggest
that being employed at work contributes the most to predicting time spent for PIPs in the
negative direction, and that being male, being younger, and having the tendency to
acquire things also contribute to this prediction.

Table 5.19 Multiple regression analysis summary predicting time spent for PIPs (square
root) (N = 602)
The squared part correlations show that being employed at work uniquely
predicted about 1.2% of the variance in time spent for PIPs, when all the other variables
were statistically controlled. Having the tendency to acquire things predicted about 1.1%
of the variance. The rest of the variables predicted less than 1% of the variance in time
spent for PIPs.
5.3.5 Factor analysis
Factor analysis was performed to find out which of the seven PIP time use
variables exhibit similar patterns. The seven PIP time use variables are Taking/studying

86
for a class on a subject of personal interest, Researching purchases, Computer use for
personal interest (excluding games), Reading/doing research for personal interest,
Writing/blogging for personal interest, Listening/watching radio, podcast, TV, or videos
for personal interest, and Creating multimedia contents for personal interest.
Here, principal axis factor analysis (PA) method was used to extract relationships
because it is good for understanding the covariation among variables (not reproducing all
information including variance and covariance as principal component analysis does)
(Leech et al., 2015). PA with varimax rotation was conducted, and two components were
rotated based on the eigenvalues over one criterion. After rotation, the two components
combined accounted for 43% of the variance. Component 1 accounted for 25% of the
variance, and component 2 accounted for 18%. The table below displays the items and
component loadings for the rotated components.

In factor 1, it is notable that creating information (writing/blogging and creating
multimedia contents) load together. Taking/studying for a class and researching
purchases also load in factor 1. In factor 2, consuming information (reading/research and
listening/watching multimedia contents) and computer use load together. This indicates
that most of the consumption might have been done on the computer.
5.3.6 Topic-based information appetite
To test proposition 2 that an individual has different information appetites for
different topical areas, a nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test was conducted. It
was chosen in order to compare paired means for continuous data that are not normally
distributed. In this case, the pairs were time spent for topic A and time spent for topic B.
As with time spent in PIPs, time spent for topics also exhibit positively skewed, long tail
distributions, so Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test was appropriate.
The Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test showed that 329 people spent more time on
topic A, 175 spent more time on topic B, and there were 98 ties (N = 602). The difference
indicating more time spent for topic A was statistically significant (Z = -7.032, p < .001, r
= -0.20).

Then, the SPSS file was split according to the IA group (high IA vs. regular), and
the same statistical test was run again.

88
In the regular IA group, the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test showed that 287 people
spent more time on topic A, 155 spent more time on topic B, and there were 94 ties (N =

Table 5.23 Descriptive statistics of the time spent on topics in the high IA group
Then, a mixed ANOVA was conducted to assess whether there were IA level and
topic differences in time spent on topics. Results indicated a statistically significant main
effect of topic, F(1, 600) = 36.173, p < .001, partial eta2 = .057. In other words, the
difference on time spent on topics between topic A and B was statistically significant. IA
group effect was statistically significant also at F(1, 600) = 97.712, p < .001, partial eta2
= .140. This means that the test of whether people in different IA groups spent time on
topics differently is significant. However, the topic main effect was qualified by a

89
statistically significant interaction between topic and IA group, F(1, 600) = 5.023, p
= .025, partial eta2 = .008. Examining the means and standard deviations of the time spent
on topics between regular and high IA groups shows that both regular and high IA groups
spent more time on topic A, and high IA group spent more time on both topics A and B
than the regular group did.
Next, multiple regressions were conducted as the time spent on topic A and topic
B as dependent variables, respectively. The independent variables were the same as in the
multiple regression model for the time spent for PIPs, except the addition of time
interested in the topic. They were the following.
•

•

Labor force status (Reference category: Not in labor force)

•

Time interested in the topic (in days)

N was 553 for topic A, reduced from the total N of 602, because there were some
missing values in time interested in topic A. The model’s prediction of time spent on
topic A was marginally significant, F(11, 541) = 1.671, p = .077, with four of the
variables significantly contributing to the prediction. The adjusted R2 value was .013,
indicating that 1.3% of the variance in time spent on topic A was explained by this model.

Table 5.24 Multiple regression analysis summary predicting time spent on topic A (N =

For topic B, N was 551, reduced from the total N of 602, because of the missing
values in time interested in the topic B. The independent variables did not predict the

91
time spent on topic B, however, F(11, 539) = 1.460, p = .143. The statistics showed that
the time interested in the topic B statistically significantly predicted time spent on topic B
(beta = .097), but since the overall model is not significant, this has little meaning.
5.3.7 Topics and time with information in the last 24 hours
Lastly, the open-ended question on how the participant spent time with
information regarding their topics of interest in the last 24 hours was analyzed. This
question was optional and was completed by 301 out of 602 participants.
Largely four themes emerged from the data. First was the availability of time, or
the lack there of. Second was the temporal context, or the length of time they have been
interested in the topic. Third was why they were interested in a certain topic, and the
fourth was doing multiple PIP activities at the same time.
First, the participants noted that they did not spend much time for PIPs in the past
three hours because they were at work or attending to domestic/family responsibilities.
Several mentioned that they spend more time for PIPs in the evenings (e.g. after work, or
after kids have gone to bed) or weekends. Several also wished they had more free time
for PIPs. Some mentioned that they spent time on PIPs while at work, often during breaks
or down time.
Second, the temporal context turned out to be a complex one. Many times it was
nested at multiple levels – such as being interested in politics for many years, then the
upcoming presidential election, and caucuses. Interests in caucuses were short-termed,
but it was nested within a medium-term interest in the presidential election, and longterm interests in politics and news. Some had a long-term interest in favorite TV shows,

92
and then a short-term burst of interest in a new cast member. Then there were long-term
interests such as cooking, and a short-term interest of a recipe for the night.
The data showed that there were two modes of attention for long-term, ongoing
interests: One is that it may stay dormant in the back of the mind until a related shortterm interest pops up, which then takes the center stage over other interests. For instance,
one participant had a 30 year interest in gardening, but warmer weather on the day of the
survey made her want to take action and research plants. Another participant was a
lifelong gamer, and finding out about a new game prompted her to research it to see if she
wanted to purchase it. A long-term movie goer read reviews of new movies because of a
plan to go to the movie with friends on the weekend. The other is that one continuously
and regularly (almost every day) checks for new information on the long-term interested
topic. Being up to date on the topic is important to these participants.
Third, the participants described why they were interested in a certain topic. The
most prominent reason was research for practical purposes such as income tax, travel
planning, redecorating, fixing a computer, and so on. Some of the other major reasons
included researching purchases (e.g. car, cell phone, small appliances, etc.) and the
upcoming presidential election. The next was a major life event for themselves or close
ones such as moving, pregnancy, or having a serious illness such as cancer. Personal
goals such as losing weight, writing a book, or a career goal were also mentioned.
Fourth, some participants mentioned that they did multiple PIP activities together
such as researching information on a TV show on a tablet while watching the TV show,
listening to a radio episode and looking up a print copy of the story at the same time, or
having YouTube running in the background while being online.

93
5.4 Discussion
The first proposition was that individuals have varying degrees of information
appetite, as measured by the amount of time spent engaging in personal information
practices (PIPs). The distribution of the total time spent for PIPs was positively skewed
with a long tail in that there were many people who did not spend much time for PIPs,
but at the same time there were a small number of people who spent a lot of time in PIPs.
The distributions of times spent on topics also exhibited a similar shape. In addition, a
cluster analysis identified a small group of people who spent much time for PIPs, namely
a high information appetite (IA) group. The number was very small (4.5% of the sample),
though, so throughout the data analyses mean plus one standard deviation was used to
distinguish the high IA group (11% of the sample). The proposition was supported in that
individuals spent varying degrees of time in PIPs, reflecting their IA level.
The second proposition was that an individual has different information appetites
for different topical areas. This was supported by statistical analyses of the time spent on
topics. Respondents were asked to provide two different topics that they were interested
in the last three hours, topic A and topic B, and then asked how much time they spent on
each topic. According to the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test, 504 out of 602 respondents
(84%) spent either more time on topic A or more time on topic B (i.e. not a tie between
the two). The difference on time spent on topics between topic A and B was statistically
significant in mixed ANOVA. Based on these results, proposition two was also supported.
Additionally, more people spent more time on topic A, which happened even though the
participants were instructed to name the topics in no particular order.

94
Hypothesis 1, information appetite in one type of activity does not predict
information appetite in other types of activities, was not supported by the MTurk dataset.
Although in the ATUS dataset 83% of the individuals engaged in one to two activities
only, in the MTurk dataset the number of activities engaged in was much larger and more
dispersed (Mean = 3.49, Std. Dev. = 1.84). 64.4% were involved in two to four activities.
Moreover, 11.6% of the respondents participated in all seven activities. One thing to note
is that this difference between the ATUS and the MTurk results might be due to the fact
that in the MTurk survey PIP activities were not treated as mutually exclusive, so the
participants could report more activities than one for a given time period. Moreover, the
MTurk sample was using a computer when they answered the survey, and 90.9% of the
participants said they used a computer for PIPs. So the PIP activities they performed
likely happened on the computer, and the participants must have counted computer use in
addition to their other PIP activities in the survey answer, which might be the reason of
64.4% being involved in two to four activities.
Hypothesis 2, individual characteristics such as age, gender, and education level
affect the time spent for PIPs, was partially supported. According to comparisons of
regular and high IA groups, age difference was found to be statistically significant, but
gender and education level differences were not. As for the age, the high IA group was
younger (Mean = 32.08, Std. Dev. = 10.35) than the regular group (Mean = 35.47, Std.
Dev. = 11.20). Multiple regression analysis also showed that being younger contributes to
the prediction of time spent for PIPs.
Hypothesis 3, time spent for PIPs is negatively affected by time spent for work,
domestic, and family responsibilities, was also partially supported. When the regular and

95
high IA groups were compared, the difference in time spent actually working was found
marginally significant in that the high IA group had spent less time actually working.
However, the difference in time spent on domestic/family responsibilities was not found
to be statistically significant.
These two variables were not included in the multiple regression analysis because
time spent actually working and time spent for domestic/family responsibilities could be
affected by the time spent for PIPs (e.g. spending time on PIPs at work instead of actually
working, or spending too much time reading instead of cleaning the house). If the
dependent variable affects the independent variable, it might create a bias in the
regression model (Allison, 1999).
Research question 1 was: what are the relationships between the activity-based
information appetite and the topical information appetite along with the topic’s temporal
context? This was investigated with mixed ANOVA analysis to assess whether there
were IA level (determined from the activity-based IA) and topic differences in time spent
on topics. The results showed that the difference on time spent on topics between topic A
and B was statistically significant, and the test of whether people in different IA groups
spent time on topics differently was also significant. Both regular and high IA groups
spent more time on topic A 16, and the high IA group spent more time on both topics A
and B than the regular group did.
As for the topic’s temporal context, statistical analyses did not reveal any useful
results and it could not be determined whether a topic’s temporal context affects time
spent on topics. However, analysis of the open-ended question on time spent on
16

This must be an order effect, although the participants were instructed to list the topics “in no
particular order.” The full survey questionnaire is in Appendix B.

96
interested topics in the last 24 hours indicated a complex relationship between the topics
and the temporal context. A nested structure was found where a short-term interest stems
from a medium-term interest, which in turn is nested inside a long-term interest. As such,
when answering the survey some participants responded on time spent on their current
short-term interest along with how long they have been interested in their long-term
interest. This could have thrown off the survey results.
Hypothesis 4, those with a higher EC score will spend more time for PIPs, was
supported by the t-test between regular and high IA groups, but was not supported by the
multiple regression analysis. According to the t-test, both EC scores were higher in the
high IA group (the group that spent more time in PIPs). However, in the multiple
regression model, the relationship between the EC variables and the time spent in PIPs
was not found to be statistically significant.
RQ2 was how the participants’ reported compulsive acquisition symptoms
related to the time they spent for PIPs. The relationship between the acquisition scale
scores and the time spent for PIPs was found to be statistically significant in the multiple
regression analysis, and according to the beta weight a higher scale score (i.e. having the
tendency to acquire things) related to more time spent in PIPs.
Overall, the multiple regression model of time spent for PIPs had a very small
effect size of 4.8%. There was a similar result with the ATUS dataset in its high IA group.
This suggests that some other factors that were not investigated in this study might be
affecting results. The next chapter proposes plans for future research to further study
these undiscovered aspects of information appetite.

97
Chapter 6 Conclusion
In this chapter, implications of the findings and limitations in the studies reported
in this dissertation as well as plans for future research are discussed. It ends with
concluding remarks.
6.1 Variables and the Revised Model
What approaches or perspectives might explain information appetite (IA)? The
answer can be considered in terms of person and situation variables. First would be
personal characteristics embedded within an individual such as personality, which acts to
produce a particular information behavior that is consistent across different situations and
is stable over time. However, personality variables such as epistemic curiosity were
found to have minimal effect in the MTurk study. The results did not support that an
individual’s IA level would be universal across all situations and be persistent over time.
Rather, it is driven by opportunity such as free time available for personal information
practices (PIPs), by need-driven interests, and so on.
Second, IA might be primarily explained by situation variables alone. A situation
variable was found important in that free time available for PIPs was a powerful predictor
of time spent for PIPs. Yet, there is no reason to assume that the situational circumstances
can be generalized over individuals and then over time. For example, some situations
generate short-lived interests: needing a car may invoke a high IA in a car-related topic
but for only a period of time while the necessity exists. Needing to fix something creates
a high IA in the topic until the deed is done. Moreover, relying on situation variables
alone betrays the common observation that some people exhibit excessive information
seeking tendencies even when there is no pressing need to do so.

98
Therefore, it can be concluded that a combination of both person and situation
variables is at work. Future research will have to find variables that are reasonable at the
collection level, however.
In the studies reported in this dissertation, the person variables were not found to
make meaningful contributions to the model. Rather, it was a situation variable such as
having free time that turned out to be the most important factor in predicting the time
spent for PIPs. A person variable that was found to be a significant factor, the compulsive
acquisition symptoms personality variable, explains that when the desire to spend time is
presented, those with a higher acquisition impulse will more readily act on the desire and
spend more time in PIPs.
The preliminary model presented in Chapter 1 has been revised as follows.
Situation variables have been added to the model, an example of which is short-term
needs. Topic interests have been revised to long-term topic interests to reflect the nested
structure of temporal contexts in topic interests. The nested structure means that
individuals were shown to have long term interests, and then medium term and short term
interests that are nested within the long term interests. What is learned from the MTurk
study is that a short-term interest born of a short-term need (e.g. fixing something broken)
and a short-term interest born of a long-term interest (e.g. interest in some new TV actors
as potential casts while being interested in a TV show for a long time, or interest in a
caucus while being interested in politics for a long time) should be differentiated. As such,
a short-term topic interest born of a short-term need would be classified as the situation
variable, whereas a short-term topic interest born of a long-term interest would be
classified as the long-term topic interest.

6.2 Implications
The major implication of the research in this dissertation is that time is used as the
measure of information appetite, and as both propositions show, individuals were found
to be spending various amount of time in PIP activities and in different topics. Hence the
studies validate the use of time as the measure.
The second implication is the situation variable, having free time. In information
overload, the insufficiency of time was a major factor in determining the state of
information overload, and some scholars argued that individuals exercise various
strategies to avoid being overloaded (Jacoby, 1984; Savolainen, 2007). The strategies
such as filtering and withdrawal might be at work in satisfying information appetite as
well. The filtering strategy is filtering out useless information from the sources while
focusing on the content to avoid; the withdrawal strategy is minimizing the daily
information sources, focusing on the information supply to avoid in order not to be
overwhelmed with information (Savolainen, 2007). This means that when individuals
know that they have limited free time for information use, they might employ similar
strategies to economically spend their time, and such time use may not accurately
represent their actual desire to spend time with information. This presents a challenge in

100
measuring information appetite as it is difficult to measure an individual’s desire directly.
Hence, extra questions would be needed to find out if the participants economized their
time spending or not.
The situation variable, having free time, also relates to the question of information
appetite and satiety. The studies here assumed that people stop information seeking when
they are satiated. However, for those with high information appetite, it is questionable
whether they have been truly satiated: they may not have been satiated, but stopped
because they ran out of available time. Moreover, several people mentioned in the openended question that they spend more time with information during evenings and
weekends when their time use is less constricted. In a future study, asking individuals
why they stopped information seeking would be one way to learn if they stopped because
their information appetite was satiated or because of other reasons such as running out of
free time.
And yet, for long-term interests, perhaps satiety is a state that is never reached.
Case (2012) pointed out that with an interest that is from a lifetime curiosity, there is no
identifiable time pressure (p. 41). Any such information seeking could be picked up later
where it had been left off and continued indefinitely. So, for long-term interests, one
might never be fully satiated, yearning for more information endlessly.
One area that is left for future study is the three dimensions of PIPs –
consumption, dissemination, and creation of information for personal reasons. In the
factor analysis of the time spent on PIP activities in the MTurk study, creation activities
loaded together as well as the consumption activities. However, since the PIP activity
categories were largely informed by the ATUS study, several activities covered multiple

101
dimensions, which made it impossible to analyze the effect of each dimension separately.
A future study on PIPs and their three dimensions, as well as their influence on
information appetite, might uncover the separate contributions of PIP dimensions and
yield valuable insights.
Another area for future study is the kinds of information behaviors that represent
high information appetite. Examples would be reading newspapers regularly or keeping
up with the YouTube subscription feed daily. This dissertation focused on measuring
information appetite with time, but did not investigate the kinds of behaviors that are
exhibited by those with high information appetite. Such data could be gathered from
focus groups, interviews, or a panel study where the researcher follows a group of
participants over time.
The third area left for future study is if information appetite runs in families. Does
parents’ information appetite affect their children? Once the above-mentioned data on
information behaviors that represent high information appetite is gathered, the behaviors
could be used as markers to analyze both parents and children in a family and see if there
is any pattern of similarities. There are some studies that argue that children inherit their
parents’ habits via genetic disposition and model learning (e.g. driving habits (Bianchi &
Summala, 2004; Ferguson, Williams, Chapline, Reinfurt, & De Leonardis, 2001; G.
Miller & Taubman - Ben-Ari, 2010; Taubman - Ben-Ari, Mikulincer, & Gillath, 2005)),
but there is little such research in information behavior except for early research on
reading habits (e.g. Stone & Wetherington Jr., 1979). If high information appetite is
found to involve promotable behavior, studying intergenerational influence would be
useful.

102
6.3 Limitations
To minimize the effect of memory, the MTurk survey asked about time
expenditure in the last three hours only. In the open-ended question that asked about their
time spending in interested topics in the last 24 hours, some participants noted that the
last three hours did not represent their typical time expenditure. A time diary or a survey
of a full day’s record would have been more appropriate; or multiple samplings of three
hours over multiple days would have been good, too. In fact in the MTurk study it was
planned to execute the latter plan, but the plan changed to a single survey after the first
pretest, as discussed in Chapter 4 for reasons that were particular to MTurk. It would be
appropriate to execute the plan again on samples that are more controllable than MTurk,
and see if this makes a difference in the results.
Moreover, the survey was conducted in the one-time cross-sectional way. This
also happened due to the way MTurk worked, as discussed earlier in Chapters 4 and 5. In
future studies, it would be interesting to include various days (both weekdays and
weekends) and time periods in the data.
The next limitation was that the MTurk sample was using a computer when the
individuals responded to the survey. This created a context where they have been using a
computer (for potentially PIPs) for a while before answering the survey. As such, the
MTurk sample’s participation rate in the computer use for PIPs was the highest among
PIP activities at almost 91%. This is an important contextual distinction to note.
In addition, in the MTurk study of topic interests, it did not differentiate topic
interests born of a short-term need or those born of a long-term interest. After the study
was done, in the data there was a confusion in the reporting of the length of time

103
interested in the topic in that those who had a short-term interest born of a long-term
interest did not seem sure whether to report the short time or the long time that they were
interested in the topic. Therefore, these distinctions would have to be clearly made in
future studies.
Next, there could be an alternative way of defining the high IA group. Instead of
running cluster analysis or using mean plus standard deviation on the total time spent for
PIPs, specific outliers in the total time spent for PIPs could be picked and of those
outliers, other variables could be investigated to identify those who share similar
characteristics. This way, those who have potentially high IA but did not spend much
time during the surveyed time period might be identified in the high IA group. This
method has not been explored in this dissertation, however. Also, such grouping would
need to be confirmed with an additional, follow-up method such as an interview.
Lastly, the ATUS dataset and the study on MTurk were conducted on samples
drawn from the United Sates population. There are other time use datasets available from
other countries such as Europe; it would be interesting to analyze them and see if the
propositions that were supported in this dissertation are also supported in samples from
other countries.
6.4 Future Studies
Three future studies will be presented here. First is an in-depth interview/focus
group, second is a survey with follow-up interview, and third is an experiment.
First, the purpose of the in-depth interviews (individual interviews and focus
groups) is to explore what affects IA, to discover the variables that will explain more
variance in the IA model, and to learn the kinds of information behaviors that represent

104
high information appetite. The focus group will be broken by discipline/profession and
age groups. The proposition is that people of high IA are drawn to certain
disciplines/professions. The interviews and focus groups will be conducted around the
following themes: what spurs them to begin and end information seeking, how regularly
and repeatedly a single topic is searched for, time spent on the topic vs. time spent
normally, topics that are searched for that are from a long-term interest vs. a short-term
need, and so on.
Second, a survey will be conducted on two student groups with different profiles:
one is college freshmen, and the other is graduate students in library studies. The
hypothesis is that graduate students in library studies will have higher IA than college
freshmen and have been attracted to information professions such as librarianship for that
reason, following the new proposition that people of high IA are drawn to certain
disciplines/professions; because college freshmen have not chosen their field yet, they
make a good comparison group. In the survey, they will be asked about time spent on
PIPs. It would take the form of time diary with PIPs as optional secondary activities.
After the survey is finished, groups of high IA participants and regular IA participants
will be identified; then they will be invited for a follow-up interview. They will be
interviewed on their time spending in PIPs, their PIP-related habits, and so on.
Third, a group of participants will be recruited for an observational experiment
that will take a set amount of time. The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the
influence of topic interests on the time expenditure and information seeking patterns. The
proposition is that IA is influenced by long-term interests. They will be asked which
topics they have long-term interests in, and one of them will be randomly picked for their

105
task. The control group will be given a topic that is not one of the participants’ long-term
interests. Using computers that are on the Internet, they will be given a task to find one or
more interesting, latest news on the topic. They are free to determine how much time they
want to spend on the task, and if they finish early, they can spend the rest of the time
however they want but they may not leave the room early. How much time they spend on
the task and their online activities will be recorded and analyzed. After the experiment,
they will be asked about the experience and the reasons behind their actions.
The experiment could also be a 2x2 design in that the sample is divided into longterm interest/no interest and information field/non-information field (e.g. library program
students vs. college freshmen) groups.
6.5 Concluding Remarks
Despite the limitations noted earlier, this study made an important contribution in
the study of information behavior by uncovering a human characteristic that has not been
studied before. As an explorative study of information appetite, and the first of its kind, it
served its role well.
Two propositions about IA were made, and both were supported by the datasets.
The first proposition was that individuals have varying degrees of information appetite,
as measured by the amount of time spent engaging in personal information practices,
which was supported by the ATUS dataset and the study on MTurk. The second
proposition was that an individual has different information appetites for different topical
areas, which was supported by the MTurk data.
A model of information appetite was proposed and explored in the MTurk study.
Although the statistical representation of the model was poorly supported in general with

106
very small explanatory power, this suggests that the variables in the model did not fully
explain the variance in information appetite, which is still a meaningful finding.
As for what affects spending time for PIPs, having free time (e.g. not working/not
having a job, or evenings and weekends) was found to be an important factor in both
statistical analyses and the analysis of the open-ended question.
Three future studies were suggested to explore what affects IA and to study two
more propositions. The first new proposition is that people of high information appetite
are drawn to certain disciplines/professions, and the second new proposition is that
information appetite is influenced by long-term interests.
This dissertation stemmed from the question about when individuals are satisfied
with information. It attempted to answer the question from the perspective of information
appetite, expressed in the amount of time spent engaging in PIPs. Even though the
finding is meager, the topic still has academic and practical importance. It presents a
behavioral model of when individuals stop information seeking. It is commonly observed
that some people spend much time even when the same task is assigned to them. IA is not
a part of relevance judgement, but instead it may represent a habit and how people spend
their time. In addition, being able to predict how much time people spend has a very
useful implication in online advertisement marketing, for instance. As the first study of
information appetite, this study served its role and paves the road for next studies.
