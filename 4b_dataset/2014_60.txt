ABSTRACT
Dissertations are a credible and trusted resource for those seeking cutting-edge
knowledge. They typically are difficult to access, and often researchers need to purchase

dissertations in order to examine them closely. Using survey methodology, this study examined
the dissertation author’s awareness of publishing in open access, as well as the key factors that
motivate the dissertation author’s decision to publish in open access format. Participants were
all doctoral and Ph.D. students or alumni at Pittsburgh area higher education institutions.
Results of the survey revealed that the majority of the doctoral alumni and doctoral students
were aware of publishing in open access. Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations were
examined, and five key factors emerged from an analysis of the survey results. The number one
motivation for publishing in open access format was an extrinsic motivation: Authors believed
open access publishing led to a richer database repository. Despite the fact that the most
frequently identified motivation was extrinsic, the other four most significant motivations were
all intrinsic. For example, open-access publishing was viewed as being of benefit to authors’
careers or as increasing authors’ prestige and reputations. The results of this research are
significant for those who wish to encourage further use of open access publishing.
Keywords: open access, publishing in open access, dissertation authors, awareness,
ProQuest, PQDT, electronic theses and dissertations, motivation factors, intrinsic motivation,
extrinsic motivation, electronic publishing, scholarly publishing, scholarly communication,
funding in open access, copyright concerns for ETDs.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Increasing Use of the Internet for Research
The increase in Internet usage, accompanied by growth in the number of people who
use the Internet for research purposes, has called attention to the problem of on-line resource
barriers. In the past, a university’s ability to support research was linked to its library (Kling &
Callahan, 2003). During this time, few dissertations would circulate past the local libraries that
housed them, and this limited the communication of research findings (Barton, 2005).
However, the increasing use of the Internet has significantly changed this situation, and digital
libraries of theses and dissertations that are available over the Internet are increasingly
important to university library collections (Moxley, 2001).
Furthermore, the Internet has increased access to research and enables people to do
much more of their own research. According to Wilinsky (2003), this differs from past
situations in which those doing research had to go to the library and seek assistance from the
librarians to find information for them (p. 6).
Open Access: Definition and History
The term open access is used to denote the provision of not only scholarly materials, but
also peer-reviewed and research information that is available to all at no cost (Swan, 2012).
This means that the right holder of the information grants an “irrevocable right” to people
globally and permits them to use, copy, transmit, distribute, and develop “derivative work” in
the formats they find suitable while undertaking any lawful activities, as long as the original
author has been credited (Swan, 2012, p. 6).

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

As Swan (2012) puts forth, the history of open access can be traced to computer
scientists during the early years of Internet use as they freed their findings for others access,
use, and starting points (p. 14). However, this was rudimentary at first, as only a discrete
community accessed this body of work (Swan, 2012). Self-archiving, which can be linked to
contemporary open access, began in 1991 when arXiv, a high-end physics print server, was
established and began handling journals (Swan, 2012). In the late 1990s, the development of a
citation-linked index, Citeseer, enabled the harvesting of articles from repositories and websites
where the computer science community would self-archive them, and shortly after, other
disciplines began following suit (Swan, 2012, p. 14).
Repositories grew as the handlers of open access material and open access journals,
began rising as an alternative. This alternative made journal articles, books, and dissertations
freely available online, and models were devised to cover the costs (Swan, Willmers, & King,
2014). It was not until December of 2001, however, that the popular working definition of open
access rose from the Budapest Open Access Initiative: this is considered the formal definition
of open access used by the Open Society Institute (Swan, 2012, p. 15).
Open Access and Dissertations
Open access increases the popularity of open access electronic theses and dissertations
(ETDs); in fact, Barton (2005) points out that ETDs were already one hundred times more
likely to be circulated in comparison to print dissertations (p. 107). This is because there are
thousands, and potentially millions, of individuals who may read open-access dissertations. In
another perspective provided by Swan (2007), the worth of a published work is measured
through citations (p. 198). Because open access enhances the visibility of the articles, affording
opportunities to read and use materials one otherwise would not have seen, the number of

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

13

citations for open-access research consequently raises the value of the research. Furthermore, it
becomes possible, through open access, to exploit synergies from the ensuing collaborations in
the open access forum (Swan, 2007).
Open access to the literature and to unpublished dissertations is one potential solution to
these formerly described online resource barriers (Barton, 2005). Open access provides its
patrons with opportunities for unlimited and free access to knowledge. Because dissertations
are often considered as the final stage in doctoral education, they intend to be exciting, creative,
and original (Knox, Burkard, Janecek, Pruitt, Fuller, & Hill, 2011). Dissertations are highly
credible and trusted resources and usually are difficult to access, so readers have a limited set
of options when it comes to accessing these essential findings of new knowledge (Dawrs,
2012). Therefore, dissertation authors should consider the open access concept so as to assist
scholars in overcoming the obstacles that prevent dissertations’ accessibility. Open access to
dissertations allows readers to access dissertations through the Internet and to use them freely
without any limitations (Park, 2007). Open access to the literature and to dissertations is a
prime solution to help researchers in their academic performance as they cope with the barriers
associated with acquiring trusted electronic resources and as they deliver a core value to the
whole education process (Evans, 2012).
Dissertations can be available without any payments to potential scholars by being
deposited into PQDT open database (ProQuest, n.d.), which can be searchable from any
location without constraints. The opportunities that it provides are beneficial and capable of
simplifying the ability to gather quality knowledge (Dulle, 2011). Those dissertation authors
who make their dissertations open access provide researchers with unlimited and free access to

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

14

knowledge and at the same time help to cut costs for the libraries that do not need to pay for the
annual cost of the repositories (Swan, Willmers, & King, 2014).
Basic reasons behind the open access and Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs)
movement indicate obstacles that potential readers face when requesting a hard copy of the
dissertations through the interlibrary loan service or contacting authors to get their permission
to obtain a copy of their dissertations (McCutcheon, 2010). Some dissertation authors are
beginning to embrace and support open access venues by supplementing institutional
repositories and academic databases (Ellingford, 2012). The growing popularity of
dissertations that are in open access for different kinds of research can be a good starting point
for further commercialization and profit extraction from someone’s work. However, many
dissertation authors still do not implement this system, as they are unable to realize its real
benefits.
Most of the studies that are related to open access concern scholarly communication,
library benefits of open access, and journal publishing in open access. Current research by
Evans (2012) focuses on how librarians at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) feel about open access venues and documents their current interactions with open
access venues. Evans concludes that librarians are aware of open access venues and are in
favor of making research freely available on the Internet; however, they are experiencing a
variety of obstacles in making the transition to open access: funding, skepticism about the
quality of work for public view, lack of institutional commitment, and low, or no, demand by
faculty and others within the academic community (Evans, 2012, p. 84).
Looking at open access publishing, Khalili (2011) explores the current status of
familiarity and experience with open access among medical researchers in Iran. Khalili

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

15

concludes that more than half of the respondents are unfamiliar with basic open access
initiatives and services, and only half of the researchers have publishing experience with open
access journals (p. 346). In the same vein, Ellingford (2012) focuses on scholars’ perceptions
and practices toward publishing in open access outlets in the social science community. The
results show that if scholars want their research read by a wider audience, they should publish
in open access journals (p. 62). Also, pro-open access policies and procedures could gain more
support by ensuring open access is promoted to non-tenured scholars seeking to publish.
Ellingford also concludes that more research, forums, discussions, and education about open
access needs to occur in greater abundance in order to continue to ameliorate scholars’ views
about the benefits of open access publishing (p. 62). In addition, Park (2007) has studied the
factors affecting scientists’ adoptions of open access publishing. The study concludes that the
social influence and perceived topical compatibility factors are insignificant for adoption and
that prior experience with and knowledge of open access publishing are significant factors to
motivate scientists to adopt open access publishing in general (Park, 2007). Many other studies
discuss the electronic theses topics. Jones & Andrew (2005) examine how the synergy of open
access had been used at Edinburgh University Library to design and implement an e-thesis
service and to offer an easy theoretical framework to aid others (p. 198). The study concludes
that open access is a natural and forward-looking way to develop e-theses and other research
material repositories.
One of the most illustrious names in open access research is Peter Suber. Therefore, it is
significant to consider his studies as main sources in open access publishing. Suber is a Senior
Researcher at the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) and the
Director of the Harvard Open Access Project (HOAP), In one of his studies, Suber (2008)

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

16

argues that electronic theses and dissertations should be considered low-hanging fruit for the
open access movement and proves that fears that open access for electronic theses and
dissertations will prevent future publication are groundless (p. 26). Other current scholars who
work in the field of scholarly communication and write extensively on open access and ETDs
are Willinsky, Swan, and Moxley. They have several publications in open access. For example,
one of the Willinsky's studies (2010) observes the various approaches that authors, journals,
and funding agencies are considering toward open access. In addition, the study explains the
open access effect on reputation for authors, journals, and the research enterprise.
Stakeholders
With open access, the dissertation author’s reputation is likely to be extended to a wider
and global population. Because wider distribution entails risk, discernment is crucial. More
importantly, for dissertation authors, the open access platform is beneficial as it is less
susceptible to duplication and deception as compared to printing (Willinsky, 2010).
Stakeholders who could benefit from open access are authors, readers, libraries, the publishing
industry, and the scientific and research community.
Authors.
It is essential to recognize authors, as they are the ones who develop the content to be
freely distributed. A significant risk for authors lies in open access as it relates to funding the
development of content to be freely distributed (Swan, 2010). However, cost benefits derived
from open access by authors relate to the increased usage metrics and media coverage of their
work on the open access platform (Swan, 2010). Open access lowers the barriers among
authors interested in actively publishing and seeing their work reach a wider audience
(MacGregor, Stranack, & Willinsky, 2014).

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

17

Readers.
Researchers must also be considered, for they are the primary beneficiaries of open
access. A primary benefit of open access entails increased accessibility and efficiency in
accessing knowledge, which is crucial for societal development (Ayris et al., 2011). As well,
readers benefit from enhanced citizen education, enhanced quality of public surveys, and
increased media reporting (Swan, 2010). However, a risk that is evident with open access
regards the increasing exposure to published material lacking professional publishing that is
likely to be available online (MacGregor, Stranack, & Willinsky, 2014).
Libraries.
During the transition to open access in publishing, libraries have found themselves
required to subscribe to certain scholarly and academic journals so as to sustain editorial
judgments and peer reviews that authors’ colleagues in the field provide (MacGregor, Stranack,
& Willinsky, 2014). In fact, with other stakeholders being relieved from making any payments,
it is the institutional libraries which are the ones most likely to end up paying subscription costs
for research (Ayris et al., 2011). However, open access brings cost benefits to libraries
considering the aggregated impact of researchers and enabling the effective creation and
dissemination of knowledge (Ayris et al., 2011). This facilitates economic efficiencies as the
cost of obtaining the disseminated literature becomes far lower in comparison to the published
print costs (Swan, 2012).
Publishing Industry.
The initial reluctance of the publishing industry to embrace open access can be
attributed to the risk of being unable to preserve profit margins, since publishing revenues were
the main source of survival, and shifting to open access poses risks to this survival

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

18

(MacGregor, Stranack, & Willinsky, 2014). However, open access has been noted to favor
small publishers who want to gain global reach as it allows them to compete with larger
publishers (Swan, 2012).
Scientific and Research Community.
It is likely to be difficult among those in the scientific and research community to
subscribe to all the journals they would wish (Swan, 2007). As is the case for the libraries
reducing journal subscriptions for budgetary reasons, the same is true for the scientific and
research community (Swan, 2007). However, while it initially seemed as if this portion of the
stakeholders was to be negatively affected by the open access development, cost benefits are
emerging, courtesy of the enhanced media coverage, usage metrics, reduced cost per citation,
reduced cost per item used, and enhanced interdisciplinary research (Swan, 2010).
Rationale for the Study
Theses and dissertations are extremely important for global development because they
provide researchers with information about the current state of knowledge of a given discipline.
It is necessary for this information to be accessible and easy to find so as to avoid research
duplication and to reach consistency among different researchers.
The emergence of electronic theses and dissertations has helped scholarly information
to become more readily searchable and able to include added features such as color,
multimedia, supplemental files, and interactive elements. However, it has not resolved the
accessibility problem itself, leaving the issues of copyright and general access to information to
be resolved later with the emergence of the open access concept and the first open access online
repositories.

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

19

As the open access approach to electronic theses and dissertations has become more
common, the world community has acquired an unprecedented source of scholarly information,
conveniently structured and providing all the necessary supplementary data to make the process
of research as fast and efficient as possible. That is why supporting and promoting the open
access concept for electronic theses and dissertations is crucial.
It is still important to investigate issues surrounding the concept of open access
dissertations, such as what services should open access online repositories of electronic theses
and dissertations and how to better resolve copyright issues. These issues will be covered in
this study, the main focus of which is analysis of the factors that influence dissertation authors’
decisions to publish in the open access database PQDT, as well as the level of authors’
awareness of this service. Answering these questions will provide a significant step forward in
supporting a more robust national development.
Problem Statement
In general, dissertations are hard to retrieve even if they are discovered, so dissertation
authors often need to purchase them in order to examine them closely. However, publishing
dissertations in open access is a potential solution to help dissertation authors to achieve wider
distribution of research content with far fewer constraints. Though some dissertation authors
are beginning to embrace and support the open access approach, most of them still do not
utilize this benefit.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this study is to determine the key factors that motivate dissertation
authors’ preferences for publishing dissertations in open access. To complete this main goal,
the study also explores dissertation authors’ awareness of publishing in open access.

Research Questions
This study addresses the following research questions:
•

Are dissertation authors aware of ProQuest open access database?

•

What are the motivating factors that influence dissertation authors’ decisions to publish
their dissertations in ProQuest open access database?

•

Is there a relationship between the awareness of open access publishing and the decision
to publish dissertations in open access?

•

Is there a relationship between the perceived advantages and the decision to publish
dissertations in open access?

Discussion
This study aims to list the factors that influence dissertation authors’ decisions to
publish dissertations in open access. Recent studies have generally examined open access
publishing, scholarly communication, and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs).
However, to date, there have been no studies that have specifically focused on authors’
decisions to publish dissertations in ProQuest open access database (PQDT). The deliverables
of this study may be beneficial to dissertation authors as readers or writers, and they may
positively change the culture of research.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
The issue of open access to electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) is widely
discussed today, and solving the problems that this issue poses is still very important and
actual, in spite of the fact that the concept of open access to ETDs was introduced more than a
decade ago. Academic literature provides a variety of views on this topic and offers in-depth
analysis of many issues connected with the topic of this study. However, in the literature
review, the study focuses mainly on such topics as the historical background and general
characteristics of both traditional and electronic theses and dissertations, the concept and
background of open access, an overview of the ProQuest online depository and its open access
tool PQDT, and the copyright concerns for electronic theses and dissertations. In the literature
review, the study also considers motivational theory including intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.
What differentiates this study from similar studies is the focus on open access dissertations
deposited in ProQuest/UMI’s centralized repository, PQDT.
Traditional Methods of Theses and Dissertations
Academic research is considered a foundation for further investigation in any field, and
it directly or indirectly contributes to the growth and development of individuals and society
(Vijayakumar, 2007, p. 73).
The term dissertation historically came from Germany where the whole academic
system was transformed for the sake of scientific development (Barton, 2005, p. 35). Medieval
students were expected to demonstrate their ability of argumentation and writing canonical
texts through the means of dissertation writing and formal argument accompanying the
dissertation defense process. The works of medieval times demonstrate a collaborative

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

22

approach to knowledge (Bottando, 2012, p. 68). Although the price for the books was very
high, in a legal sense, academic literature was very accessible, even though its owners were
forced to share a copy with the universities whenever needed (Barton, 2005, p. 92). Since that
time, academic literature historically became the primary source of scholarly information all
over the world and later formulated the basis of America’s science and educational systems.
According to Suber (2008), theses and dissertations are still extremely useful for the researches
in all spheres, but especially in humanities in which they continue to be relevant and important
for a much longer period of time (p. 26).
The efficiency and relevance of academic literature was dramatically improved when
printing technology was invented, and knowledge became objectified and divided into discrete
units. Moreover, the concept of authorship emerged, thus starting the new era of relations
between the original author of the text and the readers. Barton (2005) states that at the end of
the 19th century, most of the American universities adopted a requirement that all dissertations
had to be published to ensure proper dissemination of knowledge. However, this requirement
was soon cancelled due to financial reasons and actually became the launch pad of today’s
theses and dissertation access problem (p. 142).
Suber (2008) observes that dissertations have many advantages as a source of
academic information, compared to journal articles because they are much bigger in scale,
cover their topics more comprehensively, are more responsive to past researches, and are
studied, revised, and refined more carefully (p. 26). However, there are some accessibility
problems associated with the use of academic dissertations as they are usually not well indexed
in academic libraries, are difficult to evaluate before purchase, and the topics covered are
usually too narrow to publish a full-value book (Suber, 2008, p. 26).

Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs)
The electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) concept was originally developed to
increase the accessibility to academic literature, and it started to gain momentum worldwide as
researchers, libraries, and students started to realize the scientific necessity of this issue (Suber,
2008, p. 28). ETD represents the practice of making digital versions of theses and dissertations
available online, and data from these repositories suggest a dramatic increase in the use and
citation of doctoral theses in current research activity and, thus, are related to the enhanced
resource discovery (Jones & Andrew, 2005).
The history of ETD began in 1987 with a meeting arranged by UMI and attended by
representatives of Virginia Tech, University of Michigan, SoftQuad, and Arbor Text. Discussed
were the latest approaches to electronic publishing, and they formulated an idea of applying
single standards to the preparation of dissertations (Fineman, 2003, p. 219). In 1996, the
networked digital library of theses and dissertations (NDLTD) was established to promote the
adoption, creation, use, dissemination, and preservation of e-theses (Barton, 2005, p. 59). Also
in 1996, the U.S. Department of Education funded a three-year, nationwide effort to extend the
concept of ETD across the country (Fineman, 2003, p. 220). Access to the information on the
NDLTD union catalogue varies between open, restricted, fee-based, and mixed access.
Decisions regarding the accessibility of ETDs are made by the authors who may or may not
want their work being published on the Web. Unfortunately, this has led to fewer than half of
the items in the NDLTD catalogue being freely accessible (Barton, 2005, p. 57).
Although the benefits of ETD are very important for global scientific and academic
development, the pace of this concept’s implementation is still rather slow in the United States.

The Concept of Open Access: Background and Overview
The initiative of ETDs cannot be fully understood without explaining the original
concept of Open Access because creating databases and catalogues with electronic versions of
theses and dissertations is only one side of the initiative. Since the time ETDs emerged, the
global academic community has argued about whether to make access to this information free
or to continue preserving paid authorship. Dull (2011) points out that open access is a means
through which scholarly content is shared freely on the Internet, thus presenting wider and
unlimited access to scholarly literature and enhancing scholarly communication and selfarchiving (p. 18).
The term open access (OA) was first coined in the Budapest Open Access Initiative
(BOAI) at a meeting sponsored by the Open Society Institute (OSI) in 2001, although the idea
of providing free online access started much earlier than this adoption (Khalili, 2011, p. 238).
The networked online medium made it possible for such a concept to appear because the Web
empowers the authors of digital works to give them away free for all to use, and it is a very
simple procedure for the authors to make their papers available through their institutional
repository or publishing them in open access journals and other publications (Khalili, 2011).
The results of the studies show that authors with a significant number of publications find open
access attractive due to low publication costs; however, those scholars who have few
publications are still hesitant to use the concept (Ellingford, 2012).
Suber (2008) argues that there are strong reasons for scholars all over the world to
protect the idea of open access for ETDs (p. 32). Currently, most theses and dissertations are
already born digital, and the authors of dissertations do not lose revenue. These are royalty-free
works of research literature. ETDs are not formally published, and they exclude publisher fears

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

25

of lost revenue. Open access among other things, makes dissertations much more accessible
and a valuable source of information for further research.
In spite of all the benefits of the open access concept, its global implementation still
meets a number of constraints. This approach needs a revision of the current examination
processes in universities, and it generates perceived threats of plagiarism and bogus
submissions. Although students are not paid for their dissertations, they often hope to include
this work as a part of their future printed book, and they see a commercial threat in open access
since authors often care a great deal about intellectual property issues (Suber, 2008, p. 31).
Another side of the problem is that many researchers and librarians are not familiar with, nor
have assimilated, the new culture in their scholarly workings; nor do they know the advantages
to be derived from them (Khalili, 2011). Ellingford (2012) offers one potentially negative side
of such an approach: Although searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks
quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion, this may accelerate consensus and
narrow the range of findings and ideas built (p. 25).
ProQuest and PQDT Open
Developing of the Open Access concept inspired different entrepreneurs all over the
world to create massive electronic collections of digital information organized into interactive
on-line catalogues of ETDs. One such global catalogue is ProQuest, an information and
technology company which is part of the Cambridge Information Group (ProQuest, n.d.).
ProQuest is a resource of electronic collections containing millions of documents
originally published in magazines, newspapers, and journals. The company offers its products
and services mainly to academic, school, public, corporate, and government libraries around the
world (ProQuest, n.d.).

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

26

These collections can be searched for documents on certain subjects using either key
words or names of articles and magazines. ProQuest offers powerful search methods that are
divided into three groups: basic searches, advanced searches, and publication searches.
Most database subscriptions are purchased by public or academic libraries that, in turn,
provide access by individuals. It is said that virtually every major research library in the world
provides access to the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT) database through one format
or another (McCutcheon, 2010).
Although most of the services are not free of charge and are aimed at group
subscriptions, there are free services available for individuals. For example, PQDT Open
provides open access dissertations and theses free of charge as the authors of these dissertations
and theses gave their consent to make their works available for free on the Web (Clement,
2012, p. 16). Without a need to register on the Website, each visitor can quickly search and
locate dissertations and theses relevant to his/her request and view, or even download, the
complete text in PDF format. However, most of the works are still copyrighted, and that
prevents scholarly re-uses of an open access work (Clement, 2012, p. 78).
Over the last decade and a half most of the graduate students have chosen to publish
their graduate works via free Internet access many of them have used the PQDT Open database
and have willingly paid an author’s publishing fee of $95 to provide this form of open access
for their users. Moreover, some of them have also chosen to remove permission barriers, thus
providing for liberal reuse of their graduate scholarship by users around the world (Clement,
2012).
The ProQuest Open Access Publishing PLUS option is a service provided for graduate
students to increase the reach of their research by publishing their ETDs on an open access

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

27

basis (PQ/UMI, 2009). The service provides the widest possible exposure of graduate research
and helps to ensure that the officially published version of the dissertation or thesis is the most
widely available version in the primary literature. The service also provides free public access
to the uploaded ETDs on PQDT Open and free access to the citation, abstract, and full text for
the institutional subscribers to ProQuest dissertations and theses (ProQuest, n.d.).
ProQuest’s publishing agreement provides each submitter with a choice either to use
Open Access Publishing PLUS or traditional publishing. As the company’s website promises,
all services and processes covered by traditional publishing efforts will apply to Open Access
Publishing PLUS from ProQuest. It means that the information will be indexed, microfilmed,
preserved, and archived properly. However, using the Open Access Publishing PLUS option,
the submitter makes his/her dissertation and thesis available at no charge for viewing or
downloading by anyone with access to the Internet (PQ/UMI, 2009). The traditional publishing
model is based on “copy sales and royalty payments” relations in which the owner of the
intellectual property and author of the work contracts with the publisher to reproduce,
distribute, and sell copies of the work. Choosing a traditional publishing method, the author
makes the first 24 pages of his/her work free, while the balance of the dissertations and theses
are for a fee (McCutcheon, 2010, p. 16). It is up to a submitter to choose, based on his/her
values system and professional goals, which way to go while publishing the ETD.
The Method of Publishing Theses and Dissertations in ProQuest/UMI
Although the company tries to make it as easy as possible to have one’s ETD submitted
and published, there are still many aspects that must be taken into consideration by submitters.
There are three possible ways to have one’s ETDs submitted on ProQuest: as a paper copy that
will be scanned, as a PDF file through the online submission tool, or through an FTP site

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

28

(ProQuest, n.d.). Online submission is a preferred choice because it ensures that the copy of
manuscript is received in the highest quality with color images preserved. Submitters can also
include supplementary digital materials with their dissertations or theses. Other important
aspects include avoiding copyright infringements, preserving one’s own copyright, and
choosing between traditional publishing and open access publishing (McCutcheon, 2010, p.
79).
Funding in Open Access
MacGregor, Stranack, & Willinsky (2014) argue that over the last two decades, the
digital transformation experienced in scholarly communication prompted the development of
publishing strategies, tools, and models as the internet rose to be the main method of
knowledge dissemination (p. 165). A major concern in the open access publishing model has
been about funding. In this model of publishing, it is the author who bears the burden of
publishing when seeking to make his or her publication available for open access. This differs
from the traditional model in which the consumers, who are the readers, pay for the publishing.
An area of publishing related to open access and of interest is the funding model adopted by the
ETDs sites and open access journals. University ETD sites do not charge authors. On the other
hand, ProQuest and many open access journals do charge, which poses barriers to the
objectives of open access.
There are various grounds upon which authors are forced to bear the burden of
publishing. For instance, in a subscription-based world where websites require fees for one to
gain access, there exist barriers to gaining knowledge for readers as they lack the time to seek
articles that are not accessible in their libraries. This means websites would have to rely on the
funding from the authors to guarantee they are able to operate (Swan, 2012). It is crucial to

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

29

consider that expenses are incurred in developing the open access software; open access is not
free: there is a party that has to pay for it. In particular, considerable expense is spent on
designing a user-friendly system, which means ProQuest and other journal article sites have a
genuine reason in charging authors prior to taking their articles or dissertations (Willinsky,
2005). However, the charges have tended to be affordable for authors considering the
significant savings in open access, courtesy of the avoided costs in real estate and the removal
of expenses that would have been used in the maintenance of an editorial office. Furthermore,
the always-open virtual office in open access and the fact that a complete set of records,
materials, and dissertations can be accessed from any computer that is connected to the Internet
play a role in minimizing the cost to a level at which the authors can bear the burden of paying
(Willinsky, 2005).
There are various issues that facilitate open access and having customers pay no
subscription fees (Swan, 2012). It is expected that the charges authors have to pay are not
considerable, as digital space is no longer a significant consideration because the storage costs
have fallen to a level that any addition of text-based titles has little, if any, noticeable financial
impact. This makes it feasible to provide dissertations and articles at no charge and to seek
other benefits that result from access to the articles and dissertations, rather than the payment
from the readers (Swan, 2010). This model differs from the traditional model which was
designed in a manner to recoup the publishing costs that prohibited an author from using the
system because of the high costs the author would be paying (Swan, 2010, p. 30).
Although the ideas advanced by the open movements are widely agreed upon, the full
adaptation of the open access principles would not be realized with websites charging the
authors, as many authors would then not subscribe to the websites (Dulle, Minishi-Majanja &

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

30

Cloete, 2011, p. 129). Swan (2012) considers the incentive for commercial publishers to retain
the traditional subscription-based model to be the main source of this barrier (p. 30).
However, it is also crucial to appreciate the existence of funding sources for ETD
publishing, and it is only a handful of the ETDs that support themselves with the author-side
charges since most rely on sponsorship (Willinsky, 2005). Otherwise, universities’ ETD sites,
without charging the authors, bring a new perspective which can be linked to their being funded
by the institutions, unlike commercial bodies such as ProQuest, and thus demonstrating the full
benefits of open access (Moxley, 2004). Nevertheless, Willinsky (2005) observes that it would
be most beneficial to scholarship in open access when authors pay for their work to be
published, as this would facilitate sustainability (p. 505). Having the element of author
subscription fees facilitates continuity in open access, as it is able to raise corporate
concentration within publishing. Unlike the case of the ETDs that are supported by institutions,
ProQuest and other open access journals would need to have a commercial model to guarantee
extensions and improvements to the circulation of scholarly work.
Copyright Concerns for ETDs
Theses and dissertations, put into electronic form, possess the same copyright properties
as the traditional printed ones. However, as ETDs are usually considered in terms of open
access to them, they are expected to be online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and
licensing restrictions (McCutcheon, 2010).
In reality, authors still permit different levels of access to their theses and dissertations,
as they are in the position to make decisions whether to submit their work to open access
journals, deposit them into open access archives, or transfer copyrights to publishers (Khalili,
2011). Open access, by its nature, is compatible with copyright. Most electronic theses and

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

31

dissertations are published under all-rights-reserved copyrights and do not allow usage beyond
a fair-use concept. If fair use is not enough to authorize open access for full-text works under
copyright, it is necessary to get permission from the copyright holder. The legal basis of open
access is the consent of the copyright holder (for newer literature) or the expiration of the
copyright (for older literature) (Suber, 2011).
Practice shows that most authors choose to retain the right to block the distribution of
misattributed copies (Swan, 2012). Some choose to block commercial re-use of their works,
and some compose their own licenses, or permission statements, and attach them to their works
(McCutcheon, 2010). Basically, most of these attempts are aimed at blocking plagiarism,
misrepresentation, and sometimes commercial re-use, and authorize all the uses required by
legitimate scholarship. Therefore, the main role for a copyright in ETDs is to give authors
control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited
(Suber, 2011).
ProQuest provides all submitters with a comprehensive guide that helps to avoid
copyright infringement in one’s dissertation or thesis and to protect one’s own copyright. In
fact, in many cases, the company requires submitters to provide permission letters for use of
previously copyrighted material (ProQuest, n.d.).
Awareness of Open Access Publishing
Open access awareness is the knowledge of free availability of scholarly materials on
the public Internet. It entails the recognition that public viewers are allowed to read, copy,
download, distribute, and use these scholarly materials for any lawful practices without any
barriers hindering their access to these materials (Swan, 2012). Lynch (2006) observes that
open access entails “an increased elimination of barriers to the use of the scholarly literature by

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

32

anyone interested in making such use” (p. 5). Knowing or recognizing these facts is what
entails open access awareness.
In the past, different studies have been carried out with the intention of establishing the
awareness and use of open access publishing through online repositories. (Dulle, MinishiMajanja & Cloete, 2011) argues that most researchers have not fully embraced the idea of using
open access journals because they are not aware of the availability of open access publishing
and the benefits it provides to its users (p. 118). According to MacGregor, Stranack, &
Willinsky (2014), some of the benefits of using open access publishing include increased
exposure of information to the target audience, easier information discovery by the audience,
and persistent access of information among others (p. 172).
According to Khalili (2011), numerous authors and researchers are still reluctant to use
open access publishing. One of the main explanations for this trend is that authors and
researchers are not aware of the existence of open access publishing and the advantages it
provides to the users (p. 346). A different study, cited by Korobili, Tilkidu, & Delistavrou
(2005), shows that awareness plays an important role in determining the authors’ use of open
access publishing. This study used respondents who were aware of the existence of open access
publishing and its benefits to the users. The results established that 68.8% of the respondents
preferred using open access publishing as opposed to 31.2% of the respondents who preferred
using printed publications (p. 92). To this end, Korobili, Tilkidu, & Delistavrou (2005)
concluded that awareness plays an important role in determining an authors’ use of open access
publishing (p. 109).
This argument is further supported by Okoye and Ejikeme (2010) who conducted a
study on open access awareness and established that the use of open access resources is still

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

33

relatively low among authors only 13.33% have published articles on open access journals (p.
7). One of the main factors explaining the low utility of open access resources in this study
included a negative attitude of researchers towards open access resources.
Nonetheless, Khalili (2011) observes that there has been a gradual increase in the usage
of open access resources over the years. This argument is attributed to increased awareness
campaigns by open access advocates and practitioners giving scholars and researchers an
opportunity to learn about the advantages of utilizing open access resources.
In publishing, perceived awareness is the extent to which an author believes that he/she
would be aware of a certain publication. This kind of awareness incorporates previous
experiences obtained from reading a publication, visiting a website where a publication is
available, and so forth (Hernandez-Borges et al., 2006). When an individual experiences an
innovation, he/she becomes aware of the innovation’s existence and is more likely to adopt it
for future use (Rogers, 2003). In the same vein, Evans (2012) states that the reading and citing
stages precede the publishing stage. In this case, reading and citing processes enhance the
author’s awareness of open access publishing, hence increasing the probability of the author’s
using open access for future publications (p. 19). Reading and citing enables an author to
eliminate any fears of the unknown in open access, thus further promoting the possibility of
using open access publishing sources. According to Poltronieri et al. (2013), open access
publishing is innovative, however, the uncertainties surrounding the open access concept
become a huge challenge when authors are considering whether to use open access publishing
(p. 3). On this note, Dulle, Minishi-Majanja & Cloete, (2011) stress that the more widely the
open access concept is understood, the more likely it is that authors would adopt it when
publishing their articles. This argument is supported by Bjork (2004) who states that general

34

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

awareness of open access publishing plays an important role in promoting the increased use of
open access publishing among scholars (p. 340).
Foster and Gibbons (2005) conducted a study in an institution to establish why faculty
had not disseminated its publications into open institutional repositories. The findings support
the views of Abrizah (2009). They established that, among other reasons, the main reason why
faculty had not disseminated their publications into open institutional repositories was that the
faculty did not have sufficient information on the open institutional repository concept.
Particularly, the study established that the faculty did not have information on the functionality
and the career benefits of open institutional repositories. It further noted that the use of open
institutional repositories by the faculty increased with more awareness of the advantages of
using open institutional repositories among the faculty. To this end, Foster and Gibbons (2005)
concluded that awareness of open access publishing increases the likelihood of authors
publishing in open access.
Motivational Theory
In current research, the motivational theory is used to model the motivation of

Motivation is the result of an interaction between human needs and incentives. A person
feels motivated when available incentives lead to the satisfaction of his motives or needs.
Dualistic theories separate motivation into two types: intrinsic and extrinsic (Reiss, 2012).
Also, motivation theorists, Lepper, Greene, & Nisbett, 1973; Deci, 1975; Lepper & Greene,
1978; Deci & Ryan, 1985, differentiate intrinsic from extrinsic motivations. Intrinsic and
extrinsic motivations fall under the cognitive evaluation theory, self-determination theory, and
general interest theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Gagné & Deci 2005; Eisenberger, Pierce, &
Cameron 1999).
Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations have been a major study throughout the work
environment. There has been a study of organizational commitment, but not much emphasis
has been put on this study (Tribolet, 2004). Another study had been designed to identify and
evaluate the combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations on a sample of middle-school
students (Hayenga & Corpus, 2010). Moreover, Lei (2010) describes the process of learning
new knowledge and skills among college students as being based on intrinsic and extrinsic
motivations (p. 153). Also, Fagan, Wooldridge, & Neill (2008) use the Integrated Model of
Technology Acceptance (IMTA) to study the reasons first-line managers in a mid-sized
manufacturing organization use computers (p. 31). The study found a positive relationship
between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation, a positive relationship between extrinsic
motivation and behavioral intention to use computers, a positive relationship between perceived
ease of use and extrinsic motivation, and a positive relationship between intrinsic motivation
and perceived ease of use (p. 35). There were several studies concluded on the relationship
between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, more specifically in the international business
environment (Areepattamannil, Freeman, & Klinger, 2011). Intrinsic motivation is commonly

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

36

described as practicing something for its “own sake” (Reiss, 2012, p. 152). Extrinsic
motivation, on the other hand, refers to the implementation of an “instrumental goal” (Reiss,
2012, p. 152). Extrinsic incentives destabilize intrinsic interest. Research shows that managers
have a tendency of misjudging the work motivation of employees. Some people have an
extrinsic incentive bias since they believe that others are more motivated than they are by
situational or extrinsic motivations. Likewise, others are believed to be more motivated than
others by situations that are dispositional or intrinsic (Mitchell, 2012).
Considering the literature review, most of the studies on scholarly communication and
Electronic Theses and Dissertations, ETDs, including publishing in open access, apply the
diffusion of innovation theory as a theoretical frame. The diffusion of innovation theory was
developed in 1962 by E. M. Rogers with the aim of explaining how, over time, an innovation
spreads throughout a specific population or a specific group of individuals. This diffusion
results in the adoption of the said innovation to be part of the specified population (Rogers,
2003). Park (2009) determines the intention of open access publishing by three categories:
attitude towards open access publishing, social influence on open access publishing, and
perceived control for open access publishing (p. 345). He incorporates the theory of planned
behavior and the diffusion of innovation theory in his study to identify factors affecting
scientists’ adoptions of open access journals. Another study concludes with ten factors
affecting scientists’ adoptions of open access (Park, 2007). These factors are: perceived career
benefit, perceived authoritative advantage, perceived knowledge, social influence, perceived
technological advantage, behavioral experience, perceived visible advantage, perceived topical
compatibility, ease of publishing, and controllability. However, the conceptual model is
tailored for this study. The framework assumes that a dissertation author’s preference to publish

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

37

his/her dissertation in open access is determined by two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic
rewards. Therefore, the study considers perceived knowledge, perceived career benefits,
perceived authoritative advantages, and perceived visible advantages as intrinsic motivations.
However, the study determines perceived technological advantages, perceived topical
compatibility, social influence, and controllability as external motivations. Furthermore, this
study did not consider behavioral experience and ease of publishing.
Intrinsic Motivation.
Intrinsic motivation is an effective antecedent to predict intrinsic job satisfaction.
Several studies suggest that an employee is either dissatisfied or satisfied with his or her job. If
there is no motivation to work, employees will not perform better to meet the set goals and
objectives (Wong-On-Wing, Lan, & Lui, 2010). Deciding on the most efficient strategy that
would increase overall job satisfaction, for instance, pay-for-performance, it is important for
employers to increase intrinsic motivation since job satisfaction positively relates to job
performance (Covington & Müeller, 2001). Job performance, within this context, is defined in
terms of employee output. Possible measures of job performance include effort, efficiency, and
outcomes. Furthermore, dissatisfaction from intrinsic sources often results in employee
turnover. Employees with strong intrinsic motivations are more likely to be satisfied with jobs
that pay well. Interestingly, intrinsic job satisfactions are positive. Thus, in order to develop an
academic career, achieve an author’s long-term goals, and be recognized by the academic
community (Park, 2007), scholars should consider publishing dissertations in open access
repositories. According to Bjork (2004), open access is currently being regarded as an
innovation that is expected to enhance positive changes to the way scholars access, process, and
share knowledge (p. 15). Furthermore, the factors influencing authors’ preferences of

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

38

publishing sources in open access are based on the intrinsic motivation provided by open access
to the authors.
This study considers the following factors as intrinsic motivations: perceived career
benefits, perceived knowledge, perceived authoritative advantages, and perceived visible
advantages. Behavior usually is motivated. Career benefit positively influences the decision of
publishing dissertations in open access. In this study, career benefit is considered as one of the
intrinsic factors of publishing dissertations in open access. According to Park (2007), perceived
career benefit is the extent to which an author believes that publishing in open access would be
advantageous in terms of career development (p. 58). Academic publications do more than just
communicate; they are connections to the academic reward system. However, perceived career
benefit is valued differently by authors depending on their academic positions. Open access
publishing sources are widely accessible and are said to have a positive effect on career benefit
(Harnad & Brody, 2004). As such, Park (2009) points out that authors would be influenced to
use open access publishing sources if they perceive them to have career benefits (p. 348).
On the same note, perceived knowledge also influences authors’ choices of publishing
sources in open access. Perceived knowledge is the extent to which an author believes that he
or she would know an open access publication from experience including accessing a journal
website and citing or reading publications, among others. In this case, prior knowledge of open
access publishing plays an important role in influencing authors to publish in open access. This
is in line with the view that potential adopters who have prior knowledge of an innovation will
be more comfortable with the innovation and are more likely to adopt it (Rogers, 2003).
Perceived authoritative advantages influence authors’ choices of publishing sources in
open access (Park, 2009, p. 347). The perceived authoritative advantage, in terms of intrinsic

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

39

motivation, may be attributed to the fact that it results in discipline among people. Therefore,
publishing dissertations in open access makes authors trustworthy, reliable, reputable, and wellknown. According to Rogers (2003), authority promotes rapid diffusion of an innovation or
“the degree of relative advantage is often expressed as economic profitability, as conveying
social prestige or in other ways” (p. 229). In this case, the perceived authoritative advantage is
the extent to which an author believes that publishing in an open access source would provide
authority. Studies illustrate the existing relationship between perceived authority and open
access source selection. In open access journals, for instance, Kling & Callahan (2003) point
out that the use of certain terms, such as peer-reviewed, promotes a positive journal reputation.
Perceived journal reputation is conceptualized as perceived authority and plays a huge role in
influencing authors’ preferences of publishing sources in open access.
Perceived visible advantage also influences authors’ preferences of publishing sources
in open access. The perceived visible advantage, in terms of intrinsic motivation, regards the
fact that intrinsic motivation provides the conditions that promote change by enhancing
intrinsic willingness, perceived ability, and readiness to change (Creaser, et al., 2010). Park &
Qin (2007) believe that every person is capable of change and can choose to change when the
willingness and ability, as components of motivation, come together (p. 76). The responsibility
for change is necessarily left with the authors. In addition, perceived visible advantage is the
extent to which an author believes that using open access publishing would promote the
visibility of a publication (Harnad & Brody, 2004). Antelman (2004) established that open
access journals are cited more frequently than printed journals, hence concluding that open
access provides wider dissemination of information. In this case, the fact that open access

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

40

publishing provides wider dissemination of information increases the probability of authors
preferring the publishing sources available in open access (p. 374).
It became apparent that scientists who responded were more likely to recognize the
value of open availability advertising in its capacity to spread knowledge on a more extensive
scale. This gives the sense that scientist respondents may have more intrinsic motivations than
extrinsic motivations, as they already have achieved knowledge. Among scientist respondents
only, the easier it was to get a paper published in open access publishing, the less likely
respondents were to publish in such journals. These respondents regarded a journal as being of
lower quality if it had a higher acceptance rate (Creaser, et al., 2010).
Extrinsic Motivation.
Extrinsic motivation refers to performing tasks because of something that results from
it. There are four types of extrinsic motivation that can be linked to the knowledge process.
These are: domination of motivation through social identification, desire for knowledge,
craving to achieve success in learning activity, and motivation extraneous to study. The
positive influence of behavioral experience is consistent with diffusion theory which holds that
previous experience with an innovation will result in greater comfort with, and positive
perception of, that activity to the extent that the innovation is likely to be borrowed (Park,
2007). Extrinsic motivation is an important factor for the successful implementation of a
knowledge-sharing culture. An individual can use knowledge from his fellow colleagues if it is
provided to him/her in time (LaPlante, 2010).
This study considers the following factors as external motivations: perceived
technological advantage, perceived topical compatibility, social influence, and controllability.
Open access publishing sources have been associated with numerous advantages when

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

41

compared to printed publications. Such advantages have been identified to play a significant
role in increasing the likelihood of authors publishing in open access. Open access publishing
has also been identified with technological advantages. According to Robinson (2012),
technology increases the integration and flexibility of data processing, hence providing
increased efficiency in the publishing process. These advantages are experienced in open access
publishing (p. 9). Park (2007) alleges that authors perceive the benefits of technology, as used
in open access publishing, as making them distinguished from paper-printed publications (p.
183). In this view, Poltronieri et al. (2013) point out that awareness of technological advantages
of open access publishing by authors increases the possibility of authors using open access
publishing to publish their articles (p. 3).
According to Park (2007), perceived technological advantage is the extent to which an
author believes that using open access publishing would promote publishing performance (p.
57). Dulle, Minishi-Majanja & Cloete, (2011) further opine that using open access publishing
promotes better management of manuscripts, in addition to promoting direct feedback from the
audience (p. 120). These advantages are made possible by different information technologies,
such as feedback bulletin boards, that influence authors’ preferences of publishing sources in
open access.
Perceived topical compatibility is the other factor that influences authors’ preferences of
publishing in open access. Perceived topical compatibility is the extent to which authors believe
that the topic of an open access publication would suit their existing academic interests (Park,
2009). Rogers (2003) further notes that compatibility is “the degree to which an innovation is
perceived as consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential
adopters” (p. 240). In this case, there is a higher probability that individuals would adopt an

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

42

innovation that they are more familiar with at the expense of an innovation that they are less
familiar with.
In the process of selecting a publishing source, publication audience is one of the
factors that authors put into consideration, and it is directly related to topical compatibility
(Park, 2009). Meadows (1998) notes that “one survey of academic researchers found out that
70% regarded the prestige of the journal as important, and 67% thought its readership is highly
important” (p. 164). As such, Meadows (1998) concludes that publication readership is directly
related to perceived topical compatibility, and it influences authors’ preferences for publishing
sources in open access.
Social influence also plays a significant role in persuading authors to publish their
materials in open access. Influence from interpersonal relationships and evaluation of the
products of other people influence individuals towards adopting an innovation (Park, 2007).
Interpersonal influence and publication influence are the main social influences that persuade
authors to adopt open access publishing. Interpersonal influence is the extent to which an
author perceives that his/her peers think that he/she should or should not publish in open
access. On the other hand, publication influence is the extent to which an author evaluates open
access publications of other scholars who are close and important to him/her (Park, 2009).
Controllability can be described as the degree to which an author becomes aware of his
or her organization’s control over publishing in open access. Park (2007) suggests that as
supporting resources become more easily and readily available, open access publishing turns
out to be more effective.
Park (2007) contends that controllability is the extent to which an author recognizes the
external control of publishing in open access (p. 61). This perception influences authors’

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

43

preferences of publishing sources in open access. Kling & Callahan (2003) further purport that
open access publishing will become more effective in the future with increased development of
a support infrastructure. Some publishing sources in open access charge publication fees which
are paid from the author’s personal budget if they are not waived by grants or other support
institutions. In open access, resources and infrastructure refer to publishing policies and
publication regulations and play a huge role in influencing authors’ preferences of publishing
sources in open access. According to Antelman (2004), these resources and infrastructure are,
more or less likely, the external facilitating conditions (p. 378).
Also, the structure of interpretational relevance is determined by the principle of
compatibility. Compatibility issues are linking the current theme along with the interpretational
structure in the stock of knowledge. Extrinsic motivation, within this regard, necessitates some
separate consequences such as touchable or spoken rewards, so pleasure comes not from the
action itself but, instead, from the extrinsic consequences (Hung, Durcikova, Lai, & Lin, 2011).
Summary
Dissertations and theses have traditionally been considered a primary source of
scholarly information in the USA and in the rest of the world. Emergence of electronic theses
and dissertations has greatly influenced the efficiency of this source. However, its use is still
limited due to the restrictions posed by copyright concerns. Online repositories that provide
open access to the scholarly information serve as a key to solving this problem. At the same
time, the notion of open access, as well as its primary features, still is not clearly defined, and a
significant number of authors like Peter Suber continue to study this issue. The current state of
knowledge on this topic allows for further research.

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

44

One of the most advanced online repositories of ETDs is ProQuest. This service
provides both the option of traditional publishing online, when only the first 24 pages of the
dissertation are free to peruse, and there is an open access option for some additional fee. The
main focus of this research is electronic dissertations deposited in ProQuest’s centralized
repository as a topic that needs more scientific research and rationale. If authors are aware of
the process and development of open access and believe they have something of value that they
want others to read, they will likely be motivated to publish in open access. The study includes
factors that influence dissertation authors to make use of open access. This study also uses
motivated theory because of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.

CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
Considering publishing in open access and understanding the factors that encourage

dissertation authors to publish in open access PQDT, and based upon the literature review, the
researcher developed a methodology. The researcher derived the format of the methodology by
using factors that were found in the literature (Park, 2007). Since part of the research agenda
was to list the factors that influenced dissertation authors’ preferences of publishing
dissertations in open access, the methodology approach included the following:

Creswell (2003) emphasizes that the quantitative approach is best when the problem is
identifying factors that influence an outcome. This study is explanatory and designed to learn
about factors influencing dissertation authors’ preferences of publishing in open access by
focusing on doctoral students and alumni. The information collected from the literature review,
in addition to the findings that are derived from the results of the survey, will help in answering
the research questions. Table 3.1 illustrates the linkage between the literature review and the
research questions. The research questions are as follows:

Therefore, an explanatory study using primarily quantitative data was the best match for
the purpose of this study. The quantitative data was used for analysis to arrive at reasonable
conclusions. The chosen quantitative methodology was designed to address the link in research
between the dissertation authors and their motivations toward publishing dissertations in open
access. Additional data questions included: participant demographics, open access preference, a
Likert Scale measurement of value, and an open-ended question to identify participants’ current
attitudes toward publishing dissertations in open access.
To gather data and answer the research questions, the quantitative data needed to be
collected using a web-based platform. The survey instrument as the method of data collection
provided a numeric description of awareness, trends, and attitudes of the sample (Creswell,
2003). Babbie (2004) argues “surveys are particularly useful in decrypting the characteristics of
a large population” which “is very important for both descriptive and explanatory analyses,
especially wherever several variables are to be analyzed simultaneously” (p. 274). The
methodology also indicated the type of data that would be collected, and it allowed for a plan to
analyze the data. This analysis plan is summarized in Table 3.2.

Data Analysis Plan

Procedures

Purpose

Descriptive and frequency statistics are
going to be run on all quantitative data.

Examine data for errors, outliers, and possible
relationships.

Cronbach’s Alpha tests are going to be
performed on all variables, the
awareness variables, advantages, and
the motivation factors.

The Cronbach’s Alpha is used to show if the
relationship between the variables is
significant.

Pearson Correlation tests between the
sum of awareness variables and the sum
of preference variables, and between the
sum of perceived advantages variables
and the sum of the preference variables
will be used.

Pearson Correlation is used to show the linear
relationship between two variables.

A Factor Analysis test among the eight
factors will be given.

Factor Analysis is used to determine factors
that explain the pattern of correlations within
a set of variables.

Analysis of findings to answer research
questions and to link the research
questions to the literature will be
conducted.

The analysis will add to the body of
knowledge in the area of publishing
dissertations in open access.

Participants
Doctoral alumni from 2003 to 2013 and doctoral students within one year of degree
completion were chosen as the research participants in this study. The reason for choosing the
graduated and near-completion doctoral students is to determine the dissertation authors’
awareness of open access, their motivations towards publishing dissertations in open access,
and the factors that influence their preferences toward likelihood or usage of publishing
dissertations in open access. The survey was administered to doctoral alumni – some who work

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

as assistant professors at one of three universities in the Pittsburgh area: Robert Morris
University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pittsburgh.
Robert Morris University was founded in 1921 as the Pittsburgh School of Accountancy
and is located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The university offers more than 60 undergraduate
and more than 20 graduate degree programs. As of 2013, the university had an enrollment of
approximately 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students. According to Tang (2011), students
chose to attend RMU because of its small size where the students could acquire personal
attention with a 15:1 student-to-faculty ratio (p. 24).
Carnegie Mellon University was founded in 1900 as the Carnegie Technical Schools to
serve workers and young men and women of the Pittsburgh area. The university has seven
colleges and schools which offer Master's and Doctoral degrees. Currently, the university offers
approximately 90 programs and majors within its six undergraduate schools, colleges, and
inter-college degree programs. The university offers a variety of options from biomedical
engineering to music theatre, and social and decision sciences to robotics, and more. Students
choose to attend Carnegie Mellon University because it is consistently top-ranked (Carnegie
Mellon University, n.d.).
The University of Pittsburgh was founded as the Pittsburgh Academy in 1787. The
university offers more than 100 undergraduate-level degree programs in 10 schools and
colleges. In addition, it offers 14 graduate and professional schools providing a choice of over
200 degree programs. Students choose to attend the University of Pittsburgh because it is one
of the oldest and most distinguished comprehensive universities (The University of Pittsburgh,
n.d.).

This research has no set minimum number of participants. The survey remained
available from July to September until a reasonable amount of participation was gained.
Survey Instrument
The researcher did not conduct a foundation study to gather preliminary data and to
ensure the validity and reliability of the survey questions because the study used and modified
an existing survey. The validity and reliability aspects of the instrument were tested in the
original study (Park, 2007). The validity and reliability of the study were high due to the large
number of responses: 1,104 (Park, 2007). A five-point Likert Scale, a six-point Likert Scale,
and a seven-point Likert Scale were used in the original study.
This study utilized a web-based survey to gain as many responses as the researcher
could acquire. The researcher used QuestionPro, an electronic survey, with the link distributed
to potential participants through emails. The survey instrument was completed by the end of
February 2013. The survey contained a welcome page that presented participants with the
statement of agreement, information in the research background, and the researcher’s contact
information. Participants first read through the statement of consent, and then they clicked the
“Next” icon to begin the survey. The study was modified from an existing survey using Likert–
type Scales from a doctoral dissertation developed by Ji-Hong Park. Some of the categories
were kept, but some of the questions were either omitted or changed. The questionnaire was
used to attempt to assess which factors influenced dissertation authors’ decisions to publish in
open access. The factors presented in this study were perceived career benefits, perceived
authoritative advantages, perceived knowledge, social influences, perceived technological
advantages, perceived visible advantages, perceived topical compatibility, and controllability
(Park, 2007).

Survey Pilot Test and Validation
The next task after designing the questionnaire was to validate data through content
validation and the pilot test.
Pilot Test.
The researcher conducted a pilot test using the survey with a convenience sample of 17
doctoral students. The participants who majored in Communications and Information Systems
were near-completion doctoral students at Robert Morris University. Most of the participants
expressed concern about the length of the survey. Based on the feedback from the 17
responders, the researcher redesigned the questionnaire by combining some of the factors and
removing others that had similar meanings. One of the major changes was related to the
factors’ questions. The questions focused on how participants agreed or disagreed with some
statements, so the researcher changed the questions to rate the importance given to each factor.
Content Validation.
To ensure that the questionnaire contained appropriate and clear content, the researcher
asked a convenience sample of doctoral students at Robert Morris University to walk through
the survey. The twelve participants in Communications and Information Systems were secondyear doctoral students at Robert Morris University. Suggested changes from the content
validation included the need to operationally define “open access” and the need to add an “I
don’t know” option.
In addition, the researcher asked Dr. Gary A. Davis, one of the experts and an associate
professor of Computer and Information Systems at Robert Morris University, to complete the
web-based survey to test the survey’s length and content. He suggested two important
revisions:

Final Survey Instrument
The survey questionnaire was divided into four sections of applicable questions as
follows:
1. Awareness of publishing in ProQuest open access database (PQDT)
2. Motivation factors for publishing in ProQuest open access database (PQDT)
3. Preference of publishing in ProQuest open access database (PQDT)
4. Other data gathering (including demographics)
A complete copy of the survey can be found in Appendix E.
Awareness of Publishing in ProQuest Open Access Database (PQDT).
The first part of the survey focused on awareness of publishing dissertations in an open
access. This included asking whether or not the respondents were aware of open access and
whether or not they submitted dissertations in open access. Also, it asked the type of services
they had used. Participants were asked to indicate the type of services they have used if they
published in open access repository PQDT. Also, the participants were asked if they had read
dissertations on-line and if they have used ProQuest PQDT. A Likert 6-point scale was used
with responses from “never” to “more than 1 time per week” for other questions to indicate
how often the participant reads, cites, and discusses dissertations published in open access.
Another Likert 6-point scale was used for other questions, with responses from “completely
unfamiliar” to “do not know” to determine if the participant is familiar with the publication-fee
issue and the copyright rule of open access PQDT. This part of the survey sought to explore the
author’s awareness and usage of the open access repository PQDT.

55

Motivation Factors for Publishing in ProQuest Open Access Database (PQDT).
The series of questions in the second part of the questionnaire focused on the ten factors
that motivated dissertation authors to publish dissertations in open access PQDT. It functioned
as a performance evaluation of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that motivate dissertation
authors. In the next question, a Likert 5-point scale was used to rate responses from “not
important” to “the most important”. The questions asked the participants to rate how important
they thought each of the factors was toward publishing dissertations in open access PQDT and
the IT functions of open access PQDT.
Preference for Publishing in ProQuest Open Access Database (PQDT).
The third part of the questionnaire requested information about the participants’ future
preferences of publishing in open access PQDT. Participants were asked to indicate if they
preferred to encourage other authors to submit their dissertations to open access PQDT prior to
graduation, if they had already submitted their dissertations in PQDT, or if they preferred to
submit their dissertations to open access PQDT within the next 6, 12, or 18 months (or greater).
Understanding the participants’ future preferences is important in helping determine the
likelihood of publishing dissertations in open access PQDT.
Other Data Gathering (Including Demographics).
The final part of the survey collected demographic information, which is also modified,
from an existing study (Park, 2007). The questionnaire asked for the respondent’s gender, age,
kind of job, areas of expertise, current institution, and area of study. All of the demographic
questions had categorical values from which to select a response. However, there was an openended question which was, “I welcome any additional comments you may wish to make.”

Data Collection for Main Study
The survey was available from the beginning of July, 2013 until the end of September,
2013. For the purpose of administering the survey, the researcher would not be able to receive
any list of doctoral alumni from Carnegie Mellon University or the University of Pittsburgh.
Therefore, the researcher collected email addresses from ProQuest and did a manual search of
dissertations in academic libraries and the online repositories. However, the researcher was able
to have lists of Robert Morris University doctoral alumni from the Computer and Information
Systems Department, the Education Department, and a list of the near-completion doctoral
students. The survey was distributed to 420 participants using a Web-based tool called
QuestionPro, which was available through http://questionpro.com/t/AKKkYZPue2. All the
data was inputted into a statistical database using SPSS software. The surveys were
administered anonymously, and participants were assured that the survey was completely
voluntary and anonymous according to Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations. The
researcher indicated those facts on the first page of the online survey that was displayed before
any questions were shown.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS
Introduction

This explanatory study determined the key factors that influence dissertation authors’
preferences for publishing their dissertations in open access. Several different statistics were
used to explore the vast amount of data collected using the survey instrument. SPSS was used
to determine data frequencies for research question 1 (RQ1), research question 2 (RQ2),
research question 3 (RQ3), and research question 4 (RQ4). For RQ2, factor analysis was
utilized. Also, for RQ3 and RQ4, the Pearson Correlation was utilized.
The chapter four is divided into three sections. The first section conveys the analysis of
qualitative data. The second section provides the analysis of quantitative data along with survey
participant description, demographic analysis, and analysis of reliability testing. The third
section presents the data analysis and the results for the research questions.
After data collection was completed, a copy of that data file was transferred into SPSS
for analysis. Also, a codebook (Appendix A) was developed to determine the types of data
(nominal, ordinal, or interval) that were collected for each item on the survey, and the variables
were then coded in SPSS as nominal, ordinal, or interval data.
Section One
Analysis of Qualitative Data.
This study mainly utilizes quantitative data to evaluate the research questions. However,
this study used an open-ended question to confirm qualitatively any additional comments that
participants preferred to add. Item 47, “I welcome any additional comments you may wish to
make,” was used to gather qualitative data. It was read and then coded for themes as they
emerged. Themes included “awareness,” “usage,” “usefulness,” “difficulty,” and “collegiality.”

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

63

Words or phrases that were included in the category of “awareness” included “This survey
made me aware” and “interested in open access.” The study addresses the issue of awareness as
an important element in determining the author’s use of open access publishing (Korobili,
Tilkidu, & Delistavrou, 2005). “Usage” included a phrase such as “used the PQDT to find
dissertations on similar topics to my study.” “Usefulness” included words or phrases such as
“was helpful to find a gap in the current literature on the topic and relating studies,” “really
helped me find additional sources for my study by viewing the references sections of those
related dissertations,” and “this study very fascinating and I would love to see the results.”
Another theme that emerged from the study was “difficulty.” Words and phrases that were
coded into this category included, “My dissertation is extremely hard to find in ProQuest” and
“searched myself since people told me it was hard to find even by putting my name in.” The
last theme that emerged from the open-ended question was “collegiality.” Words or phrases
that were included in the category of “collegiality” were: “This process was mentioned to my
cohort, but not fully explained” and “would love any information you are willing to share.” A
summary of the themes and coding regarding this aspect of the qualitative data collected is
listed in Table 4.1.

Awareness

Mostly this survey made me aware of, and interested in, open access.

Usage

I used the PQDT to find dissertations on similar topics for my study.

Usefulness

It was helpful to find a gap in the current literature on the topic and
related studies. It really helped me find additional sources for my study
by viewing the reference sections of those related dissertations. I find
this study very fascinating and I would love to see the results.

Difficulty

My dissertation is extremely hard to find in ProQuest so I am very
disappointed. I searched myself since people told me it was hard to find,
even by putting my name in.

Collegiality

This process was mentioned to my cohort but not fully explained. My
dissertation is currently in the process for publication, which is
supposed to take about 4-6 months. I would love any information you
are willing to share.

Section Two
Analysis of Quantitative Data.
The data collected from this study was quantitative in nature. It originated from 46 of
the 47 questions on the survey. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used in this study.
The significance of the descriptive statistics is to describe the characteristics that identify the
sample, to check variables for any outliers of assumptions underlying the statistical techniques
that are used in the present study, and to address specific research questions (Pallant, 2010).
Descriptive statistics were run on the data set. Frequency and descriptive statistics were
run to check for outliers. A five-point Likert Scale (questions 13 through 37), a six-point Likert

65

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

Scale (questions 8 through 12), and a seven-point Likert Scale (questions 38, 39, 40, and 41)
were used in this study. No outliers were found with examination of the data. The demographic
data were examined also for outliers, but no data was removed.
Survey Participant Description.
The participants used in this study consisted of 106 doctoral alumni and finishing
doctoral students who completed the online survey instrument for this research. The survey
instrument consisted of 47 questions exploring the awareness, motivation factors, and
preference for publishing in open access. The first 39 questions contained no missing data. The
next seven questions, which were the demographic questions, contained some missing data
(items 40 through 46 on the survey). Therefore, out of the 106 participants, there were a total of
six participants who did not complete the demographic data, but the study did not eliminate
them from the data source due to not completing the survey. Thus, the study consisted of a total
of 100 participants who completed the survey, including the demographic data.
Demographic Analysis.
Demographic evaluation of the participants in this study was performed using
descriptive statistics and frequencies. The following tables (4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5) provide a
picture of the sample used for this study.

participants in the 30 to 39 age group. There were 24% of the participants between the ages of
50 and 59, and 4% of the respondents were between the ages of 60 and 69. The remainder of
the participants, 70 years and older, represented 1% of the respondents in the study. As
observed, the majority of the respondents in this study were between 30 and 49 years of age
and nearly equal in distribution among those categories.

Language Arts/Reading, Military, Consulting, Behavioral Science, Information Systems and
Communications, Health Sciences, Systems Engineering, Education, Public Policy, Design,
Social Services, Energy, Government, Program Management, Biology/Life Science, Marketing,
Investigative, Intermediate Reading and Math, Communications and Visual Communications,

major of Business, followed by the major of Computer Science with 22%. The smallest
samples were from the major of Mathematics and Statistics with 1%, followed by the majors of
Earth and Environmental Sciences with 2%.

non-profit, school, public education, federal government, self-employed, college, school
district/education, and government. 17% were working in the industrial business sector. The
remaining participants consisted of 3% working in non-commercial research institutions.
Analysis of Reliability Testing.
The Cronbach’s reliability analysis was established for the overall survey. Cronbach’s
Alpha is a standard measure of internal consistency and reliability. Acceptable Cronbach Alpha
scores should be greater than 0.7, and preferred scores should be 0.8 or more; however, this
measurement depends also on the number of items used in a scale (DeVellis, 2003; Pallant,
2010). Cronbach’s Alpha measured statistics in four groups of the survey questions that
indicated the awareness, motivation factors, perceived advantages, and the preferences for
publishing dissertations in open access. The overall scale (33 items) had a large number of
items, so Cronbach’s Alpha provided a strong measure of reliability, but the awareness scale

69

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

and the preference of publishing dissertations in open access had a small number of items (four
items). The motivation factors had 25 items, and finally the perceived advantages scale had 12
items. Details of this analysis are provided in Table 4.6.

As mentioned previously Cronbach reliability analysis was established for the overall
survey. The reliability statistic result for Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.881 and, thus, in the
preferred acceptable range. The next Cronbach reliability analysis was performed on the
awareness variables. The reliability statistic result for Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.271 and
considered not to be in the preferred acceptable category. Because SPSS does not consider the
variables that have missing data, SPSS did not include items 2, 4, and 7 on the survey as
awareness variables; therefore, the reliability statistic results for Cronbach’s Alpha were
considered not to be in the preferred acceptable category. Another Cronbach reliability analysis
was performed on the motivation factors. The results of this test indicated a Cronbach’s Alpha
value of 0.888 and, thus, was in the preferred acceptable. Additional Cronbach analysis of
concern based on survey questions was run on the perceived advantages in which the

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

70

Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.884, which was also considered preferred acceptable. The final
Cronbach’s Alpha test was performed on the preference in which the Cronbach’s Alpha value
was 0.641 and fell into the acceptable range.
Section Three
Data Analysis and Research Questions.
The data analysis for the following four research questions was based on the specified
survey questions asked to the study participants. In this section the research questions are
examined and data analysis is performed.
Research Question One - Are dissertation authors aware of ProQuest open access
database?
In order to answer the first research question, descriptive statistics and frequency tests
were run on the first 10 questions (items 1 through 10 on the survey). The following tables
show the descriptive statistics and frequency distribution for the awareness variables.

The responses were different in the three other questions (items 3, 5, and 6 on the survey)
because the participants had the choice to skip those three questions on the survey if they
answered no to certain other questions (items 2, 4, and 7 on the survey).

published in PQDT once per quarter, 16% cited dissertations published in PQDT once a month,
4.7% cited dissertations published in PQDT once a week, and the least percentage, 0.9%, cited
dissertations published in PQDT more than once a week. The last awareness question in the
survey, (item 10), asked the participants how often they discussed the dissertations published in
PQDT with colleagues. 34.9% of the participants never discussed dissertations published in
PQDT, 27.4% discussed dissertations published in PQDT more than once a year, 17%

75

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
discussed dissertations published in PQDT once per quarter and once a month, and 1.9%
discussed dissertations published in PQDT once a week and more than once a week.

Research Question Two - What are the motivating factors that influence dissertation
authors’ decisions to publish their dissertations in ProQuest open access database?
In order to address this issue, questions 11 through 35 (factors motivation) of the survey
were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA).

statistical significance of P=.000, thus supporting the correlation matrix possessed factorability
(Bartlett, 1954).

Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis.

Principal component analysis (Table 4.13) revealed the presence of seven components
with eigenvalues exceeding 1, which explained 70% of the variance.

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

Figure 4.1. Scree Plot Diagram for All Components in Principal Component Analysis.
A careful review of the scree plot in Figure 4.1 showed a clear break between the fourth
and the fifth component. When using Principal Component Analysis, the point at which the
curve begins to drop and flatten out lets one know that factors after that point are ignorable
(Pallant, 2010). Using Catell’s scree test, the researcher decided to retain the fifth component
for further analysis (Catell, 1966).

The five component solutions, which are highlighted in table 4.15, explain the variances
and components. Component 1, “using the IT functions allows dissertation authors to make
PQDT a rich repository,” considers it as an extrinsic factor [see appendix B] of Perceived
Technological Advantage (PTA) contributed 31.3%. Component 2, “publishing dissertations in
open access PQDT is a valuable use of time,” is considered as an intrinsic factor of Perceived
Career Benefit (PCB), contributed 40.3%. Component 3, “publishing dissertations in open
access PQDT increases an author’s reputation,” is considered as an intrinsic factor of Perceived
Authoritative Advantage (PAA) contributed 48.1%. Component 4, “publishing dissertations in
open access PQDT is helpful in developing an academic career,” is considered as an intrinsic

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

82

factor of Perceived Career Benefit (PCB) and it contributed 55.2%. Component 5, “publishing
dissertations in open access PQDT helps an author’s work become prestigious,” is considered
as an intrinsic factor of Perceived Authoritative Advantage (PAA) contributed 60.6%. To
further develop the interpretation of these five components, a component matrix was
performed, Table 4.14, which provided a simple structure with all five components that
indicated a number of strong loadings and most variables loading substantially on one
component (Thurstone, 1947).
Research Question Three - Is there a relationship between the awareness of open
access publishing and the decision to publish dissertations in open access?
The research question was examined through establishing the Pearson Correlation tests
between the sum of awareness variables, items 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7, and the sum of preference
variables, items 36 through 39, to further understand the correlation between these two groups
of variables. This analysis was explored through the responses given by the participants in
survey questions 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Because the participants had the choice to skip five of the
awareness questions on the survey, items 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10, if they answered no to certain
questions, items 2, 4, and 7, and SPSS does not include any variables that have missing data,
the study did not include items 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10, even if they were considered awareness
variables. For this research question, descriptive statistics and frequencies also were performed
between the sum of awareness variables, items 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7, and the sum of preference
variables, as shown in Table 4.16.

The results of descriptive statistics in Table 4.16 had indicated 97 participants of the
awareness sum, and 106 participants of the preference sum. The mean was 6.66 for the
awareness variables and 12.29 for the preference variables. The median was 7 for the
awareness variables and 12 for the preference variables.
Correlation between Awareness and Preferences.
A Pearson Correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the correlation between the
awareness and the preference. The Pearson Correlation analysis had shown a statistical
significance of n=97 (awareness), n=106 (preference), and p = .702, with r = .039. The test
indicates that there is no correlation between the awareness of publishing dissertations in open
access and the preference for publishing dissertations in open access for research question
three.
Research Question Four - Is there a relationship between the perceived advantages
and the decision to publish dissertations in open access?
In response to this research, the data was examined through a Pearson Correlation
analysis between the sum of perceived advantages variables (items 13 through 20 and items 27
through 30) and the sum of preference variables (items 36 through 39). Descriptive statistics

Summary
The analysis of the quantitative data contained interesting results. There was clear
evidence that the majority of the participants were aware of open access repository PQDT, and
they read dissertations on-line. The factor motivation variables were subjected to principal
component analysis (PCA), and the KMO value exceeded the recommended value.
Additionally, there appeared to be no relationship between awareness of publishing
dissertations in open access and a preference for publishing dissertations in open access.
However, there appeared to be a medium relationship between perceived advantages factors
and a preference for publishing dissertations in open access. Analysis also confirmed that the
first component of the factor analysis was one of the extrinsic motivations which was Perceived
Technological Advantage (PTA), especially the factor that indicated that using the IT functions
allowed dissertation authors to make the PQDT as a dissertation repository rich. Based on the
analysis, including the Cronbach’s Alpha and Parallel Analysis testing, the reliability for the
instrument appears to be high, especially for motivation factors.

CHAPTER 5: DISCUSSION

This chapter integrates and discusses the results of the study within the context of the
literature. The chapter also explains the meanings of the findings and indicates the researcher’s
point of view. It also discusses the limitations of this study and includes some
recommendations for future research.
Awareness of Publishing in Open Access
The present study found that participants were aware of, and familiar with, the term
open access. 74% of the participants were aware of ProQuest Open Access Publishing PLUS,
and 44.1% submitted their dissertations through the online repository PQDT. Also, 88.1% of
the participants read dissertations online. Previous open access studies support the results of
this study, and the majority of both the policymakers and researchers were quite familiar with,
and aware of, the open access concept (Dulle, 2011). The results also verified previous research
by Creaser, Greenwood, Oppenheim, Probets, Spezi, & White (2010). They maintain that
authors were familiar with the term open access and demonstrated a general understanding of
the open access concept (Creaser, Greenwood, Oppenheim, Probets, Spezi, & White, 2010).
Additionally, the most interesting finding of this study demonstrated that the majority of
the participants (88.7%) used the online repository PQDT, although a previous study had found
the term repository was confusing (Creaser et al., 2010). The results emphasized that the more
often dissertation authors used open access by citing, reading, and discussing information, the
more likely they would publish their dissertation in open access. Likewise, the author’s
awareness of open access had an impact on increasing the motivation of publishing
dissertations in open access. Indeed, this finding had been mentioned in the literature (Park,
2007).

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

87

Although the majority of the participants were aware of open access and may have
wanted to publish in open access, they chose the traditional publishing option (56.9%) rather
than paying the $95 fee to publish in ProQuest Open Access Publishing PLUS. It appears that
the cost paid by authors as a publication fee is one of the obstacles that prevents them from
publishing dissertations in ProQuest open access. Moreover, 50.5% of the respondents
indicated that they received both the full text and the preview text when they used the online
repository PQDT. It seems that the cost that is paid by researchers to receive a full text of the
dissertation is also another obstacle that prevents publishing dissertations in ProQuest PQDT.
The results indicate that authors preferred free-of-charge service and preferred to receive both
full-text and the preview text because they needed to have the full-text of the dissertation to
support their studies.
Open access provides free collection management, free and wide accessibility of
information, efficiency in the publishing process, and effective channeling of communication to
the audience. These benefits influence authors to publish their dissertations in open access,
even if the cost is one of the major concerns. It appears from the findings of this study and the
literature that most of the dissertation authors were aware of publishing in open access, but they
did not consider the benefits of open access as major elements for researchers. Dissertation
authors should be aware of and support the idea of open access because publishing dissertations
in open access increases the ability to find dissertations without constraints, enhances research,
saves time and effort, and removes cost barriers for retrieving the publications of other authors.
In my experience as a dissertation author, I do support the open access because I had to buy
full-text on-line dissertations. I purchased seven full-text dissertations in order to use them in

88

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
the present study. It can be concluded that open access is the potential solution to removing
barriers that prevent one from accessing recommended dissertations.
Factors Influencing the Motivation for Publishing in Open Access
The primary focus of this study was to determine which factors motivate authors to

publish dissertations in open access. The study demonstrated two types of motivations, intrinsic
and extrinsic, and each type included factors that influenced dissertation authors’ preferences
for publishing dissertations in open access. In looking at the second research question, the study
illustrated, through principal component analysis, that indeed, there were five primary factors
influencing dissertation authors’ preferences for publishing dissertations in open access as
shown in Table 5.1.

It appears from the factor analysis that the first component was one of the extrinsic
factors and falls under Perceived Technological Advantage (PTA). The first factor that
motivates an author to publish a dissertation in the ProQuest open access that participants chose
was “using the IT functions allows dissertation authors to make PQDT a rich repository.” What
emerged from this was an interesting finding because the first factor influencing the motivation
of publishing dissertations in open access had fallen under Perceived Technological
Advantages, and it was one of the extrinsic motivations. I was expecting the first factor to be
one of intrinsic motivation since Ryan & Deci (2000) argue that intrinsic motivation is
considered an important element, especially in education. “Because intrinsic motivation results
in creativity and high-quality learning, it is especially important to detail the factors and forces
that engender versus undermine it” (Ryan & Deci, 2000, p. 55).
However, my finding supports two researchers’ cognitive evaluation theory that
indicates increasing extrinsic motivation undermines intrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985).
Also, the finding supports self-determination theory and general interest theory, which indicate
that extrinsic rewards can enhance intrinsic motivation (Gagné & Deci 2005; Eisenberger,
Pierce, & Cameron 1999). It does appear from the findings that people use technology and
consider it extrinsic motivation, as it generally allows doing more with less time and resources.
Therefore, it is more economically efficient and creates new possibilities and opportunities for
people.
My findings also showed that the second and the fourth factors were intrinsic factors.
The intrinsic factors fell under Perceived Career Benefit (PCB) and have been mentioned in the
literature as the second factor (Park, 2007). Perceived Career Benefits is valued differently by
authors depending on their academic positions. Thus, university professors might be the group

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

90

who would be more likely to consider publishing in open access as an important career benefit.
Therefore, publishing in open access is widely accessible and has a positive effect on career
benefits. Additionally, considering Perceived Career Benefits as an intrinsic motivation might
affect authors’ decisions of publishing in open access since intrinsic motivation is commonly
described as doing something for one’s own benefit. I taught at Umm Al-Qura University in
Saudi Arabia as a part-time faculty member, so I was considering Perceived Career Benefit as
an intrinsic motivation and had a long-term goal to be a full-time faculty member.
The results indicate that the third and fifth factors fall under Perceived Authoritative
Advantage (PAA) that also was considered as an intrinsic motivation. This finding supports the
Rogers (2003) diffusion of innovation theory, which uses five innovation characteristics
(relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability). In addition, what
emerged from the demographic data analysis was that over 1/3 (39%) of the participants were
university professors, so they should consider Perceived Authoritative Advantage as an
important factor that could make them well known and feel more scholarly. From my
experience as a university teacher, I would like to be better known and would prefer to enhance
my reputation. Therefore, I encourage publishing in open access to allow the broader possible
dissemination of my work without constraints. That will provide free global access to my work,
which increases my reputation and makes me feel more scholarly. It can be concluded from the
findings that most of the dissertation authors were concerned about their reputation and being
well known.
The literature debates other factors that could influence dissertation authors’ preferences
for publishing in open access, and I did not discuss these in the present study due to its
quantitative nature. These factors included free access, cost, speed, publishing quality, and

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

91

copyright (Warlick & Vaughan, 2007). The first factor that could be of influence in publishing
in open access is free access. The term free access offers unlimited access to dissertations so
authors, as readers, would have desired dissertations that are related to their studies without
paying to receive a full-text version. That factor could also improve the quality of the study
when citing more related dissertations. The other factor that could influence dissertation
authors’ preferences for publishing dissertations to open access is the cost. The cost of $95 that
the dissertation authors, as writers, have to pay is this one-time fee, but the benefit of that could
last forever. For example, the dissertation authors who submit their dissertations in open access
could improve the opportunity for their dissertations to be cited more often than those of other
authors. In most cases authors attempt to make their best research open access than the others
since they are available worldwide. They have the chance to become more citable. For
example, Alma Swan, John Willinsky, and Peter Suber have published different works in open
access. As a result, they are often cited.
Another factor that could influence dissertation authors’ preferences for publishing
dissertations in open access is the speed. The speed factor is related to time consumption. The
process of searching and finding open access dissertations is easier than the process of
accessing and reading unopened access dissertations or the printed copies. Therefore, open
access saves the researchers time which could be a primary concern of the researcher. Another
of the factors that could influence dissertation authors’ preferences for publishing dissertations
in open access could be the publishing quality. In order to publish in ProQuest open access
repository PQDT, dissertation authors are required to meet the publication format and criteria
so researchers, most of the time, do not need to worry about the dissertation quality of the
PQDT authors. The last factor that could motivate publishing dissertations in open access could

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

92

be the copyright. Authors did not consider the copyright one of the factors that could motivate
in publishing in open access in 1999. However, now authors are considering copyright as a
motivation factor of publishing in open access more than ever before. Dissertation authors
should consider copyright as a motivation factor because each dissertation published in PQDT
is given an ISBN reference number and should be listed on the PQDT repository. Also, each
dissertation has a copyright page as a protection to the dissertation authors’ rights.
Awareness and the Preference for Publishing in Open Access
The results indicate that no relationship appeared between an author’s awareness and
his/her preference for publishing in open access, although the findings show that the majority
of the doctoral alumni and students were aware of open access. In the results chapter of this
study, the researcher discussed the participants’ preferences for publishing dissertations in open
access. The decisions ranged from the characteristic of agreeing to prefer publishing
dissertations in PQDT to the characteristic of strongly disagreeing. The statement that got
44.3% of the doctoral alumni and the students’ highest agreement score was statement number
one in the preference section of the survey. Statement number one, which most of the
participants chose with “somewhat agree” was “I prefer to encourage other authors to submit
their dissertations in PQDT prior to graduation.” However, the statement that got 24.5% of the
doctoral alumni and the students’ highest disagreement score was statement number four in the
preference section of the survey. Statement number four, which most of the participants chose
with “strongly disagree,” was “I prefer to submit my dissertation in PQDT within the next 18
months or greater.” What emerged from this was that although there is no significant
relationship between the awareness of publishing in open access and the preference for
publishing in open access, there is clear evidence that the doctoral alumni and students, as

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

93

dissertation authors, support and encourage the idea of publishing dissertations in ProQuest
open access database PQDT because they had to deal with obstacles that prevented them from
accessing the desired dissertations that were related to their study. Although dissertation
authors may support the idea of publishing in open access, there are a number of reasons that
might prevent authors from publishing in open access (ProQuest/UMI). The first reason could
be related to the author’s work that might be funded by an industry or a corporation, so there
may be some restrictions for the web access to the work. The second reason could be related to
the unique method that authors invented through their dissertation, to the development of
something with tangible value to an industry or a business, or to the patented work in the
dissertations (Suber, 2008). The third reason could be authors’ own value systems and goals to
help society benefit from their research by making their work free to anyone who wants or
needs it.
Perceived Advantages and the Preference for Publishing in Open Access
The findings show a moderate correlation between perceived advantages and the
preference for publishing dissertations in open access. This study discussed the term perceived
advantages in three forms: Perceived Visible Advantages, Perceived Authoritative Advantages,
and Perceived Technological Advantages. The first perceived advantage form was Perceived
Visible Advantage, meaning that there are more visible publications that are more available to
the readers as opposed to printed copies. Since publishing dissertations in open access makes
dissertations freely available, the visible advantage provides them with the potential benefit of
wide readership. It appears that the dissertation authors who believe that publishing
dissertations in open access would increase the visibility of their dissertations are more likely to
prefer publishing in open access to ensure that their publications reach the target audience

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

94

within the shortest duration of time possible. The second perceived advantage form was
Perceived Authoritative Advantage. Perceived Authoritative Advantage could provide authority
such as promoting a positive reputation, being well known, and feeling more scholarly. It
appears that Perceived Authoritative Advantage plays a serious role in influencing authors’
decisions of publishing dissertations in open access. It is possible to say there is a positive
relationship between authors’ reputations and authors’ publications. In general, accessing the
most recent resources more quickly and easily provides authors the ability to extend their
information and write valuable research, and thus, the research affects authors’ reputations
because reputation is what others think about scholars. The third perceived advantage form was
Perceived Technological Advantages. Perceived technological advantages can mean the extent
to which an author believes that using open access would promote publishing performance.
Technology seems to be an intelligent method that supports publishing in open access, and, it is
possible to say, that technology helps accessing the desired information quickly and easily.
Therefore, the factor, Perceived Technological Advantages, relates to the open access method
because it considers idealistic techniques to deliver information faster and easier. It seems that
authors prefer to publish in open access if they obtain advantages, can be visible or
authoritative, or be technological from their publications such as dissertations. In summary, the
term perceived advantage is the ability gained through easy access to resources.
The purpose of this study was to determine factors that motivate an author to publish in
open access. Analysis of primarily quantitative data created a picture of the dissertation
author’s awareness of publishing in open access that yielded interesting and unanticipated
findings. Overall, the majority of the dissertation authors were aware of open access and read
dissertations online.

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

95

The connection between the Awareness and Perceived Advantages
From the findings discovered in this study it is clear there is no relationship between
dissertation authors’ awareness of open access and their decisions to publish in open access.
The evidence that there is no connection between the two aspects is the fact that most of the
dissertation authors are not using open access to publish their findings on their own. Those
dissertation authors who do publish in open access often do so not because they want to, but
because they are compelled to move with the changing world. Some dissertation authors are not
aware of the advantages and the disadvantages associated with open access, but they just use it
without partaking of the full benefits.
However, in this study there is minimal relationship between perceived advantages of
publishing in open access and the decision to publish in open access. The advantages of
publishing in open access are what have motivated various authors to publish in open access.
This motivation is in a way related to perceived advantages. The advantages associated with
this mode of publishing are encouraging authors to produce volumes of literature via this
means. Publishing in open access is advantageous to various groups, thus making it a reputable
method of publishing. The perceived advantages motivate dissertation authors to publish in
open access.
The fact that perceived advantages are what stimulate dissertation authors to publish in
open access shows that there exists a connection between awareness of publishing in open
access and the perceived advantages. It has been shown that while dissertation authors may be
aware that it is possible to publish in open access, they are not making effective use of it. This
can be attributed to the fact that these authors are not convinced of the advantages of publishing
in open access. Additionally fear of the unknown could be another factor that might be barring

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

96

them from fully using this method of publishing. However, it is evident that the perceived
advantages of publishing in open access is what is motivating these dissertation authors to
publish in open access. Some of the perceived advantages inducing them to use open access are
elimination of publishing costs and faster dissemination of the information to the targeted
audience.
Optional Implementations for Open Access
The findings of the present study hold optional implementations for open access
journals, particularly ProQuest/UMI as well as university ETD sites. Since the results of the
present study focus on the awareness of publishing dissertations in open access, the ProQuest
company should facilitate beneficial ways to increase the dissertation author’s awareness to
publish in the open access PQDT database. In addition, the findings indicate a medium
relationship between preference and perceived advantages. Therefore, ProQuest should offer
interesting advantages that could be visible, authoritative, or technological for dissertation
authors to enhance publishing in open access. For example, ProQuest could provide a special
offer to the authors who prefer to publish their dissertations in PQDT soon after they graduate.
The present study also could help academic libraries by providing a framework for
considering and evaluating ProQuest PQDT. The PQDT database provides a number of
benefits for libraries, such as free global access to desired dissertations, which would increase
libraries’ budgets. Adopting the concept of open access, however, could make the university
ETD databases richer because the ProQuest Open Access Publishing option allows more
accessibility to dissertations from different universities. The idea of publishing in open access
could help the small universities to grow and compete with the big universities. Considering
Harvard and Yale University as affluent universities, Harvard library “subscribed to 98,900

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

97

serials and Yale to 73,900” as of 2008; however, “several sub-Saharan African university
libraries subscribed to zero” and were limited to collections donated by publishers (Suber,
2012. p. 30). Most of the small universities and universities in developing countries face
financial issues, so they do not have large budgets to improve their resources in the university
library database. Thus, most of those libraries rely on the interlibrary loan, a service for
researchers. So if users find that the library does not have access to one of the needed
resources, the library can borrow that source from other academic libraries. However, most of
the time, researchers are required to wait at least a couple of days for delivery; also, it is
possible that using the interlibrary loan extensively can cost more than using open access online
repositories. One of the significant movements in open access that many universities should
consider is Harvard Open Access Project (HOAP). It started in 2011 to enhance open access
within and beyond Harvard and provide information and policy about open access (Berkman,
n.d.).
In addition, this study listed the key factors that influence dissertation authors to publish
dissertations in open access. Therefore, ProQuest/UMI should consider the listed factors and
give priority to these factors when developing its repository. The listed factors also could help
any publications, so the publishers should consider these factors in order to provide wider
distribution and easy access to their articles, books, or any other types of resources.
Consideration of these factors may allow academic libraries to develop better materials and,
therefore, improve the quality of their information services. In addition, the results also provide
dissertation authors an evaluation of the factors that could motivate them to publish in ProQuest
Open Access Publishing PLUS. Dissertation authors who are doing research would definitely
benefit from this kind of information. However, dissertation authors can start with traditional

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

98

publishing and add the open access later; especially if they are publishing as a journal article, it
is recommended starting with the traditional because some publishers do not like the web
access to the authors’ work. It could be concluded, however, that researchers are more likely to
use, and cite, free access resources, which easily could be found when conducting a study.
Therefore, dissertation authors should consider this idea when making a decision to either open
access their work or not.
Limitations of the Study
This research is quantitative in nature, so data generated from this study did not provide
enough depth into some of the areas. In addition, any data collected using survey instruments
may be limited with the recognition that participants may provide incorrect data on surveys
(Pallant, 2007).
The time of data collection was in the summer when most of the doctoral alumni were
on vacation, especially the ones who just graduated. The second and third attempts to collect
data were in the beginning of the fall semester, which also was not suitable because the
doctoral alumni were busy after their vacations; therefore, many of them ignored the survey.
This study was conducted at three universities in the Pittsburgh area: Robert Morris
University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pittsburgh. Only 106
participants completed the survey. The small sample size may need to be increased in order to
more accurately generalize the findings.
The researcher could not receive any list of doctoral alumni from Carnegie Mellon
University or the University of Pittsburgh; therefore, the researcher collected email addresses
from ProQuest and D-Scholarship@Pitt, and did a manual search of dissertations in academic
libraries, and checked the online repositories.

Recommendations for Future Studies
Many studies could be generated from this research study. They are as follows:
•

The present study focused on ProQuest PQDT as an open access repository. Further
study could be conducted to compare the university ETD sites with ProQuest and many
open access journals in terms of the cost and benefits.

•

The present study determined the key factors that motivated authors to publish in
PQDT particularly. A future study could apply the listed factors to other open access
journals, and the results might be different and more significant.

•

The present study identified factors that influenced publishing dissertations in open
access; however, it did not cover the relationships among these factors. Future studies
could be conducted to identify the inter-relationship among these factors and test them.

•

This study used a small sample size of the doctoral alumni and students in the
Pittsburgh area. Further study should obtain a more comprehensive sample of
university professors across the United States to enhance the generalization of results.

•

Research may examine one university ETD database and compare the chosen database
to other universities’ ETD databases in terms of the size, service, and cost.

•

The present study focused particularly on the dissertation as a main recourse that
dissertation authors used in their study. A future study could include other types of
open access resources such as articles and books and have other types of users such as
high school students and people in business.

•

A study could be conducted to collect the perceptions of the dissertation authors who
are university professors about the factors that motivate them to publish in open access

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

100

and examine whether they affect their reputations and improve their academic careers
or not.
•

A future study could be conducted to compare open access dissertations with non-open
access in all fields within five years in ProQuest PQDT database to create a list of the
advantages of publishing in open access.

Conclusion
Open access can have a positive impact on everything in people’s daily lives starting
from education to medical implications. Students as researchers need to access valuable
resources in their fields, so open access offers unlimited access to education. Doctors as
researchers also need to access the latest medical knowledge in order to make decisions, to seek
more effective treatments, and to find better outcomes, so open access provides a wide variety
of medical resources. For example, a real-life illustration of how open access can stimulate
knowledge creation is how a high school student Jack Andraka, who “won the 2012 Intel
International Science and Engineering Fair,” used only freely available resources to develop a
new diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer which enables doctors to diagnose the disease earlier
than they were before he developed the test (SPARC, n.d., para.1). Therefore, open access
sources can lead to innovation and improve the ability to develop new products and services.
Professors and librarians should advocate for open access publishing because it makes
information easily available to researchers, scholars, and educators. Open access is essential in
the sense that it eliminates economic barriers associated with hard-copy publication of
dissertations and other scholarly material. With open access, the intellectual materials are easily
reproduced and redistributed to the people that are interested in their contents. There are a
number of portable devices such as tablets and phones that can be used in reading open access

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

101

publications. Open access publications can thus be read easily any place. Open access
publishing is also, of course, quite a bit cheaper than printing hard copies.
It is possible to conceive of awareness as a seed and publishing in open access as its
fruitage, so awareness and open access are related and impact each other in some ways.
Supporting open access publication is important because it makes it very easy for scholars to
produce and disseminate their works to the public. Members of the public can easily access the
intellectuals’ works; thus open access publication will help educate people. Additionally,
digital publication helps conserve the environment by reducing the demand for trees.
From the advantages associated with the open access publications it seems logical to
promote this form of publication. Professors, researchers, students and publications’ staff
should all immediately join the open access bandwagon and promote this type of publication to
the hilt. In addition to these groups of professionals, the government and ministries of higher
education must play an important role in encouraging open access publication. Policies can be
formulated by politicians to promote this mode of publication. Politicians can also promote the
use of open access publications in higher education institutions.
Universities also, of course, have an important role to play in promoting open access
publication. University policymakers can do this by making most of their reading materials
available to students via the school website. This will motivate students writing their
dissertations to use open access publication methods in order to be able to use the school’s
website and get exposure on the world-wide web. By forcing students to use this method of
publication the university policy makers will expand the culture of public access publications
among students around the world. The institutions can also promote open access programs in
form of lectures. These programs will create awareness among the students as to the advantages

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING

102

of open access; at the same time they will be taught how to use this type of publication software
and how to access scholarly works that are available in this format. Open access in this context
refers to the free availability of intellectual property to the public. The free availability of this
information is made possible via the Internet, allowing any user who has access to the Internet
to read, download, print, distribute, or use it for any legal function with no financial, legal, or
technical barriers. From the facts presented in this study it is clear that governments, ministries
of higher education, universities, and all decision makers need to encourage publication in open
access to increase awareness, support knowledge, and create a community consciousness.

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
Appendix C
Literature Review Linked to Research Questions
RQ1. Are dissertation authors aware of ProQuest open access database?
Supporting Literature
•

Open access refers to the free availability of scholarly materials on the public Internet. The
public viewers are allowed to read, copy, download, distribute, or use these scholarly
materials for any lawful practices without any barriers hindering their access to these
materials (Swan, 2012).

•

Hernandez-Borges et al. (2006), opine that open access publishing (OAP) provides free
electronic access to scientific research materials. Such free access is provided through open
access journals, free access to personal websites, and so forth.

•

In the past, different studies have been carried out with the intention of establishing the
awareness and use of open access publishing through online repositories. Dulle, MinishiMajanja & Cloete (2011) established that most researchers have not fully embraced the idea
of using open access journals. This is so because they are not aware of the availability of
open access publishing and the benefits it provides to its users.

•

According to MacGregor, Stranack, & Willinsky (2014), some of the benefits of using open
access publishing include increased exposure of information to the target audience, easier
information discovery by the audience, and persistent access of information, among others.

•

Korobili, Tilikidou, and Delistarou (2005) point out that in an open access publishing user
survey conducted in the University of Hong Kong library, 68.8% of the respondents preferred
using open access journals compared to 32.2% of the respondents who preferred using
printed journals. Many of the respondents in this survey preferred using open access journals
due to their advantage over printed journals. In this vein, Korobili, Tilikidou, and Delistarou
(2005) observe that while using open access journals, the journal content is accessible to all
users regardless of their affiliation with a subscribing library. Equally, open access journals
have increased visibility and citation advantages.

•

In a different study conducted by Okoye and Ejikeme (2010), the results established that the
use of open access resources is still relatively low. One of the main factors explaining the
low utility of open access resources in this study included a negative attitude of researchers
towards open access resources.

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
•

Despite all the existing challenges in the usage of open access resources by scholars and
researchers, Khalili (2011) observes that there has been a gradual increase in the use of open
access resources over the years. This augment is attributed to increased awareness campaigns
by open access advocates and practitioners giving scholars and researchers an opportunity to
learn about the advantages of utilizing open access resources.

RQ2. What are the motivating factors that influence dissertation authors’ decisions to publish
their dissertations in ProQuest open access database?
Supporting Literature
•

According to Bjork (2004), open access is currently being regarded as an innovation that is
expected to enhance positive changes to the way scholars access, process, and share
knowledge.

•

To the authors, open access provides free collection management, free and wide accessibility
of information, efficiency in the publishing process, an effective channel of communication
to the audience, and so forth. These benefits influence authors towards publishing their
materials in open access.

•

According to Bjork (2004), authors publish their research with the hope that the audience will
obtain this information and use it for further research processes. Through open access, the
authors’ research reaches a large number of the intended audience where it is obtained and
printed and, as such, further increases the chances of the audience building on, and
developing, the research ideas.

•

This is a source of influence for the authors to prefer publishing sources in open access
Through open access publishing, the authors have the assurance that their research will have
many citations due to wide readership, accessibility, and the high quality associated with
open access (Bjork, 2004).

•

open access publications are cited more than printed publications because of their high
quality and increased accessibility.

•

An author’s publishing preference is also influenced by different factors addressed by the
diffusion of innovation theory. This theory focuses on the authors’ perceived beliefs about the
attributes of open access publishing including its complexity, compatibility, relative
advantages, observability, and trialability.

•

The perceived author’s belief in the advantages of open access attributes influences authors’

120

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
preferences for publishing sources in open access. Such perceived beliefs include perceived
career benefits, perceived authoritative advantages, perceived technological advantages,
perceived visible advantages, controllability, perceived topical compatibility, and social
influence.
•

According to Rogers (2003), authority promotes rapid diffusion of an innovation; “the degree
of relative advantage is often expressed as economic profitability, as conveying social
prestige or in other ways” (p. 229).

•

In this case, the perceived authoritative advantage is the extent to which an author believes
that publishing in an open access source would provide authority. Studies illustrate the
existing relationship between perceived authority and open access source selection.

•

In open access journals, for instance, Kling & Callahan (2003) point out that the use of
certain terms, such as peer-reviewed, promotes a positive journal reputation. Perceived
journal reputation is conceptualized as perceived authority and plays a huge role in
influencing authors’ preferences for publishing sources in open access.

•

Perceived visible advantages also influences authors’ preferences for publishing sources in
open access. The perceived visible advantage is the extent to which an author believes that
using open access publishing would promote the visibility of a publication (Harnad & Brody,
2004).

•

Antelman (2004) established that open access journals are cited more frequently than printed
journals, hence concluding that open access provides wider dissemination of information. In
this case, the fact that open access publishing provides wider dissemination of information
increases the probability of authors preferring the publishing sources available in open access.

•

Open access publishing is also associated with technological advantages. According to Park
(2007), perceived technological advantage is the extent to which an author believes that
using open access would promote publishing performance.

•

Dulle, Minishi-Majanja & Cloete, (2011) further opine that using open access publishing
promotes better management of manuscripts in addition to promoting a direct feedback from
the audience. These advantages are made possible by different information technologies such
as feedback bulletin boards that influence authors’ preferences for publishing sources in open
access.

•

Perceived topical compatibility is the other factor that influences authors’ preferences for
publishing in open access. Perceived topical compatibility is the extent to which an author
believes that the topic of an open access publication would suit the existing academic

121

interests (Park, 2009).
•

Rogers (2003) further notes that compatibility is “the degree to which an innovation is
perceived as consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential
adopters” (p. 240). In this case, there is a higher probability that individuals would adopt an
innovation that they are more familiar with at the expense of an innovation that they are less
familiar with.

•

In the process of selecting a publishing source, publication audience is one of the factors that
authors put into consideration, and it is directly related to topical compatibility (Rogers,
2003). Meadows (1998) notes that “one survey of academic researchers found out that 70%
regarded the prestige of the journal as important, and 67% thought its readership is highly
important” (p. 164). As such, Meadows (1998) concludes that publication readership is
directly related to perceived topical compatibility, and it influences authors’ preferences for
publishing sources in open access.

•

Perceived career benefit influences authors’ preferences for publishing in open access.
According to Park (2007), perceived career benefit is the extent to which an author believes
that publishing in open access would be advantageous in terms of career development.
Academic publications do more than just communicate; they are connected to the academic
reward system. However, perceived career benefit is valued differently by authors depending
on their academic positions.

•

Open access publishing sources are widely accessible and are said to have a positive effect on
career benefit (Harnad & Brody, 2004). As such, Rogers (2003) points out that authors would
be influenced to use open access publishing sources if they perceive them to have career
benefits.

•

Park (2007) contend that controllability is the extent to which an author recognizes the
external control of publishing in open access. This perception influences authors’ preferences
for publishing in open access. Kling & Callahan (2003) further purport that open access
publishing will become more effective in the future with increased development of support
infrastructure. Some publishing sources in open access charge publication fees which are paid
from the author’s personal budget if they are not waived by grants or support institutions. In
open access, resources and infrastructure refer to publishing policies and publication
regulations and play a huge role in influencing authors’ preferences for publishing sources in
open access. According to Antelman (2004), these resources and infrastructure are more or
less likely the external facilitating conditions.

•

Social influence also plays a significant role in persuading authors to publish their materials
in open access. Influence from interpersonal relationships and evaluation of the products of
other people influence individuals towards adopting an innovation. Interpersonal influence
and publication influence are the main social influences that persuade authors to adopt open
access publishing. Interpersonal influence is the extent to which an author perceives that
his/her peers think that he/she should or should not publish in open access. On the other hand,
publication influence is the extent to which an author evaluates open access publications of
other scholars who are close and important to him/her (Park, 2009).

RQ3. Is there a relationship between the awareness of open access publishing and the decision to
publish dissertations in open access?
Supporting Literature
•

In publishing, perceived awareness is the extent to which an author believes that he/she
would be aware of a certain publication.

•

This kind of awareness incorporates previous experiences obtained from reading a
publication, visiting a website where a publication is available, and so forth (HernandezBorges et al., 2006).

•

Rogers (2003) is of the opinion that when an individual experiences an innovation, he/she
becomes aware of the innovation’s existence and is more likely to adopt it for future use.

•

Evans (2012) states that in scholarly communication, the reading and citing stages precede
the publishing stage. In this case, reading and citing processes enhance the author’s
awareness of open access publishing, hence increasing the probability of the author using
open access for future publications.

•

Reading and citing enable an author to eliminate any fears of the unknown in open access,
hence promoting further the possibility of using open access publishing.

•

According to Poltronieri et al. (2013), open access publishing is innovative; however, the
uncertainties surrounding the open access concept become a huge challenge when authors are
making considerations on whether to use open access publishing.

•

On this note, Dulle, Minishi-Majanja & Cloete, (2011) stress that the more widely the open
access concept is understood, the more likely it is that authors would adopt it when
publishing their articles.

•

This argument is supported by the arguments of Bjork (2004) that general awareness of open
access publishing plays an important role in promoting the increased use of open access

123

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
publishing among scholars.
•

Foster and Gibbons (2005) conducted a study in an institution to establish why faculty have
not disseminated their publications into open institutional repositories. Their findings support
the views of Abrizah (2009). They established that, among other reasons, the main reason as
to why faculty have not disseminated their publications into open institutional repositories
was that the faculty did not have sufficient information on the open institutional repository
concept. Particularly, they established that the faculty did not have information on the
functionality and the career benefits of open institutional repositories.

•

They further noted that the use of open institutional repositories by the faculty increased with
increased awareness of the advantages of using open institutional repositories among the
faculty.

RQ4. Is there a relationship between the perceived advantages and the decision to publish
dissertations in open access?
Supporting Literature
•

Open access publishing sources have been associated with numerous advantages when
compared to printed publications. Such advantages have been identified to play a significant
role in increasing the likelihood of authors publishing in open access.

•

Harnad and Brody (2004) point out that open access journals have perceived visible
advantages, meaning that they are more visible publications and are more available to the
readers as opposed to printed journals. Since open access journals are freely available, the
visible advantage provides them with a potential benefit of wide readership.

•

Harnad and Brody (2004) assert that this benefit has a significant influence on the authors’
intentions of adopting open access journals to publish their materials.

•

Past studies on open access journals focused on the visible advantage that these journals have
over printed journals (Antelman, 2004; Harnad & Brody, 2004; & Bjork, 2004). Nonetheless,
they failed to focus on whether the visibility benefit is perceived as an advantage by authors.
Recent studies have, however, employed a holistic approach on the advantages of open access
journals and how authors perceive these advantages (Rogers, 2003).

•

Particularly, Bjork (2004) notes that the authors who believe that open access publishing
would increase the visibility of their publications are more likely to adopt open access
publishing to ensure that their publications reach the target audience within the shortest

124

OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
duration of time possible.
•

Open access publishing has also been identified with technological advantages. According to
Robinson (2012), information technology increases the integration and flexibility of data
processing, hence providing increased efficiency in the publishing process. These advantages
are experienced in open access publishing.

•

Park (2007) alleges that authors perceive the benefits of information technology, as used in
open access publishing, as making them distinguished from paper-print publications.
Awareness of technological advantages of open access publishing by authors increases the
possibility of authors using open access publishing to publish their articles.
