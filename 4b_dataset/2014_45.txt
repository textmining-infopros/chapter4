MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AS ALTERNATIVE ARCHIVAL SPACES:
INVESTIGATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHIVAL PRACTICES IN NONPROFIT MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS
Lindsay Kistler Mattock, MLIS, PhD
University of Pittsburgh, 2014

In the United States, archival institutions have prioritized the preservation of commercial
and Hollywood cinema overlooking small-scale media production by non-professionals and
independent media artists. Media arts centers, however, have played a pivotal role in the
continued access, use, and preservation of materials produced by the communities that they
serve. These non-profit media collectives were imagined as a distributed network of
organizations supporting the production, exhibition and study of media; serving as information
centers about media resources; and supporting regional preservation efforts. However, media
arts centers have remained over-looked and unexplored by the archival field. This dissertation
seeks to shift this balance, including these artist-run organizations as part of the network of
archives and collecting institutions preserving independent media.
Using case study methodologies this study investigated the practices at three media arts
centers, Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Paper Tiger Television, and the Termite Television Collective,
seeking to understand the role of these organizations in the collection and preservation of
independent media and the development of archival practices in non-profit media organizations.
The study places each of these organizations in the wider history of media arts center movement
in the United States and looks broadly at the development of archives and archival practices
within these organizations. Framing media arts centers as maker-spaces and archival spaces, this

iv

dissertation argues for a critique of professional archival practices and a redefinition of the
standards for preservation of audiovisual materials.

INTRODUCTION

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the growing availability of 16mm film and video
technology spurred production from amateur, independent, and underground filmmakers, and a
variety of other non-professional media creators. This growing sector of independent media
production worked in opposition to Hollywood, the dominant force of media creation. Amateurs
have had access to media technology from the advent of cinema, but the availability of a wider
variety of formats and the growing number of venues supporting the exhibition of noncommercial and non-professional work grew exponentially during this decade.
This burst of media production influenced the establishment of a network of media arts
centers across the country. These centers began as small, non-profit, artists-run organizations,
supporting the production of small-scale independent media. The media arts center movement
has been generally recognized from those writing from within the movement, but has not been
the subject of wider academic study. This dissertation investigates the history and development
of several media arts centers focusing on the various services and practices provided by these
institutions. In doing so, this dissertation identifies ways in which archival practice may benefit
from understanding the relationship of independent media creators to their media products and
moving image technology.

THE PRESERVATION OF INDEPENDENT MEDIA

The challenges of preserving independent media in the United States have been identified
in a series of reports published by the National Film Preservation Board and Hollywood’s major
lobbying arm, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. These reports, published
decades apart, illustrate many of the challenges that the motion picture industry and moving
image archivists share in preserving and providing continual access to audiovisual records.
The Library of Congress published the results of their initial investigation into moving
image preservation in 1993.

Film Preservation 1993: A Study of the Current State of Film

Preservation surveyed the growing field of moving image preservation in order to develop a plan
for preserving the nation’s film heritage. The second report, Television and Video Preservation
1997 further identified the issues specific to the preservation of videotape formats expanding the
preservation plan to include all analog formats of audiovisual media. 1
More recently, in response to the retooling of the motion picture industry from film to
digital video, the Science and Technology Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences published their survey of practices at major motion picture studios in 2007, titled The
Digital Dilemma. This initial report was followed by a second study published in 2012, The
Digital Dilemma 2: Perspectives from Independent Filmmakers, Documentarians, and Nonprofit
Audiovisual Archives, a publication that further investigates the issues specific to media

the preservation of independent media on some scale. However, while these reports suggest that
independent media is not being adequately preserved for a variety of reasons, they offer few
solutions.

1.1.1

Film Preservation 1993 and Television and Video Preservation 1997

The National Film Preservation Act of 1988 established The National Film Preservation
Board, an advisory board for the Librarian of Congress that is charged with developing and
implementing the national film preservation plan and selecting “culturally, historically or
aesthetically significant films” each year for the National Film Registry. 3 The 1993 and 1997
reports published by the Board coincide with the renewal of the National Film Preservation Act
in 1992 and 1996 and were drafted at a moment when moving image archiving was gaining
recognition, stimulating more research in the areas of film and video preservation. 4
Early film preservation efforts were directed toward the collection and preservation of
nitrate film, a chemically unstable film stock first used in the production of motion pictures. The
volatility of nitrate film and the spotty preservation efforts by film studios shaped early

preservation policies that prioritized the recovery of lost titles from the silent era. 5 Beginning in
1909, acetate based film stock, or “safety film,” was manufactured as an alternative for nitrate
film, but nitrate would continue to be used through the early 1950s. “Safety film” became the
standard for preservation of nitrate film; older titles were reformatted to new film stock in an
attempt to provide continued access to the work.
Similar to nitrate decay, acetate film suffers from “vinegar syndrome,” a progressive
deterioration of the film base. Over time, the film stock begins to shrink and warp, eventually
inhibiting playback of the medium. Color film also fades over time, leading to additional
preservation concerns. After decades of transferring nitrate-based film to acetate stock, by the
mid-1990s these preservation issues with acetate film were becoming evident to studios and
archives concerned with the preservation of moving images.
Film Preservation 1993 was a direct response to this new threat to the preservation of
motion picture media. Recognizing the disproportionate attention of the preservation community
on early cinema, the report suggests, “traditional preservation efforts directed largely toward the
Hollywood feature seem shortsighted,” and calls attention to the larger variety of motion pictures
deserving of preservation, such as “newsreels, documentaries, experimental or avant-garde films,

5

The most frequently cited statistic suggests that some 80% of cinema produced prior to 1928 has been lost.
Others estimate that 75% of all silent era footage has been lost along with approximately 50% of all films
produced before 1950. See, Anthony Slide, Nitrate Won’t Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States
(Jefferson, NC: MacFarland Classics, 2000), 9.

anthropological and regional films, advertising and corporate shorts, dance documentation, and
even amateur home movies, especially of ethnic groups invisible in mainstream media.” 6
Film Preservation 1993 also demonstrated the disproportionate allocation of funding
among the country’s major film archives. UCLA’s Film and Television Archive, the George
Eastman House, and the Museum of Modern Art received 86% of the funds available from the
federal government through the American Film Institute and the National Endowment for the
Arts from 1979 through 1992. 7 The majority of institutions surveyed for this study were large
archival institutions specializing in the preservation of moving image media; however, the report
does include a few significant moving image collections held in a number of museums and
historical societies across the country. 8
Independent filmmaking, including avant-garde and documentary film, is recognized as
an “at-risk” category of film production in this initial study.

While Hollywood studios were

beginning to take responsibility for the management of their own moving image assets through
the establishment of in-house archives and film libraries, the 1993 report acknowledges the lack
of preservation resources among independent producers working outside of these major
Hollywood studios. The lack of storage resources for independent filmmakers and the limited
distribution of independent productions are both listed as risks to the survival of these works
6

Melville and Simmon, Film Preservation 1993, chap. 1. This list reflects the types of moving images named by the
“orphans” movement. See chapter 2 of this proposal for further discussion. The chart “What Types of Films Are
Preserved with AFI-NEA Grants?” demonstrates the disproportionate nature of the funding for film preservation.
53% of funds available through the American Film Institute and National Endowment for the Arts from 1979-1992,
funded the preservation of silent era cinema (nitrate titles released before 1929). Independent features received
2% of the available funds with 7% of funding supporting the preservation of avant-garde works. Documentary
films received a larger proportion of the funding at 16%, however, it is unclear how films were placed in these
categories. Melville and Simmon, Film Preservation 1993, fig. 7.

Grants provided through the American Film Institute and the National Endowment for the Arts were the single
largest funding source for film preservation at this time. Melville and Simmon, Film Preservation 1993, fig. 6.

without active intervention by archival institutions. 9

Studio and stock footage libraries,

museums and archival institutions, and private collectors are suggested among the disparate sites
of preservation for moving image media.

However, “independent producers and distributors”

becomes a catch-all category, representing a variety of organizations and individuals producing
and collecting media. 10 Interestingly, media arts centers are specifically named along with other
artist-run organizations as sites for collection and distribution of media, but are not pursued
further as possible preservers of moving image collections. Film and the major sites of moving
image preservation are the central focus of this initial study.
Recognizing the limited focus of the 1993 report, Preservation 1997 establishes a
preservation plan for moving image assets recorded on videotape, including a more extensive
discussion related to the preservation of independent media. The report includes all of the
“major dimensions” of videotape production, including, “entertainment, nonfiction, news and
public affairs, public television, local television news, video art, and independent video.” 11
Videotape and television media are described separately from film-based media due to the
preservation concerns specific to magnetic media. Like film-based media, videotape requires
specific environmental storage to ensure the long-term preservation of the material.

smoving image formats also degrade over time, resulting in data loss and inhibiting playback. 12
With the larger number of video formats available, issues of obsolescence also put videotape
assets at greater risk. 13
Much like Film Preservation 1993, large network studios and archives are described as
major preservers of video while media arts centers are mentioned as possible sites of collection,
but not included in the larger study. However, unlike Film Preservation 1993, independent
video and video art are awarded their own chapter in the 1997 report. Again recognizing
independent media as an at-risk category, the limited resources of independent media producers
are described as the most significant challenge to preserving independent productions. While a
few archival institutions are listed among collectors of independent media, non-profit
distributors, media arts centers, libraries, community organizations, production units, college
audiovisual departments, as well as garages, attics, and closets, are also listed as places where
video collections may be found. 14
Preservation 1997 shifts the focus beyond preservation also arguing that access to media
has inhibited research in this area as “no comprehensive effort has been made to list, catalog or
document, let alone preserve this remarkable record of American history and culture.” The
report warns, “many media arts groups are unfamiliar with professional cataloging practices and

formats. Wheeler, Videotape Preservation Handbook, 22-23.

lack computers and training facilities, making the development of shared data fairly difficult.” 15
Access becomes central to the conversation of preservation, as the failure to catalog these
materials has allowed such collections to remain unrecognized by the preservation community.
Funding for the media arts is allocated for the production of media, but few of these small nonprofit media organizations have the resources to catalog and preserve their work. 16 Preservation
funding is limited to archival institutions, such as the larger moving image repositories cited in
the 1993 report, however few of these organizations had prioritized the collection and
preservation of video.
Both reports helped to increase awareness of moving image media preservation issues in
the United States and shift the preservation focus from nitrate collections to a wider variety of
media, including video productions and independent media. In the intervening years, this shift
can be traced through the ‘orphan film movement,’ which advocates for the preservation of all
forms of media, from art house cinema to home movies. 17 However, as digital production
technologies begin to replace the analog, the preservation community has voiced a new set of
concerns regarding the preservation of digital media.

1.1.2

The Digital Dilemma: 2007 and 2012

The first Digital Dilemma report, published in 2007, focuses on the digital asset
management issues of major Hollywood studios as they transition from analog to digital

15

Murphy, Television and Video Preservation 1997, chap. 5.
The 1997 report cites a Media Alliance grant application seeking funds to catalog video art that was twice
rejected by the National Endowment for the Arts. The report also suggests that none of the media arts
organizations have funding to preserve the media they create. Murphy, Television and Video Preservation 1997,
chap. 5.

production. The retooling of the motion picture industry poses a number of challenges for
studios managing their moving image assets. As Film Preservation 1993 illustrated, by the mid1990s studios had developed internal archives programs to manage the media they produced; the
retooling of the production process for new digital media formats also suggests a retooling for
these preservation programs.
No longer bound by the cost of celluloid film, the low cost of memory and storage space
affords media producers with opportunities to capture more moving image material during
production than analog counterparts. 18 Along with this increase in the amount of data produced,
the entire production workflow shifts as the digital files, rather than analog film, are
manipulated, transferred, and stored on a number of servers and machines. Digital formats have
now matched, and in some instances surpassed, the pictorial quality of film, but do not produce a
physical element – the standard on which moving image preservation has been defined.
While production and distribution are streamlined, eliminating the need to strike multiple
analog prints of each film, preservation and long-term storage now present a greater financial
liability for studios. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences estimates an annual cost
of $1,059 to store an analog archival master of a single title. The management and storage of a
4K digital master (the digital equivalent of an analog print) is estimated at $12,514 per year. 19
Unlike physical film elements that can be passively housed in cold storage for centuries, digital
files require active management to ensure preservation into the future.
The Digital Dilemma compares the information produced in the major motion picture
industry to the “big data” issues challenging the medical, earth science, government, corporate

business, and supercomputing sectors. The report recognizes that every sector is encountering
the same digital preservation challenges and that there is no single cost-effective, long-term,
digital preservation strategy that can be universally adopted in all situations. 20
Concerned with the assets of the larger motion picture industry, this report focuses on the
efforts of the corporate realm to preserve their assets, surveying the digital asset management
systems of large oil companies and large sectors of the United States government such as the
National Archives and Department of Defense. While the conclusions regarding digital storage
requirements and preservation strategies are universal to all types of digital management, the
reports fail to address the smaller scale solutions for organizations that do not have the resources
for this large-scale digital management.

Like Film Preservation 1993, the concerns of the

commercial film industry for the long-term management of commercial moving image assets are
prioritized in this report. This study upholds the unequal balance between the concerns of the
larger motion picture industry and small-scale production, seeking large scale solutions rather
than looking towards smaller institutions for possible insight.
These shortcomings were addressed in a second report, The Digital Dilemma 2:
Perspective from Independent Filmmakers, Documentarians and Nonprofit Audiovisual
Archives, published in early 2012. Partnering with the Library of Congress’s National Digital
Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP), the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences conducted a survey of independent filmmakers, producers, and distributors

20

between 2008 and 2011 to examine the preservation practices and concerns of both independent
media producers and non-profit archives. 21
The report suggests that of the 550 public moving image archives in the United States
and 310 moving image archives world-wide, none of these archives were cited as final
repositories for the independent media, with two exceptions: the UCLA Film and Television
Archive which works in partnership with the Sundance Institute and Outfest, two large exhibition
spaces for independent cinema. 22 Instead, other non-profit audiovisual archives are listed as
repositories of last resort, that is, if the work of independent filmmakers’ survives to donation.
Most independent filmmakers in this study reported that their major concerns were
distribution of their work and managing upcoming projects; preservation was thought to be a
concern for producers, production companies, and distributors, rather than the individual
filmmakers. 23 About half of those interviewed reported that they “sometimes” think about longterm preservation, and 8% reported they do not even consider the short-term preservation of their
work. 24 While the technological challenges to the preservation of independent media are the
same as they are for larger commercial productions, these media creators do not operate in the
same networks and have the same resources available to them.

21

The full list of participants is not yet available but will be published on the AMPAS website at sometime in the
future. The case studies developed from the report include a number of archives including the Archives of
Appalachia at East Tennessee State University, The Film and Media Archive at Washington University, the Walter
J. Brown Media Archives and Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and one non-archival nonprofit media institution, Franklin Furnace in Brooklyn, New York.

Much like Film Preservation 1993, “independent” in this report suggests “indie” films as defined by the indie film
movement in the 1990s. “Indie” films produced outside of the major Hollywood studios, but still represent large
productions. No Country for Old Men, Crash, Slumdog Millionaire, The Hurt Locker, and The King’s Speech are all
cited as “indie” productions recently recognized by the Academy Awards. Preservation 1997 remains the unique
outlier among these reports, specifically mentioning “community media” and other smaller independent media
productions.

Shared responsibility or a cooperative structure was suggested as one possible method for
systematically collecting and preserving independent media.

Preservation 1997 reached a

similar conclusion, suggesting that shared responsibility of archival resources would better
support the distributed nature of the independent film sector. The independent filmmakers
surveyed for this study favored this distributed preservation model, but the possibilities of
partnering with media arts centers as part of a preservation network was not explored; the report
does not look beyond recognized archives as possible sites of preservation for independent
film. 25
Taken as a set, these four studies illustrate the challenges of moving image archiving,
suggest a need for preservation education for moving image professionals and moving image
creators, and identify a need for greater financial support for the preservation of media in both
analog and digital formats.

These studies also demonstrate the issues of technological

obsolescence that plagues the preservation community.

The moving image industry is

constantly evolving, affording moving image producers with the ability to innovate and
communicate in new ways. Archivists are faced with the challenge of providing continued
access and managing these records into the future. The loss of moving image materials, whether
through purposeful destruction or due to the ephemeral nature of the physical media, has shaped
the field of moving image archiving. However, these reports do not look beyond the traditional
types of institutions responsible for the creation and preservation of moving images.
Preservation, as defined by large studios and moving image archives, remains the central tenet of
these reports. While the need for small-scale solutions is acknowledged, there is no attempt by

25

The report does recognize collections maintained outside of large moving image archives. Collections are
described at The Country Music Hall of Fame, the Hoover Institution, the Human Studies Film Archives of the
National Anthropological Archives at the Smithsonian, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Northeast Historic
Film, and Anthology Film Archives.

any of these studies to look beyond traditional venues of moving image collection and
preservation to understand the role of organizations outside of the studios, such as media arts
centers.

1.2

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AND THE INDEPENDENT FILMMAKING
COMMUNITY

Media arts centers were initially conceived as a network of organizations developed to
provide resources supporting independent media production. Sheldon Renan, former director of
the Pacific Film Archives, suggested this grassroots movement was initiated in 1969 in direct
response to the failure of the American Film Institute to establish “regional full-service film
centers” supporting the Institute’s national focus. 26 Renan imagined a distributed network of
film centers across the United States, serving, “film audiences; filmmakers; scholars from any
discipline needing to do research with film; teachers; industry (where the public good is
somehow involved); and public television.” 27 Each would support the production, exhibition and
study of media; serve as information centers about media resources; and work with the Library
of Congress to support regional preservation efforts.

26

Sheldon Renan, “The Concept of Regional Film Centers,” Sightlines 7, no. 3 (1973/1974): 7. Instead, the
American Film Institute (AFI) would support filmmaking on the national level. AFI served as a lobbyist for film
preservation, prioritizing the loss of Hollywood cinema discussed in Film Preservation 1993. The AFI’s policies and
funding priorities also helped to define film preservation in this country and the goals of film preservation efforts,
which focused on Hollywood as the cultural heritage of the nation. See also, Janna Jones, The Past is A Moving
Picture: Preserving the Twentieth Century on Film (Gainesville: University Press of Florida), 61-74.
27
Renan, “The Concept of Regional Film Centers”, 7.

13

Embracing Renan’s desires, a community of filmmakers and supporters of the media arts
organized a series of conferences in mid-1970s, providing a venue for independent filmmakers to
express their concerns regarding the development and support of independent media production
in the United States. The Independent Film Community was drafted at one of these conferences,
the Conference on the Regional Development of Film Centers and Services (or the “Mohonk
Conference”), organized by the Committee on Film and Television Resources and submitted to
the National Endowment for the Arts. 28 This initial conference was followed by a series of
eleven regional conferences, the “Major Media Center Conferences,” to review and approve the
final report that identified the needs of the independent film community in the United States.29
The final report identifies five areas of concern for the independent filmmakers: distribution,
funding, non-theatrical exhibition, film study, and preservation. Media literacy and education are
also named as high priorities for this growing community of media producers. 30
Many of the conclusions in this report foreshadow the conclusions reached in the studies
published by National Film Preservation Board and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences.

The Independent Filmmaking Community argues that independent filmmaking

networks are widely distributed and distinct from traditional production and have few resources
to support the production of media.

The authors call upon the federal government to prioritize

funding for independent media in order to allow for democratic access to media resources and to

28

The authors of the report chose the term “community” to describe independent filmmaking over “industry” due
to the distributed nature of independent film production and to contrast this network of filmmakers with the
Hollywood film industry. Peter Feinstein, ed., The Independent Film Community (New York: Committee on Film
and Television Resources and Services, 1977), v.
29
Pittsburgh Filmmakers hosted the first of these conferences in 1978 with the Carnegie Institute (the Carnegie
Museum of Art). Other sites for regional conferences included the American Film Institute, Pacific Film Archive,
Rocky Mountain Film Center, the Walker Art Center, and WGBH-TV Boston. This series of conferences was just
one of the many that would lead to the development of NAMAC, the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture,
first known as the National Alliance of Media Arts Centers. See, Feinstein, The Independent Film Community, 97.

14

support the development of a larger network of resources for this growing community.
Interestingly, along with access to the tools of media production, preservation is also named as
one of the top priorities. 31 While the fragility of the medium is cited as one of the primary
concerns regarding the longevity of film and video media, the report suggests that “avantgarde
filmmakers need to be educated about the realities of preservation,” and further that the
economics of independent filmmaking and the lack of a systematic method for collecting such
works were also growing concerns for preserving the material for posterity. 32
Film Preservation 1993 specifically mentions media centers as sites storing the work of
independent filmmakers. The Digital Dilemma 2 also mentions the role of media cooperatives
and artist-run organizations emerging in the late 1960s and early 1970s in preserving the works
of independent artists, but does not specifically address media arts centers. As a network, media
arts centers fulfill all of these functions: funding, preservation, distribution, exhibition, and
study. 33 Drafted by the preservation community, the reports published by the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the National Film Preservation Board focus solely on
preservation, only one of the many services provided by media arts centers. As a result, these
sites are passed-over and not explored. This dissertation seeks to shift this balance, including
these artist-run organizations as part of the network of archives and collecting institutions
preserving independent media.

31

In his 1978 review of the regional conference Robert Haller, then director of Pittsburgh Filmmakers, places
preservation at the top of the list of topics addressed above other technological issues, including: publication and
scholarship, exhibition and distribution, and advocacy. Robert A. Haller, “The Pittsburgh Regional and Major
Media Conference,” Field of Vision 4 (Fall 1978): 23.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. What can the history and development of three differing media arts centers – Pittsburgh
Filmmakers, Paper Tiger Television, and Termite Television Collective – reveal about the
role of media arts centers in the collection and preservation of independent media and the
development of archival practices in non-profit media organizations?
2. How can the identified practices impact the future management of media collections in
archival organizations?

1.4

WHAT ARE MEDIA ARTS CENTERS?

Media arts centers are non-profit entities that often operate under a membership or
cooperative model supporting media creators who are producing media outside of commercial
production outlets such as television and film studios. The centers promote access to media
technology, provide educational opportunities for artists and non-specialists, and serve as an
outlet for the circulation and dissemination of these materials. As this study investigates the
development of these media organizations as part of a distinct movement, the term will serve as a
designator referring specifically to institutions that are organizational members of the National
Association of Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC) that support the production, preservation,
distribution, exhibition, and study of media.
Media arts refers to all media products, either digital or analog, created using film or
video media. This term includes “art that is produced using or combining film, video, and
computers,” and “a diverse array of artistic work that includes narrative, documentary, and
16

experimental films; videos and digital products; and installation art using media.” 34 For the
purposes of this study, this distinction is important. The moving image preservation movement
in the United States has been defined by the preservation of the film object, pushing these
broader types of media products to the margins of the field. By encompassing all moving image
media, analog and digital, this term places less emphasis on the specific technologies (film or
video) used to produce individual media products and provides a means for generally describing
the issues faced in the management of audiovisual materials.
Independent typically delineates media produced outside of mainstream media outlets.
The term is typically associated with “indie” films (a term coined during the boom of
independent cinema in the 1990s), which designates films produced in studios outside of
mainstream Hollywood; however, “indie” studios and production houses can represent media
conglomerates as large as their Hollywood counterparts. 35
Film critics and scholars have also defined independent media according to their
aesthetics, suggesting that independent productions prescribe to certain visual and thematic
codes. 36 However, the term originates to the underground film movement of the 1960s. Sheldon
Renan, founder of the Pacific Film Archive, combines both the aesthetic and economic
definitions, suggesting that an underground film is “personal statement” that “dissents radically
in form, or in technique, or in content, or perhaps in all three.” Such films are produced with

34

Kevin F. McCarthy and Elizabeth Heneghan Ondaatje, From Celluloid to Cyberspace: The Media Arts and the
Changing Arts World (Pittsburgh: RAND, 2002), vii.
35
George Lucas’s Lucasfilms and the Weinstein’s Mirimax Films are examples of these large independent studios
associated with “indie” productions.
36
See for example, Yannis Tzioumakis, American Independent Cinema: An Introduction (Edinburgh: Edinburgh
University Press, 2006); Emanuel Levy, Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of Independent Film (New York: New York
University Press, 1999).

17

minimal financial resources and are distributed outside of the mainstream commercial outlets. 37
The term also suggests that the individual creator maintains ownership and complete creative
control over the work. 38
This study will use the definition proposed by the National Alliance for Media Arts and
Culture (NAMAC):
video and film conceived and produced independently of the traditional corporate
sponsors for media and made for a wide range of purposes beyond purely
commercial considerations. The work may be personal essays, documentaries,
media or video art, feature-style narratives, or combinations of them. 39
This definition not only includes a variety of recognized modes of production, but also
encompasses other types of non-commercial media, including alternative, radical, and
community media.

Media arts centers serve what can be described as “independent media

artists,” filmmakers and video creators working outside the realm of traditional sites of
production such as film and television studios that maintain creative and intellectual control over
their works. The broad range of services provided by media arts centers allow these independent
media producers to maintain this control over the works they create.

refers to audiovisual work over which the producer not only maintains complete creative and editorial control
during the production, but also post-production copyright ownership.” See, Michele L. Wozny, “National
Audiovisual Preservation Initiatives and the Independent Media Arts in Canada,” Archivaria 67 (Spring 2009): 88.

SITES OF STUDY

Three media arts centers have been identified as the subjects of this study. These
centers are non-profit, membership driven organizations that support the production, distribution,
and preservation of media.

The similarities among the functions of each institution provide

points of comparison, while the age of each organization and the media production technologies
available at the time of their incorporation provide areas of contrast.
By selecting cases that have been established over the last forty years, these
centers represent a diversity of organizational structures, programming, support functions, and
technological concerns. Each of these organizations has recently celebrated an anniversary of
their founding and has been established long enough to begin to look at their practices through a
historical lens.

Through studying this series of media centers established over successive

decades, the project can help to demonstrate how these organizations have grown and adapted to
successive changes in media technology while also providing a broader historical overview of
the media arts movement in this country.

1.5.1

Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Inc.

Pittsburgh Filmmakers (est. 1971) is a nonprofit corporation designed to encourage the creation
and understanding of media for noncommercial artistic and literary purposes. To this end,
Filmmakers offers a curriculum of courses in film, video, and photography to university and
independent students in the Pittsburgh region. Filmmakers also exhibits the work of prominent
photographers and filmmakers in its two galleries, Melwood Screening Room, Regent Square
Theater and Harris Theater. A key component of Filmmakers’ mission is to provide equipment
access and funding for independent media artists. 40
Former director of Pittsburgh Filmmakers Robert Haller described Pittsburgh as the
“third city” of independent filmmaking during the 1970s. 41 Established in 1971, Pittsburgh
Filmmakers began as a filmmakers’ co-op providing access to equipment for local filmmakers
and exhibition space for visiting artists, while serving as a hub for independent film production
outside of the filmmaking centers of San Francisco and New York City. Haller suggests that a
combination of “institutional, geographic, financial, and personal factors were responsible for
making the city a catalyst and a player in the national and international community of what had
earlier been called experimental or underground film.” 42 While the media arts center played an
important role in the local and national film community, Pittsburgh Filmmakers also emerged as
a pivotal player in the emerging media arts center movement. 43
Now in its forty-first year, Pittsburgh Filmmakers manages the operation of three
theaters, offers for-credit and non-credit courses in media production, and continues to provide

access to film and video equipment and gallery space for members and local artists. Established
in the early 2000s, the Pittsburgh Filmmakers Library supports film and media research with a
highly specialized collection of monographs, journals, videos, and other media resources. While
the organization does not have a formal archives program, Pittsburgh Filmmakers also serves as
custodian of two significant archival film collections including 30,000 feet of footage from
Pittsburgh, a film commissioned for the city’s bicentennial in 1958, and the films of
underground filmmaker, George Semsel. 44
Both collections have found their way to Pittsburgh Filmmakers almost by accident.
Pittsburgh was ultimately deemed a failure by the bicentennial committee that commissioned the
production of the film in 1959. For decades, twenty drums of original camera negatives, trims,
work-prints, and outtakes were transferred between several storage locations, only to be donated
to Pittsburgh Filmmakers in 1979 before the annual Three Rivers Film Festival. 45 A video
transfer of the film was created and screened at the festival, drawing renewed interest in the film.
Since this transfer of custody in 1979, the film and original elements have been stored at
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, even though the organization does not have an official archives program
and does not have the facilities to provide proper storage for the film elements according to

44

Pittsburgh is listed in Rick Prelinger’s Field Guide to Sponsored Films, a catalog of “historically significant, but
neglected titles,” complied in 2006 with the support of the National Film Preservation Foundation. See, Rick
Prelinger, The Field Guide to Sponsored Films (San Francisco: National Film Preservation Foundation, 2006), 74.

City of Tomorrow,” Moving Image 12, no. 2 (Fall 2012): 70-94.
45
The film materials were originally stored in a New York city warehouse, then at the Selma Burke Arts Center in
Pittsburgh, and finally in the garage of Ted Hazlett, former president of the A. W. Mellon Educational and
Charitable Trust. The Bicentennial Association retained custody of a 16mm print of the completed film until it
disbanded in 1960. This print was also placed in Hazlett’s custody. See, Ed Blank, “Festival Screens $150,000
Curiosity,” Pittsburgh Press (June 10, 1979).

archival standards. 46 Pittsburgh Filmmakers received funding to transfer the film to digital video
as part of the city’s 250th anniversary in 2008. The film was re-screened as the Pittsburgh
Reframed (at 250) that included a series of two minute and fifty second shorts created by several
Pittsburgh artists that included some aspect of the original footage from Pittsburgh. 47
In 2003 filmmaker George Semsel, Professor Emeritus in the School of Film at Ohio
State University, donated his collection of 16mm films to Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

This

collection represents his work from the early 1960s through the late 1990s. In a 2009 interview,
Dr. Semsel expressed his reasons for donating the collection to Pittsburgh Filmmakers,
explaining that the work of the filmmakers he associated with has been lost and that the current
network of archival institutions has insufficiently documented independent filmmaking. His
hope was that his donation would inspire Pittsburgh Filmmakers to develop an archival program
to support a larger documentation effort within the independent filmmaking community. 48
While these collections have not inspired the creation of an official archives program,
Pittsburgh Filmmakers is serving as an archive of last resort and as such is performing a
preservation function for the community of filmmakers that the organization supports.

The

organization’s interest in the entire life-cycle of media, its involvement in the foundations of the
media arts center movement, and its continued operation under the traditional media arts center
model have made Pittsburgh Filmmakers an ideal subject for this study.

46

In 1979 the film was already beginning to show signs of physical decay. The Pittsburgh Press article states,
“because its color has faded with age, the movie looks as if it has been filmed through a red filter.” The elements
are currently stored at room temperature at the Pittsburgh Filmmakers facilities. The ISO recommendation for
the storage of film elements exhibiting these signs of deterioration is 32°F at 30 to 50% relative humidity. See,
Adelstein, IPI Media Storage Quick Reference.

Paper Tiger Television Collective

Paper Tiger Television (PTTV) is an open, non-profit, volunteer video collective. Through the
production and distribution of our public access series, media literacy/video production
workshops, community screenings and grassroots advocacy PTTV works to challenge and
expose the corporate control of mainstream media. PTTV believes that increasing public
awareness of the negative influence of mass media and involving people in the process of making
media is mandatory for our long-term goal of information equity. 49
Paper Tiger Television (PTTV) has its roots in the public access television movement.
The collective was founded in 1981 as a live public access television program produced by a
small number of dedicated volunteers. Each week the show offered a critical reading of a
specific publication such as the U.S. News and World Report, using media to critique media.
One of the original “tigers,” DeeDee Hallek explains the media literacy aims of the
programming, “by going over a publication in detail,” she suggests, and “by examining how it is
enmeshed in the transnational corporate world and by pointing out exactly how and why certain
information appears, a good critical reading can invert the media so that they work against
themselves.” 50 PTTV’s programming has expanded beyond this weekly critique to a variety of
alternative programming broadcast on public access channels in Manhattan and Brooklyn,
available through video distribution channels, and published on the Internet.
The non-profit media collective produces and distributes media and serves as a grassroots
community advocate, working in opposition to mainstream media. The collective “believes that
increasing public awareness of the negative influence of mass media and involving people in the

process of making media is mandatory for our long-term goal of information equity” and
supports a number of community programming initiatives that focus on media education and
literacy. 51
The collective also maintains a significant archives that supports the production and
distribution of PTTV media. Included in Footage 89, a catalog of media holdings from a variety
of moving image repositories in North America, PTTV is described as a videotape archives and
distributor. 52 The 1989 publication lists a collection of 150 videotapes produced by the media
center. These include ¾-inch videotape masters and VHS viewing copies that are available to
the public by appointment. Footage 89 also suggests that the organization has intellectual
control of its holdings with a card catalog, published catalog, and a computer catalog for staff
use. 53 PTTV currently maintains a collection of over 330 titles spanning the entire history of the
organization. A smaller collection of videos are also available online.
In 2010, PPTV donated its archive, including the master videotapes from thirty years of
production to the Fales Library & Special Collections at New York University. As the master
videotapes donated to Fales have not been processed and remain inaccessible, PTTV continues
to list the “archives project” among a number of other media projects currently being undertaken
by the collective. The project includes the preservation of the duplicate videotapes of PTTV’s

51

Paper Tiger Television, “Mission,” http://papertiger.org/mission.
The catalog was complied with the assistance of Rick Prelinger, a collector and advocate for industrial film
preservation. The 1989 publication and 1991 supplement were an attempt to create a union catalog of moving
image holdings in a variety of repositories across North America. Any institution and organization collecting
moving images were considered for the study, not just those serving as recognized moving image archives. By
1991, when the updated supplement was published, PTTV’s archives had grown to almost 200 titles and over 400
individual videotapes. See, Richard Prelinger and Celeste R. Hoffnar, eds., Footage 89: North American Film and
Video Sources (New York: Prelinger Associates, 1989); Richard Prelinger, ed., Footage 91: North American Film and

programming which remain in their offices, as well as related documentation, artifacts, and
ephemera. This project aims to organize, physically preserve, and catalog the materials related
to these collections. The archives “reflect the work of many prominent media scholars, activists,
cultural critics, and artists of the last 25 years, but also that of activists from social justice
movements whose struggle might otherwise have gone undocumented.” PTTV understands this
project as an important step in not only documenting the history of the organizations, but also the
larger history of the public access television movement, video art, media advocacy, visual
literacy initiatives, and video activism. 54
Much like Pittsburgh Filmmakers, PTTV provides a variety of services related to the
production, distribution, and preservation of media. With its focus on media activism and
broadcast television, rather than the production of media as individual artistic products, PTTV
provides another perspective on the development of media arts centers.

The youngest of the three media arts centers selected for this study, the Termite
Television Collective (Termite TV) was founded in 1992 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by a
small group of MFA students from Temple University that shared a desire to use television as a
medium to critique mainstream media productions. The collective began with a weekly halfhour timeslot on Drexel University’s television station DUTV, and has continued to provide
media programming through public access television and online through the collective’s website
over the last twenty years. 56 Similar to Paper Tiger Television, the mission of Termite TV is “to
produce, distribute and facilitate the creation of experimental and activist media that challenges
the status quo and provides an alternative to corporate media.” 57 The collective’s name was
inspired by a quote from film critic Manny Farber who observed, “a peculiar fact about termitetapeworm-fungus-moss art is that it goes always forward eating its own boundaries, and likely as
not, leaves nothing in its path other than the signs of eager, industrious, unkempt activity.”58
Like Pittsburgh Filmmakers, the organization also hosts a variety of educational initiatives
including a partnership with Temple University’s MFA program and a series of community
media literacy workshops. 59 However, unlike the other two media centers selected for this study,
the majority of Termite TV’s work is broadcast electronically on the organization’s website. 60

The community initiative, “Messages in Motion,” partners with a variety of community groups providing
instruction on media production. Participants create short “video postcards” to educate others about social issues
in their communities. The workshops are conducted on-site at a variety of community centers. Termite TV
provides instructors and media technology in a blue van that travels from community to community much like a
bookmobile combining community media, social activism, and media literacy from a single source. See, Termite

Anula Shetty, co-director of Termite TV, describes the organization as a “media collective” suggesting a shift
from television broadcast media.
57

26

Similar to Pittsburgh Filmmakers, the collective does not have an official archives
program. Instead, the organization understands their website as a “self-archiving” effort. 61 Over
40 programs dating from 1992 to present are currently available through termite.org. 62 In
addition to broadcasting online, the collective produces a variety of media programs broadcasted
nationally through public television networks and included in festival and museum screenings.
Several ongoing projects illustrate the services offered by the collective and the organization’s
attempts to provide continued access to their media productions.
“Life Stories,” a project aimed at curating and “ever-growing collection” of 5-minute life
stories, began as the “Living Documentary” project, a cross-country bus trip with Termite TV
members collaborating with local media artists and residents to produce a constantly evolving
documentary of life across the United States. Originally broadcast as part of the collective’s
regular programming, the project has now expanded into a digital database of videos. 63 While
the database is still in the early stages of development, the videos can be accessed
chronologically through a series of thumbnail images or through text-based links that include
transcriptions of the videos. Eventually the videos will also be geographically organized though
a Google Maps tool. 64

In addition to the geographic representation of the collection, the

collective also desires to build a function that allows anyone to upload a 5-minute life story. The
“Life Stories” project represents just one attempt by the collective to create, collect, and provide
continued access to the work created by Termite TV.

“Walk Philly,” an interactive video walking tour of Philadelphia, includes historical and
archival material as well as artist generated videos, representing a different type of archival
involvement by the collective. Described as a “walking museum,” video tours are led by local
artists, historians, performers, and other community members, providing “a personal
interpretation evoking histories, moods and memories.” 65 The multi-media productions can be
downloaded to a variety of portable devices including smartphones and iPods. These immersive
tours juxtapose images and sounds from the past with the present landscape as tourists move
through city.

Both documenting and historicizing Philadelphia, this project represents a

participatory, location-based archive of sorts – part documentary, part oral history, and part
community archive.
Termite TV rounds out the cases selected for this study representing the most recent
decades of the media arts center movement.

While sharing similarities with Paper Tiger

Television, which may be indicative of what media arts centers have become, the collective’s
educational and media literacy initiatives provide points of comparison with Pittsburgh
Filmmakers. The collective’s desire to build an online archive of materials presents additional
points of contrast with the physical archives (both formal and informal) established by the other
two organizations.

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AS MISSED OPPORTUNITIES

Independent media presents specific challenges for archivists. Moving image creators do
not see a responsibility to preserve their work, but they also express a desire to have their work
preserved. These concerns have been expressed in a series of reports generated by the producers
and preservers of media over the past thirty-five years. The discussion of independent video art
in Preservation 1997 concludes:
The needs of the independent media arts community merit an on-going task force
devoted to preservation and access issues, a task force linking the expertise of
local groups with that of nationally recognized centers for video preservation.
One place to begin is to conduct a nationwide survey to determine where and how
these collections are stored and whether collaborative strategies are possible. In
addition it is necessary to conserve, catalog, and bring these works to the attention
of a wider public and to scholars and educators. 66
In the fifteen years since the publication of this report, no such taskforce has been
assembled, and the expertise of local groups such as media arts centers have not been explored.
This study represents one step towards recognizing the efforts of media arts centers in the
preservation of media and to further explore how they manage their assets.
As organizations that support a full range of activities related to the production and
distribution of media, media arts centers are a missed opportunity for archivists. Through
studying the way in which these media centers collect and preserve, represent and provide access
to their collections, and support the production of media through training media creators, this

in which these centers have adapted to changing technologies over-time and managed their
media collections.

LITERATURE REVIEW

The moving image archives literature has acknowledged the challenges of preserving
media produced outside of mainstream commercial venues, as evidenced in the reports from the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the National Film Preservation Board. Media
arts centers are one of many sites in which independent media is created, accessed, and collected,
but as these centers prioritize the production of media material, they have not been recognized by
the archival community as sites of collection and preservation. More significantly, while the
‘media arts movement’ has been generally recognized by those working within the movement,
little scholarship directly addresses the development of the organizations that emerged from this
movement. With their concern for media education, production, distribution, exhibition, and
collection, media arts centers can be placed at the intersections of several related areas of
scholarship, which provide some context for understanding these non-profit media organizations.

2.1

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AND INDEPENDENT MEDIA

While reports such as The Independent Filmmaking Community provide a glimpse into
the ambitions of the media arts center movement, little academic writing has focused on the
nature and development of these media organizations. Beginning in the 1960s and 70s, avantgarde and underground filmmakers are cited as the first independent media artists. Video and
31

television supported the following decades of media creation, while digital technologies and new
media dominate the most recent wave of media production. 67

The development of media

technology has no doubt influenced the context of production, however the literature follows a
technologically deterministic narrative rather than exploring the other influences on media
production such as the organization structures that supported it.
In a 2002 report describing the impact of digital process on the media arts sector, the
literature related to the media arts is described as “more likely to focus on individual media arts
disciplines, such as documentaries or Internet art, than on the media arts as a distinctive genre,”
while

“emphasizing the artistic and aesthetic aspects of the media arts rather than their

organizational characteristics.“ 68 P. Adams Sitney’s seminal work on the American avant-garde
Visionary Film, exemplifies this literature. Focusing specifically on film as a medium, Sitney’s
historical work highlights individual filmmakers providing a close reading of specific films as
examples of the avant-garde genre as it developed in the United States. 69 Volumes dedicated to
experimental, documentary, and underground film similarly describe the aesthetic conventions of
these different modes of production while describing each film as the personal product of a
single artist, rather than addressing the network of organizations that filmmakers relied on for
equipment, distribution, and funding. 70 This focus on the individual artist is common across the

film studies literature and is reflective of the way in which these films were defined as personal
statements of an individual craftsperson or auteur.
Similarly, the literature related to video art suggests work in this medium is a distinct art
form with its own aesthetic concerns and a history that runs parallel, but separate from the
production of film related media. Here, the advances in video technology are emphasized as new
technologies open new opportunities for artists to create of individual works and broadcast their
productions to a wider audience. 71 The development of video and film technology also serves
as the foundation for the discussions of digital media art and new media; however, this literature
emphasizes individual works, artists, and aesthetic movements within the medium, rather than
the organizations that support the production and distribution of such works. 72
Beyond this focus on the media art object, the 2002 report continues, “there are few
systematic empirical data on such features of media arts as the size and characteristics of their
audiences, the employment and background characteristics of media artists, and the number and
features of organizations that produce, distribute, and fund the media arts.” 73 The National
Alliance for Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC) provides a few sources of empirical data about
the media arts sector and the organizations that support it through their “Mapping the Field
Project,” a longitudinal survey initiated in 2010. 74

Along with the organizational members of

NAMAC, the survey targeted members of five major media arts organizations: the Alliance of

National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors, and the National Federation
of Community Broadcasters. The survey collected data related to organizational structure, media
focus, services offered, staff demographics, funding and revenue sources, and membership data
from responding organizations. However, the survey takes a sweeping view of the media arts
sector, including a variety of organizations that support the media arts, not media arts centers
specifically.
Outside the work of NAMAC, film historian Scott MacDonald has attempted to fill this
gap in the literature with a series of volumes historicizing several artist-run organizations that
supported the production and exhibition of independent media in the United States – film
distributor Canyon Cinema, and cinema societies, Cinema 16 and Art in Cinema. 75

Each

monograph begins with a brief history of the organization, followed by an edited “sampling” of
interview transcripts, personal letters, programming notes, as well as materials previously
published in newspapers and trade journals, selected by the author from personal and
organizational collections. With little published research to build on and few archives holding
the primary source materials, MacDonald creates his own archives in an attempt to influence
future study of the material, “provid[ing] a lure toward a remarkable moment in the institutional

75

See, Scott MacDonald, Cinema 16: Documents Toward a History of the Film Society (Philadelphia: Temple
University Press, 2002); Scott MacDonald, Art in Cinema: Documents Towards a History of the Film Society
(Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2006); Scott MacDonald, Canyon Cinema: The Life and Times of an
Independent Film Distributor (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2008).
As a film distributor, Canyon Cinema’s primary function is the promotion and distribution of individual films.
Cinema societies like Cinema 16 and Art in Cinema relied on distributors like Canyon to provide titles for their
screenings. These societies ranged in size and scale and could be found in organizations as large as the United
Nations and as small as local public libraries. Dedicated to the appreciation of cinema in all its forms, cinema
societies sought to educate general audiences about media produced outside of Hollywood. For further
description of these organizations see, Ciecile Starr, ed., Film Society Primer (Forest Hills, NY: American
Federation of Film Societies, 1956).

history of independent film.” 76

MacDonald’s works represent one of the few attempts to

historicize institutions that supported independent media practices throughout the 1960s and 70s,
but they are specific to each organization, providing little connection to the wider media
landscape.
A smaller body of literature focuses less on the development of specific organizations,
and instead describes attempts to build audiences for independent media. Barbara Wilinsky
explores the development of “art house cinema” in her Sure Seaters. This brief history describes
the development of alternative venues for foreign and avant-garde works. The screening venues
were “often small theaters in urban areas or university towns that screened ‘offbeat’ films such
as independent Hollywood, foreign language, and documentary films.” 77 Wilinsky includes
cinema societies such as Art in Cinema and Cinema 16 as well as the Museum of Modern Art’s
Film Program and screenings at universities across the country, describing the growing audience
for this particular mode of exhibition that supported and legitimized the study of film as an art
form.
Film historian Anthony Slide provides a foil for Wilinsky’s history focusing instead on
the “non-theatrical” film, or educational and industrial films. Slide’s history describes the
businesses and production houses that specialized in education and industrial films for
circulation in non-commercial venues such as schools, churches, and classrooms. 78 His study
relies on trade journals, Educational Screen, Business Screen Magazine, Film News, Sightlines,

and Film Library Quarterly, suggesting the lack of primary sources related to these alternative
sites of production.
Both Wilinsky and Slide describe alternative sites of film production and distribution,
targeting audiences outside of mainstream cinema viewership.

There is less focus here on

individual works and artists, but each addresses only one sector of film production and
distribution. While these histories represent a small but growing interest in alternative sites of
production and distribution, media arts centers are not directly addressed in either of the
histories.
The final and perhaps most abundant source of literature related to media arts and media
arts centers is described as “fugitive,” that is, “scattered across a wide array of sources including
newspapers, magazines, academic journals, exhibition catalogues, and online sites that are
difficult to find using standard bibliographic sources.” 79

A variety of trade journals and

publications contain pieces of the history of the media arts movement, but these often brief
articles focus on specific organizations or projects, rarely connecting to the wider media arts
movement. Such articles are often generated by those who are closely involved with media arts
centers.

Lucy Fischer and Bill Judson, Pittsburgh film educators with ties to Pittsburgh

Filmmakers, provide a brief history of the organization’s founding as an artist co-op and cinema
society in the early 1970s in “Independent Film in Pittsburgh.” 80 The authors connect Pittsburgh
Filmmakers to other organizations in the area, such as the Carnegie Museum of Art, but not to
the wider media arts community. More recently, Robert Haller, former director of Pittsburgh
Filmmakers, published his history of the organization’s influence on the avant-garde film

movement, drawing from collections held at the Anthology Film Archives and his personal
recollections. 81 Much like Fischer and Judson, Haller describes the local connections between
the media center and other Pittsburgh organizations concerned with film production and
exhibition, but Haller’s descriptions of visiting artists provide the only link to the larger media
arts community. Media educator and co-founder of Paper Tiger Television, DeeDee Halleck
provides a similar institutional history in her Hand Held Visions, a collection of her essays,
presentations, lectures, and other published and unpublished works. The works by these authors
represent personal reflections, not supported by rigorous research or documentation. 82 They also
fail to provide an understanding of the inner workings of the organizations or their function in
the wider network of media centers.
A smaller body of literature generated during the late 1970s and early 198os describes the
conferences and reports emerging from the developing media arts movement that culminated in

81

82
Similar examples can be found throughout a number of journals focusing on specific organizations. A number
of articles highlighting the work of Appalshop, a media center in Whitesburg, Kentucky serve as example of the
scattered nature of material related to specific media centers. Herb Smith and Helen Lewis, Appalshop members
are interviewed about their involvement with the organization in Jim Wayne Miller, “Appalshop and the History of
Appalachia,” Appalachian Journal (Summer 1984): 410-427. The founding of the organization is reviewed in,

“Survival and Resistance: Appalshop’s First 40 Years,” NAMAC Idea Exchange (blog), National Alliance of Media
Arts and Culture, December, 19 December 2008, http://www.namac.org/node/6630. Other articles address the
media produced at the centers, such as, Jane M. Gaines, “Appalshop Documentaries Inventing and Preserving
Appalachia,” Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media 34 (March 1989): 53-63; Andrew Horton, “Film from
Appalshop: Documentary Film-Makers in the Appalachians,” Film Quarterly 33, no. 4 (Summer, 1980): 11-14.
“Fugitive” websites such as the Experimental Television Center’s “Video History Project,” also provide some
insight into the development of media arts centers. The site serves as a bibliography of sources providing a
chronology of reports, conferences, and legislation related to video and media arts. See, Experimental Television
Center, “Video History Project,” last modified 2011, http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org.

the incorporation of NAMAC in 1980. 83 In his discussion of non-profit media organizations,
film scholar J. Ronald Green suggests that these types of media organizations had been neglected
by film scholarship and overshadowed by commercial film production. 84 His article, “Film and
Not-For-Profit Media Institutions,” presents an institutional model of the media-culture system
that includes media arts centers, here described as “regional media centers.” 85 Green’s system
describes a series of functions that support the growing independent media sector: funding,
production, preservation, distribution, exhibition, and study.

The organizations represented in

this system vary from large institutions now recognized by the moving image archives
community as significant players in the field such as the Film Library at the Museum of Modern
Art and Pacific Film Archive, to small regional media centers like Pittsburgh Filmmakers. Each
institution may provide a range of the functions identified by Green. Pittsburgh Filmmakers is
described as a “paradigm case history” encompassing all functions, including preservation,
which is defined as “ensuring that works are not lost and are accessible for the future.” 86

83

Many of the articles related to these NAMAC and media arts centers in these formative years call for the
incorporation of media arts organizations and argue for changes in policy at the national level. Others are brief
reports on related conferences. See, Sheldon Renan, “The Concept of Regional Film Centers,” Sightlines 7, no 3
(1973/1974): 7-9; Robert. A. Haller, “The Pittsburgh Regional and Major Media Conference,” Field of Vision 4 (Fall
1978): 23-24; Wanda Bershen, “Notes from Minnewaska: On Independence,” Field of Vision 7 (Summer 1979): 2-8;

Cultural Economics 8, no. 1 (1984): 61-79; J. Ronald Green, “Broader Alliances: Focusing on the Field,” Cinema
Journal 24, no. 4 (Summer 1985): 15-58.
84
Like Haller and Halleck, Green also writes from within the movement, serving as president of NAMAC from
1982-1985. Much of his work describes NAMAC’s agenda, describing an idealized version of media centers or
lobbying for the creation and support of these institutions. See, J. Ronald Green, “Film and Video: An Institutional
Paradigm and Some Issues of National Policy,” Journal of Cultural Economics 8, no. 1 (1984): 61-79; J. Ronald

With their focus on the other aspects of production and distribution, this preservation role
of media centers has gone unrecognized by the archives community.

Interestingly,

organizations such as the Museum of Modern Art and the Pacific Film Archive are well known
in the moving image archives field, celebrated for their work to promote the preservation and
study of film; but, the role of such organizations in the production of media has been deemphasized in the archival literature. 87 These two types of organizations, media arts centers and
film archives, remain separate and unequal. Preservation becomes the defining characteristic of
a film archive, leaving media centers outside of the scope of the archival practice.

2.2

MOVING IMAGE ARCHIVES AND THE ORPHAN FILM MOVEMENT

The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is understood as one of the largest and most
influential moving image archives in the United States. Founded in 1935, the institution played a
key role in the formation of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) in 1938.
MoMA joined the British Film Institute, the Cinématheque Française, and Germany’s
Reichfilmarchiv to form this international organizing body for moving image archives. 88 In the
early years, these founding institutions worked to elevate the study of film as art and functioned
on the cinématheque model, that is prioritizing access and exhibition of moving images over

87

Interestingly, a number of recognized moving archives are listed among media arts centers. See Renan, “The
Concept of Regional Film Centers,” 7-9; Feinstein, The Independent Film Community.

Press, 2003), 9-22.

39

preservation. Preservation was an incidental function to providing access – in order to show
films, one must collect them.
Early histories of the development of moving image archives emphasize the role of these
institutions in the development and legitimization of moving image archives, along with the role
of the personalities and collectors who advocated for developing the moving image collections at
each of these institutions. 89

Iris Barry, Henri Langlois, and Ernest Lindgren serve as

representatives of their respective institutions, shaping collecting policies according to their
individual tastes, preferences, and personalities. Penelope Houston’s Keepers of the Frame
exemplifies these histories, chronicling the development of these large institutions and the efforts
of their founders to celebrate the cinematic art form. Published in 1994, the history coincides
with the development and professionalization of the moving image archives field, providing a
background for a budding profession. 90

89

See for example: Anthony Slide, Nitrate Won’t Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States
(Jefferson, NC: McFarland Classics, 1992); Ivan Butler, To Encourage the Art of Film: The Story of the British Film
Institute (London, Robert Hale, 1971); and Richard Roud, A Passion For Films: Henri Langlois and the
Cinemathéque Française (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999).
90
Penelope Houston, Keepers of the Frame: The Film Archives (London: British Film Institute, 1994). Houston
suggests, “film archivists belong to a young profession.” Along with the reports from the Library of Congress
investigating moving image preservation in the United States, the 1990s represented a decade of professional
growth for moving image archivists. The Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) was officially
incorporated in 1991 as the first professional organizations for individuals. Membership in FIAF is limited to
organizations involved in film preservation. FIAF would ratify its first code of ethics for archival practice in 1998.
Moving image archivist, Ray Edmondson, and others, began to codify the practice of moving image archiving in
the late 1990s, including Audiovisual Archiving: Philosophy and Principles first published in 1998 and revised in
2004. See, Ray Edmondson, “Is Film Archiving A Profession?,” Film History 7 (1995): 245-255; Ray Edmondson,
“The Building Blocks of Film Archiving,” Journal of Film Preservation 50 (March 1995): 55-58; Ray Edmondson,
Audiovisual Archiving: Philosophy and Principles (Paris: UNESCO, 2004); Helen P. Harrison, ed., Audiovisual
Archives: A Practical Reader (Paris: UNESCO, 1997).
However, it should be noted that there is still some question as to whether or not moving image archiving is a
distinct profession or merely a specialization within the archival field. A recent study published in the IASA Journal
suggests that the field may still be experiencing an “identity crisis.” The author suggests that the sample size of
the study was too small to draw any distinct conclusions about the field, but suggests that from the preliminary
findings, at this time it is “inappropriate to consider audiovisual archiving a profession,” based on the attitudes of
the respondents to the survey. See, Tim Bathgate, “’What We Believe We Are, Say We Are and Demonstrate We
Are’: A Quantitative Analysis of the Attitudes of Audiovisual Archivists,” IASA Journal 37 (July 2011): 20.

40

Houston’s text illustrates the sense of loss permeating the moving image archives field,
citing the loss of 80% of silent cinema by neglect, purposeful destruction, and the cannibalistic
nature of nitrate film. 91

This statistic is often cited as justification for the preservation of

moving images and became a rallying cry for image archivists. 92 Houston’s text also gives voice
to the anxieties related to the self-destructive nature of the cinematic medium and the
obsolescence of moving image technology that have become central to how moving image
preservation is defined. Referring to how preservation formats are described, she suggests
“expressions such as ‘archival’ are themselves no longer used;” instead, “definitions are in terms
of the life expectancy of dyes, of the film base, of electronic software and hardware.” 93 This
anxiety and sense of loss shifted the priorities of major film archives from access to the physical
preservation of film materials. For moving image archives, preservation is closely linked to the
filmic artifact. Preservation efforts represent an attempt to perpetuate the original document and
therefore are tied very closely to the film object, the celluloid itself. 94
Over the past few years, this preservation discourse has become a subject of study for
film scholars. Film historian Carolyn Frick argues that archivists should reconsider preservation
as the defining function of film archives and explores the concept of preservation as it has been
used to shape what should be collected and preserved. Frick asks, “In the twenty-first century, is

94
This shift is reflected in archival manuals which stress the physical preservation of film materials, demonstrating
the technical knowledge required to properly archive moving image materials. See: National Film Preservation
Foundation, The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums (San Francisco: National
Film Preservation Foundation, 2004); Steven Davidson and Gregory Lukow, eds., The Administration of Television

and Mark-Paul Meyer, eds., Restoration of Motion Picture Film (Boston: Butterworth Heinemann, 2000).

this definition of what constitutes acceptable preservation standards still the most important
priority for moving image collections?” 95 Both Frick and fellow film historian Janna Jones have
explored how the concepts of “archive” and “preservation” have been invoked in moving image
archival practice and shaped the policies related to moving image preservation. Both authors
mirror earlier histories of moving image preservation in the sense that they concentrate the
efforts of the large players in film preservation (MoMA, Eastman House, and the Library of
Congress). However, both authors also address the influence of Hollywood studios, copyright
policy, funding policies of the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Film Institute,
and the founding of the National Film Preservation Board and National Film Preservation
Foundation on film preservation policies in the United States.
Archival scholar Karen Gracy takes the opposite approach, studying how preservation
has been defined from within the field in an ethnographic study of archival practice. Gracy
approaches film as a “manufactured commodity,” 96 again revealing the field’s bias towards the
commercial pursuits of film production, but also exploring the relationship of studios and film
producers to their intellectual and cultural property.
Reflecting on the International Federation of Film Archives’ code of ethics, Gracy
observes, “the term ‘film archive’ arose more from a desire to create an image of stability than
from an aspiration to describe an institutional mission… A film archive must consider
preservation to be its top priority, and thus, if an organization does not preserve films, it is not an
archive.” 97

emerges from the 1993 Library of Congress report which defined and proposed a preservation
plan for the nation’s moving image collections. Gracy also demonstrates the tensions and
competing values emerging from film studios and archives, drawing similar conclusions to Frick
and Jones who describe the external policies impacting preservation within archival institutions.
All three authors suggest that Hollywood studios have had a significant impact on how
preservation has been defined in the United States. Recounting actress Mary Pickford’s donation
to the Library of Congress, Frick suggests the desires of large studios and donors to protect their
interests in moving image assets shifted the archival community’s attention from providing broad
access to moving images to preserving and maintaining the physical material. 98 Hollywood
lobbyists would have a significant impact on copyright policy and preservation funding
throughout the 1970s and 1980s as television and home video became new outlets for motion
picture distribution. However, Jones suggests that the reluctance of the studios to support the
1993 preservation plan proposed by the National Film Preservation Board allowed the
preservation community to advocate for the preservation of moving images produced outside of
these commercial conglomerates. 99
This most recent wave of film preservation prioritizes “orphan” films. The term was first
used in reference to film preservation in the 1993 National Film Preservation Board, originally
describing works in any format for which the copyright owner was unknown. In this context, an
orphan film is defined as a film that “does not have an apparent copyright holder and lacks
commercial viability; thus, it does not have much of a chance of any persons or institutions

paying for its care or preservation.” 100 The term has been appropriated to reflect a shift in
preservation priorities from Hollywood and commercial cinema that dominated the early years of
film preservation. The Orphan Film Symposium suggests the term includes:
all manner of films outside of the commercial mainstream: public domain
materials, home movies, outtakes, unreleased films, industrial and educational
movies, independent documentaries, ethnographic films, newsreels, censored
material, underground works, experimental pieces, silent-era productions, stock
footage, found footage, medical films, kinescopes, small- and unusual-gauge
films, amateur productions, surveillance footage, test reels, government films,
advertisements, sponsored films, student works, and sundry other ephemeral
pieces of celluloid (or paper or glass or tape or . . . ). 101
Film Preservation 1993 not only advocated for the preservation of motion pictures, but also
helped to promote this shift in funding priorities away from Hollywood films and toward a
broader range of films deserving preservation. 102
This shift not only reflects a growing prioritization of smaller cinema by the preservation
community, but also represents a shift in focus from large institutions like the Library of
Congress, George Eastman House and UCLA’s Film and Television Archive, to smaller archival
institutions preserving a variety of orphan works. The establishment of the National Film
Preservation Foundation (NFPF) in 1996, the funding arm of the National Film Preservation
Board, is cited as one of the major influences in establishing this shift, as the NFPF limited the
funding the federal government could direct towards mainstream motion picture preservation,
directing funds towards the preservation of orphaned works. The re-direction of funds shifted
the burden of preservation for Hollywood cinema to the studios and other funding organizations.

While the NFPF grants smaller awards, a larger number of archives could now apply for funding
to preserve the industrial films, home movies, and other orphaned works found in their
collections. 103
This new prioritization of a range of media production compensated for the
preoccupation with nitrate film in the early preservation efforts, but the moving image archives
literature remains preoccupied with film preservation.

Frick, Jones, and Gracy each limit their

studies to a discussion of the influences on film preservation, while making little mention of the
preservation of television and videotape, the subject of the National Film Preservation Board’s
1997 report. Each of the authors suggest that digital production and preservation processes will
greatly impact the current understanding of preservation in the moving image archives field, but
do not acknowledge the other moving image media that will also be impacted by this shift. 104
These studies do represent a break from earlier histories of film preservation and film
archives which focused on specific individuals or organizations, but they remain preoccupied
with the film object and with the larger institutions supporting the preservation of film. Smaller
regional archives are mentioned, but the efforts of traditional archives and manuscript

in shaping the preservation policies of television archives.

repositories and other organizations that do not specifically focus on the collection of moving
images remain outside the scope of these major studies. 105
In the pioneering years of moving image archiving, providing access to moving images
was prioritized over the preservation of the artifact in an attempt to elevate the popular
entertainment medium to works of art. Once moving images were accepted as art and part of our
cultural heritage, the preservation of the physical object took precedence and has shaped
preservation policies and the practice of moving image archiving. In the formative years of film
archiving when access was prioritized, media arts centers could have been included among the
film archives working to promote the study of film. However, as preservation now dominates
the moving image archives discourse, media arts centers have been excluded from this group of
organizations. Their efforts to preserve and provide access to the media they create remain
unrecognized by archival practitioners.

2.3

COMMUNITY MEDIA AND ALTERNATIVE MEDIA PRACTICES

As preservation is only one of the many activities that media arts centers support, they
remained an unexplored subject for moving image archives; but, the media produced within
these organizations has been embraced by another growing area of study within the
communications field, community media.

However, as with the moving image archives

scholarship, media arts centers are not specifically named within this body of literature. Rather
105

A 2008 study of film preservation in museums, archives, and libraries demonstrated the difficulties “traditional”
collecting institutions face in preserving their media collections. Over 20% of the institutions surveyed described
their video and film collections as “in danger.” Other preservation challenges included a lack of staff expertise and
technological obsolescence. See, Jen Mohan, Environmental Scan of Moving Image Collections in the United States
(Washington, D.C.: Digital Library Foundation, 2008).

46

than focusing on media as art, community media stresses the importance of access and
participation in the production and consumption of media.
Like the media arts, community media also traces its origins to avant-garde and
underground cinema. The availability of 16mm film equipment and video technology in the late
1960s and early 1970s helped to spur amateur and independent media production. While avantgarde and underground media are often associated with artistic and aesthetic movements,
community media describe a different mode of production, stressing the power of
communications technology to mobilize communities through media production.
Generally defined, community media “refers to grassroots or locally oriented media
access initiatives predicated on a profound sense of dissatisfaction with mainstream media form
and content, dedicated to the principles of free expression and participatory democracy, and
committed to enhancing community relations and promoting community solidarity.” 106 Access
includes the availability to equipment, audiences, bandwidth, training, and the establishment of
policy that allows communities utilize to these media resources. 107 Community refers to groups
of individuals bound by geographic location, ethnic structures, cultural groups, and a variety of
other social structures self-defined through a common identity.
Related to community media are a variety of sub-genres of oppositional media. Each of
these categories describe media produced outside of the mainstream media outlets in a variety of
different contexts, primarily defined by the political aims of the creators. Alternative media is
the broadest of these related categories, describing “media that are alternative to, or in opposition
to, something else.”

This “something else” is typically defined as the mass-media or

mainstream-media “widely available and widely consumed.” 108 Further politicizing the aims of
community media, activist media “encourage[s] readers to get actively involved in social
change.” 109 The focus here is on the audience and the consumption of the media rather than the
mode of production; however, activist media shares a do-it-yourself ethos with community
media.
Radical media blurs the lines between these two distinctions, “represent[ing] alternative
and marginalized viewpoints of underrepresented groups, working against the power of
mainstream media conglomerates to restore balance to the relationship between the producer and
consumer of media.” 110

Related terms include alternative journalism, citizen journalism,

citizen’s media, democratic media, emancipatory media, and social movement media. 111 Robert
Downing suggests that radical alternative media is on the furthest end of the spectrum of
alternative media production demanding the most active involvement from the audience as
critical readers and working both overtly and covertly in direct opposition to popular culture and
mass culture. 112 On the opposite end of this spectrum is citizen’s media, or the “media texts of
ordinary citizens.” 113
All of these terms bleed together, describing a mode of production that emphasizes the
critical consumption of media products and provides a critique of mass-produced, mainstream
media. Studies of community media use the media products to investigate the political aims of

the community rather than studying the organizations that support the production of such
media. 114 Media scholar Chris Atton suggests a new theoretical and methodological framework
for investigating alternative media in which media is defined by its modes of creation,
production, and distribution, not simply by the radicalized content. 115 His framework accounts
for not only the alternative themes and aesthetics, but also the alternative business practices and
organizational structures emerging from the production of alternative media.
Atton’s work builds from studies of fanzine culture both in print and online.

Through

investigating the organizational structures supporting the production of these publications, Atton
has identified ‘infoshops’ as the hubs of this alternative media production. Infoshops can take
two different forms.

The first is described as a “radical information center” or “radical

community library.” This version of the infoshop provides a reading-space and serves as a
distribution hub for alternative publications. These communal spaces can be freestanding or part
of a larger organization. The second use of the term refers to the larger organizational structure
that supports the alternative production culture, “providing a forum for alternative cultural,
economic, political, and social activities.” 116
Infoshops bear a direct resemblance to media arts centers. Atton suggests infoshops are
often run by the users in a distributed nature, without a formal hierarchy, similar to the co-op and
membership models favored by many of the media arts centers. Infoshops provide resources and
technology, serve as hubs for distribution, and act as a general information resources for those
seeking alternative publications or wishing to publish themselves. Other studies of community

media investigate individual communities or types of media, theorizing the social aspects of
production or consumption of this media. Alternatively, Atton explores the support network for
alternative media production, suggesting an alternative organizational structure and culture that
mirrors media arts centers.
In this body of literature, media is understood as a communications technology rather
than a mode of artistic expression. Issues of access, power, media literacy, and technology
training are emphasized by the communities generating such media. In this way, community
media embraces the full range of functions that media arts centers support. However, broadcast
media such as cable television, radio, and electronic modes of communication are described as
the primary modes of production for communities. While independent film and video are
created in opposition to mainstream modes of production, they are produced by individuals and,
as such, excluded from studies of community media.

2.4

COMMUNITY ARCHIVES AND COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE

Community is also being explored by traditional archival scholarship through the concept
of community archives. This final intersection between archival theory and media arts centers
provides an additional framework for investigating the work of media arts centers. Community
archiving is related to the idea of the citizen archivist in that the concept breaks down the barrier
between professional and amateur practices, recognizes inherent power of archives, and

50

acknowledges alternative spaces in which collecting is taking place.

117

Similar to community

media, the participatory nature of community archiving is stressed along with the community
building aspects of collecting and documenting a shared history.
Archival scholar Andrew Flinn suggests that community archives “are the grassroots
activities of documenting, recording, and exploring community heritage in which community
participation, control and ownership of the project is essential.” 118 Community archives may
remain independent and autonomous or may partner with traditional collecting institutions such
as museums and archives. Issues of custody, control, representation, and access to community
records are the central tenets of community archiving.
Community remains a loosely defined concept for archival scholars in an attempt to
broadly include a variety of non-traditional archival practices. Flinn emphasizes that community
can be broadly conceptualized so long as communities are self-defined “on the basis of locality,
culture, faith, background, or other shared identity or interest.” 119

117

Marginalized and

Rick Prelinger has been credited with coining the term that refers to, “a person working outside established
institutions who is doing archival-quality work (not simply collecting), typically in an area that is neglected or
inadequately addressed by established collections. Citizen archivists collect and add value to records of
significance, many of which ultimately find their ways into institutions.” As quoted in, Ned Thanhouser,
“Reconstructing Thanhouser: The Twenty-Five-Year Journey of a Citizen Archivist,” The Moving Image 11, no. 2
(Fall 2011): 99, note 13.
Prelinger notes that the moving image archives field owes credit to these “unaffiliated” archivists who preserved
moving image materials not traditionally collected by larger archival institutions. See Prelinger’s comments on,

underrepresented social group and populations that have been otherwise undocumented by
traditional archival institutions are the subject of many community archives studies. 120
However, community archives also include the collections created by communities of
practice. Originally conceptualized by Jean Lave and Etienne Wegner in their theory of social
learning, communities of practice are social groups defined by a shared practice. This practice is
described as “joint enterprise” mutually undertaken by a group of individuals that share common
set of communal resources (vocabulary, objects, sensibilities). 121
David Wallace explored one such community of practice emerging from the community
of Grateful Dead fans.

Wallace describes the archive of informal recordings of live

performances circulated among fans of the Grateful Dead, or “DeadHeads.”

For decades, the

producers of these recordings or “tapers” illicitly traded audiotapes through the growing network
of DeadHeads, until they were officially recognized in 1984 and provided a designated area at
concert venues, dubbed the “Official Taper’s Section.” 122 While Wallace describes the role that
these “tapers and traders” played in the larger Grateful Dead community, he also describes an
emerging community of practice, identified as the “taping community.” These rogue recorders
exhibited a set of shared values, established practices, and a common vocabulary. Tapers
developed methods for eluding security, standards for recording technologies, and a lexicon for

120

The 2009 volume, Community Archives includes a number of articles that describe the recordkeeping practices
of a number of under-represented and marginalized communities, including: aboriginal groups; queer, gay, and
lesbian archives; communities emerging from political struggles; as well as groups defined by their geographic
location. See, Jeannette A. Bastian and Ben Alexander, eds., Community Archives: The Shaping of Memory

describing the best areas of concert venues for recording. 123

The DeadHead community

developed a circulating archive of these unofficial recordings, supplementing the formal archive
of studio recordings produced by the band. Wallace’s study suggests an alternative means for
defining the concept of community in community archives.
By broadly defining the concepts of community and archive, community archives share a
similar indefinable quality with community media.

Flinn suggests that “definitions of what a

community might be, or what a community archive is and what it might be taken to include are
not necessarily clear or fixed.” 124 Other associated terms include local history group, oral history
project, community history project, community memory project, informal archives, independent
archives, or independent community archives. Jeannette Bastian adds to this list the concepts of
the embodied archive, non-traditional archive, and living cultural archive. 125 What is common
across all of these terms is the notion of a shared identity and the desire to document a common
history.
Jeannette Bastian’s concept of the living and embodied archive suggest that community
archives not only include traditional paper-based documentation but other forms of cultural
expression that may not include the traditional archival concept of the record. In her studies of
community, Bastian includes intangible aspects of culture such as performance and oral
tradition. 126 A wide variety of documentation can be found within community archives: material
artifacts, oral histories, audiovisual documentation, personal testimonies, analog and paper

materials, and ephemera. Like the concept of community, the record is also self-defined and can
include anything that may have significance to that particular community.
Community archives have also been connected to the availability of communications
technology, particularly the ability to create and share digital collections on the Internet. Andrew
Flinn suggests that participatory digital technologies have had a significant impact on the
development of community archives, providing new opportunities for communities to generate
and share their stories and histories. 127 In this way, community archives are closely tied to
community media. Both concepts describe modes of communication in which communities
choose to represent themselves, providing an alternative to mainstream culture.
While the concept of community archives stresses the role of the community in
constructing its own archives, archival scholars have also begun to theorize the role of the
archivist in these community constructs.

In an ethnographic study of several community

archives projects in the UK, Mary Stevens, Andrew Flinn, and Elizabeth Shepherd described a
model for a participatory approach to community archiving, suggesting a role for the
professional archivist in assisting the community archivist. Archival professionals can provide
expertise in the areas of preservation, conservation, curation, and dissemination of community
collections.

Archivists can also share their knowledge in the areas of copyright and digital

representation for community archivists undertaking digitization projects. 128

54

These cooperative models suggest a new role for archivists as community consultants;
however, Flinn observes that community archives “challenge the legitimacy of the mainstream
sector,” suggesting a tension between professional and amateur. 129

Conversely, many

community archives have evolved from a parallel distrust from communities towards the official
archive. Instead, professional archivists must join community archivists as partners, recognizing
the expertise that the community has to offer. Community archives provide opportunities to fill
gaps in the archival record by supplementing collections or suggesting new areas of collection
for archives. The alternative practices developed within community archives also present
opportunities for archival practitioners to reflect upon and revise their own practices. 130
Like the orphan film movement, which has expanded the notion of what counts as part of
moving image heritage, community archives represents an attempt to expand on the notion of a
collective national heritage or national history and legitimize the histories and heritage of groups
which identify in other ways outside of the nation-state. Whereas moving image archives are
oriented towards defining the object, community archives focus on people and their attempts at
self-documentation. Similar to community media, community archives embrace new ways of
representing, collecting, and preserving documentation that may not fit the standards of
mainstream archival organizations.
Moving image archivists have not yet embraced the concept of community archives, but
this concept provides a useful framework for understanding media arts centers.

As non-

traditional archival spaces, the concept of community archives allows media arts centers to be
understood on their own terms, rather than in archival terms. While the practices at media

centers may not meet archival standards, the collecting practices developed in these institutions
demonstrate a desire to preserve and share the media that is produced within these organizations.

2.5

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AND THE RESIDUAL CATEGORY

In classification systems, the residual category is described as “that which is left over
after a classification is built,” the “other,” “none of the above,” and “not otherwise specified.”131
These “garbage categories” are homes for the “ubiquitous other.” 132 They are a catch-all for the
things that just don’t fit.

Media arts centers appear to belong to such a category. These

organizations are situated at the intersections of the bodies of scholarship discussed, but do not
squarely fit within the boundaries of the literature as it has been framed. In fact, each of these
areas of scholarship represents additional residual categories, describing concepts of media
production and organizations that are not easily classified.
Media arts is perhaps the most troublesome, described as both a set of practices and
genres encompassing media produced on film, video, or in electronic form.

Documentaries,

narratives, experimental works, and installation art are all included in this catch-all category.
The media arts are distinct from the plastic arts in that they utilize moving forms of visual media,
and from performance art that suggests live, staged performances. The ubiquity of ‘media arts’
is useful in that in embraces all time-based, moving-image media that are often placed into
artificial categories according to the aesthetics of a particular moving image medium (i.e. film

MA: MIT Press, 2000), 149.

56

and video). As this chapter has demonstrated, these artificial distinctions have been upheld by a
number of fields of study. In this sense, the media arts is a useful concept for embracing
commonalities between different media forms. However, the all-inclusiveness of the concept
also makes it a moving target and difficult to theorize in a meaningful way.
This blurring of categories can also be seen in the moving image archives literature.
Defined by the preservation of the film object, moving image archivists have attempted to
embrace the more general term ‘audiovisual’ or ‘moving image’ archives, but remain
preoccupied with the filmic object.

Moving image preservation has been defined by the

preservation of the original film element. These distinctions begin to blur with video and digital
productions, which must be reformatted to ensure their long-term preservation, destroying the
principles on which film preservation has been based.
Moreover, moving image archives have become their own residual category of sorts.
Broadcasting libraries, stock footage libraries, cinemathéques, museums, national archives,
regional archives, and studio archives are all terms that describe the various institutions
concerned with the continued preservation of moving image materials. 133

Joan Schwartz has

demonstrated that archives and archival collections consisting primarily of visual materials are
often defined as distinct from traditional archival institutions concerned with the preservation of
paper-based materials. Schwartz argues that the logocentrism of archival theory and practice
have marginalized photographic records and other visual forms of documentation.

While

concerns for preservation of the physical medium often lead to the physical segregation of
photographic collections from related textual materials, the nature of how archivists refer to
photographs “others” these records in the archive. The terms “non-textual,” “special media,” or
133

See, Ray Edmondson, et. al. “The AV Archive Definition and Typology,” in Helen P. Harrison, ed., Audiovisual
Archives: A Practical Reader (Paris: UNESCO, 1997): 40-42.

57

“graphic materials” are used to distinguish photographic records from traditional text-based
documents and manuscripts. Professionals who specialize in the use of such materials are
“photo” or “media” archivists, signified as different from general archivists. 134 The push for
professionalization from moving image archivists can be seen as one of the effects of this
othering of visual media within the archival field, as audiovisual archiving is relegated to a
residual category of archival practice.
‘Orphan films’ and ‘community media’ are equally difficult to define. The exhaustive
list of moving images included in the concept of “orphan works” has benefited moving image
archives, giving name to a group of moving images that had been previously unrecognized by the
preservation community.

However, this residual category, including all manner of media

produced outside of Hollywood studios blurs the distinctions between the different modes of
production and reinforces the preoccupation with the media object, as archivists hunt out
individual films to save. In a similar vein, community media embraces a wide range of media
products generated in opposition to the mainstream media. The term excludes as much as it
includes failing to acknowledge film and video works not produced for mass broadcast over the
airwaves or Internet.
Community archives are an attempt to bring a residual category into the archival field.
Terry Cook explains that this shift in the archival paradigm “challenge[s] [archivists] to stop
seeing community archiving as something local, amateur, and of limited value to the broader
society and to start recognizing that community-based archiving is often a long-standing and

134

The SAA’s A Glossary of Archival & Records Terminology includes several related terms for “special records,”
defined as, “materials stored separately from other records because of their physical form or characteristics
require unusual care or because they have nonstandard sizes.” These terms refer specifically to visual materials:
“nonprint materials,” “nontextual records,” and “visual materials.”

58

well-established praxis.” 135 But in an attempt to include all community-collecting practices, the
concept remains undefined. Community archives are yet another residual category, describing
any self-identified community and their self-defined collections of self-identified records.
Discussing the various functions of media arts centers, J. Ronald Green asked, “should
production services take place outside the context of distribution, exhibition, study, and
preservation activities,” and conversely, “should preservation take place outside the context of
production, distribution, exhibition and study activities?”136 These two questions sum up the
issues addressed here. Moving image archivists have attempted to separate preservation as a
function that is outside the purview of producers of media, and conversely, moving image
archivists are solely concerned with keeping and maintaining these records over time. This
classification of practices has artificially divided the field, which has assumed that these
practices are separate and unequal.
Residual categories create a silence. Objects are designated as “other” because they are
unknowable and unknown. 137 Trapped at the intersections of several residual categories, media
arts centers have remained un-named and un-recognized, relegated to the “other” or
“miscellaneous” category.

This project attempts to bring media arts centers in from the

periphery to become the object of study. With their concern for the total ecology of media
production, what can be learned from these organizations?

METHODOLOGY

This study utilized case study methods to answer the following research questions: What
can the history and development of three differing media arts centers – Pittsburgh Filmmakers,
Paper Tiger Television, and Termite Television Collective – reveal about the role of media arts
centers in the collection and preservation of independent media and the development of archival
practices in non-profit media organizations? How can the identified practices impact the future
management of media collections in archival organizations?

3.1

CASE STUDY AS A RESEARCH METHOD

Robert Yin describes case study as a method and research paradigm rather than a feature
of research design or technique for data collection. He defines case study as, “ an empirical
inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life context,
especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident.” 138
The strength of the case study method, Yin proposes, is the utilization of a variety of evidence,
including documents, physical artifacts, interviews, and observations to create a robust and
holistic understanding of the particular case or cases at the center of the study.
138

2009), 18.

Case study has been identified as a method that is particularly suited for the study of
organizations. 139 Organizational case studies rely on the same variety of data points suggested
by Yin, but include a historical component that allows the researcher to track the development of
an organization over time. Information professionals G. E. Gorman and Peter Clayton suggest
historical study as a necessary component of an organizational case study, arguing that in order
“to understand an organization you must also understand its historical roots, its evolution over
time.” 140 As media arts centers have not been the subject of previous study, case study method
allowed for the investigation of current practices at targeted sites as well as their history and
development.

Media technology is always pushing forward to provide new creative

opportunities for media producers. In response, media arts centers have adapted their practices
over time to keep up with the changing standards of the field, introducing this media technology
to the communities of creators they support. A study of current practices alone would have been
too limiting.

Understanding the development of each site over time allowed for the

investigation of the influence of these technological changes within each organization as well as
the shifting priorities that followed changes in leadership, along with the impact of other external
influences such as the availability of funding through specific granting agencies (such as the
National Endowment for the Arts), and changes in preservation priorities in the wider archival
field.
Given that there has been little scholarship investigating media arts centers and the media
arts movement in the United States, the variables impacting practices at these organizations

could not be immediately identified. As such, this study was exploratory in nature. 141 The
subjects for this study were purposefully selected to provide opportunities to study both the
appearance of media centers as a phenomenon as well as the development of practices within
each of the organizations.

RESEARCH DESIGN

Cases for a particular research study may be selected because they represent “ideal” types
or extreme cases. 142 With the lack of scholarship related to media centers, the “ideal” media arts
center remains an unknown.

Points for comparison were designed into this study through the

selection of multiple cases. This design provided opportunities to begin to develop a typology of
media arts centers and opportunities for generalization, whereas a single case could only describe
a single organization. Multi-case studies are described as “richer” than single case studies,
“because they offer contrasts that help the researcher better understand why and how a
phenomenon occurs in one way in one setting and a completely different way in another
setting.” 143

Through utilizing multiple case studies, this study provides a more robust

description than a singular study and can serve as the basis for future studies of these types of
organizations.

141

Gorman and Clayton suggest, the purpose of an exploratory study is “to investigate little-understood
phenomena, to identify important variables.” See, Gorman and Clayton, Qualitative Research for the Information
Professional, 95.

The three cases identified for this study were purposefully selected from the members of
National Alliance of Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC) for several reasons. My interest in this
project began with another research project investigating the history of Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
Pittsburgh Filmmakers is one of the oldest media arts centers in the country, officially
incorporating in 1971. As part of its mission, the organization provides production facilities,
educational opportunities, and screening venues to the Pittsburgh region. Additionally, the
organization has custody of several film collections, but does not have an organizational mandate
to collect. In this way, Pittsburgh Filmmakers has become a repository of last resort for these
collections. 144 Pittsburgh Filmmakers has also been described as one of the few remaining
media arts centers that continues to operate as a ‘true’ media arts center. 145 For these reasons,
Pittsburgh Filmmakers was selected as one site for this study.
The additional sites were selected for their geographic location and concentration in a
particular media, differing from Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

While Paper Tiger Television

broadcasts a majority of the media produced by the collective through public access cable
television, Termite TV uses its website to broadcast and develop media projects. Both East
Coast organizations are members of National Alliance of Media Arts and Culture and can be
designated as media arts centers as defined in this study.
More significantly, these organizations were purposefully selected to provide a
comparison of media centers over time.

While Pittsburgh Filmmakers was founded as a

filmmakers’ collective, Paper Tiger Television was founded as an outlet for community access
television in 1982, and Termite Television Collective a decade later as the Internet emerged as a

significant communications medium. As the oldest of the organizations, Pittsburgh Filmmakers
has addressed the widest variety of media, from film to analog video and now, digital media.
This research design provided opportunities to not only study the changes within the individual
organizations, but also to understand the development of media arts centers over time. Each case
was studied individually looking both historically at the development of each organization and at
the present practices in the broad categories of preservation, representation, and outreach. The
chronology developed through the individual histories provided a lens for understanding the
history and development of media centers more generally, establishing the foundations for future
research in this area.

DATA SOURCES

One of the advantages of case study research is the researcher’s ability to draw from a
wide range of sources to develop each case. However, the large amount of data collected
between multiple cases also presents challenges for management of the data. As such sampling
is a necessary component of case study research, as researchers are not able to study every
possible source of evidence within the cases. This selection was bounded by the research
questions. 146 The following data sources were explored for this research study.

146

Ellinger, Watkins and Marsick, “Case Study Research Methods,” 336.

64

3.3.1

Textual Materials

The historical research was driven from the primary source material found within each
organization. Gorman and Clayton suggest a variety of typical sources including annual reports,
meeting minutes, policy statements, and personnel records. 147

Through initial research at

Pittsburgh Filmmakers, I identified several sources of primary source material, including:
strategic plans, a self-published journal, class catalogs, the library catalog and database, records
related to the archival collections, and a variety of promotional materials. In conducting the
study I found that in two of the cases it was difficult to gain access to these archival records. In
two cases, these records were not systematically collected and preserved, resulting in large gaps
in the historical records maintained by each organization. In addition, records accessed for this
study were often collected haphazardly and distributed among staff and members. 148

Each of

these individuals maintained records according to their individual interests or role within the
organization, leading to gaps in the documentary record.
At Pittsburgh Filmmakers I relied on the materials preserved in the library collections
including Field of Vision, a journal published by the organization from 1976-1985, and a
transcript from the Major Media Center Conference hosted by the organization in 1978. The
organization’s Media Relations Coordinator (described as the “keeper of the archives”) also
granted access to press releases (dating from 1992 to present) and a small collection of

147

Gorman and Clayton, Qualitative Research for the Information Professional, 50.
For example, at Pittsburgh Filmmakers the records related to the acquisition and digitization of the film
Pittsburgh serve as an example of this haphazard collecting within the organization. A photocopied newspaper
clipping from 1979 announcing the donation of Pittsburgh (1959) to Pittsburgh Filmmakers serves as the only
acquisition record for the film. Additional documentation related to film, including an inventory of the 30,000 feet
of film footage, are scattered among the drums and cans in which the film is stored.
148

65

photographs documenting some of the organization’s activities. While other caches of materials
were rumored to exist, I could not gain access to any additional textual records produced by the
organization.

The Internet Archive’s Wayback machine allowed for exploration of the

organization’s website and historical course catalogs.
The recordkeeping practices at Termite Television were similar to those of Pittsburgh
Filmmakers. Access to paper-based materials was limited, however digitized materials were
available through the collective’s website. Over the past few years, the collective has scanned
some of the surviving records related to various exhibitions and screenings. Most of these
materials can be classified as ‘ephemera’ – posters, flyers, and pamphlets – however; the
collective has also digitized articles and other primary source materials related to a number of
projects. The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine was useful in this case as well to explore the
various generations of termite.org and the development of the online archive of material.
Paper Tiger Television was the outlier in terms of access to archival materials. In 2010,
the collective donated their archives to the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York
University. Here I was able to access records from the organization’s history from its founding
through 2010. The donation included administrative files such as meeting agendas and minutes,
grant applications, as well as flyers and other ephemera. 149 While collective members shared
some recent emails, access to documentation from the past three years was limited.
This lack of documentation is one of the limitations of relying on historical materials.
Gaps in the record must be considered when analyzing the materials and are particularly telling
for this study. In many cases, it was the records with some artistic merit (photographic or
illustrated materials) that had been preserved. Gorman and Clayon suggest that this lack of

66

primary materials is a known limitation for organizational research and note that interviews with
current and former employees can assist in filling these gaps in the documentary record. 150

3.3.2

Semi-Structured Interviews

To address this lack of primary material, a series of semi-structured interviews were
conducted with key staff and members of each organization. Offering several advantages over
written documentation and other methods of data collection, interviews supply an immediate
response and afford opportunities for the exploration of topics by the interviewer and interviewee
and may also assist in establishing causal links. 151

As such, these interviews were also

opportunities to resolve ambiguities found in the written record and lead to the identification of
additional informants useful for this study and future research.
The questions listed in Appendix A served as a guide for topics related to the practices
within each organization related to preservation, representation, and outreach. These questions
sought to gather information about the collections, the current storage conditions, collecting
policies, issues of access, and general maintenance of media collections. 152 Other questions,
developed prior to each interview, were driven by the data found in the primary source materials.
Interviews were conducted with the current administrative staff for each
organization, along with other staff and volunteers working in areas of particular interest for this
study. At Pittsburgh Filmmakers, interviews were conducted with the current executive director,
the media relations coordinator, the library staff, as well as staff members coordinating the Film

Kitchen and Documentary Salon exhibition programs.

As volunteer-based organizations,

subjects for the interviews with the collectives were more difficult to coordinate. One of the
difficulties is the fluid nature of the collectives’ member-base. At Termite TV and Paper Tiger
Television, I spoke with current staff, as well as founding collective members from each
organization. Many of the interviews were conducted on-site allowing for a tour of the facilities
and an overview of the activities related to preservation and collection at each organization.
Interview subjects included:
•

Charlie Humphrey - Humphrey has served as the executive director of Pittsburgh
Filmmakers over the last twenty-one years.

•

Carol O’Sullivan – O’Sullivan is the Media Relations Coordinator for Pittsburgh
Filmmakers and has been involved with Pittsburgh-based arts organizations over the
past three decades.

•

Will Zavala – Zavala is a faculty member at Pittsburgh Filmmakers, a documentary
filmmaker, and founder of the Documentary Salon, a local film appreciation group.

•

Matthew Day – Day is a former Pittsburgh Filmmakers employee and curator of Film
Kitchen, a monthly screening venue for independently produced film and video from
the Pittsburgh Region.

•

John Cantine – Cantine is a filmmaker, Pittsburgh Filmmakers faculty member, and
faculty liaison to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers Library.

•

Anula Shetty – Shetty is the current co-director of Termite Television. Shetty joined
the collective as an artist-member in 1994.

•

Michael Kuetemeyer – Kuetemeyer is one of the founding members of the Termite
Television collective as well as the current co-director of the organization.
68

•

Dee Dee Halleck – Halleck is one of the founding members of the Paper Tiger
Collective. While she is not currently producing work with the collective, Halleck
has continued to provide financial and administrative support for the collective over
the past three decades.

•

Patricia González Ramírez – Ramírez is a current Paper Tiger Television collective
member and serves as the single staff member for the organization, managing the
administrative work for the collective. Ramírez also served as the project manager
for the collective’s 30th anniversary exhibition at New York University’s Fales
Library and Special Collections.

•

Jack Walsh – Walsh has served as the executive director of the National Alliance of
Media Arts and Culture since 2010.

From 2003-2010 Walsh also served as co-

director with Helen De Michiel.
Interviews were recorded and transcribed. While the questions listed in Appendix A
served as the foundation for each of the interviews, additional questions varied for each of the
interview subjects. These additional questions were suggested by the review of archival and
secondary source materials prior to each interview, as well as the responses of the subjects
during each interview.

Questions followed the themes identified in Appendix A:

the

development of collections and archives, preservation of archival materials, cataloging practices
and representation of the archives, relationships with archives and other collecting institutions,
and outreach activities and initiatives.
There are obvious limitations to this approach. While interviews provide an opportunity
to collect rich data about practices and events, interviews are limited to the knowledge and
memory of interviewees, as well as other personal biases limited by point of view. The primary

69

and secondary source material served as a means for resolving discrepancies between the
accounts provided by each of the interviewees.

3.3.3

Secondary Source Materials

In addition to these primary sources, secondary literature related to each of the
organization and to media arts center movement was reviewed.

External publications such as

newspapers and journals contain published information related to specific events or brief
institutional histories of media arts centers; in some cases these pieces were authored by
employees of the organizations or other key persons intimately involved with the media arts
centers. Trade publications such as Sightlines, Film News, and Film Library Quarterly, and
academic journals such as Millennium Film Journal, Afterimage, and Cinema Journal provided
additional insight into the history of the organizations in this study and the historical
development of media arts centers. 153 Other institutional histories, such as Robert Haller’s
Crossroads: Avant-garde Film in Pittsburgh in the 1970s, DeeDee Halleck’s Hand-Held Visions,
and Illuminating Video: An Essential Guide to Video Art supplemented the interviews and
archival documentation. 154

153

See, Lucy Fisher and Bill Judson, “Independent Film in Pittsburgh,” Millennium Film Journal 3 (Winter/Spring

journals and trade publications that may provide additional data for this study. See, (chap. 2, note 80).

3.3.4

Additional Data

In addition to the site visits and interviews at each of the media arts centers, additional
research was conducted at The National Alliance of Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC) in San
Francisco. As the umbrella organization representing the interests of media arts centers, the
history and development of NAMAC revealed some of the larger external influences related to
the development of media arts centers, such as the involvement of the National Endowment for
the Arts explored in the following chapter.
Like the other cases in this study this research was limited by the documentation that has
been preserved by the organization. NAMAC granted access the organization’s archive of
publications including Media Arts (1983-1990), MAIN: Media Arts Information Network (19912009), and NAMAC’s Closer Look publications (2001-2010), as well as the organization’s
applications for various National Endowment for the Arts grants (1989-present). In addition to
these materials, an interview was conducted with current NAMAC director, Jack Wash to clarify
the gaps in the record and gain a sense of the current aims of the organization. This additional
data provided contextual information about the development of media arts centers and NAMAC,
suggesting additional points of comparison across the cases selected for this study.
In addition to the research at NAMAC, additional site visits and interviews were
conducted at the Bay Area Video Coalition (BAVC) in San Francisco and Anthology Film
Archives in New York City. Both organizations are members of NAMAC with formalized
preservation programs.

Anthology Film Archives, founded in 1969, specializes in the

preservation of independent, experimental, and avant-garde media. The Archives maintains a
collection of over twenty-thousand films, five-thousand videotapes, and two-thousand audio
recordings, as well as a manuscript collection and library. As with many audiovisual archives,
71

Anthology is dedicated to the preservation of film as an art form, described in its manifesto as
“the first film museum exclusively devoted to the film as an art.” 155 Archivist John Klacsmann
provided a tour of the facilities and an introduction to Anthology’s preservation and conservation
practices.
As a media arts center, BAVC provided a point of contrast to Anthology.

Founded in

1976, BAVC was one of the original media arts centers funded by the National Endowment for
the Arts in the late 1970s. 156 Like many media arts centers, BAVC is known for their support of
media production, however the organization also specializes in providing preservation services
for small non-profit organizations and individual artists. BAVC’s preservation program was
formalized in 1994 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Noted projects
include BAVC’s partnership with the Dance Heritage Coalition to create a digital repository of
dance documentation and performance, the Lost Treasures program which seeks to preserve the
work of Bay Area Artists, and the Quality Control Tools for Video Preservation. The media arts
center also subsidizes preservation projects through the Preservation Access Program supported
with funds from the National Endowment for the Arts. 157

These additional sites provided

insight into the professional standards for preservation from the perspective of audiovisual
preservationists. As specialized facilities, BAVC and Anthology are situated between larger
archival institutions such as the Library of Congress or UCLA Film and Television Archives and
the media arts centers in this study which lack formalized archival programs. While these
organizations do not appear as cases in this study, a knowledge of these practices and the support

informed my understanding of the localized practices as they have developed at Pittsburgh
Filmmakers, Paper Tiger Television, and Termite TV.

DATA ANALYSIS

The following chapters address the practices that have developed at three media arts
centers using a cross-case analysis to draw comparisons across the cases using the identified data
points. For each case the observed practices, interviews, and historical data provided a means for
triangulation and resolving discrepancies between data sources. Ellinger, Watkins, and Marsick
describe this inductive nature of data analysis, suggesting that with this constant comparative
method, “case study researchers enter into iterative cycles of data collection, analysis of some
kind, and … use insights from the analysis to guide the next steps of data collection.” 158 This
iterative approach was employed throughout the data collection and analysis; the primary and
secondary documentation suggested questions for the interview subjects, while the interviews
suggested further interrogation of the archival documentation and published materials. Data
sources were interrogated for the broad themes suggested by the Semi-Structured Interview
Questions (Appendix A): development of collections and archives, preservation of archival
materials, cataloging practices and representation of the archives, relationships with archives and
other collecting institutions, and outreach activities and initiatives.

158

Ellinger, Watkins and Marsick, “Case Study Research Methods,” 341.

73

Andrew Flinn’s definition of community archives (discussed in Chapter 2) served as a
framework for understanding the development of archival practices within each of the cases.
Defined as “collections of materials gathered primarily by members of a given community and
over whose use community members exercise some level of control,” the inclusiveness of
Flinn’s concept allowed for broad interpretation of archival functions as they were identified in
each of the cases. 159 As community archives are defined in opposition to professional archival
practices, I remained aware of my professional biases and was careful not to impose professional
standards and terminology on the practices observed. The questions in Appendix A avoided
professional jargon and asked the interview subjects to provide their own definition for common
archival concepts and terminology. In all three cases (and in the case of NAMAC) “archives”
and “preservation” were openly used terms within each organization, though not necessarily
defined according to these professional standards, as this dissertation will demonstrate.
As this study investigates the practices at three media arts centers, the following chapters
can only provide a limited understanding of the practices that have developed within these
organizations at large.

Until further research can be conducted, these cases stand as

representative examples of the archival practices that may be found in media arts centers and
similar organizations.

THE MEDIA ARTS CENTER MOVEMENT

A comprehensive history of the media arts center movement has yet to be written. While
the history gleaned from this study can only begin to tell this story, the aim of this chapter is to
give some sense of the cultural and political context from which the media arts center movement
emerged. Like all histories, this is a complicated story with a diverse set of actors, voices, and
organizations with multiple aims and motivations. The story of media arts centers intersects the
histories of video art, independent film, avant-garde film movements, as well as public access
movement, and government support for the arts.
Like the organizations represented in this story, the history of media arts centers and the
media arts centers movement is widely distributed, existing in the memories of the participants
of the movement and their personal archives, as well as in the archives of the organizations that
waxed and waned over the past sixty years. Jack Wash, current director of The National
Alliance of Media Arts and Culture explained that the few members of the founding generation
remain and many of those who have failed to pass their knowledge to the next generation. Even
this lobbying arm for the media arts field has little sense of its own history. 160
Two of the key organizations to this story are the National Endowment for the Arts
(NEA) and the National Alliance of Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC). The following chapter

160

history of the organization for its Thirtieth Anniversary in 2010.

will address the history of media arts centers using the involvement of these organizations as a
lens to provide a contextual framework from which media arts centers can be understood.

4.1

SETTING THE STAGE: THE RISE OF INDEPENDENT MEDIA

Examples of independent or non-commercial filmmaking can be found throughout the
history of film and video production.

While the term ‘independent filmmaker’ is a

contemporary term, many of the earliest filmmakers and inventors of the medium working in the
early twentieth century, could be described as independent. French filmmakers Auguste and
Louis Lumiére patented their version of the cinématographe, an early motion picture film camera
and projector, in 1895 and began producing actuality films to screen at fairs and music halls.
The most famous of which, L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat, better known as the
Arrival of the Train at the Station, is fabled for frightening first-time film goers, causing
audience members to jump out of the way of the on-coming train projected on the screen. The
Lumiéres’ controlled the means of production and distribution of their work operating similar to
the way in which we define independent filmmaking today.
Early adopters like the Lumiére Brothers and their contemporaries, such as Thomas
Edison in the United States, controlled the means of production and distribution of their work as
early inventors of moving image technology. As movie making became an industry, leading to
the development of large studios on both the east and west coast, this distinction between
commercial, or theatrical, film production and distribution, and independent, or non-commercial,
becomes more apparent. The practices of non-commercial and amateur filmmaking continued to
build throughout the early teens and twenties and into the mid-twentieth century.
76

During this

time, amateur film technology, such as 16mm safety film and projectors, was introduced to the
growing market of movie fans and cine clubs desiring to create and screen their own films or to
share commercially produced films with others. 161
The ‘independent filmmaker’ emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as the cost of film
technology reached a point at which it was more affordable for individuals or small groups of
filmmakers to purchase equipment for their own use. The terms ‘underground,’ ‘avant-garde,’
and ‘experimental’ have also been associated with non-commercial film and media production
during this era.

In these decades, the first videotape portapack technologies were also

introduced. Much like 16mm and Super-8 film technology, these early video systems were
portable and affordable, popularizing technology among independent and amateur media makers
alike. Video technology also freed these makers from film labs, as videotape could be instantly
reviewed and edited using the same recording apparatus.
Independent has different connotations today. This term can describe commercially
successful filmmakers and artists as well as those working in the non-commercial sector.
Independent in this study refers to artists working in this non-commercial sector, controlling the
means of production and distribution for their work. The media arts center, the subject of this
study, like ‘independent,’ is also a nebulous concept.

4.2

MAJOR MEDIA CENTERS, REGIONAL MEDIA CENTERS, AND MACS

In the late-1960s and early-1970s the technologies of production and distribution were
available to film and video artists; however, the cost of entry was still prohibitive for many
media-makers. 162

To distribute the costs of purchasing recording, editing, and playback

equipment, media artists began to form together into small collectives, purchasing equipment as
a group and working together to create and distribute media. The ‘media arts center’ appeared
during these decades, either growing from the smaller collectives (such as the Selma Burke Arts
Center in Pittsburgh, discussed later in this chapter) or building from already established arts
organizations like the Pacific Film Archive. 163
Film scholar and former NAMAC board member J. Ronald Green suggests that the
history of media arts centers can be traced to the founding of the Museum of Modern Art’s Film
Library in 1935. 164 However the regular use of the term does not appear in the literature until the
early 1970s. In 1973, Sheldon Renan, then director of the Pacific Film Archive, argues that this
organization was the “first film facility… to be planned as a regional film resource center.”165
Here the term “regional film center” is used to designated facilities that would support non-

162

In 1971, an entry-level portapack video camera/recorder would require an investment equivalent to about
$12,000 when adjusted for inflation. A single videotape, while reusable, cost about $13 (or $75 today), while the
equivalent in 16mm film with processing was priced at approximately $110 (or about $600 today). These statistics
were estimated from the costs reported in Michael Shamberg, Guerrilla Television (New York: Holt, Rinehart and
Winston, 1971).
163
Media arts centers appear to be a North American phenomenon. While film societies and cine clubs can be
found world-wide, the media arts center nomenclature has only been referenced in relation to centers in the
United States and Canada. For discussion of how the media arts center evolved in the Canadian context see,

commercial film production and exhibition across the United States. He suggests that this
movement began in late the 1960s as organizations were founded in regions not known for film
production (the Pacific Northwest, Mid-West, and New England). This initial push for the
regional development of non-commercial film production centered on several key issues: the
appreciation and study of film as an art form, community outreach, and the development of
federal funding structures through the National Endowment for the Arts.
Renan further suggests that the concept of regional film centers is closely tied to the
development of the American Film Institute (AFI). 166 Founded in 1967 with funding from the
National Endowment for the Arts, the twenty-two board original AFI members identified five
key priorities for the Institute: preservation of “the American Film,” audience education,
professional training for filmmakers, support of production through funding opportunities, as
well as the development of publications to support the study of film. 167 Those working within
the media arts center movement also expressed a desire for the AFI to coordinate the efforts of
the regional film centers developing across the United States. While the AFI would support film
and video at the national level, the Institute failed to develop support mechanisms with a regional
focus. The report from the 1979 National Conference of Media Arts Centers reflected this
disconnect between the aims of the media arts center movement and the AFI suggesting that “the
priorities and objectives of the AFI and the centers are different in many cases,” and that media

166

In its history of the development of NAMAC, the Experimental Television Center suggests that the
development of media arts centers parallels the development of the AFI, placing the beginning of the media arts
center movement in 1967 following the publication of the Stanford Report, the research study which called for the
establishment of the AFI. “Evolution of NAMAC (1997),” http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/evolution-namac1997.

arts centers must work to fill these gaps at the regional level. 168 NAMAC, the National Alliance
of Media Arts Centers, would later fill this role as the umbrella organization for the media arts
center movement and the media arts more generally.
J. Ronald Green uses the term ‘regional media center’ to discuss media arts centers in his
1982 description of the variety of not-for-profit media institutions developing in the country. He
again suggests the founding of the Film Library at the Museum of Modern Art as the origin of
the larger grassroots movement supporting non-commercial media. 169 However, twenty-five
years after the founding of this institution, Green reflects, “the proliferation of not-for-profit film
organizations… was being pointed out in public for its variety and overall disorganization.”170
This disorganization is demonstrated by the multitude of terms used to describe media arts
centers, which have also been known as regional media centers, major media centers, media
centers, or simply MACs. At times these terms designate large established institutions with a
national focus, such as the Museum of Modern Art, but media arts centers also connote more
regionally focused organizations supporting a few hundred artists as suggested by Sheldon
Renan and J. Ronald Green, or even smaller artists collectives and access centers operating at a
local level offering services to a few dozen members. Broadly defined, this term designates a
non-profit, membership based media arts organization providing services that support the
production of non-commercial media (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Functions of Media Arts Centers 171

Though the support of the National Endowment of the Arts and additional funding from
the Rockefeller and MacArthur Foundations, the media arts centers gained momentum
throughout the 1960s and 1970s, supporting the growth and development of the media arts sector
in this country. Then Director of the NEA’s Media Arts Program, Brian O’Doherty reported on
the growth of media arts centers in the NEA’s Annual Report from 1979:
A phenomenon of the [1970s], media arts centers bring works of classic and
advanced media art to the public through exhibition programs, workshops, and
residencies. They focus the attention of artists, critics, and public on key issues

Policy,” Journal of Cultural Economics 8, no. 1 (1984): 63.

affecting our understanding of the media. And they provide a vital resource for
media artists through equipment access programs and to the public through
maintenance of film-video collections and publications. Increasingly, media
centers are serving as centers of production; many are developing cordial relations
with their local public and commercial television stations, e.g., in Buffalo,
Houston, Minneapolis, Boston, New York, and Los Angeles. 172
Statistics reported at the 1979 National Conference of Media Arts Centers further
demonstrate the impact of media arts centers on the media arts field. Representatives of the
forty-seven organizations who attended the conference, representing about one-half of the
nation’s media arts centers, reported that they had supported 835 appearances by film and video
makers with $170,000 in artist fees and honoraria, programed 7,450 film and video screenings to
an audience of over 850,000 people and broadcast to over 2 million homes, and provided
equipment to 8,000 members. 173 This level of activity had already captured the attention of the
NEA, which began funding media arts centers in their own category within the Media Arts
Program, beginning in 1978.

MEDIA CENTERS AND THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS

National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was established by the 1965 National
Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act and charged with “develop[ing] and promot[ing] a

broadly conceived national policy of support for… the arts in the United States.” 174 In speaking
about the aims of the newly formed federal funding arm, President Lyndon B. Johnson stated:
Government can seek to create conditions under which the arts can flourish
through recognition of achievements, through helping those who seek to enlarge
creative understanding, through increasing the access of our people to the works
of our artists, and through recognizing the arts as part of the pursuit of American
greatness. 175
The NEA initially funded organizations and individuals working in the arts fields in several
broadly defined categories: Architecture, Arts and Education, Costume and Fashion Design,
Creative Writing, Dance, Drama, Folk Art, Music, Public Media, Variety of Art Forms, and
Visual Arts, along with providing support for state arts councils and agencies.
Media arts centers were initially funded as “regional film centers” under the Public
Media Program, beginning in 1972, through the Regional Development Grants which provided:
Assistance to regional organizations to help them exhibit high quality film and
video art; conduct visiting artists programs; provide access to exhibition and
production facilities; provide a resource for film and video research, study, and
information; train regional development personnel; and integrate and coordinate
media resources on a regional basis. 176
Renamed in 1977, the Public Media program became the Media Arts program. In 1978 a new
funding category was introduced for Major Media Centers, “to make the arts of film, video, and

Major Media Centers here include

organizations operating independently as well as those established within parent organizations,
such as museums, universities, or state arts agencies.

In this first round of funding fourteen

organizations were granted funds totaling to $380,500. 178 This represents four percent of the
eight million dollars in funding allocated for the Media Arts Program this year. Funds were also
allocated to:
•

Programming in the Arts, for developing programming for radio or television

•

Aid to Film/Video Exhibitions

•

In Residence/Workshop Program, providing funding for organizations to invite mediamakers for engagements

•

The Endowment/CPB Joint Program, providing funding for programming on public
television through the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB)

•

In 1980, the NEA renamed the funding category, using the broader and more inclusive
term, “Media Arts Centers.” This funding for Media Arts Centers would continue through 1996,
when the NEA restructured the entire granting program, eliminating this direct line of funding.
Reflecting on the support of the NEA, Douglas Edwards, editor of NAMAC’s newsletter,
credited the NEA for establishing “a solid foundation for the media arts ‘movement’ in the U.S.”
and further argued, “in response to the widespread grassroots efforts in the late 1960s and early
1970s, the NEA provided much needed recognition and funding for the young field – and was, in
all probability, more responsible for the popularization of the terms ‘media arts’ and ‘media arts
center’ than any other organization, group or individual.” 180 While the NEA provided support in
these formative years of the media arts center movement, support would wax and wane over the
next two decades as the media arts sector took shape under the leadership of NAMAC.

NAMAC: THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF MEDIA ART CENTERS ARTS AND
CULTURE

By 1980 the media arts center movement had gained significant momentum and media
arts centers began to organize, calling for national representation that could lobby on behalf of
the growing number of media arts centers across the country. NAMAC’s origins have been
traced to the Conference on Regional Development of Film Centers and Services, otherwise

known as the Mohonk Conference, held in February of 1973 in upstate New York.

The

conference was jointly sponsored by the Museum of Modern Art and the Pacific Film Archives,
affiliated with the University Art Museum in Berkeley, and funded by the John and Mary Markle
Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the NEA. The Committee on Film and Television
Resources and Services was formed at the Monhonk Conference and charged with developing a
centralized organization to support the growing film and television community in the United
States. 181 Thirty representatives of media arts centers as well as other stakeholders in the media
arts field were in attendance at this first major meeting of media arts centers, including two
representatives of the NEA’s Public Media Program. 182 Four of the twenty-five represented
organizations received NEA funding in 1977 under the first round of funding for Major Media
Centers. 183 This initial meeting was followed by a series of regional meetings charged with
reviewing the report drafted by the initial conference committee. After several years of research,
the Committee on Film and Television Resources and Services published the resulting report in
1977 titled, The Independent Film Community: A Report on the Status of Independent Film in the
United States.
The report attempts first to define this ‘community’ of independent media artists.
Suggesting that the commercial film sector may be defined as an industry as it is profit driven,
the authors prefer the term community when describing the non-commercial sector, as
competition for profit does not exist among independent filmmakers who are supported by nonprofit organizations. ‘Independent’ in this sense, “implies that a single individual has primary

and unquestioned creative control,” over their production.

The report centered on the

filmmaking community, not due to an oversight or bias, but because at this moment, the video
community proved t00 elusive, escaping definition.

The authors suggest that “the growth of

video is so rapid that boundaries and definitions become blurred almost before they are
recognized.” However, where the concerns of the growing video community overlap those of
independent filmmakers, the broader term ‘moving image media’ is employed in this text.184
This distinction between media would not hold in media arts centers, and in fact, many of the
organizations attending this initial conference would eventually support artists working across all
forms of visual media. This “multiformity” of the community, as it is described in this report,
also complicates the notion of preservation, discussed in the following chapter.
The report defines the broad areas of support provided by media arts centers (distribution,
funding, exhibition, preservation, and study), and concludes with recommendations and
observations about the growing community in several key areas:
•

The need for a public image

•

The expansion of exhibition programs

•

Support from government agencies

•

The opposition to “Established Media Systems”

•

Democratic access to the tools of media production

•

The significance of video as a creative medium

184

Feinstein, The Independent Film Community, vi-vii. A similar division along format lines will be seen in the
discussion of preservation in the following chapter.

87

•

The necessity of the development of “Archival Techniques” for media

•

The future of film and media education 185

Media arts centers were beginning to fulfill many of these roles, providing venues for exhibition,
experimenting with and providing access to film and video technology, as well as developing
preservation techniques, and supporting the study of media, but the movement would require
additional support from the government, both in terms of funding and policy, if it were to
succeed in the democratization of media creation. The report cites the role of the Federal
Communications Commission in developing policy that supported open access across
communication channels and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for developing further
venues supporting the exhibition of noncommercial productions, as two key examples.
However, where these governmental bodies are seen as potential collaborators, the AFI is further
chastised for the apparent failure of the organization to support non-commercial production.
The authors argue that the AFI was, “primarily concerned with the celebration of the
feature-film industry and has proven particularly unsuited to representing the independent film
community.” 186 With this failure of the AFI to represent regional interests and provide support
for non-commercial or independent media creators, the organizations represented at the
Monhonk and media arts centers from across the country gathered in two years after the
publication of The Independent Film Community for the 1979 Media Arts Center Conference.
This conference, like those that preceded it, concluded that regional development was
required to further support the growing non-commercial media arts sector in this country.

Attended by approximately half of the media arts centers in the United States, the final report
called for cooperation among media arts centers and the federal government to provide
legislation and funding to support the growing media arts field:
Media Arts Centers need and should actively seek to place representatives… on
the advisory boards of the CPB [Corporation for Public Broadcasting] and PBS
[Public Broadcasting Service], and could promote contact with Congressional
communications sub-committees, both in Washington, through a national
representative, and through in-person contacts at field hearings. 187
At this time, some of these roles were filled by the representation provided by the Association
for Independent Video and Film (AIVF), but those attending this meeting now felt that media
arts centers, “[could] and should exert substantial political force,” with the proper national
representation.

Thus, NAMAC was officially formed the following year hosting its first

convening, “An Alliance for the Media Arts in America,” in Boulder, Colorado. NAMAC began
its first decade as the National Alliance of Media Arts Centers reflecting its outgrowth from the
Media Arts Center Movement.
By 1980, media arts centers were in their third round of funding from the NEA and
NAMAC now served as the national representation for this diverse and growing body of
organizations supporting the media arts.

In the early 1980s, NAMAC members included

organizations with a national focus, such as The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
and American Film Institute, state level organizations and funders, like the Ohio State Arts
Council, and smaller regional or locally based organizations such as Pittsburgh Filmmakers and
the Toledo Media Project. 188 NAMAC was serving the diverse interests of organizations that
ranged from local media arts centers, university based organizations, and cultural intuitions –

89

from major museums charged with preserving the cultural heritage of the nation to ‘scrappy
upstarts’ creating experimental work in new media – serving as an umbrella organization for all
organizations concerned with the media arts.
In these early years, NAMAC focused on three key functions: convening its membership
at annual national conferences, providing small technical support grants to member
organizations, and conducting research and advocacy in the field. 189 Along with the annual
meetings, NAMAC began publishing the Travel Sheet, a newsletter distributed to all NAMAC
members, describing the current work being produced and exhibited in media arts centers across
the country. This publication supported the growing network of independent artists through
developing touring schedules for completed works and developing audiences in the field. In
1983, the Travel Sheet was incorporated into Media Arts, a publication partially funded by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Long Beach Museum of Art. The
audience for this quarterly publication included institutional and individual NAMAC members,
institutions and individuals operating larger media arts field, as well as the general public. Each
issue included updates and news from NAMAC and its members as well as articles related to the
broader concerns of media arts centers, “programming and exhibition activities, funding,
education, technology, production, preservation, history, and other aspects of film, video, audio,
and intermedia arts.” 190 Issues related to funding and access at both the national and state levels
were also regularly featured in Media Arts. During the 1980s, a few “anchor funders” supported
the growth of media arts centers, including the NEA, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the
MacArthur Foundation. While these grantors established a stable funding source for some,

189

monies from these foundations were often allocated for the same larger profile media arts centers
year after year, creating pools of funding for a select few. 191 The same was true for individual
artists who could apply for a number of grants furnished by the NEA and the AFI, however,
these grants were often awarded to established artists with national reputations seeking
significant funds to support their work. 192 To remedy this inequity, the NEA established the
Regional Fellowship Program in 1982. Previously administered through the AFI, in 1982 these
grants were administered by designated media arts centers.

In 1984, seven regions were

identified, each represented by a single media arts center.
Representatives of the NEA identified several advantages to this effort to decentralize
funding for the media arts:
1. They acknowledge the geographically diverse media community.
2. They encourage the media artists to remain within their communities, rather than
migrating to national centers of production.
3. They put the award-making process closer to the constituency served.
4. They showcase the administering organizations – the media arts centers.
5. They encourage the participation of private corporations and foundations which do not
fund national programs. 193
The fellowship program succeeded in stimulating production at the regional level,
allowing the media arts centers to acknowledge and showcase media artists in their
individual regions. While this was a more democratic approach to allocating funding,

some regions were disproportionally represented, as Figure 2 demonstrates. 194 Media
arts centers in the Central Mid-West and Mid-Atlantic supported fewer than six states,
while funding designated to the Rocky Mountain Film Center in the Western Region was
divided among fifteen. Each region received the same award from the NEA to be
distributed across the constituency (in 1984 each designated media arts center received an
award of $45,000).

and Rocky Mountain Film Center (University of Colorado) for the West and Pacific Territories.

In 1984, NAMAC announced a second regranting program, the Management Assistance
Grants also funded by the NEA. Instead of focusing on the work of the individual artist, this
program aimed to support the “growth and development,” of media arts organizations “by
implementing concreted management initiatives which will move these groups towards increased
long-term stability.” 196 The grants furthered the aims of the media arts center movement by
providing monetary assistance for the development of individual organizations, and by
designating media arts centers as the regranting organizations. This theme of decentralized of
funding would continue through the 1990s, as the NEA began to cut the number of small grants
(less than $5,000) it administered to small media arts organizations and individual artists.
The 1990s brought number of other changes for NAMAC and the media arts field. In
1991, the relationship with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science dissolved and
Media Arts became MAIN: Media Arts Information Network.

During this time the larger

established media centers such as the long-term co-publishers of Media Arts, the Long Beach
Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art (New York) began to break their association
with NAMAC. Many of these organizations represented museums and other cultural institutions
with larger support networks and interests outside of the media arts. However, this loss of larger
media arts centers and organizations made way for a growing constituency of smaller media arts
organizations, a demographic that would continue to grow within NAMAC’s membership. The
model of the media arts center, as it was envisioned decades earlier, was also in decline. While
many media arts centers continued to thrive, NAMAC became the National Alliance of Media
Arts and Culture, recognizing the diversity of non-profit media organizations that NAMAC was
now serving.

While this decade marked a growth in the media arts sector, these years would also prove
challenging for NAMAC. The National Endowment for the Arts continued to modify their
funding structure throughout the 1990s and eliminated the specific line of funding for Media Arts
Centers in 1997 after almost two decades of support.

The Media Arts Fund, NAMAC’s

regranting program through the NEA, was eliminated a few years prior.
The NEA’s Media Arts Program director and long-time supporter of NAMAC and the
media arts center movement, Brian O’Doherty would also leave the NEA in 1996. These funding
cuts were felt deeply by media arts organizations that had identified the NEA as one of “the most
influential and important funders” in the media arts field. 197 The NEA’s Media Arts Centers
funding category was credited with helping to legitimize the media arts center movement among
organizations in the wider arts fields. Some organizations funded in this category reported that
their organizations adapted to fit the media arts center model in order to qualify for this funding
from the NEA. Those receiving funding at this federal level also suggested that the prestige of
receiving an NEA grant helped to attract further funding at the state and local levels. 198
These changes were felt across all of the funding programs in the NEA, not only the
Media Arts. While the NEA had sustained a series of modest budget cuts from the federal
government in the earlier half of this decade, 1996 brought with it the most drastic cuts leading
to the wholesale restructuring of the granting program.

The seventeen discipline-based

programs, which included the Media Arts Program, were replaced by four funding categories:
Heritage and Preservation, Education and Access, Creation and Presentation, Planning and
Stabilization. Over the next three years, grants to individual artists were eliminated, with the

exception of established fellowship programs in literature, jazz, and folk and traditional arts. All
re-granting programs and operational support grants to organizations were also terminated. 199
These funding cuts reflect the larger tumultuous political climate during the Culture
Wars.

During the 1990s the NEA and the arts in general were under attack by the political

Right, and attempts were made to completely defund the organization. The National Assembly
of State Arts Agencies also reported a twenty-six percent decrease in the available funding for
the arts, citing the budget cuts as the “largest decline in 23 years.” 200 The attacks against the
NEA and other public funding sources for the arts can be seen throughout NAMAC’s newsletter
during this decade (see, “Helms Attacks NEA” on the following page).

For example, in 1992

NEA grants for the Gay and Lesbian Media Coalition and the Pittsburgh International Lesbian
and Gay Film Festival were rejected. The ruling was overturned for the 1993 funding cycle, but
the affect on the media arts field was chilling. 201 In 1997, the NEA declined funding for Canyon
Cinema’s catalog suggesting that, “absent any artistically-based selection process or editorial
mechanism, the Endowment cannot rely upon the artist excellence or merit of the material
included.” 202 The independent film distributor had received NEA funding for the printing of its
distribution catalog for the past fifteen years. Other artists and media arts centers came under

attack in these years, but those producing “subject matter relating to gay, lesbian and female
sexuality,” were specifically targeted for investigation. 203

Helms Attacks NEA
On September 19, 1991, the Senate passed an amendment to the FY92 Interior Appropriations
Bill which would restrict the NEA from funding works which: “…may be used to promote,
disseminate or produce materials that depict or describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual or
excretory activities or organs.” The Amendment authored by Senator Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, passed in the Senate 68 to 28. Attempts were also made by Helms to force the NEA to
shift $64.6 million (50% of its budget) to state arts councils throughout the country, stating that
the “elitist” policies of the NEA have shortchanged many individual states by “funneling most of
the money to big cities, which then use the funds to impose their liberal morality, homosexual
lifestyles , and a distorted culture on the rest of the country.” These attempts failed when Helms
could not muster up the votes to table discussion.
The Appropriations Bill now heads to conference where an effort will be made to remove the
Helms language. There is also a difference of budget size approved by each chamber of
Congress which needs to be reconciled – the House having previously approved a budget of
$177.7 million for the NEA (attempts were made by Congressman William Dannemayer of
California to attach a similar restrictive amendment, but failed, through only by nine votes), $3
million more than the Senate’s approved budget.
Conferees from both the House and the Senate are expected to meet beginning October 3, to
attempt to work out the differences between the two chambers’ versions of the Bill. If you
haven’t already done so, you need to be contracting your Senators and Representatives to let
them know your view on the necessity of unrestricted federal funding of the arts. The number for
the Congressional Switchboard is (202)224-3121. Make an announcement about this current
crisis at your organization’s nightly events or in your publications/flyers/calendars and keep
abreast of the discussion (particularly if the restrictive content amendment is not removed) so that
we as a national community can regain the upper hand in the fight for our Constitutional rights.

mission of representing and supporting media arts organizations.

Director Jullian Lowe

reflected, “while others are starting to learn to live lean and mean, lean and mean has always
been our norm and now we’re just plain mean.” He further observed:
we’ve been fighting a cultural war for the past five years. In truth, we’ve been
fighting a cultural war for much longer than that. The battles have been labor
struggles, civil rights movements, suffrage campaigns, and much more. Artists
have always been part of these battles, although art history may not always reflect
that fact. We need to re-claim this history both as artists and arts organizations. 204
Lowe’s comments reflect the resilience and endurance of the media arts field. While the
following decade would bring with it more challenges and roadblocks, NAMAC would continue
to adapt to the changing political and technological climate at the turn of the twenty-first century.
With the burst of the “dot com bubble” and the economic collapse in 2008, NEA funding
would not return to pre-1990s levels. Jack Walsh, current director of NAMAC, suggested that
this economic climate necessitated change in organizational structure for those in the media arts
field, resulting in a decline of the physical center (media arts center) and the growth of smaller
media arts organizations. With the proliferation of the web and the dropping cost of media
production technology, access to equipment was no longer as important as it was decades before;
anyone with access to a cell phone and a computer has the ability to create and distribute the
media they produce. This is not to say that the media arts center has disappeared. According to
statistics from 2004, twenty-eight percent of NAMAC’s membership was founded prior to 1973
during the formative years of the Media Arts Center Movement (see Figure 3).

These

organizations have continued to persist by adapting and changing with the availability of funding
as well as the changes in media technology over the past six decades. 205

Despite these changes NAMAC’s role in the media arts field remains similar to its goals
in the 1980s: hosting national conferences, conducting research and advocacy in the field, and
providing general support to media arts organizations. This support is now provided though
Leadership Grants and Regional Leadership Institutes designed to “foster and fortify the culture

and business of independent media arts,” in an attempt to build a stronger media arts field. 207
The organization has also developed a series of publications titled A Closer Look, first published
in 2000 under the leadership of Helen De Michiel, presenting case studies of member
organizations which highlight leadership and management skills.
While NAMAC has attempted to strengthen the field through assisting with the
development of individual organizations, the organization has also continued to survey and
define the boundaries of the media arts field.

Launched in 2010, Mapping the Field is

alongitudinal study aimed at gathering empirical data about the media art field. The study is not
limited to NAMAC members, but rather surveys the entire media arts field in an attempt to
assess the impact of non-commercial media, collecting data related to: organizational budgets,
revenue streams, and organizational activities. 208 Now in its second round of data collection,
Mapping the Field has, “illuminat[ed] for the first time an independent media arts field made up
of larger and more established organizations than previously known.” 209 The cases selected for
this study represent this diversity across the media arts field as well as the complexity of the
history of the development of the Media Arts Movement in the United States.

FILMMAKERS, PAPER TIGERS, AND TERMITES: A CASE HISTORY FOR
MACS

The cases explored in the following chapters intersect this history at varying points.
Pittsburgh Filmmakers serves as the paradigm case for the media arts center model. 210
Established in 1971, the organization was an active organization in the media arts center
movement, hosting the 1978 Major Media Center Conference, one of the regional conferences
following the 1973 Monhonk Conference, and was among the first recipients of the NEA’s
Major Media Center Grants. Pittsburgh Filmmakers also served as the NEA’s representative for
the Mid-Atlantic Region administering grants through the Regional Fellowship Program through
1996. As an active NAMAC member, Pittsburgh Filmmakers also hosted the 1998 NAMAC
Conference, Media Generation: What Works to What’s Next.
Pittsburgh Filmmakers has weathered the past forty-three years as a traditional media arts
center by emphasizing its commitment to media arts education and partnering with local colleges
and universities earning income by offering for-credit courses. From its roots as an artist co-op
at the Selma Burke Arts center in the early 1970s, Pittsburgh Filmmakers remains dedicated to
supporting the individual artist, whether affiliated with the educational programs or working
independently from the Pittsburgh Filmmakers facility.

Pittsburgh Filmmakers remains a

membership driven organization, with the executive director reporting to voting artist members.

210

Described as such by J. Ronald Green who argued, “Pittsburgh Film-Makers is a paradigm case history of
growth from an original exclusive concern in 1971 for film production, through progressive relations with film
study and exhibition, then preservation, distribution, and funding.” J. Ronald Green, “Film and Not-for-Profit
Media Institutions,” in Film/Culture Explorations of Cinema in its Social Context, ed. Sari Thomas (Metuchen, NJ:
Scarecrow Press, 1982), 47.

100

The media arts center remains dedicated to providing the breath of services for artists that were
described by the early advocates for the media arts center model. 211
Paper Tiger Television and Termite TV represent the smaller media arts organizations
represented within NAMAC. Both organizations break from the traditional media arts center
model, operating as media collectives.

Whereas Pittsburgh Filmmakers is supported by

individual artist members who pay fees to access equipment and facilities, Paper Tiger and
Termite TV are project driven and seek funding for the development of programming to be
broadcast on the web or through local cable access channels. In these two examples, artists work
together to develop, produce, distribute, and exhibit works collectively, with the final products
belonging to the collective and not the individual. While each of these organizations rent
common space and share common equipment, collective members do not pay a fee, but rather
donate their time to the organization.
While they represent a break from the traditional media arts center model, these
collectives support the creation, distribution, exhibition, and preservation of media, but serve a
smaller constituency of artists. Emerging in 1981 and 1992 respectively, Paper Tiger and
Termite TV developed during leaner funding times, when established organizations had develop
relationships with large funders and as some lines of funding for media arts centers were
disappearing. Both organizations operate on ‘micro-budgets,’ receiving project based funding

from state arts organizations and individual donations. 212 The differences between these cases
and their placement along the timeline of the development of media arts centers provide points of
contrast throughout this study.

CONCLUSION

Independent media creators are not in fact independent, as this history of media arts
centers had demonstrated. As J. Ronald Green observed:
the dependence of independent filmmakers on multi-system institutions, and their
interdependence among themselves, is realized, perhaps unwittingly and often
unwillingly, through their own necessary cooperative practices. Thus the
‘independent’ filmmakers were independent of commercial institutions, but not of
their own not-for-profit (or profit) institutions, or of each other. 213
As this history has demonstrated, media arts centers emerged as a network of
interdependent organizations driven by a common desire to support the development of media
arts in the United States. Despite the desire of media arts centers to remain independent entities,
financial support from the NEA and other large funders was key to the development of this
network.

The wax and wane of funding and the shifts in political attitudes towards the arts

shaped the development of media arts centers and the types of support they provided to artists

Paper Tiger Television currently operates on a budget of approximately $30,000 per year. This small sum
supports the production, rent and utilities, and a single part-time staff position. The Termite TV operates on a
similar budget, however in lieu of staff collective members serving on the board take on the administrative duties
for the organization.

and communities. Though, media arts centers remained dedicated to providing a full range of
services from production, to distribution, to preservation.
This history represents an alternate, and previously unexplored view of the development
of audiovisual archives in the United States. Many of these same funding mechanisms and
governmental organizations supported and influenced the development of audiovisual archives in
the decades prior to the media arts center movement. 214 The history of media arts centers can be
placed alongside the development of other preservation movements in the United States, a
movement that was driven by the creators rather than the collectors of media.
This is only a partial history, aspects of this story have yet to be explored and uncovered
in the records and memories of the media arts centers that remain.

While the linear history

presented here traces the history of the media arts center movement though the lens of NAMAC
and the NEA, in reality this history, like all histories, is not so neatly packaged. As this chapter
has illustrated, ‘media arts centers’ and the ‘media arts’ are not clearly defined, and as such the
larger history contains many stop-and-starts, blind corners, and dead ends. It is the complexity
of the media arts that is the strength of the field, as former NAMAC co-director Helen De
Michiel observed:
But I’m not worried that this is no static definition of the media arts. The field is
more expansive, more fluid, and more about real engagement across participatory
boards than ever before. We are artists making film, digital, audio, and broadcast
work. We are activists working on legislative and reform policies to protect our
public media. We are educators teaching people of all ages how to create and
think about communications as a shared dialogue. And we are entrepreneurs
building organizations and new business models to support experimentation

214

The influence of the National Film Preservation Board, the American Film Institute, and preservation funding
from the National Endowment for the Arts and National Film Preservation Board have been explored in Caroline
Frick, Saving Cinema: The Politics of Preservation (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011).

throughout the motion media environment. 215
The following chapters will continue to explore media arts centers as a phenomenon,
specifically focused on issues related to archives and archival work as they arise in the each of
the cases.

As a cross-section of media arts centers, these cases represent the diversity of

organizations working under the umbrella of NAMAC. The practices developed within these
multifarious organizations provide an opportunity to explore archival work in a different light,
through the culture of different communities of practice and creative cultures that do not fit
cleanly into any particular category, especially not as archives.

PRESERVATION IN MEDIA ARTS CENTERS

Cinema – or, if one prefers, the motion pictures – is like a big tree with many branches. The
Hollywood movie is only one of the branches of this huge tree. There are other equally green
branches: the branch of the documentary film; the branch of the avantgarde or poetic film; the
branch of the home movie and the anthropological film; etc. This multi-branched nature of
cinema shouldn’t be forgotten when we talk about preservation of our moving image heritage. 216
We in the video field are in a sort of twilight zone. We’re not totally accepted by the art world –
where we got our beginnings – and, on the other hand, a lot of film people are resistant to
video. 217
As the previous chapter demonstrated, the media arts field is not well defined. Media arts
is a broad term encompassing all forms of media production, including film, video, television,
radio, and other forms of digital or ‘new media.’

As the cases selected for this study

demonstrate, media arts centers take a variety of different organizational structures and operate
with differing philosophies on the aims of media production, although they are generally nonprofit, member driven organizations concerned with supporting artists in the production of
media.

Audiovisual archivist, Ray Edmondson suggests that the field of practice responsible

for the preservation of this media, audiovisual archiving also has an “internal plurality and
diversity” among the institutions and individuals who practice in this field. 218 Audiovisual, like

media arts, is an all-encompassing term that includes all time-based or moving image media,
such as film, video, television, audio recordings, as well as digital forms of expression.219
Audiovisual archives can be for-profit or non-profit, privately owned or government sponsored,
free-standing organizations or departments within larger institutions, and represent variety of
organizational structures, including: broadcasting archives, programming archives or
cinematheques, audiovisual museums, academic archives, special collections, studio archives,
and stock footage libraries.
While Edmondson argues that a single philosophy drives the practice of audiovisual
archiving as a distinct academic discipline, archival scholar Karen Gracy has demonstrated that
within the field, ‘preservation’ is a pluralized concept, defined within the context of the varying
institutions serving as custodians for audiovisual media. 220 Edmondson defines preservation as
the “totality of things necessary to ensure permanent accessibility – forever – of an audiovisual
document with the maximum integrity.” 221 Edmondson’s definition refers to “a great many
processes, principles, attitudes, facilities, and activities,” while “maximum integrity” is not
clearly defined. These processes can include conservation, restoration, reconstruction, copying,
recreation, and emulation. 222 The definition of each of these concepts too, may be redefined
within different institutional contexts.
Gracy defines preservation as “the multiple processes, both physical and intellectual, that
are used by archives and libraries to maintain access to a film: collection, physical preservation

techniques, cataloging, transfer to film and video, and exhibition.”223 This definition again,
suggests a plurality of practices that support the preservation of film and video. Preservation in
this definition includes both the activities related to prolonging the life of the physical medium as
well as those actions taken to provide continue access to such material.
Archives serving as custodians of records both paper-based records and audiovisual
media must balance preservation and access. Materials are housed in chemically inert archival
enclosures and placed in climate-controlled storage on specialized shelving. While the materials
are preserved in this manner to ensure their longevity and to provide continued access, access
becomes a risk for materials. Researchers may purposefully or inadvertently damage materials
through use, tearing or marking materials in reading room or by simply handling documents and
introducing oils and contaminants from their skin. Light, heat, humidity, and environmental
pollutants all pose risks to archival materials regardless of format, but the mechanical nature of
audiovisual materials makes access to these records particularly precarious.
Physical audiovisual media share a hardware/software relationship with the technology
for production and for playback. While it is possible to inspect a film element without projecting
the images, to recreate the illusion of movement and sound a film must be fed through a
projector and introduced to heat, light, and the possibility of mechanical damage as it moves
though the projector.

This hardware/software relationship is more pronounced with videotape

materials. The strip of magnetic tape carries a signal that can only be translated by the playback
hardware. Further, because the information on the tape cannot be read without the aid of the
playback technology, it is often difficult to determine if the signal is damaged. Obvious physical

223

Gracy, Film Preservation, 22.

107

damage to the tape or the housing can indicate some signal loss, but in most cases the media
must be played back to be inspected for evidence of signal loss or decay.
The chemical makeup of audiovisual media presents further archival challenges. Unlike
paper materials that are stable at room temperature, audiovisual media requires specialized
storage near freezing temperatures to prolong the life of the material in archival terms. The first
film-stocks, manufactured on nitrate-based plastics, are notoriously known for their
flammability, but also degrade in process that leads to image loss if not stored in a stable
environment at the freezing point. Acetate-based film or “safety-film” was manufactured as an
alternative, but is also chemically unstable. Like nitrate stock, acetate-based film will shrink and
warp over time if not stored in similarity cold environments. The organic dyes in color film,
regardless of film base will fade over time.

Magnetic media is similarly susceptible to

degradation at without cold storage and suffers from binder degradation known as ‘stick-shed
syndrome’ in particularly humid environments.
What does this mean for audiovisual archivists? Preservation in the audiovisual archival
context means storing materials in a cold and stable environment, which leave such materials
inaccessible to users.

Reformatting or copying the materials onto stable formats is the only

solution for continued access to the material over time. This is where the concepts of restoration
and conservation become entangled with preservation in relation to audiovisual materials.
In the archival field, preservation brings to mind such terms as immutability, integrity,
and fixity, a concept that is closely tied to the concept of a single, original, archival document.
Preservation in this context describes “the act of keeping from harm, injury, decay, or

108

deconstruction, especially through noninvasive treatment.” 224 In other words, the rehousing of
archival materials into specialized folders and boxes and placing those items into a controlled
preservation environment.

This passive process of preservation is distinguished from

conservation and restoration which imply the more active processes of repairing damaged
materials and returning the item to some idealized ‘original form.’
Leo Enticknap addresses this distinction between the practices of preservation and
restoration, suggesting:
preservation is essentially a passive process. In the case of an archival institution
that uses a passive conservation model, this can consist of little more than the
rudimentary technical examination of a film element (to determine if there is any
imminent risk of content loss, primarily through decomposition), and then putting
it in a vault with the temperature and humidity optimised for the long-term
storage of that particular film base and emulsion combination. 225
Here preservation is described as “passive conservation,” that is, conducting a basic inspection
and placing the item into cold storage. This process, Enticknap argues assumes that the material
will not be accessed in the near future. For access, he describes an intermediary “technical
preservation” which includes the creation of access copies, a determination of copyright, and the
other steps to describe and provide access to the materials. Restoration is describes as part of
this active preservation process that results in the creation of surrogates of the original elements
for access:
restoration refers to one or a combination of processes of technical intervention,
intended to create a copy of the content of a film from elements acquired by an

224

Archivists, 2005), s.v “preservation.”

109

archive, which more closely recreates aesthetic characteristics of that content
which were known to exist at some point in the past, but which are not present in
the surviving elements. 226
Restoration may be limited to the aesthetic qualities such as the restoration of color values in
faded elements, or may result in the complete reconstruction of film from fragmented
elements. 227 Karen Gracy’s study of the film preservation process reveals that in practice,
“preservation” includes this entire continuum of processes from passive to active including the
“intervention and remedy” associated with restoration and reconstruction. 228 The National Film
Preservation Board reinforced these definitions in Film Preservation 1993, suggesting that
preservation indicates that film is “viewable in its original format with its full visual and aural
values retained” and “protected for the future by ‘preprint’ material through which subsequent
viewing copies can be created.” 229 This definition from the National Film Preservation Board
suggests that a film is not preserved unless it is available in its original format, or that the content
has been transferred to new film elements. 230

230
The International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) reinforces this definition of preservation, arguing that
“When providing access to material by programming, projection or other means, archives will seek to achieve the
closest possible approximation to the original viewing experience.” FIAF does give some leeway when choosing a
preservation medium, acknowledging that archivists are limited by the “technical possibilities available,” but
emphasizes that the, “new preservation copies shall be an accurate replica of the source material.” The Code of
Ethics also suggests that archives should strive to continue to provide access to nitrate elements when it is
possible to do so. International Federation of Film Archives, “Code of Ethics,” accessed April 20, 2014,
http://www.fiafnet.org/uk/members/ethics.html. However, the practically of film-to-film transfers as the
preferred preservation intervention is now questionable as commercial studios retool to digital formats and film
manufactures discontinue the production of film in response.
227

110

Unlike film, preservation (copy and transfer) on the original media was never a strategy
for video.

Since the introduction of video recording in the 1950s, each new generation of

videotape has improved recording quality and image resolution, but has introduced a host of new
technology for recording and playback. Unlike the film industry which has standardized a
handful of film formats, videotape formats include dozens of open-reel and cassette formats
encoded with both analog and digital information. 231 Combined with the preservation concerns
for the physical tapes, the obsolescence of formats also restricts access to and preservation of
these materials. As such, the only preservation strategy for video formats is migration. Whereas
film preservation is focused on the end-product, video preservation is an ongoing process as
suggested in Television and Video Preservation 1997:
The preservation of videotape itself may not be the real archival issue compared
to that of format obsolescence. In this context video preservation is not an end
product but a process of archival management that requires re-formatting and
copies, and quality control. 232
The reproduction of a surrogate that reflect the original intent of the creator in terms of
informational content and aesthetic values remains central to the process of preservation and
restoration for all audiovisual materials, regardless of medium, but the original carrier is thought
to have little value in the case of videotape.

5.1

PRESERVATION INDEPENDENCE

…the 1992 National Film Preservation Act directed the Library of Congress to conduct
“a national study on the state of American film preservation” and “to coordinate preservation
efforts among studios and archives.” While there has been talk of bringing a ‘fresh’ approach to
the lack of any effective national plan, even a cursory review of the issues and players suggests
that what we represent as a community is very likely to be marginalized once again. …What
assurance is there that this is not simply another means to rewrite history according to the
status quo? 233
The practice of preservation as it has been defined here, is from the perspective of
audiovisual archives. These definitions closely align with the concepts of preservation as it has
been defined by the National Film Preservation Board in its studies of the audiovisual archival
field – Film Preservation 1993 and Television and Videotape Preservation 1997. As discussed
in Chapters 1 and 2, these reports set the standards and priorities for preservation in the United
States and stand as the only extensive surveys of audiovisual archival practices in the US to
date. 234 But these are the standards of preservation as articulated by the professional archives
and studios; independent media creators are named in this report, but represent a minority voice
in the conversations. As the quote at the beginning of this section illustrates there was a concern
within the media arts centers regarding the priorities defined by the Library of Congress and
National Film Preservation Board in these reports.
As Film Preservation 1993 illustrates, the preservation of nitrate film became an early
priority for film archives. However, nitrate decay was not a concern for independent producers

The Digital Dilemma report from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences provide insight into
contemporary practices in archives and commercial production venues, but did not have the same scope as the

who utilized 16mm and 8mm film stocks which were never produced on nitrate stock, rather
these films were manufactured on “safety film” or acetate-based film stock. The larger concern
for independents is the preservation of video, which is at greater risk of obsolescence. While the
reports from the National Film Preservation Board evidence of the failure of the archival field to
meet the needs of independent media creators, this fact was recognized decades earlier by the
active voices in the media arts center movement:
In the past there has been sizable support for film preservation, particularly nitrate
deterioration. The programs of the National Endowment for the Arts have really
been the backbone of the nitrate preservation effort, administered by the
American Film Institute and now by the National Center for Film and Video
Preservation. But there is no comparable program in the field of television and
video. 235
Nearly a decade before the 1993 study, the National Endowment for the Arts reported that it was
the “unresolved technical questions and the urgent demands of nitrate and color film
preservation” which lead to the channeling of funds for the preservation of these materials.
However, the Endowment argued that, “this [prioritization] should not be construed as an
attempt to minimize the need for video preservation,” rather video preservation is recognized as
a “problem of national significance.” 236
While national funding and research within the archival field was directed towards
solving the preservation challenges of film archives, preservation research was equally as active
in the independent sector who focused on areas under-represented by the mainstream reports.
One of the largest players in this preservation research was the Media Alliance, a media arts
advocacy organization in New York City. Graham Leggat, director of Media Alliance testified
before Congress as part of the hearings leading up to Television and Video Preservation 1997,

identifying two concerns of the organization, “video art works produced by national, regional
and New York artists, and community television, produced by community-based organizations
and video collectives.” Acknowledging the public funding provided by the National Endowment
for the Arts for media arts centers, Leggat continued, ”[this body of work] represents a major
investment of both public and private funds into an historical and cultural legacy that
unfortunately remains largely out of reach of both scholars and the public.” He suggests that this
work remains inaccessible because the organizations who create these collections are “unfamiliar
with moving image preservation, conservation and collection management,” and lack the
resources in staff, funding, and technology necessary to archive these materials. 237
Media Alliance began advocating for preservation of independent media much earlier. In
1991 the National Endowment for the Arts and New York Sate Council for the Arts provided
funding for a survey of the video preservation practices of 111 individuals and institutions
(predominately in the New York and the north-eastern United States), including libraries,
archives, distributors, museums, and media arts centers, followed by a symposium hosted at the
Museum of Modern Art. The resulting publication Video Preservation: Securing the Future of
the Past summarizes the major findings from these efforts related to collection building,
collections management, preservation, funding, and other “critical issues.” 238
The findings of the Media Alliance report mirror the conclusions of the 1993 and 1997
studies that followed, but are specific to the issues raised by independent and non-commercial
media makers and organizations. Cataloging and preservation funding are reoccurring themes.
While distributors and exhibitors publish catalogs of circulating materials, few guides to the

archival holdings of institutions were available. Funding for preservation was limited within
these organizations. Public funding from the New York State Council for the Arts and the
National Endowment for the Arts was available, but limited, and private money was scarce. The
report cited a single MacArthur foundation grant to the Carnegie Museums for the Andy Warhol
Collection as the only example of private funding for a video preservation or cataloging effort.239
One of the challenges to obtaining funding was defining what preservation entailed as Greg
Lukow deputy direct of National Center for Film and Video Preservation explained:
A number of preservation projects were funded through access categories of
various federal agencies, in part because they don’t quite know yet what
videotape preservation is. They’re confident about extending public funds for
film preservation, because it promises a long-term payoff of hundreds of years,
but there’s no such promise with video preservation. 240
These are concerns that were raised throughout the media arts field – the need for technological
solutions to preservation, as well as funding for preservation, cataloging, and access activities.
But where this infrastructure existed, albeit in limited form, for independent filmmakers, video
was new territory:
The preservation of film is a relatively recognized priority with known technical
solutions and standardized cataloging procedures. Video (which includes
broadcast television as well as independent video) is a field where there are as
many technical questions as there are possible solutions, where there are no
standard cataloging procedures, and where the very existence of independent
video relative to broadcast television is an issue that requires much more
education of funders and policy makers. 241

period for a cataloging project that was denied. Boyle, Video Preservation, 13.

Television and Video Preservation 1997 laid some of the groundwork for preservation activity in
this area, but media arts centers continued to advocate for preservation and contribute to
preservation research as well.
This contribution was also about self-education. There was an understanding that while
the preservation fields could provide some insight and guidance, that the media arts field could
contribute to this conversation as well. Media arts centers like San Francisco’s Bay Area Video
Coalition (BAVC) were active participants in the development of preservation interventions for
independent media.

In their 1993 report, Media Alliance described BAVC as “the only

remaining media art center with state-of-the-art video equipment and professional engineering
support” and “a likely center for a national technical preservation service.” 242 BAVC officially
began its preservation program in 1994 supported by a grant from the National Endowment for
the Arts, entering the preservation field at a moment when audiovisual preservation efforts were
focused on film and not video preservation.
In its efforts to support video preservation research, BAVC published Playback: A
Preservation Primer for Video funded by the Getty Grant Program, in 1998.

Playback brought

together experts from the video and arts conservation aimed at “develop[ing] and implement[ing]
a realistic strategy to ensure that these valuable materials [video artworks] are safeguarded for
the future.” 243 The publication begins by recognizing that a sustainable preservation strategy for
video did not exist, and further that specialized “video conservation” training had yet to be
developed. Because preservation strategies for audiovisual materials were based on the practices
developed for film preservation (cool and dry passive storage and copying of materials on to new

film-stock), at this time there was no recognized preservation strategy for videotape materials,
which must be migrated to new formats to preserve the informational and aesthetic content.244
Whereas film has an artifactual value, videotape does not. BAVC’s guide however, attempts to
describe a method of conservation for videotape materials that mirrors the active conservation
procedures practiced as part of film preservation.
Playback calls for the creation of a “new discipline within the field of conservation,”
suggesting that conservators must partner with the engineers of video technology to begin to
develop preservation models for videotape. 245

More significantly, this publication argues to

legitimize video as art suggesting that museums and other cultural institutions must also become
part of a larger infrastructure for the preservation of these art works. 246 This was the same move
made by film archivists and film enthusiasts in the 1930s as film archiving and film studies came
of age. 247 The study collection at the Museum of Modern Art is an example of these early efforts
– film was collected in order to be studied, its institutionalization in the museum context helped
to legitimize film as an object of study and as a work of art. 248 As such, film preservation, and
now video preservation, should follow the practices of conservation, that is, preservation of the
informational as well as artificatual values of the material.

244

The authors of the manual argue that “there is no strategy for working with videotape, and there is no planned,
comprehensive effort to develop specialists in video conservation.” Sally Jo Fifer, et.al, eds., Playback: A

Playback emphasizes this mode of preservation for videotape particularly in the art
museum context, suggesting that the technology, also carries an artifactual value:
The availability of videotape players, like videotape itself, is rarely considered;
the playing of videotape is thought of primarily in terms of image and sound. It is
necessary to consider both the playback equipment and the videotape when
addressing the preservation of original materials, especially installation art. 249
Here video preservation is described in relation to this original technology, preserving not only
the image and sound, but the technological context of playback as well.
But this guide is also a call for developing “realistic strategies” for the preservation of
video works, particular as technology changes at a relatively rapid pace:
While we are belatedly concerned about the fate of the works that have gone
before us, we must develop methodologies for future challenges. Unless practice
for videotape preservation begins to be articulated with a realistic look at scale
and resources, we know that tapes produced only fifteen years ago will soon be
lost forever. The institutions and individuals who oversee these tapes agree that
the need for preservation is immediate, not just for art on video, but future art
using all new technologies. 250
Here the guide recognizes this preservation challenge in technological terms, not limited to
analog carriers but acknowledging that this work will shape endeavors to preserve digital media
as well. It is the question of “realistic” and sustainable strategies that becomes a concern for
independent media. In the context of archives and museums, a conservators point of view may
be appropriate, but these are standards that cannot be met by small archives and non-archives
like media arts centers.

As a media arts center, BAVC has developed tools such as the

Audio/Visual Artifact Atlas (AVAA) for the identification of playback errors as well as the
Secure Media Network (SMN), a digital archive for the Dance Heritage Coalition, and continues
to offer “boutique” preservation strategies for independent media artists and archives. BAVC’s

practices have been informed by their constituency, but remain dedicated to a concept of
preservation suggested by the archival field. 251
Whether defined by archival practice or by media arts centers, the practice of audiovisual
media preservation is similar. In terms of storage, artifacts must be stored in stable cold and dry
environments in inert archival containers.

Preservation drives access; if stabilized in cold

storage, the materials are inaccessible, so media must be migrated to new formats, whether film
or video, in order to be used. Further, the materials must be cataloged so they are discoverable.
As these publications from BAVC and Media Alliance demonstrate, media arts centers
advocated for preservation and access of these materials alongside their archival counterparts.
The conclusions from these publications reflect the conclusions from the National Film
Preservation Board’s reports published in the same decade. These efforts emerging from the
media arts community articulate the need for preservation measures, but the guidelines align
closely with the definitions of preservation emerging from the preservation field – no localized
solutions are suggested. While being overlooked by the preservation fields, they strive to meet
their standards.

5.2

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AS ‘IMPERFECT ARCHIVES’

When preservation is viewed within this broader cultural context – the familiar conditions
prevalent in other issues shared by the independent media arts field come to the surface – access
to technology, access to funding, access to information, access to venues which enable the
expression of disparate ideas. 252
Preservation from the point of view of media arts centers is a simple concept, “ensuring
that works are not lost and are accessible for the future.” 253 However, audiovisual preservation
is a resource-heavy activity, one which has been understood as the work of other professionals
such as archivists and conservators. In Video Preservation: Securing the Future of the Past the
Media Alliance reflected “video collectors know environmental factors impact the life of tape,
yet many are uncertain what the parameters of good archival practice are,” this is the work of
archivists and conservators, trained to interact with this technology. 254

In addition,

institutionalization of independent media brings about additional political tensions, as Deirdre
Boyle observed, “given video’s roots in anti-establishment Sixties, there is an inevitable tension
between those who favor standardized, centralized, nationalized methods and those who believe
in decentralized, low-cost, low-tech, how-to alternatives.” 255 The 1997 report from the National
Film Preservation Board and more recently, the Digital Dilemma 2 from the Academy of Motion

Picture Arts and Sciences emphasize a need for similar solutions for independent and noncommercial media, but such low-cost, low-tech, h0w-to, do-it-yourself solutions are not
explored.
It is not that these methods do not exist, rather they remain unrecognized as preservation
methods as they do not meet the definition of preservation as outlined by preservation
professionals.

In an effort to acknowledge the preservation practices of resource-limited Latin

American film archives, Janet Ceja Alcalá introduces the concept of the “imperfect archives.”
The term is derived from filmmaker García Espinosa’s idea of the “imperfect cinema,” described
as such because the “approach to preserving cinema was not bound by the standards of the
professionally polished movie; [the imperfect cinema] was a cinema of hunger,” and, as such,
“[the archivists] archival codes and standards were outside of the established norm.” 256 Ceja
Alcalá defines the practice of preservation within the wider cultural context of Latin America in
archives that cannot support the standards of preservation as defined by European and North
American archival professionals.
Ceja Alcalá discusses the formation of UCAL (Unión de Cinematecas de América
Latina), a regional network of film archivists formed in Latin America in the 1960s. These
archivsts are described as "amateurs," who like those that drove the media arts centers movement
aimed to “circulate, exhibit, and care” for the films being created in their respective institutions.
This was a "filmmakers movement" regionally focused on building a national cinema and a
radical political move from the cinematheques who preserved and provided access to this
revolutionary

cinema.

Latin America,” Moving Image 13, no. 1 (Spring 2013): 81.

121

Emerging out of the radical politics of the 1960s and 70s the media arts center movement
supported an independent cinema, which like the imperfect cinema stood in opposition to
mainstream and commercial cinema. Along with the “pragmatic concerns for how to preserve
these materials,” media arts centers also began to “see preservation as politicized,”257
demonstrated by a question posed by video preservation advocate Deirdre Boyle:
what role does content play in decisions to preserve video… what role does the
Nineties’ political conservatism play in decisions about preserving early video
work, which often documented radical political activism, social change and
unlicensed creative expression during the Sixties and Seventies? 258
Much like their Latin American counterparts, each of these organizations in this study
demonstrate an understanding of the professional standards of preservation, but have developed
preservation methods and standards according to the local expertise and resources, and
philosophy of media production.
Operating as a traditional media arts center, Pittsburgh Filmmakers supports the
production regional media, offering educational opportunities, supporting local exhibition of
media, as well as providing technological and financial support for artists. While preservation is
not the focus of the organization, they have become an archives of last resort for several
collections of archival media including the film Pittsburgh produced for the city’s 1958
Bicentennial celebration.

Pittsburgh Filmmakers took custody of the film over two decades

after its production, in 1979. At that time, two new 16mm prints were created from the original
35mm negative. One of these 16mm prints was sent to Anthology Archives for preservation, but
the thirty-thousand feet of original negatives, workprints, and outtakes remained untouched. At

the time, representatives of Pittsburgh Filmmakers articulated a plan to index and catalog the
footage, however this project would remain unrealized until 2008.259
Executive director Charlie Humphrey explained that he attempted to identify a funding
source for the preservation of the film throughout his tenure with the organization. 260 But, it was
not until the 250th anniversary of the city's founding in 2008 that Humphrey was able to
successfully raise the necessary funds to inspect and digitize the film. During this 2008 project
the original elements were cleaned and inspected and the original negatives were used to create a
high definition digital video copy of the film. 261 It was during this inspection of the original
elements that an alternate version of the film was uncovered. 262 These trims and outtakes were
also digitized and utilized as part of the Pittsburgh Reframed at 250 project in which local artists
were asked to reuse aspects of the Pittsburgh footage to create new two minute and fifty second
short films celebrating Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Reframed shorts were screened
during the city-wide 250th celebration and released on DVD.
Aspects of this digitization project closely resemble film preservation as it is defined
within the archival context. The original negatives, and not the 16mm reduction print from the
1970s, were inspected, cleaned, and digitized to create a new access copy of the film. During
this process the original aesthetics of the film were also respected, including an attempt to correct
the color of the film that had faded with time. However, this preservation project falls short of

Humphrey recalled applying to the National Endowment for the Arts for preservation support, but could not
remember why the grant was rejected. He believes it was due to a failure of the granting agency to recognize the
significance of the film. Interview with the author, July 11, 2013.

123

the archival definition as a new film copy was not created and the film has not been passively
preserved in properly controlled archival storage.
The focus of the Reframed project was access and reuse of the material. The original
medium was not important to Pittsburgh Filmmakers. For those creating the Reframed shorts,
the film medium is meaningless as most contemporary artists are working with digital video.
Digitized, the film became accessible to the wider Pittsburgh community and could be screened
and distributed on DVD, and further the digitized scans of the negatives and outtakes allowed
artists to reuse the material and create new works reframing this footage in a contemporary
context.
Archivist Sean Kilcoyne acknowledges Pittsburgh Filmmaker’s attempt to make the film
widely accessible to general audiences, suggesting that as a media arts center without a mission
or mandate for preservation the organization has done "remarkably well" as custodians of the
film.

However, Kilcoyne expresses a greater concern for the inaccessibility of the original

elements that have not been digitized, cataloged, or stored in an "archival manner," and argues
that while the digitization can be understood as the first steps towards preservation, that film
remains "unpreserved." Writing from an archivists' perspective Kilcyone further advocates for
the film, and its "specific archival needs," arguing:
at a minimum, film elements should be inspected and cataloged; new elements
should be created photochemically and stored in secure, climate-controlled
facilities; and issues of access should be creatively resolved so that in addition to
a digital version of the film being made available, Pittsburgh can be seen on the
screen, at last, in 35mm. 263
While these recommendations are sound, they illustrate the tension between the practices at
media arts centers and archival institutions. While the original elements of Pittsburgh have not

263

Kilcoyne, “Pittsburgh (1959),” 87.

124

been fully cataloged or digitized, the film is now accessible in digital form. The film has also
been listed in Rick Prelinger's 2006 Field Guide to Sponsored Films, a catalog of industrial and
institutional films, underwritten by the National Film Preservation Foundation. 264

Charlie

Humphrey also suggested that the film is open to anyone who is interested in conducting further
research. In this sense, Pittsburgh is open and accessible, at least more accessible than it would
be in cold storage in an archival facility. It is this continued access to the informational content
of Pittsburgh and the ability to reuse and transform this work that is significant in this example;
as Humphrey explained, "I think we [Pittsburgh Filmmakers] do have a responsibility to
continue to revisit that film and to find way to reflect Pittsburgh back to itself." 265
Preservation at Termite Television closely resembles the practices at Pittsburgh
Filmmakers – the original media does not dictate the preservation method for the material. In
fact, all documentation deemed to be archival by the collective (moving image or otherwise) is
digitized and linked to the collective's website termite.org.

Over the past two decades the

collective has been more conscious of their efforts to preserve the history of the organization,
making appraisal decisions about the documentation that is digitized and displayed on the
website. Artifacts that cannot be digitized are displayed in a museum-of-sorts on designated
shelving at the entrance to Termite TV’s office.

Figure 4. Termite TV’s Living Documentary Exhibit 266

The Termite Television Collective philosophy is influenced by film critic Manny
Farber’s idea of “termite art” which “moves always forward, eating its own boundaries, and
likely as not, leaves nothing in its path but evidence of eager, industrious, unkempt activities.”267
As a small group of media artists, Termite TV breaks from the traditional media arts center
model, operating as “laboratory,” as described by founder Michael Kuetemeyer. At Termite TV
media production is less about the end result and more about the process of production and
continual experimentation with new models for media. In this way, the collective is always
learning, changing and adapting, and looking forward to the next project, as such
experimentation and immediacy are part of the aesthetic of Termite TV productions. These are
not polished media products, nor are they intended to be.

The five-minute Life Story model illustrates this point. Originally this template for
production was utilized as part the collective’s Living Documentary Tour. 268 Modeled on a
circus or traveling performance, the collective traveled the United States in 1999 gathering fiveminute stories, documenting the thoughts and histories of willing participants as the millennium
approached. This Life Story model grew from the need to make an immediate connection with
the communities the collective was visiting as they toured the country.

The format is simple,

each interviewee is placed in front of a camera (wherever they may be, whether it is playground,
or a jail cell, or in their own home) and is asked to tell their story in five minutes. The success of
this model for the Living Documentaries Tour has inspired the collective to continue gathering
Life Stories. The videos are now available through a web portal that allows users to sort the
stories by name or location, creating new meaning as they navigate the ever-growing collection
of interviews. 269 The simplicity and intimacy of this model has allowed Termites to adapt this
model for use in media literacy workshops as well, inspiring new projects like Messages in
Motion.

Messages in Motion further experiments with the Living Documentaries model at a

local level; the blue Messages in Motion Van, outfitted for video production, travels throughout
Philadelphia bringing the tools of production to community groups that create video postcards to
tell their stories. 270
It is this continual experimentation and growth that inspires the collective, thus the idea
of preservation is antithetical to the Termite TV philosophy. However, in 2003 “something

interesting happened,” as Termite Anula Shetty explained; during this time the collective was
developing programming related to the current Gulf War and began looking back at the
programming that the collective had produced during the Desert Storm Conflict in the 1990s.271
Shetty explained that this was the first time the collective considered the preservation of their
work, “before we weren’t thinking about archiving, but seeing those two shows juxtaposed – the
new work and the old work – that’s when we realized this is really valuable.” 272 It was at this
point that the collective began a more conscious effort to collect and preserve the work that they
create.
The Termite aesthetic carries though to the preservation of this work; the glitches, fallout, and degradation on the videotapes are transferred to the digital copy and become part of the
record. There is no attempt to restore and correct the damage that has occurred as the physical
videotapes are digitized with the tools that the collective has available. While the physical tapes
are stored at the Termite TV office, the digitized works are made available through termite.org
using a variety of web-based freeware such as Blip, You Tube, iTunes, Vimeo, Wordpress, and
Durpal. Much like the development of other Termite TV projects, the archive is approached
with the same experimentation and immediacy. The focus here is on providing continued access
to the works, rather than preserving a pristine copy of an idealized original.
The collective does have an understanding of the steps that ‘should’ be taken to preserve
their works, but does not have the resources to preserve the original materials in cold storage or
create high-resolution preservation copies that meet the archival standards. Collective members
discussed the preservation programs offered by the BAVC, but the preservation options offered

by the media arts center remain unattainable with Termite’s limited resources. Instead, the
collective preserves their work according to their own standards and capabilities.

When

discussing the other options explored by the collective Shetty and Kuetemeyer explained, “it
would be nice to have someone fixing the dropouts and things like that, but on the other hand all
the digital artifacts that are there are part of the Termite way of looking at it.” 273 These
‘imperfections’ become part of the history of the archive, evidence of the preservation process,
and of the resourcefulness of the collective to work with the tools they have available to provide
continued access to their work.
While Paper Tiger Television shares this same do-it-yourself ethos of media production,
the collective has attempted to formalize the preservation process meeting the standards set by
the preservation field. Since the mid-1990s the collective has worked from a common space on
Layfatte Street in New York City. Like Termite TV, this space serves as a meeting site for
collective members, a workspace for editing, and as the administrative office for the collective.
The space also houses over three-hundred videotapes representing thirty years of Paper Tiger
Television productions along with external hard-drives and computers storing recent
productions. Founding Tiger, DeeDee Halleck expressed concerns for the physical preservation
of the materials in this space.

She explained that with the limited resources of the collective,

maintaining a stable environment for the tapes has been impossible. Recently, she used her
personal funds to purchase a new window air conditioning unit, to keep the space comfortable
for the collective members. The windows in the space are an additional concern for Halleck as
they introduce heat and sunlight which also pose a risk for the videotape collection.

273

Anula Shetty and Michael Kuetemeyer, interview with the author, August 8, 2013.

129

This inability of the collective to maintain a preservation environment for the collection
was one of the reasons cited for the recent donation of the master videotapes to the Fales Library
and Special Collections at New York University in 2010. This was not the first time that the
collective explored the option of donating materials to an archival repository to ensure the
continued preservation of these works.

In a 1998 letter discussing the preservation the

Communications Update master tapes produced in the early 1980s, the collective suggested it
was “ill-equipped to archive [the tapes] and make them publically accessible.”

274

During this

time, the collective was working to raise funds to conduct an internal preservation assessment of
the materials and to catalog their growing videotape collection according to MARC cataloging
standards, however the physical preservation and transfer of the materials to sustainable formats
was still beyond the capabilities of the collective.
In order to achieve these goals, the collective recognized that they would require the
assistance of an archival institution. Paper Tiger representatives began negotiations with New
York University’s Tamiment Institute Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives seeking an
arrangement that would provide secure and climate-controlled facilities for the master videotapes
as well as a means for providing access to these works through the creation of new transfers.
While the Tamiment Library expressed an interest in the collectives’ paper records, the
videotapes were a subject for concern:
[The archivist] told you that he was definitely interested in the program
documentation files and that there was no reason that these materials, which have
none of the preservation and funding issues associated with the programs
themselves (described below), could be donated to Tamiment immediately, if
Paper Tiger desires.

130

That said, there are some major issues that would need to be addressed and
resolved, by both parties, before the major part of the donation (the programs)
could be considered. They revolve around the costs (in terms of both time and
money) of such a project and copyright considerations. 275
The curator for nonprint collections, suggested that the library and archives were no
better equipped to preserve and archive the videotape materials from Paper Tiger’s collections,
citing the lack of properly controlled environmental storage and technology required to migrate
and clean the videotape materials. 276 The cost of preservation in this case, outweighed the
benefits of accessioning the collection.
Until Paper Tiger found a home for its collection in 2010 with the Fales Library and
Special Collections, the collective worked to preserve and catalog their videotape collection to
the best of their ability with the assistance of the Media Alliance. This began with a fundraising
effort dubbed “The Year of the Tiger,” which solicited funding to support the assessment of
materials by collective members and interns, the creation of a MARC compatible catalog using a
FileMaker Pro Database template developed for media arts centers by the Media Alliance and

276
The curator suggests that at present a preservation strategy does not exist for video: “I remind you that
although I use the term ‘preservation’ in connection with video, this is only a kind of shorthand. At present there
is no definitive way to preserve video archivally, other than transfer it to film, which is prohibitively expensive; the
best one can do is to clean and maintain original tapes and remaster them onto the best media then available
(both in terms of physical durability and the amount of hardware available in the world to play it back), and store
them in climate-controlled facilities.” Letter from Tamiment Institute Library/Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives

IMAP (Independent Media Arts Preservation), and the transfer of the videos onto digital
formats. 278 As a means for guiding this preservation workflow, the collective printed extensive
instructions, similar to the archival workflow outlined in the National Film Preservation’s Film
Preservation Guide. 279 Interns were first instructed to watch each video and record information
about the condition of the tape using the “Tape Documentation Form” and the “Video Glitch
Glossary” (see Appendix D). This information was then used to catalog the materials and
prioritize digitization. Using the resources and technology available within the collective, the
tapes were then migrated to digital formats. 280
DeeDee Halleck explained that Mona Jimenez (former director of Media Alliance and
IMAP) assisted Paper Tiger in developing their in-house preservation program and has helped
many groups like Paper Tiger to get the “right sort of preservation” for their materials. 281 Yet,
another Paper Tiger affiliate working for the Metropolitan Museum of Art expressed some
concern over the digitization of the materials, which was not completed to archival standards,
suggesting that the collective should have consulted a professional who could have better
assisted in the design of a preservation workflow that would meet archival standards. 282

As the digitization was limited by technology and disk-space available to the collective, the videotapes were
digitized using compressed video codex, which reduce the quality of the video in order to reduce the size of the
video file. Archival standards suggest the use of uncompressed codex which preserves the integrity of the
original.

The restoration of Pittsburgh revealed similar tensions between the professional archival
standards and the standards that are attainable within media arts centers. Paper Tiger’s records
demonstrate that the collective had a sophisticated knowledge of preservation and understood the
archival standards. 283

The collective sought the advice of professional archivists and

conservators, who could not suggest feasible solutions for preservation within their means. Like
Termite, services such as those provided by BAVC were too expensive for the collective.
Chicago’s Video Databank has preserved a handful of Paper Tiger’s videotapes, but the
collective devised its own means of preservation through in-house digitization for the remainder
of the collection.

5.3

THE MEDIUM IS NOT THE MESSAGE

[Preservation] might at first glance seem an odd concern for groups which have only been
around for ten or fifteen years, but a harder look tells a different story. …[These] groups face a
different kind of preservation problem: their archives contain materials documenting the
development of their regional or ethnic communities – film footage and videotape not more than
twenty years old, and so not threatened with imminent chemical disintegration, but in jeopardy
nonetheless, as underfunded groups struggle to properly store, catalog and make accessible
material that should be in active use by scholars, researchers, and media artists.284
Media theorist Marshall McLuhan argued that “the medium is the message;” audiovisual
archivists have embraced his philosophy which suggests that the informational content of a
record is bound to the medium on which it is imprinted.

However, the preservation efforts

within the cases here demonstrate that in some instances, it is the informational content and not

related to the preservation.

the preservation of the media artifact that should take precedence. While it is certainly true that
some films may require preservation as works of art and thus be preserved on the original
medium, audiovisual preservation need not be defined by the medium in all cases.
Through their efforts to meet the preservation standards as defined by archival
professionals, media arts centers have developed localized practices which adhering to their
individual philosophies and standards. These are deliberate efforts to extend the life of the media
in their collections, and more importantly, to make these collections accessible to others.

It is

the continued access and re-use of the informational content of the media collections which is
most significant here.
Yet, these collections are vulnerable. These media arts centers have actively engaged in
the development of local solutions that are working for the short term, but as Kate Horsfield of
the Video Data Bank argues, “without access to low-cost technologies and services we will be
buffeted by the gatekeepers who decide which programs are important,” and which survive. 285
The ephemerality of audiovisual media inherently puts these collections at risk, though in some
cases, like Termite TV, this decay and eventual loss may be understood as part of the process.
For cases like Paper Tiger Television who understand their archive to contain not only the
history of the collective but also the histories of the communities they have documented, this fear
of loss outweighs any desire to maintain local control of the collection. In this case, the
collective chose to transfer custody of their collection to an organization that could provide
proper environmental storage, but with the loss of control and access. 286

In her discussion of the imperfect archive Ceja Alcalá concludes, “the history of the
archival experience of Latin American countries and institutions …is a call for archivists,
educators, and scholars to take into account the nuances of preservation practice in different
settings in relation to the cultures of cinematic practice that created them.” 287 Media arts centers
exemplify this need to pluralize preservation practices and to recognize the context and practices
of creation as significant to the preservation of these materials.
From the archival perspective, the practice of preservation is a constant give and take
between preservation and access. Archival materials must be carefully preserved to ensure their
longevity, yet the use of the materials introduces contaminants and dangers that may destroy the
records.

Further, archival preservation is predicated on the continued preservation of the

original, but in the case of audiovisual materials, there is no single original. The practice of
audiovisual archiving has been further defined by the preservation of the filmic object. To
preserve an audiovisual record is to preserve a fictionalized original, an ideal copy of a record
that will always exist in multiples. During preservation, both the aesthetic and informational
values of this original must be retained.

As publications from the media arts field have

demonstrated, in theory media arts centers adhere to this archival ideal (exemplified by BAVC’s
Playback), but as this chapter has demonstrated, in practice a different set of values emerges.
Preservation is instead defined entirely by the informational content of the audiovisual record.
While the aesthetic values are preserved when financially and technically possible, it is the
transfer of the information contained on the tapes, reels, and filmstrips that is privileged here.
Counter to the accepted philosophy of audiovisual archives, the original medium does not dictate

287

Ceja Alcalá, “Imperfect Archives,” 92.

136

the preservation medium. 288

The medium that will provide immediate accessibility to the

informational content is preferred over the medium that will ensure that all of the original
aesthetic and artifactual values have been retained.
This suggests for audiovisual archives (at least those desiring to function as archives and
not as museums) that in many cases, the original medium does not dictate the mode of
preservation, opening the possibility for archives to look to more affordable and accessible
methods of migration and digital preservation, rather than relying on costly transfers to obsolete
media (i.e. film to film transfers) to preserve the artifactual values of the original.
While media arts centers attempt to meet the standards established by the preservation
community because they understand the fragility of the medium, these standards are too resource
dependent to be attainable and limit access to collections. While cold storage may prolong the
life of the materials, such passive preservation efforts make the materials inaccessible for use.
The active preservation models that insist upon the migration of audiovisual materials to
contemporary materials with respect to the original media are equally unsuited here. In the case
of media arts centers, it is not necessary to expend these resources to ensure that the work is
experienced in the same material context in which it was created, rather it is more important that
these collections continue to be accessible in order to uphold the missions of these organizations
– to establish an alternative to the mainstream.

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AND MEDIA LITERACY

Changes in technology seem to hit like hurricanes… Like a hurricane, technology isn’t going
anywhere, it’s going everywhere. Unlike a hurricane, it will never stop. How do nonprofit
media arts organizations cope with this mischievous force? By accepting the fact that change is
a constant in media arts. We must acclimate ourselves and our organizations to changes in
technology. If the hurricane is expected, and accepted, its still a big blow, but risks can be
minimized. 289
Technology plays a powerful role in the preservation of audiovisual media.

Leo

Enticknap observed, “cinema is virtually unique among art forms and recording media in the
complexity of and extent to which it depends on the combination of technologies used in the
creation, distribution, and exhibition of its core product.” 290 As the last chapter illustrated, the
preservation of audiovisual media is closely tied to these technologies. Manuals developed for
film archivists address not only the chemical and material makeup of the media, but also the
various technologies necessary to inspect and access archival audiovisual materials.

The

National Film Preservation Foundation’s Film Preservation Guide introduces archivists to the
technology necessary for a minimal film inspection (rewinds, projection reels, cores, split reels,
splicers, sound readers, and footage counters), as well as more advanced processes offered by
labs (wet-gate and optical printing, redimensioning, and digital restoration techniques). The

Guide also addresses the visual identification of various formats and technologies, such as
magnetic and optical soundtracks, negative and reversal film stock, as well as methods for dating
film from date codes imprinted by the manufacturer. 291

More advanced manuals, such as

Restoration of Motion Picture Film, describe the chemical composition of the film base
(including diagrams of the molecular structure of the plastics), as well as the mechanics of
cameras, projectors, and sound equipment.292

And, projection manuals, such as Torkell

Sætervadent’s publications from the International Federation of Film Archivists (FIAF), assume
that film archivists and curators must have intimate knowledge of the design and operation of
projection systems as well. 293
These manuals emphasize the technical proficiency archival professionals must have to
complete even a simple inspection of audiovisual materials. This specialized knowledge of
cameras, projectors, playback equipment, and recording media is one shared by the creators of
media as well. As access points for media technology and its products, media arts centers have
developed methods for teaching audiences to watch and critique media, alongside methods for
instructing novice users to create and produce media. This chapter will explore these training
opportunities developed at each of the media arts centers through their approaches to creating
and exhibiting media.

HOW TO MAKE INDEPENDENT MEDIA

The artistic future of the motion picture in America rests in the hands of the amateur.
-C. Adolph Glassgold, 1929 294
The difference between regular broadcast-TV, educational-TV, and Guerrilla Television, is this:
The networks are run by people who operate the cameras in their own interest. Educational-TV
is where Liberals demand the cameras to operate in the people’s interest. And Guerrilla
Television gets cameras to the people to let them do it themselves.
-Michael Shamberg, Guerrilla Television, 1971 295
The first small-gauge film stocks were produced in 1909 and were quickly followed by
the production of consumer grade recording and playback technology. Film historian JanChristopher Horak credits Eastman Kodak’s introduction of 16mm film and the Cine-Kodak
camera in 1924 with popularizing early amateur and avant-garde production in the United
States. 296 Guides and manuals, such as James Cameron’s 1928 Amateur Movie Craft, also date
to this decade.

Cameron’s guide introduces “take-your-own-movie-fans” to basic film

technology, including cameras, film stocks, projectors, lenses, and lights.

The guide also

discusses the use of this technology, from how to use the camera, how to compose and light
shots, and how to project the finished product. Similar guides, such as Kodak’s How to Make
Good Home Movies, provided a technical introduction for the average home movie maker
including an introduction to the camera, lenses, lighting and framing techniques, as well as

projection and maintenance, helping to popularize the practice of creating home movies, while
advertising Kodak’s products. 297
Guides such as Raymond Spottiswoode’s Film and Its Techniques and Lenny Lipton’s
1972 Independent Film Making are intended for avant-garde filmmakers, documentarians, and
university film students, addressing “practical problems likely to be encountered by the smaller
production unit.” 298

Spottiswoode’s text begins by reminding the reader of the highly

specialized knowledge required to produce a film: “technically, film making is immensely
complicated, by far exceeding any of the other arts in range of scientific processes and
manipulation of mechanical skills.” 299 These texts cover the mechanics of filmmaking from the
hardware (cameras, lab processing, editing equipment, and projectors), to the software (film
stocks, recorded sound media, and the material makeup of the media), as well as the production
process (storyboarding, scriptwriting, distribution, exhibition).
Media arts centers prevailed at this technologically dependent art, deferring the cost of
media production by providing equipment rentals and funding for artists, technology instruction,
and mechanisms for distribution and exhibition. Media arts centers and media arts collectives
also published their own guides to media production, addressing to an audience seeking outlets
for media creation that did not conform to the commercial norms – repurposing the technology
of media production for larger aims.

Artist Michael Shamberg and the Raindance Corporation published Guerrilla Television,
a manual/manifesto illustrating the use of television as an “information tool,” in 1971.

The

publication begins with a “meta-manual” outlining the philosophy of Guerrilla Media. Guerrilla
Television is a guide to creating feedback loops in the commercially dominated media culture of
“Media-America,” aiming to arm media producers with the tools that they need to take control of
the country’s communication channels. This manual is not simply an instruction booklet for how
to create home movies or amateur productions, nor is it simply an expression of the desires of a
counter-culture. Instead, this guide advocates for democratic access and use of information
channels:
No alternate cultural vision is going to succeed in Media-American unless it has
its own alternate information structures, not just alternate content pumped across
the existing ones. And that’s what videotape, with Cable-TV and videocassettes,
is ultimately all about. Not Polaroid movies. 300
Reflecting the aims of the media arts center movement, Shamberg calls for the creation of new
information infrastructures that support local and regional media production, referred to here as
“grassroots television” that “works with people, not from up above them.” 301

Guerrilla

Television is also described as “Do-It-Yourself Television” or ”two-way television.” While the
meta-manual outlines this philosophy, advocating for the development of an infrastructure for
supporting the production of media at this level, the manual also addresses the practical use of
the technology to meet these ends.
With its emphasis on technology, the “Manual” section of Guerrilla Television is similar
to other filmmaking manuals published at this time.

The tools and technology of media

production are described in great detail: how to select the right medium, use the technology,

manipulate the image, secure funding and distribution outlets, and provide training for others.
However, youth oriented workshops are described here as well. These workshops demonstrate a
particular concern for providing technology training for the next generation of Americans
growing up in a media saturated world. The workshops described here emphasize the creation
of media as a community activity. 302

Unlike the traditional training manuals, Guerrilla

Television reflects the aims of the media arts center movement, which was seeking to develop
regional resources for local media creation. Access (having the means to create media) and
distribution (having the work seen by an audience) are the primary concerns here.

However,

Guerrilla Television is also about the creation of a larger infrastructure supporting these
functions.

The manual discusses the creation of storefront theaters, localized networks in

apartment buildings, mobile screenings, as well as the use of public access cable, suggesting the
use of media technology in creative ways.
Another interesting example of these manuals is The Spaghetti City Video Manual: A
Guide to Use, Repair and Maintenance published by media center and video collective
VideoFreex in 1973. This publication is less manifesto and more manual, the opposite of
Shamberg’s Guerrilla Television. Much like the traditional production guides, the manual opens
with a discussion of the hardware and software of media production, designed to “open up some
options for people who want to become more self-sufficient with their video hardware.” 303

The

manual is divided into four sections (Theory, Systems, Basic Maintenance and, Not So Basic
Maintenance), introducing the basics of video technology from the hardware and software
systems, from how a video signal is encoded onto the magnetic media, to discussions of editing,

broadcasting, and distribution. Like Guerrilla Television, the VideoFreex’s manual is directed
towards those users who may be unfamiliar with "video spaghetti," that is all of the wires, cables,
connectors and other hardware associated with video production, which is "unfamiliar because
the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of it hasn’t been available in any comprehensive form,” especially to those
working with the "low-cost" technologies available to amateurs and independents. 304
These manuals aim to educate potential users of media technology, providing a how-to
guide for the use of media technologies, while advocating for new uses of the tools of the
commercial media. While media arts centers provide access to these tools, the manuals
described here demonstrate that a certain knowledge and understanding of the technology was
required as well. This skill set is often referred to as 'visual literacy' or 'media literacy.'

6.2

VISUAL AND MEDIA LITERACY

The visual literacy movement was contemporaneous to the media arts center movement.
Educator John L. Debes is credited with introducing the concept of visual literacy in the early
1960s. Visual literacy emerged as a concern for school-aged children who were coming of age
in a media dominated environment – particularly television. Debes suggests a hierarchy of skills
that a visually literate person should possess, including the ability to distinguish: light from dark,
differences in brightness, similarities in shape and size, hues from grays, distance, height, and
depth. Also included in these competencies is the ability to interpret and describe sequences of

304

VideoFreex, The Spaghetti City Video Manual, 2. “Spaghetti” is in reference to a skit from the Tonite Show with
Jack Parr where Italian peasants were harvesting spaghetti from a Spaghetti Tree. The manual explain that
viewers unfamiliar with the “technology of spaghetti” didn’t understand the joke.

144

images and body language. 305 The emphasis here is on the ability to interpret visual cues and
elements of visual modes of communication, as Debes explains:
Visual Literacy refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can
develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory
experiences. The development of these competencies is fundamental to normal
human learning. When developed, they enable a visually literate person to
discriminate and interpret the visible actions, objects, symbols, natural or manmade, that he encounters in his environment. Through the creative use of these
competencies, he is able to communicate with others. Through the appreciative
use of these competencies, he is able to comprehend and enjoy the masterworks of
visual communication. 306
Visual literacy in this sense focuses on the skills necessary to 'read' or interpret the visual
elements of an image. These are skills that the consumer of images must possess to make sense
of the informational content of the image. Debes presumes that interpreting an image requires a
different skill set and knowledge, that not unlike reading text, must be learned.
This same skill set is emphasized in the archival literature.

Visual literacy here is

described as “the ability to understand and use images and to think and learn in terms of
images.”307 Similarly, these definitions are written for consumers of images, and not makers,
emphasizing the skills required to interpret the information within a photograph or moving
image, rather than an understanding of the technologies required to make such images.

The

concept of visual literacy from this perspective assumes that one should be able to interpret the
messages encoded on visual media, the informational content.

In 2011 the Board of Directors of the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL) endorsed the “Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education,” which
suggests new literacy skills required for the twenty-first century, as “new digital technologies
have made it possible for almost anyone to create and share visual media.” The visual literacy
competencies are designed to complement and build upon the ACRL’s “Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education” with a focus on visual information. 308 The ACRL
defines visual literacy as “ a set of abilities that enables an individual to effectively find,
interpret, evaluate, use, and create images and visual media.” These skills “equip a learner to
understand and analyze the contextual, cultural, ethical, aesthetic, intellectual, and technical
components involved in the production and use of visual materials.” 309 Here, visual literacy
includes both the technical skills required to create visual media, as well as those skills necessary
to interpret and use such materials. As with other definitions of visual literacy, the ACRL
competencies seek to establish educational standards that support the development of “critical
consumers” of visual media who can become “competent contributor(s) to a body of shared
knowledge and culture.”
By including the skill-set necessary to create media alongside those necessary to use and
interpret visual media, the ACRL recognizes the need for literate individuals to not only read, but
also write with visual media. In this sense, this definition overlaps with definitions of media
literacy, a similar concept that includes the “knowledge, skills, and competencies that are
required in order to use and interpret media.” Here media is broadly defined, including all

“visual and aural forms of communication,” – video, television, cinema, radio, photography,
advertising, newspapers and magazines, recorded music, computer games, and the Internet. 310
The National Association for Media Literacy Education similarly suggests that media literacy is
a “necessary, inevitable, and realistic response to the complex, ever-changing electronic
environment and communication cornucopia that surround us.” 311 Unlike visual literacy, media
literacy is more often connected with the competencies of media creation, closely associated with
media production courses and workshops offered to non-professionals, particularly school-aged
children, while visual literacy is often used in context of consuming images on television or in
print.
With the ACRL’s updated guidelines, both media and visual literacy suggest a level of
technical competency with the visual materials.
“technological literacy.”

These skills have also been described as

This set of competencies is commonly associated with the STEM

fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), however contextualizing technology
in this way limits the scope of how ‘technology’ is defined. ‘Technology’ often connotes “hightech” technologies, rather than acknowledging other cultural objects such as books, photographs,
and indigenous artifacts. 312

Broadly defined, technology includes “everything that humans do

or make to change the natural environment to suit their own purposes,” yet technological literacy

remains closely connected to scientific literacy, historical literacy, and design thinking.313
Broadly defined, technological literacy is, “general understanding of technology… developed
enough so that a person can function effectively in a technology-dependent society where rapid
technological change is the norm.” 314 Similar to media literacy, technological literacy assumes
that one has a basic knowledge about the design and use of the technology, the ability to use
technology, as well as the ability to “think critically” about technology and its impact on society.
In each of these examples ‘literacy’ is used as a means for defining a set of skills to be taught in
conjunction with reading and writing that assist the ‘reader’ with the ability to understand both
the technology and its products as socially constructed.
As this brief survey of literacies demonstrates, these are fluid and dynamic terms whose
meanings have changed and adapted to the technological landscape over time. The International
Visual Literacy Association suggests that it is the interdisciplinary nature of visual literacy that
has lead to the variances among definitions of the concept; as society shapes the use and
development of new technologies, new literacies continue to evolve. 315 Despite these variances,
these concepts acknowledge the need for a different set of skills and knowledge to work with and
interpret the various communications employed in our day-to-day lives.

These technologies, their products, and artifacts must be critically consumed, not
passively used, to enable the democratic use and access of these technologies by all.

The

educational missions of each of the cases in this study support a similar concept of visual and
media literacy.

6.3

VISUAL LITERACY AND MEDIA ARTS CENTERS

People are very media-aware – how to translate that into new roles for media arts centers? New
kinds of networks are coming into being, and media arts centers will be key players in that
process. There’s been a real democratizing of video in the last five or six years: there are a few
million camcorders out there now. How do media arts centers fit in? As editing centers for
public use? As downlink centers? When they figure it out, it will bring new money, new ideas,
and new blood into the field.” 316
Whether defined as technological, media, or visual literacy, by promoting these skills
media arts centers promote the reading and writing of culture with media technologies. Literacy,
as described in the context of media arts centers, takes the form of “critical media literacy,” that
“teaches students to learn from media, to resist media manipulation, and to use media materials
in constructive ways,” while “concerned with developing skills that will help create good citizens
and make them more motivated and competent participants in social life.” 317 The development
of how-to manuals, like those published by Shamberg and the Videofreex, is just one of the
methods of media literacy instruction employed by media arts centers.

Through media

production, education initiatives, and exhibition, the media arts centers in this study embrace

literacy as part of their mission create an informed audience of media consumers and producers
who can use media to enact change.

6.3.1

Programming Literacy

The traditional approaches to visual literacy emphasize the reading and interpretation of
visual media over producing or writing media.

Paper Tiger Television’s first programming

series operated on this philosophy, developing programming that critiqued the media being
broadcast by commercial networks and teaching viewers to become active consumers of media,
as stated in the Paper Tiger Manifesto:
Paper Tiger Television is a public access TV show. It looks at the
communications industry via the media in all of their forms. The power of mass
culture rests on the trust of the public. This legitimacy is a paper tiger.
Investigation into the corporate structures of the media and critical analysis of
their content is one way to demystify the information industry. Developing a
critical consciousness about the communications industry is a necessary first step
towards democratic control of information resources. 318
Founded by a group of activist artists with a desire to “smash the myths of the information
industry,” Paper Tiger sought to challenge the messages broadcast by commercial television.
Here, the program becomes a means for educating critical consumers, who may then be inspired
to take up the same tools to create their own media.
The first Paper Tiger Television episodes achieved these aims in two ways, first, as open
readings of ‘the media’ on Communications Update. Opening with the question “It’s 8:30 do
you know where your brains are?,” this weekly program, invited guests to perform a critical
reading of the mass media. In each episode, a new critic (communications theorists, film

scholars, and sociologists) read aloud from publications such as The New York Times, Rolling
Stone, Newsweek, and The Wall Street Journal, openly critiquing the printed mass media. While
the collective recognized that many people were skeptical of the messages broadcast by ‘the
media,’ there was an assumption that a critical viewer must be taught to read between the lines so
to speak, to look beyond the polished messages in these popular media outlets: “The next time a
viewer reads a publication that was covered on Paper Tiger, each ad and each article becomes a
reinforcement of the critical reading.” 319
Along with this discussion of the informational content of media products, the visual
aesthetics of the show also attempted to demystify the production of television.

Founding Tiger

DeeDee Halleck explained that many cable access shows mimicked the aesthetic of commercial
broadcasts – setting up panels of speakers in-front of plain backdrops, mimicking a news
broadcast, or placing interviewees between two ferns against a black backdrop for a chat-show
style interview.

Paper Tiger broke this mold, creating colorful hand-made sets and props and

allowing for other production “transgressions” to be broadcast (e.g. sound cues and camera shots
of the crew). This do-it-yourself aesthetic encouraged others to attempt to create their own sets
and develop programming without matching the polished aesthetics of commercial television.
As described by collective members, the “cartoony backdrops, hand-held graphics, and
handmade feel [were] designed to inspire viewers to believe that they [could] make media
too.” 320

In addition to these aesthetic elements, the exact cost of the production was also

319

publications produced by the collective. Internal documents such as meeting minutes were distributed to
collective members mimeographed with stamped and hand-drawn graphics. Examples can be found in the
archival materials housed at the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University. Images of the
props and sets from the collective’s thirtieth anniversary exhibit at New York University’s Bobst Library can be
found at “Paper Tiger Exhibit,” http://www.papertigerexhibit.blogspot.com.

publicized at the end of each episode to emphasize the ease in which community television could
be made. Both the critical reading and the DIY aesthetics of the show served as Brechtian means
of breaking down the ‘third wall’ and creating a space for viewers to think more critically about
the production of media.
Termite Television embraces a similar production philosophy, suggesting in their
manifesto, “the observer is part of the experiment.”

321

Like Paper Tiger Television, Termite

Television productions embrace a playful, un-polished aesthetic.

Termite Television’s first

experiment was the series This is Only A Test, broadcast on Drexel University’s cable access
channel DUTV. Each collective member produced a segment of a twenty-eight minute episode
centered on a particular theme or topic. This is Only a Test critiqued representations of gender,
consumerism, and television, as well as national elections and local politics. 322 The 1992 “Gulf
War” program exemplified this particular Termite model. In this iteration of This is Only a Test,
cable news footage was repurposed and remixed as viewers are asked to look at these
mainstream representations in a new way.
Like Paper Tiger, Termite re-uses commercial media and transforms it, critiquing the
messages being broadcast as a means for educating passive consumers of media. As c0-founder
Michael Kuetemeyer explained, “the Termite way of looking… is not meant to be sharp.”
Termite productions demonstrate the playfulness and resourcefulness of the collective.

Much

like Paper Tiger’s handmade props the unpolished aesthetic of Termite TV is part necessity and
part transparency. Kuetemeyer suggested, perhaps “hooking-in the audience is not what you’re
after.” The Termite Way of Looking is intended to leave the audience with questions and a sense

that the problem hasn’t been solved, as a means for inspiring the audience to take action. Like
Paper Tiger the flaws are emphasized so that the viewer becomes an active participant in the
creation of meaning.
At first glance, Pittsburgh Filmmakers appears to emulate the passive modes of
viewership constructed by commercial media outlets. While independently produced, the media
created here often strives for the polished look of commercial media products. While Pittsburgh
Filmmakers specializes in exhibiting productions that are not distributed to multiplexes and
commercially owned movie-houses, Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ theaters reinforce the established
look-and-feel of the commercialized moving-going experience.

However, Pittsburgh

Filmmakers also supports modes of exhibition that support the active engagement of audiences
within these traditional venues.
Film Kitchen functions much like a small-scale film festival. The monthly screening
started with the vision of Bill O’Driscoll, Arts and Entertainment Editor of Pittsburgh’s City
Paper, about fifteen years ago as an outlet for the local film and video. On the second Tuesday
of every month, Pittsburgh Filmmakers hosts a curated screening of regional film and video at
the Melwood Screening Room. Current curator, Matthew Day explained that in many cases,
Film Kitchen may be the only public screening for these independent works. 323 The screenings
draw crowds from fifteen to fifty, usually including the friends and family of the exhibiting
artists.
While Film Kitchen supports the exhibition of local work, the screening venue also
establishes a feedback loop between audience and artist.

At each screening the curator

introduces the works to be presented and his rationale for selecting each film or video. After the

323

Matthew Day, interview with the author, August 23, 2013.

153

work has been screened a conversation begins between curator, artist, and audience. This is an
example of active and critical media consumption; the audience may ask questions in an open
forum with the media artist. During the September 2013 Film Kitchen, audience members asked
questions about particular aesthetic choices, the details of production, as well as the motivations
and inspirations for the presented works. In Guerrilla Television, Shamberg argued for similar
mechanisms establishing a two-way communication in traditional media outlets observing,
“there is no feeding back into broadcast television; you can call up a radio talk show but the
announcer usually works you over; and there’s only so many times you can write a ‘letter-to-theeditor.’” 324 Film Kitchen creates a feedback loop at this basic level, supporting the exhibition of
local media and a means of directly communicating with the producer of the work.
Film Kitchen is part of a larger history of visiting artists at Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
Throughout the organization’s history, visiting filmmakers have been part of Pittsburgh
Filmmakers’ educational mission. In his history of independent film in Pittsburgh, Robert Haller
suggests that the “broad, alert, and curious audience that responded to films,” was one of the
city’s assets, fostering a rich film culture in Pittsburgh. 325 Pulling from the flow of visiting
artists screening at the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh Filmmakers hosted filmmakers such
as Jonas Mekas, Bruce Baillie, Guvnor Nelson, Kenneth Anger, and Stan Brakhage. 326 The
workshops and screenings hosted by filmmakers created opportunities for the audience of
student-filmmakers and local film-enthusiasts to engage in conversations with these established
artists.

6.3.2

Enacting Literacy

While production and exhibition within these media arts centers support the ‘reading’
competencies of visual literacy, through workshops and other modes of community engagement
these organizations also support the ‘writing’ competencies of media literacy. Of these three
cases, Pittsburgh Filmmakers offers the most formalized opportunities for its constituency to
develop these media literacy skills. Founded as an artist co-op at the Selma Burke Arts Center,
equipment access has been at the core of the Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ mission from the beginning.
From this small, local resource, Pittsburgh Filmmakers now provides equipment access to
hundreds of artist-members. As an equipment access facility, the organization serves as a media
lab for the entire region. The equipment office maintains photography, filmmaking, and videomaking equipment, for both contemporary media formats and obsolete media as well. 327
This technology training is central to the media literacy initiatives developed by the
organization. Pittsburgh Filmmakers defines media literacy as “the ability to access, analyze,
evaluate and create media in a variety of forms, enabling individuals to become critical
consumers and thoughtful creators.” 328 While Pittsburgh Filmmakers is a source of technology
for those already proficient in its use, as a school the organization provides educational
opportunities for college students as well as the general public. Courses cover all modes of
media production from filmmaking and darkroom techniques, to digital video production and
web design. Whether targeting adult students or school-aged children, literacy skills are taught
by working with the technology. This hands-on instruction is supplemented by the screenings

327

Pittsburgh Filmmakers has served as a resource for local archives in the past, providing playback and inspection
equipment for film and video technology.

and other exhibition venues, continuing the organization’s mission to support literate audiences
in the Pittsburgh region.
Media literacy is also central to the mission of the Paper Tiger Television collective:
Through the production and distribution of our public access series, media
literacy/video production workshops, community screenings and grassroots
advocacy PTTV works to challenge and expose the corporate control of
mainstream media. PTTV believes that increasing public awareness of the
negative influence of mass media and involving people in the process of making
media is mandatory for our long-term goal of information equity. 329
While Paper Tiger has abandoned the Communications Update format for other documentary
forms, the collective continues to challenge and critique commercial media outlets by creating
programming focused on specific social issues and communities that may not be represented in
the mainstream media. 330 These programs are broadcast on community cable access television,
screened in community centers and spaces, and are available on the web, continuing the
collective’s mission to create an informed public of critical consumers of media. In addition to
this programming, the collective has also produced hands on technology workshops for the
community, addressing the additional technological competencies of media literacy.
When the collective has the time, interest, and resources available, Paper Tiger has hosted
media literacy workshops in partnership with various community groups. The first of these
workshops was hosted at the Satellite Academy High School in 1989 as part of the “Through Our

Eyes Video History Project.” 331 These seminars were offered more frequently in the 1990s and
early 2000s when the collective had a larger membership and funding to support such projects.
A 1998 document from the annual Paper Tiger retreat described a project titled “Analog Media
in a Digital World: Discussions with Communities” in which screenings of “low-tech shows”
would be followed by a lecture addressing the particular technologies of low-tech media
production. The document also announced “Literacy, Creation, Action,” a project funded by the
Manhattan Neighborhood Network that included a series of community video workshops which
incorporated “PPTV’s unique media literacy knowledge with techniques for teaching adults and
young people about media production which [could] be used for social change.” 332 During these
workshops, Paper Tiger Television shared its technological resources and expertise to teach
community groups how to use video technology to tell their own stories.
In addition to these formal workshops, Paper Tiger has published it’s own Shamberg-syle
manual, ROAR: The Paper Tiger Television Guide to Media Activism, bringing this technological
training to a wider public. Like Guerrilla Television, ROAR seeks to empower “camcorder
guerrillas” and “commandos” to create “cheap media” or “bargain Media” and broadcast that
media through alternative outlets.
Like Shamberg’s manual, ROAR is part manual and part manifesto.

The opening

chapters, “Do You Know Where Your Brains Are?” and “Paper Tiger and Friends,” outline the
history and the philosophy of the organization. The remainder of the manual contains features

such as “How to Use Community Access Channels” and “Making TV is Easy and Fun” that
provide accessible instructions and advice to empower communities to use these technologies
and resources. The final section is simply titled “How To,” including articles that address the
nuts and bolts of production, from the playful “A Recipe for Tasty TV: What You Need to Know
to Make a Show” and “Fiona’s Hand Camcorder Hints,” to the highly technical “How to Build a
FM Radio Transmitter.” ROAR is a complete manual for community media production, covering
the practical elements of production, how to manage people and work together, how to gain
access to distribution channels, how to secure funding and resources, as well as how to use and
maintain media technology.
In contrast to the formal workshops and educational opportunities at Pittsburgh
Filmmakers and Paper Tiger Television, Termite Television’s emphasis on experimentation has
lead to the development of several projects that directly engage the community in the process of
production. While Pittsburgh Filmmakers serves as a physical media lab for its members, as a
think-tank Termite Television is a laboratory for experimenting with new modes of engagement
for the community. The media literacy initiatives here have evolved from Termite’s templates
for production like “Life Stories.”
As described in the previous chapter, the Life Stories model evolved from the collective’s
1999 “Living Documentary Tour.”

Formulated as a means for quickly connecting the

community, the 5-minute Life Story model also has the power to engage the documentarian
behind the camera, as little technological know-how is needed to produce a Life Story. The setup requires little more than a video camera and tripod, and requires no editing or post-production
work. The immediacy of the project has made it a go-to model for youth and community

158

oriented workshops, and has been reformulated for projects like Messages in Motion.333

In this

Termite experiment, a van outfitted with video production equipment travels throughout the
Philadelphia area providing technology instruction to community groups and schools.
Participants learn how to use the tools of media production while creating 5-minute “videopostcards” documenting their neighborhood or organization. The collective has also developed a
“Messages in Motion” zine that provides step-by-step instructions for members of the public not
participating in the project. 334
Other Termite templates have been utilized to teach media literacy skills as well.
Collective member Michael Kuetemeyer has used the segmented structure of Termite’s cable
access program This is Not a Test as a means for Temple University students to collaborate in the
classroom.

Anula Shetty suggested that the other Termite projects, such as the Walk Philly

template, could also be used in this context. “Walk Philly” is a 2010 Termite initiative which
partnered with local artists and historians to create a series of guided smart-phone walking tours
of Philadelphia. Shetty suggested that if simplified, the Walk Philly model could serve as an
additional template for community-based media production. 335 These Termite experiments,
repurposed as media literacy initiatives support the development of both the reading and writing
skills suggested by the ACRL guidelines by engaging the community in the production of media.

READING AND WRITING MEDIA

Through these literacy initiatives, media arts centers seek to foster what Lawrence Lessig
has described as a Read/Write culture in the Read/Only environment of commercial media
production. 336

In these three cases, both reading and writing media are emphasized as the

participants in the initiatives described here engage both the media texts and media technology
through first-hand experience.
These initiatives also meet the larger goals of media arts center movement. By engaging
the community, these projects not only help to create new audiences for media but support the
use of media arts centers as alternative systems of distribution and production.

Just as

preservation centered on access in the preceding chapter, access is a priority here as well. Not
merely access to alternative media products or to the technology and tools of media creation, but
access to the knowledge of how to produce media and how to gain entry into a read/only culture
saturated by commercial interests. More than mere independent production of art for art’s sake,
or amateur media created by hobbyists, this is do-it-yourself media with a purpose, as described
by representatives of the National Alliance of Media Arts Centers:
It seems that a field is beginning to emerge from where a fringe artistic movement
once flourished. Our profile is low because we have lived too long in the
margins. We have allowed ourselves to be perceived as a community who cares
more about chroma and digital processors and artistic angst than we care about
free speech, educating kids, or fighting injustice. The best way to improve
support for the field is to raise our profile, and the best way to raise our profile is
to use our facilities and our talents to make life in our communities better. 337

‘RW’ permissions, then he is allowed to both read the file and make changes to it. If he has Read/Only
permissions, he is allowed only to read the file.”

Media creation becomes a tool for community engagement, community power, and a means for
documenting communities from the community’s point of view. The media produced here by
the community or for the community, becomes part of the archives contained within these media
arts centers. As creators, distributors, and preservers of audiovisual media, outreach and access
looks different in media arts centers when compared to traditional archival institutions. While
traditional archives provide access to materials, media arts centers serve a dual role both
preserving and producing media. These community spaces are dynamic archival spaces where
makers build from the archives, constantly reframing and reinterpreting previous works and the
archive as a whole.

Here archivists are both consumers and producers of the archives. This

dual role of creator/archivist opens archival practice, creating a do-it-yourself archival space
where the community dictates how the archive takes shape. The following chapter will further
explore these themes, suggesting a democratic and pluralized approach to archival practice.

161

7.0

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AS ALTERNATIVE ARCHIVES

Now everyone can have their own archive, especially a personal one. (All the Instamatic
pictures locked up in closets will boggle the minds of future historians). 338
The more process-oriented an information medium is, the sillier it seems as a product. That’s
why we approve of book collecting, indulge people who collect old magazines, and lock up
people who hoard old newspapers. 339
The work of training communities to use media technology has been the long established
mission of media arts centers, as a contributor to NAMAC’s Media Information Network
reported in 1991, “through workshops and seminars we helped demystify television and film,
and through equipment access we made it possible for communities to use low-budget video as a
tool to present their ideas, aesthetics and issues.” 340 As the previous chapter demonstrated, this
access to tools, technology, and alternative media provided by media arts centers is a means for
building a literate audience for non-commercial media and empowering communities to tell their
own stories. As collectors and keepers of this media, media arts centers have also become sites
where these histories are preserved, retold, and reimagined.

7.1

THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY ARCHIVES

As suggested in Chapter 5, Janet Ceja Acala’s “imperfect archive” legitimizes the
preservation practices established within media arts centers, however the concept of community
archives provides a more robust framework for understanding the various archival functions that
have developed within media arts centers. More than mere sites of preservation, the media arts
centers in this study represent attempts to form, retain, and provide access to materials over time.
This may be in the instance of a single film, as with Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ efforts with
Pittsburgh, or with the creation of an archive documenting the work and history of an entire
organization, as is the case with Termite Television and Paper Tiger Television.
The concept of community archives is as multifarious as the concept of the media arts
center. Andrew Flinn has suggested that the concept of community is a “fluid and ambiguous
one, lacking in clear definition and employed in many different contexts.” 341 Communities, as
defined here, may be bound by geographic location, ethnic structures, cultural groups, or a
variety of other social structures self-defined through a common identity.

The concept of

community archives includes a variety of constructs from local history groups and projects, to
independent community archives. Community archives may be completely independent or may
partner with established cultural heritage institutions such as, archives, museums, or libraries. 342
The use of ‘archive’ in ‘community archives’ is equally contested, calling into question
the nature of the archive and the documentation within it. One objection to the use of the term
relates to the ephemeral nature of the materials often found in community collections,

341

Heritage Professions,” InterActions: UCLA Journal of Education and Information Studies 7, no. 2 (2011): 5.

See Chapter 2 for a review of the community archives literature.

163

“photographs, flyers, leaflets and so on,” which “often fail to meet archivists’ strict criteria for
authenticity, integrity, reliability, usability and completeness, which constitute archival
‘value’.” 343 Such objections, Flinn argues, “reflect an attempt to establish a significant stake
and responsibility for this area of activity [archival practice]” by archival professionals. 344 As
such, community archives are placed in opposition to formal archival institutions that uphold the
established standards of archival practice. In this light, community archives are the products of
amateurs, relegated to the periphery of archivy. This concept is instead intended to be “broad,
non-prescriptive, and inclusive,” as a means for pluralizing archival practice. 345

It is the

inclusiveness of Flinn’s concept that is significant here. This is a concept centered on selfdefinition. Both the community and the archive are self-defined, and as such, archivists cannot
place professional boundaries on this construct.
Broadly defined, ‘community archive’ refers to “collections of materials gathered
primarily by members of a given community and over whose use community members exercise
some level of control.” 346 The physical location of the materials, that is whether or not they are
housed in a formal archival institution, is less of a concern. Rather, it is the “active and ongoing
involvement of members of the source community in documenting and making accessible their
history on their own terms,” which defines community archives. 347

Flinn’s definition of

community archives centers on community engagement and involvement. It is the community

that initiates the archival activity and controls the ownership of the materials, and thus controls
the representation of the community and its story through the archive.
Such a broad definition of community archives risks diminishing the political aims of
many community archives, archives such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives, that stand in
opposition to traditional archival constructs by representing the histories of communities
underrepresented or excluded from traditional archival institutions.

But, the inclusiveness of

community archives from this perspective opens the concept to include the archives developed
by communities of practice, such as the archive of the Grateful Dead “taping community” that
developed an archive of illicit audiotapes of live performances through a shared common
practice. 348 In this sense, community archives are defined by the development of archival
practices (collection, curation, and control, as suggested by Wallace) within a particular
community.

When defined by practice rather than by community affiliation, the community

archivist closely aligns with the concept of the citizen archivist, defined by Rick Prelinger as “a
person working outside established institutions who is doing archival-quality work (not simply
collecting), typically in an area that is neglected or inadequately addressed by established
collections.” 349 Understood in this way, community archives are a means for acknowledging the
deliberate attempts of communities and community organizations to preserve, represent, and
provide continued access to their histories.

7.2

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AS COMMUNITY ARCHIVES

Media arts centers support both concepts of community as described in the community
archives discourse. Through supporting the production and exhibition of media, media arts
centers create a community of practice brought together by the shared practice of media creation.
All three of the organizations in this study share an alternative organizational structure that
supports the development of community among its artist-members. Operating on a collective
model, Paper Tiger Television and Termite Television are supported by a small group of
dedicated artists volunteering their time and expertise to produce and create original
programming. With its roots as a filmmakers’ co-op and equipment rental service, Pittsburgh
Filmmakers also remains dedicated to an open organizational structure, operating on a
membership model. Like the collectives, voting artist-members of Pittsburgh Filmmakers are
given a share of responsibility in the administration of the organization. Defined as a mutual
undertaking by a group of individuals that share a common set of communal resources, this
sharing of administrative responsibility, expertise, technology, and communal production and
exhibition space is consistent with the concept of communities of practice. 350
While media arts centers bring together communities of artists, these centers also
embrace the broader notions of community through supporting the creation of what can be
described as community media. This concept “refers to grassroots or locally oriented media
access initiatives.” 351 Community media embraces the idea of a community being empowered
by media technology through the control of communication channels, the means of representing

University Press, 2005), 2.

166

an alternative point of view, and the ability to shape the representation of the community through
media.

Former NAMAC director Margaret Capels suggested this support of community

production as a powerful role for media arts centers which “can provide not only access to
equipment but also access to truth.”

These access initiatives provide opportunities for

communities to “tak[e] control of telling their own histories and tak[e] control of how they are
portrayed …break[ing] the circle of racism, sexism, and cultural ignorance.” 352 In this way, the
media literacy initiatives developed by the cases of this study support this notion of community
by placing the technology of media creation into the hands of community members.
These media centers become community archives through their dedication to the
documentation and development of community as well as their efforts to preserve the media
content generated by community and artist-members. Pittsburgh Filmmakers demonstrates this
dedication to the community not only through the educational opportunities provided by the
organization, but through screening venues such as Film Kitchen and partnership with local film
festivals such as JFilm, the film festival of the Pittsburgh Jewish Film Forum, and Reel Q, the
Pittsburgh LGBT film festival. In their activist approach to media production Paper Tiger
Television has documented the stories of communities and groups underrepresented by the
mainstream media whether co-produced with the community or initiated by the collective.
Termite Television’s cooperative production models such as “Life Stories” and “Messages in
Motion,” similarly engage the community in media production while documenting the histories
and stories of community members. However, it is the collection and preservation of these
materials that transforms these media arts centers into community archives.

7.2.1

Pittsburgh Filmmakers Reframed

Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ preservation of Pittsburgh illustrates the tensions between
preservation as defined by professionals in the audiovisual archival field and the capabilities of
media arts centers.

Since the organization took custody of the film in 1979, Pittsburgh

Filmmakers has remained dedicated to the passive preservation of the thirty thousand feet of
original 35mm footage from the film’s production. While this passive preservation fails to
match the standards for environmental storage established by the preservation fields, these
materials have survived, in tact, for the past thirty-five years. Current executive director, Charlie

Humphrey suggested that while the organization does not have the facilities to preserve the film
(through proper climate control and the creation of a new film transfer) the organization does
archive the film by providing storage facilities for an important piece of Pittsburgh history. 354
The 2008 grant funding the Pittsburgh Reframed project supported an inventory and
inspection of the original elements, production of a high definition digital transfer of the film,
and scans of a small portion of the outtakes and trims containing the “lost” version of the film.
While the quality of these preservation interventions can be debated, what is clear is that the
organization has remained dedicated to preserving and providing access to this film within the
limits of the resources available. A DVD of the film and the Reframed shorts is available for
access in the Pittsburgh Filmmakers Library and the high resolution scans of the film are
maintained on the organization’s servers and hard drives.
When asked why Pittsburgh Filmmakers retains custody of the film, executive
director Charlie Humphrey expressed a sense of responsibility and ownership over the material,
arguing, “it belongs here …not out of a mission, but more out of a deference to Pittsburgh, to its
history, to its pedigree, to its beauty.” 355 Humphrey also expressed that Pittsburgh is more than
just a piece of the city’s history, but part of Pittsburgh Filmmaker’s organizational history.
While the final cut of the film fails to reflect his artistic vision for the project, filmmaker Stan
Brakhage was involved in the production of the film as one of the original directors. During his
visits to Pittsburgh, Brakhage was a regular guest of Pittsburgh Filmmakers as a visiting artist
and lecturer, described by Humphrey as one of the “patron saints” of the organization. As such,
Pittsburgh is part of the history of Pittsburgh Filmmakers, a testament to the organization’s

connection to the local and national independent filmmaking culture. Pittsburgh is also part of
the city’s history and cultural heritage as a representation of how the Bicentennial Committee
understood the past, present, and future of Pittsburgh. The Reframed at 250 shorts have been
enfolded into this archive as representations of the city, its history, and work of local media
artists.
Pittsburgh Filmmakers houses a second collection of archival films, donated in 2003 by
underground filmmaker, George Semsel. This second acquisition is somewhat problematic.
Semsel explained he donated his collection of 16mm experimental and documentary films to
Pittsburgh Filmmakers after failing to identify an archival repository willing to house his
collection. 356 The filmmaker acknowledged the work of archives such as Anthology Film

Archives, but lamented the loss of the work of filmmakers that has not been preserved in these
archival institutions. In a letter accompanying his donation, the filmmaker expressed a desire for
the organization to develop a formalized archives program, suggesting these films were “to
become part of [Pittsburgh Filmmaker’s] archive.”

358

Semsel’s donation joins a circulating

collection of local work collected by the Pittsburgh Filmmakers library.

However, these

materials are copies, DVDs of student work and other films and videos donated by local
artists. 359 Library advisor John Cantine suggested that this curated collection is perhaps the most
comprehensive collection of local and regionally produced media in the city. 360
Echoing Charlie Humphrey’s thoughts regarding Pittsburgh, John Cantine explained,
“there has always been a faction of people who thought that we should become an archive,” but
argued that the organization lacks the resources to establish a formal program. Because the
organization cannot meet the standards of the archival community, representatives of Pittsburgh
Filmmakers are reluctant to acknowledge the archival role the organization serves for the
community. While the materials may not be ‘archival’ in all cases, there are collections being
curated and preserved that document the history of the city and media production in the region.

The Year of The Tiger: Paper Tiger’s DIY Archive

In contrast to the informal and somewhat reluctant efforts of Pittsburgh Filmmakers, over
the past thirty years Paper Tiger Television has made a deliberate attempt to document the
history of the organization and preserve the media created within the collective. The

358

Letter from George Semsel to Pittsburgh Filmmakers, March 8, 2003.
Cantine suggested that in recent years it has been more difficult to build this collection as few artists are
creating DVDs, opting instead to distribute their work as digital downloads.

media. 362 The collective currently maintains a physical archive of over three hundred videotaped
programs along with related documentation, artifacts, and ephemera. 363
As suggested in the discussion of the organization’s preservation activities, the
development of the archive has been an ongoing effort over the history of the organization.
Founding Tiger DeeDee Halleck indicated that the collective had a sense of the significance of
their work from the very beginning with the development of Communications Update. The
success of this early programming effort served as an exemplar of the possibilities for public
access television and alternative media, inspiring other communities and groups to create similar
programming. The preservation efforts described in the previous chapters serve as one example
of the collective’s commitment to the Paper Tiger Television Archive. In contrast to Pittsburgh
Filmmakers, the collective has made a deliberate attempt to construct an archive and manage the
materials within it, as demonstrated in this set of instructions from the Paper Tiger Television
Manual:
The Tape Shelf: We have several tape shelves that we use regularly, the ½” tape
shelf which house all the VHS copies of our shows, the ¾” tape shelf which house
all the tapes we have made up to about 1988 and another ¾” tape shelf which
stores all the rest of our tapes up to the present. All the tapes are given numbers
and letters for identification purposes and there is a corresponding card catalogue
like the kind in libraries situated on the desk. The ¾” shelf is organized so that
screening dubs and dub masters are in the front and all masters are either behind
them or on the tip top of the shelf. Dub masters and masters are labeled
accordingly and should NEVER be screened. If you have any doubts about a
particular tape ask a staff person. No tapes leave the office without telling office
staff. 364

Tapes are physically arranged, to promote both access and preservation, with a clear delineation
of the circulating materials from the archival dub masters. The tapes are also clearly identified
with an internal cataloging schema and recorded on a card catalog. This internal catalog is
distinguished from the distribution “Cat*a*log” published for promotional purposes. The card
catalog was replaced in the late-1990s by a Filemaker Pro Database of MARC compatible
records, further illustrating the collective’s commitment to following the professional library and
archival standards wherever possible.
Unlike Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Paper Tiger Television maintains the look-and-feel of an
archive. While the collective struggles to maintain archival standards, as illustrated in the
discussion of preservation, it is easy to recognize the core archival functions as interpreted by the
collective. However, the recent donation of the archive to New York University problematizes
the relationship between the collective and its archive, revealing many of the tensions addressed
in the community archives literature.
Due to the preservation concerns related to the videotapes in the collection, the Paper
Tiger Television archive was donated to the Fales Library and Special Collections in 2010 to
become part of the Library’s Downtown Collection.

This collection, developed using

documentation strategy, includes archival materials from organizations and individuals
representing New York City’s art scene in SoHo and the Lower East Side.

The donation

consisted of sixty linear feet of administrative records, photographs, ephemera and artifacts
dating from the collective’s founding year through 2008, along with the collection of master
videotapes.
While the paper records and artifacts are open and available for research, the audiovisual
materials in the collection have not been processed. In the finding aid, these series are simply

174

described as “closed for research,” and the materials have not been cataloged or indexed. The
collective’s donation provided for the audiovisual materials to be stored in climate-controlled
storage, ensuring the continued preservation of the materials, but the videotapes have yet to be
digitized, inhibiting access. Patricia González Ramírez explained that collective members can
access the materials with permission, but otherwise these materials remain unavailable for
research.
This lack of access is a concern for the collective, which understands the productions and
programs not only to belong to the collective, but also to the communities that have been
documented and represented in these works. González Ramírez explained that the collective
“helps communities write their histories,” and therefore, the archive contains not only the history
of the collective, but the histories of these communities as well. 365 Due to the inaccessibility of
the videotapes, the archives project remains an active Paper Tiger initiative.

The Library and

Special Collections have been unable to articulate a timeline for digitization, so the collective has
decided to move forward with their own project to digitize the copies of their shows that they
maintain at their office. As an “Alternative Information Center,” the collective aspires to provide
broad and open access to its materials. While documentarians and other commercial filmmakers
are charged a fee to license clips from the archive, Paper Tiger grants free access to community
groups and activists working with small or non-existent budgets. Collective members suggested
that even after the materials have been digitized at Fales, that this tiered access would be
desirable.
The institutionalization of Paper Tiger’s archive at New York University has ensured the
continued preservation of the videotape materials in cold storage, alleviating one of the

365

Patricia González Ramírez, interview with the author, September 26, 2013.

175

preservation concerns for the materials. However, the donation has raised other concerns related
to the continued access and control of the materials. Paper Tiger has relinquished control of the
representation of the archives and community access to this collection. 366

Their desire to

continue the archives project with the remaining copies demonstrates this sense of ownership and
responsibility for this archive of materials documenting histories larger than their own.

7.2.3

The Antithetical Archive: Termite TV

The idea of an archive is counter to the philosophy on which Termite Television was
founded. Manny Farber’s “termite art” should leave no traces, “besides the signs of industrious,
unkempt activity,” and thus the collective is always moving forward, experimenting with
technology, and developing new models for production.

367

This attitude toward archiving

reflects the attitudes of respondents in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Digital
Dilemma 2, in which independent filmmakers explained that their first concern was the
production of new work. 368 Over the past two decades, however, the collective has become
aware of the value of maintaining an archive of past projects. As discussed in the previous
chapters, this realization came with the production of “The War Show” in 2003 as the collective
reflected on the production of 1992’s “Desert Storm.” By placing these two shows, critiquing

366

DeeDee Halleck explained that the Fales Archives and Special Collections was a second choice for the
collective. In the late 1990s the collective had also entered negotiations with the Tamiment Institute Library and
Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University. She believes that by framing the collection within the
Downtown collections at Fales, that the political aims of the collective have been diminished. Interview with the
author, August 21, 2013.

the politics of two very similar US conflicts in the Middle East, in juxtaposition, the collective
realized the potential value of past works leading to an effort to build the Termite Television
Archive.
Co-director Anula Shetty explained that the archive was one of the motives for renting a
common space for the collective. Prior to 2011 project meetings and other gatherings were
hosted in collective members’ homes. At this point, the archive was physically distributed
among the members of the collective, with no preservation mechanisms in place. As multiple
copies of each show were made, there was a general understanding that a copy of each show was
being kept by someone associated with the collective or that a copy could be obtained through
Termite’s distribution channels. Termite’s office in the Crane Arts Building became a site for
assembling and storing the materials that had gathered in the personal spaces of collective
members over the past two decades. While the office became a physical storage space, access to
the archive is provided through the collective’s website termite.org.
Termite.org is an access point for both current and past Termite projects. The website is
used as both a tool to develop and extend interactive, community-based projects such as “Life
Stories,” “Walk Philly,” and “Messages in Motion,” as well as a means for advertising and
distributing Termite projects past and present. But, Termite.org is also a tool for archiving these
productions and other documentation produced by the collective.

The digital archive is

represented in two ways: the “Projects” page linking users to descriptions and videos from
Termite Television’s various projects, and the Termite Television blog, which chronicles the
activities of the collective from 1992 to present.

178

Figure 10. Termite Television Blog 370

While the “Projects” page provides a means for accessing the videos and various project
documentation, the blog is a self-conscious effort to document the history of the collective.
Individual blog posts link to the videos on the “Projects” page as another access point for the
productions.

These additional links also serve to contextualize the projects in the collective’s

larger history. In addition to the project links, the collective has been working to scan other
paper-based records to accompany the descriptions and videos on the website. These records are

370

Screenshot captured April 26, 2014 from http://www.termite.org/projects.html.

179

linked to the salient entries. In addition to these links between entries and records, the blog
entries are linked through tags, inputted by collective members as a means of forming additional
intellectual connections between entries in this evolving archive.
Like all Termite Television projects, the archive shares the immediacy, spontaneity, and
resourcefulness of the Termite aesthetic. This aesthetic applies to the preservation of individual
materials contained within the archive, as described in Chapter 5, and the organization and
representation of the archive as a whole. To understand the archive, the user must employ the
“Termite Way of Looking.” The blog pages do not always load correctly or link to the intended
resources. The user must look past these glitches and imperfections in the website to understand
it as an archive.
Termite.org can also be read as an experiment in how to preserve, represent and provide
access to the collective’s history. Over the history of the development of the digital archive, the
collective has made use of freely available software such as Blip, iTunes, and Vimeo, to provide
access to the audiovisual materials in the archive. 371 As new platforms are adopted, the old are
abandoned leaving a trail of broken links. Rather than reading these artifacts as imperfections or
mistakes, they can be understood as part of the experimental ethos of the collective – going
“always forward eating its own boundaries, and likely as not, leaves nothing in its path other than
the signs of eager, industrious, unkempt activity.” 372
When questioned about the possibility of partnering with an archival institution, codirectors Anula Shetty and Michael Kuetemeyer expressed some hesitation. They explained that
the institutionalization of the collection would not reflect the original intention of the Termites.

371

For the paper-based records, the collective has used Google Docs as a platform for preservation and access.

Da Capo Press, 1998), 135.

372

180

As the collective’s membership is never static, Shetty and Kuetemeyer are conscious of the way
in which the collective’s archive is represented and accessed. Platforms like YouTube, for
example, were not explored due to the commercial nature of the web portal. There is a sense of
responsibility to respect the original intentions of the creators through the way the archive is
accessed and preserved. The collective respects these intentions by maintaining an independent
archive that reflects the philosophy and history of the organization. 373

7.3

MEDIA ARTS CENTERS AND ARCHIVAL PRACTICE

What does this mean to a culture that has become increasingly dependent on visual images for
its self-image, its view of the world, and its understanding of what is and isn't true? What does
this mean if our databanks of images, those public and collective as well as those private and
personal, fade into oblivion? I would argue that, without evidence of the past to re-examine and
reconsider, we become increasingly vulnerable to the spin doctors of history who reshaped the
past to serve other agendas. The entire spectrum of video recordings, from those professionally
recorded for cultural institutions like network television, to those made by you and me to
memorialize the events of our lives, demands our attention and concern. Were the public to
realize just what is at risk if video as a medium is dismissed as ephemeral or someone else's
concern, we would have a considerable lobby behind us and this enterprise.
-Deidre Boyle, Television and Video Preservation 1997
New York Public Hearing, March 1996 374
The previous chapter framed the media literacy initiatives developed within media arts
centers as an attempt to pluralize and democratize the practice of media production: to establish a
read/write culture in an otherwise read/only environment. As a theoretical construct, community
archives are a similar call for “archivists to give up their recently hard-won mantras of expert

181

[sic], of control, of power, and, instead, to share archiving with communities.” 375 Through the
development of their archives, each of the media arts centers in this study have demonstrated
how the practice of archives, a traditionally read/only construct bounded by professional
practice, can become read/write constructs for community engagement.
The reports form the National Film Preservation Board and the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences acknowledge the significance of the media being produced by media
arts centers and the independent artists supported by these organizations, but fail to acknowledge
the active role these centers have played in the preservation and collection of media. Media arts
centers are equated with the garages and attics and other non-archival sites where fugitive media
collections may gather to eventually be rescued by archival institutions.

The history and

development of the media arts centers in this study demonstrates that this is not the case. These
organizations are sites of active preservation, though the standards established by these
organizations may not meet the standards set by the archival profession. Further, the history of
the Media Arts Center Movement and the development of the National Alliance of Media Arts
and Culture (NAMAC) illustrate the dedication of these organizations to preservation research
and the development of interventions for the preservation of independent and non-commercial
media.
In the quote at the beginning of this section, Deidre Boyle, testifying before the National
Film Preservation Board, passionately pleads for the archival field to acknowledge the noncommercial, amateur, and independently produced media in this country. While the 1993 and
1997 reports from the National Film Preservation Board would provoke the nation’s audiovisual

375

(2012): 19.

182

archives to refocus their collecting efforts and embrace what became known as the “orphan”
film, audiovisual archivists remain committed to preservation as defined by the politics and
standards of commercial studios and cultural heritage institutions. 376

In contrast, the

interventions developed by the media arts centers in this study mimic the organizations’
production models, matching their values and philosophies. When framed through the lens of
professional archival practice, these archives will always be imperfect, but as community
archives these practices suggest a critique of professional practice and a redefinition of the
practice of preservation.
Media arts centers are not the only organizations to struggle in this archival paradigm.
Jennifer Mohan’s 2008 Environmental Scan of Moving Image Collections in the United States
suggests that non-specialized archives, museums, and libraries also struggle to preserve the
audiovisual media in their collections. The institutions surveyed for Mohan’s study cite the lack
of technology, expertise, and funding as challenges to the preservation of analog and digital
media in their collections. 377 Twenty years ago, NAMAC’s preservation working group reached
a similar conclusion:
One of the most serious challenges to any organization with media is a lack of
formal training programs, the inadequate number of reference tools on the subject,
and the limited number of opportunities for professional skill building. Even the
largest organizations, if they house film and video, are facing the same dilemma.
Indeed, the largest organizations often have the least amount of hands-on
connection to the material. The media arts community, on the other hand, is a
resource because of its dedication and intimate involvement in the history of
media. 378

Like independent artists, moving image archivists have repurposed the technologies developed
for commercial media interests and adapted them to suit their needs.

While technology will

always be a necessity for archiving audiovisual materials, this study suggests that archivists must
also gain a better understanding of how this technology is being used by creators in order to
develop archival interventions that acknowledge different modes of production. Media scholar
Leo Enticknap suggests that this understanding of the use of technology is a gap in the
knowledge of those studying film and media:
The dynamic of the interaction between the creators of the technology, the users
of the technology, and the creation of cultural and evidential artefacts using the
technology that result from this necessity [mediating technology] is something
that critics, theorists and historians of film have struggled to cope with ever since
their emergence as a profession. 379
As Termite Michael Kuetemeyer suggested, “Maybe the solution to the creative problem is not
the direction that you think.” 380 As community archives the media arts centers in this study have
employed their own standards for preservation and archivization, emphasizing access – access
for the organizations’ members and for the communities they serve. Archival standards privilege
preservation over access. Further, the standard for preservation has been defined by the filmic
object, a standard that is unattainable for media arts centers and for many archives and collecting
institutions, as Mohan’s study suggests.

As the media industries retool from film to digital

formats, this preservation standard will become unsustainable for specialized moving image
archives as well. Audiovisual records are similar to digital records in this way, without active
intervention and sustainable systems for preservation these records will be lost. This study
suggests that in order to create such sustainable models for the preservation of audiovisual

184

materials, archivists must understand the users and the creators of the records and their values.
This is a call for archivists to actively engage with these creators, not to change the way in which
these community organizations are archiving their materials, but to learn from the ways in which
the communities engage with their records to develop these solutions.
The history and development of media arts centers as explored in this study has suggested
that media arts centers have not only played a significant role in the development of the
independent film and video-making sector in this country, but have also supported audiovisual
archives and preservation community as well. Described as separate and unequal to professional
archives, media arts centers have not been fully acknowledge by archival practice or archival
historians.

Though preservation is just one of the many concerns of media arts centers, the

development of archives, as demonstrated by the cases here, has been a primary function for
these organizations. While a small number of media arts centers, such as the Film and Video
Department at the Museum of Modern Art, have been recognized as practicing audiovisual
archives, all media arts centers have supported the audiovisual preservation movement through
their localized efforts to preserve, create, and provide access to their archival collections,
establishing an underground network of community audiovisual archives (to borrow the rhetoric
of the independent film movement of the 1960s).
The practices developed here suggest a new approach to the preservation and
management of audiovisual materials, not only for audiovisual archives, but for all archival
institutions with a concern for the preservation of these technologically dependent records.
Appraisal is grounded not in the rarity of the material or its aesthetic significance, but in the
informational content of the records and its evidential value. Preservation of the informational
value is privileged over the aesthetic value of audiovisual materials, suggesting that less

185

technologically involved methods of migration are more appropriate for the preservation of
audiovisual media over resource heavy preservation interventions that preserve records on the
original (often obsolete) media.

Due to the highly technological nature of these materials,

providing access is not enough; media arts centers emphasize the need for outreach initiatives
that address the specific technological and visual literacies necessary to fully engage with
audiovisual records.

Further, as community archives media arts centers suggests an open,

dynamic, and pluralistic structure for archives through establishing archives and archival
practices that respect the values and philosophies of the community of records creators. Framing
media arts centers as archival laboratories, as alternative archival spaces, opens possibilities for
new models for the preservation and archivization of audiovisual media, not only for media arts
centers, but for all organizations and institutions preserving these materials.

7.4

FUTURE RESEARCH

This initial exploration of media arts centers has uncovered more questions than answers.
Future research in this area has implications not only for media scholars and audiovisual
archivists, but for archivists and scholars working with text-based materials as well.

7.4.1

A History of the Media Arts Center Movement

The history of the Media Arts Center Movement and the development of the National
Alliance of Media Arts and Culture warrant further study.

Those interviewed for this project

confirmed that a history of this movement has yet to be fully explored. A number of respondents
186

suggested that much of this history has not been documented, and is instead part of the memories
of those who were active in the movement. Many of those described as the “first generation” of
media arts advocates and organizers are aging and passing-away taking their memories with
them. This latent memory may only be captured through oral history. As the cases in this study
have demonstrated, members of these organizations are willing and eager to share their histories,
which suggests interest in this project. NAMAC and perhaps AMIA (the Association of Moving
Image Archivists) are two organizations that may be able to assist in coordinating such a project.
This historical project also requires further archival research in media arts centers still in
operation and in archives that may hold the collections of now defunct organizations.
While not explored in this study, further analysis of the membership data printed in
NAMAC’s publications could begin to identify persons and organizations of interest for a larger
historical study. This data could also lead to a larger Social Network Analysis of the Media Arts
Movement to better understand the links between individuals and organizations active in the
movement.
Also of interest in this area is the data from NAMAC’s Travel Sheet. While I could not
gain access to this publication for this research study, executive director Jack Walsh described
this precursor to Media Arts and MAIN: Media Arts Information Network as a newsletter that
announced upcoming appearances in media arts centers across the country.

The Carnegie

Museum of Art is also known to have produced a similar publication. The NAMAC Travel
Sheet and other similar publications could be pulled into a larger dataset and used to track the
movement of independent artists, again connecting organizations and individuals active in the
media arts movement and media production in the United States.

187

Further study in these areas would be of particular interest to those studying the
development of independent and non-commercial media production in the United States as well
as those studying social movements and independent and community media.

7.4.2

Audiovisual Archives and Union Catalogs

A history of media arts centers would also be of particular interest to audiovisual
archivists.

As this study demonstrates, media arts centers were active participants in the

development of audiovisual preservation research in the United States.

This intersection

between the history of audiovisual preservation in the United States and the involvement of
media arts centers and the media arts community also warrants further interrogation. The media
arts center movement included established archival institutions such as the Museum of Modern
Art, Anthology Film Archives, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, yet their
role in this “makers” movement has not been explored. Similarly, the efforts of non-archival
media arts centers have not been acknowledged in the audiovisual archives literature. Further
interrogation at this intersection could contribute to a more complete understanding of the
development of the orphan film movement as well as the efforts to collect and archive noncommercial media in this country.
The development of a union catalog was another unexplored, but reoccurring theme in
the data from NAMAC. The National Moving Image Database (NAMID), the first attempt at an
expansive and inclusive catalog of audiovisual materials being preserved in the United States,
was initiated in the early 1990s. NAMID was followed by MIC (Moving Image Collections) in
the 2000s, but both union catalogs of moving image media have been abandoned.

Further

exploration of these projects as well as the involvement of media arts centers and affiliated
188

organizations, such as IMAP (Independent Media Arts Preservation) and the Media Alliance,
may help to elucidate the reasons for the initial success and ultimate failure of these projects.

7.4.3

Archival Theory and Digital Preservation

This study and future research in this area has implications for other realms of archival
practice as well, particularly in the areas of digital preservation and curation. Christopher Lee
and Helen Tibbo suggested that “in order for digital collections to be sustainable over time, the
actors responsible for the archives must continuously have appropriate expertise, resources, and a
political/institutional mandate to carry out the work required.” 381 Elisabeth Yakel has further
suggested that digital curation requires “the active involvement of information professionals in
the management, including the preservation of digital data for future use.” 382 While these
understandings of digital preservation and curation suggest the need for the active management
of digital records, this active management of digital materials suggests a need to work with
records creators as well.
Due to the technological dependence of audiovisual records (both analog and digital),
audiovisual preservation at times closely resembles digital preservation.

The practices of

reformatting and restoration in the audiovisual archives field map closely to the practices of
migration and emulation. 383 As this study has demonstrated, audiovisual materials, like digital
materials, require active management if they are to persist into the future.

management of these records requires an intimate knowledge of the technologies used to create
and preserve these records. But, as this study has demonstrated, to successfully archive these
materials in all contexts, an understanding of the records creators and the social constructs of
records creation is required as well.
Audiovisual archives are positioned between the analog and digital. The standard on
which audiovisual archival practice has been established, moving image film, is on the verge of
becoming obsolete. 384 This is a standard that the media arts centers in this study have abandoned
as they have explore new methods for archiving and preserving media. While these practices
suggest new models for audiovisual archives, continued study in this area may help to inform
other areas of archival theory and practice, established on text-based models, through the
transition to born digital archives.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences cited the retooling of the industry to digital video as the
impetus for the Digital Dilemma reports.

APPENDIX A

SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

The following questions have been adapted from Jennifer Mohan’s Environmental Scan
of Moving Image Collections in the United States. Mohan’s study sought to determine the
preparedness of collecting institutions (archives, museums, and libraries) to digitize their moving
image collections. 385 This series of questions addresses the content of collections, preservation
concerns, and collecting practices, within media arts centers, as well as the relationship that these
organizations may have with other collecting institutions. These questions served as the
foundation for semi-structured interviews with the respondents at each of the sites selected for
this study.

PAPER TIGER TELEVISION VIDEO PRESERVATION PROJECT 387

D.1

THE ARCHIVAL PROJECT PRESENTS: TAPE PRESERVATION A HOW TO
LIST ON DOCUMENTATION

1. CHOOSE A TAPE TO WATCH. Record the Title, Number. Format. Year. Notes on Tape.
2. EVALUATE THE PHYSICAL. Make sure the tape has no visual exterior or interior damage.
The tape should be wound tightly, make sure there is no deterioration of the layers of the
tape. Inspect the tape heads and other moving parts of the tape to make sure there is no dust
or deposited material. If damage on the tape appears to be severe don’t take the risk of
playing the tape. It could exacerbate the problem. If the tape is dusty or has deposited
material in it, notate it and then put it back on the shelf. That is for a professional to deal
with.
3. PUT THE TAPE IN THE ¾ DECK PLAYER. Press the rewind button and make sure it is
fully rewound. Press the reset button so the play reads 00:00. Press play and begin to notate
any visual or audio glitches that occur and the approximate time they begin. Refer to the
Video Glitch Glossary for correct terms.
4. LABEL THE TAPE. Using the pre-made labels write down the date and the condition of that
tape. Place the label on the outside of the box and hand in the evaluation form in the
appropriate place.
5. REPEAT AND REPEAT. Repeat this process for as long as you want.

Before You Begin Keep in Mind:
Never Abruptly Stop the Tape – If you need to scan the video for a section, which you probably
will have to do a lot, stop the tape and use the Search dial to scan forward or backwards.
Abruptly rewinding or fast-forwarding the tape can cause the tape to unwind and thus snowball
all kinds of problems.
Maybe It’s the Machine – Remember that the ¾ decks we are using to play the tapes have seen
better days. If the tape is displaying idiosyncratic programs, try it in another player. A lot of
times the ¾ deck heads are dirty and they need to be cleaned. If the problem disappears or
lessens in another player it was probably the time player.
Sometimes You Have to be a Detective – Sometimes tapes and players just don’t feel like
cooperating. Wires can be unplugged, machines can be turned off, machines can be faulty, just
keep at it and you’ll find the problem. GOOD LUCK!
