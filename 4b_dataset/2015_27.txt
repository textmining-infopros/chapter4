Abstract
This study profiles the characteristics of the scholarship published in one of the central journals in
the field of Records Management in order to identify salient aspects of the evolution of that field.
Through a bibliometric analysis of the contents of the first twenty-five years of Records
Management Journal (RMJ), the study presents a multi-dimensional view of published research
and opinion articles in Records Management in the period 1989-2013. Key aspects examined are:
the nature of authorship (including gender, country and institutional affiliations, and degree of
collaboration); and citation practices (including commonly cited authors, commonly cited journals,
and degree of cross-disciplinarity). Records Management scholarship provides a structural
framework for Records Management as a discipline, which in turn influences Records
Management practice. The publication patterns found in RMJ can therefore serve as a mirror of
the history of the scholarship of Records Management as it was presented to practitioners in the
field during the examined time period.

Introduction and Background
1.1.

Introduction

Records Management as a practice can be traced back to the Ancient World (Brosius, 2003) and
Records Management as a discipline has been evolving since the 19th century (Webster, 1999;
Sanford, 2010). However, little is known about the characteristics and evolution of the scholarship
of the field in both academic and business worlds. Since journals are one of the major methods for
disseminating research findings to the professions in Records Management, bibliometric analysis
is used in this study to provide insight into the growth of literature and the flow of knowledge
within this field. Bibliometric analysis of Records Management literature can reveal information
about authorship and citation practices in the field. Through a bibliometric analysis of the contents
of the first twenty-five years of Records Management Journal (RMJ), this study identifies salient
aspects of evolution of published research and opinion articles in RMJ in the period 1989-2013.
This study aims to contribute quantitative knowledge regarding specific issues in the field,
including geographic concentration, gender balance, geographical distribution of male and female
professors and managers, degree of research collaboration, degree of subject dispersion and
citation preferences, by profiling the characteristics of the scholarship published in one of the
central journals in the field of Records Management. This study also ascertains trends and patterns
of authorship, recognizes active authors and institutions involved in the field, and identifies the
most influential authors, journals, literature and documents of RMJ. First, this chapter introduces
the background information of the field of Records Management and its leading journal, Records
Management Journal. It then follows by providing the purpose, research questions, significance,
definition of terms, and assumptions and limitations of this study.

1.2.

Records Management

Although the origins of Records Management as a practice can be traced back to the Ancient World
(Brosius, 2003), the field of Records Management as a profession and as a discipline is relatively
young. It was not recognized as an occupation until the early 19th century in response to an
1

increasing demand for managing and controlling the production, storage, and disposition of
records in public and private sectors (Webster, 1999). During the 19th century, countries such as
the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia began to develop and recognize
Records Management as a profession. In 1946, President Harry Truman of the United States
acknowledged a records management program that was developed to handle records generated
during the Second World War (Sanford, 2010). Various legislation, such as Federal Records Act,
and governing bodies, such as the United States National Archives, and Records Management
Bureau, were also established thereafter for the purpose of improving the management of
government records (Sanford, 2010). In 1955, the Association of Records Managers and
Administrators (ARMA), the first professional association for records managers, was established
(McLeod & Hare, 2010). Similarly, in 1958, the field of Records Management was recognized in
the United Kingdom when the Public Records Act was enacted (Sanford, 2010). Furthermore,
Records Management was being recognized as a profession by establishing the British Records
Management Society (BRMS) in 1983 (Sanford, 2010). Likewise, Australia also established the
Records Management Association of Australia in 1969 to recognized Records Management as a
profession (Sanford, 2010).

Between the 1970s and the 1980s, many governing bodies were created around the world,
including the Records Management Association of Australia (RMAA), the Records Management
Group of the Society of Archivists, and the Records Management Society of Great Britain
(McLeod & Hare, 2010). These records management associations played a crucial role in
generating scholarly and professional literature, which enhanced the scholarly communication and
development of the field to become a discipline (McLeod & Hare, 2010). A specialized body of
knowledge with distinctive perspectives, theories, and methods was generated in the field to guide
Records Management practice when a few journals dedicated exclusively to Records Management
were established during the late 19th century (Webster, 1999). At the same time, Records
Management was being recognized as an academic discipline by the universities and institutions
in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia (Webster, 1999; Sanford, 2010). In the
1990s, universities in the United Kingdom began to offer master’s degrees in Records
Management (Webster, 1999). Today, Records Management has become a significant part of
2

academic programs around the world, while maintaining close ties with many other disciplines,
such as Archival Management and Information Management (Shepherd, 2006).

In order to develop its status in both academic and professional environments, it was important for
the field of Records Management to establish its unique characteristics through scholarship.
Scholarship is one of the major vehicles for “knowledge generation, testing and communication”
in any professional group or academic discipline so as to “reflect the best ways of thinking,
analysing and problem solving” (Kitson, 2006, p.542). Records Management as a discipline
coexists in both academic and practice environments. Therefore Records Management scholarship
must foster connections between these two settings. Records Management scholars include
practitioners, researchers and educators from different business sectors (McLeod, 2008). Records
Management scholarship provides a structural framework for Records Management as a discipline,
which in turn influences Records Management practice. To develop Records Management as a
scholarly discipline, “the generation of new knowledge, the confirmation and explanation of
existing knowledge, and the application of knowledge to practice” are key factors (Riley, Beal,
Levi, & McCausland, 2002, p.384). Through scholarship, Records Management scholars can
influence the direction of thought within the field. At the same time, research is central to
improving practice, developing standards, and sharing best practices in the field in order to
maintain the professional status of Records Management as a practicing profession. Today, the
work practices of Records Management practitioners require constant updating so that they can be
maintained at a high professional level. The ability of Records Management practitioners to solve
practical problems and meet the needs of users in dynamic and changing environments is highly
dependent on scholarship in the field. Therefore, it is essential for the practitioners to actively seek
out the latest research findings and participate in research-related activities. The closer the
relationship between Records Management research and Records Management practice, the better
the practice.

In order to establish the academic and professional status as a discipline and as a profession, the
field of Records Management must possess a set of unique characteristics. Through a bibliometric
analysis of the contents of the Records Management scholarship, the characteristics, intellectual
structure, evolution, and future trends of the field can be identified. Bibliometric analysis approach
3

is a quantitative research method that has been widely applied in many disciplines for these very
purposes. With very limited existing bibliometric studies of the field of Records Management, this
bibliometric study is necessary to fill this gap. This study profiles the characteristics of the
scholarship published in one of the central journals in the field of Records Management. The
contents of the first twenty-five years of RMJ in the period 1989-2013 were analyzed to present a
multi-dimensional view of published research and opinion articles in Records Management and
identify salient aspects of the evolution of the field. The objectives of this study are to contribute
quantitative knowledge regarding specific issues in the field, including geographic concentration,
gender balance, geographical distribution of male and female professors and managers, degree of
research collaboration, degree of subject dispersion and citation preferences, by profiling the
characteristics of the scholarship published in one of the central journals in the field of Records
Management. This study also ascertains trends and patterns of authorship, recognizes active
authors and institutions involved in the field, and identifies the most influential authors, journals,
literature and documents of the field.

Key aspects examined in this study are: the nature of authorship (including gender, country and
institutional affiliations, and degree of collaboration); and citation practices (including commonly
cited authors, commonly cited journals, and degree of cross-disciplinarity). This study further
discusses the following issues in the field of Records Management in detail:

1.

Geographic concentration

2.

Gender balance

3.

Geographical distribution of male and female professors

4.

Geographical distribution of male and female managers

5.

Degree of research collaboration

6.

Subject dispersion; and

7.

Citation preference.

According to Hansen (1992), geographic concentration of a field can act as a strong magnet to
attract talented people to the field. “Proximity increases the concentration of information and the
speed of information flows (Hansen, 1992, p.97). This study provides quantitative knowledge to
4

identify the geographical distribution of the citing authors of RMJ, which can then form the basis
for future studies to investigate, for example, the relationship between institutional programs and
geographic concentration, and ways to attract Records Management talents to Canada.

Furthermore, despite many efforts and initiatives, gender inequality still exists in various
disciplines. However, there is very little literature that offers quantitative knowledge regarding the
degree of gender disparities in the field of Records Management. Therefore, this bibliometric
analysis is needed to contribute knowledge and determine whether gender disparity in research
output exists amongst the citing authors who published in RMJ.

This study also investigates the relationships between geographical distribution and gender of the
citing authors of RMJ who held professoriate and management positions. It is well-established that
women are under-represented in academia. The situation is worst in countries like Africa (Dorsey,
1989; Teferra & Altbach, 2004; Charlton, 2003). In addition, studies find that despite women
representing majority of the workforce around the world in many industries, they held only a small
proportion of management positions (Schein, 2001). There is very little literature documenting
these phenomenon in the field of Records Management. The results of this study can determine
whether these phenomenon exist amongst the citing authors who published in RMJ and identify
specific geographic locations that require further attention.

The field of Records Management is undergoing transformation evoked by the rapid change and
development of information and communications technologies (ICT). Interdisciplinary skills with
high level of technological literacy are needed from records managers to handle the changing
environment (Myburgh, 2002; Lamont, 2012). In addition, globalization and ICT have transformed
scholarly publishing to transnational in nature and promoted collaborative research efforts among
scholars. Tracking authorship with bibliometric approach is a useful technique to examine the
spread and diffusion of knowledge (He & Spink, 2002). According to Arora and Pawan (1995), an
“increase in multiple authorship and collaboration between researchers is an indication of growing
professionalism in different fields”. Multiple authorship also shows the development of a
discipline and its tendency of inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary study (Bandyopadhyay,
2001). Studies further find that collaboration may improve the quality of research by making it
5

more inclusive and more complete (Cook & Fonow, 1986; DuBois et al., 1985; Roberts, 1981;
Smith, 1974, 1977). By determining the degree of collaboration and identifying the characteristics
of authorship in RMJ in this study, researchers of the field can better understand the growth and
nature of the literature in the field, and identify collaboration partners to improve their research.

Furthermore, subject dispersion studies are often conducted in bibliometric analysis to determine
the breadth of the subject material covered by authors and understand the overall structure and
development of the discipline (Musib, 1989). Specifically, citation analysis is used in this study to
analyze the subject dispersion of citations in RMJ. It is a quantitative research method in
bibliometric study that is widely used to determine the degree of subject dispersion of a discipline.
Subject dispersion analysis can identify the interrelationship of different subjects covered in the
literature of a discipline and assess their importance for the overall development of the discipline
(Musib, 1989). The results of subject dispersion analysis can reveal the degree to which the
scholars in a discipline depend on the materials from other disciplines, which can then help
determine the degree of inter- and multi-disciplinarity of the discipline (Taher, 1993).

Finally, citation preferences of researchers in RMJ, such as rate of self-citation, correlation
between total number of citations and number of authors, and relationships between gender of the
authors and type of citations, are measured in this study to serve as an important reference to
records management researchers. In addition, the ranked list of most cited journals of RMJ is
generated to help researchers in selecting journals to which to read for generating new research
idea and finding research support material, and to which to submit their research manuscripts. The
ranked lists of most cited authors and most cited works are also created to recognize the most
influential authors and works that have shaped the field.

1.3.

Records Management Journal

In 1989, the Association for Information Management (Aslib) introduced RMJ, as a journal
devoted to Records Management, to address and discuss issues and challenges related to records
around the world (McLeod & Hare, 2010). Emerald acquired RMJ, along with seven other
journals, from Aslib in December 2001 and became one of the leading journal publishers in
6

Records Management (McLeod & Hare, 2010). Publication of RMJ began in 1989, but it was
suspended between 1992 and 1993 when the first editor resigned (McLeod & Hare, 2010). When
the publication resumed in 1994, RMJ established an Editorial Board consisted of six practitioners
and academics (McLeod & Hare, 2010). The number of Board members increased to twelve in
2004 (McLeod & Hare, 2010). Currently, the editorial team of RMJ consists of an editor, a
publisher, a content editor and an editorial advisory board of 18 members (Emerald Group
Publishing, n.d.).
The purpose of RMJ has evolved over time. In 1994, it aimed to publish “material on all aspects
of creating, processing and the disposal or retention of records, whatever their form, emphasizing
the latest research and current practice” (McLeod & Hare, 2010, p.11). Then, since 2004, RMJ has
been focusing on providing the following:

1.

“a forum for the dissemination of scholarly articles, professional practice, research
reports and critical reviews in records management;

2.

a link between research and scholarship and reflective professional best practice so
that both are informed and enhanced; and

3.

a link between research, scholarship and practice in records management and other
relevant disciplines” (McLeod & Hare, 2010, p.11).

According to McLeod and Hare (2010), RMJ defines its scope in a rather broad manner as
“explores all aspects of records management, i.e. is inclusive rather than exclusive, from the
different perspectives of practitioners, researchers and educators across all sectors and
internationally. This encompasses the latest research and thinking, current best practice, legal and
other frameworks and case studies, within the context of the electronic environment and across the
entire continuum, including archives” (McLeod & Hare, 2010, p.12.)

7

Based on the said scope, RMJ accepts contributions with the following focuses:

1.

“concepts and frameworks for understanding and helping to manage records in any
form;

2.

findings of research relating to all aspects of records management and/or research

In addition, RMJ also publishes reviews of various academic sources, such as books and study
guides, to achieve its comprehensive approaches in publication policies (McLeod & Hare, 2010,
p.12). Today, RMJ is “the only English-language academic/scholarly journal focused on records
management that is peer-reviewed and not published by a professional society” (McLeod & Hare,
2010, p.13).

Purpose of the Study

Through a bibliometric analysis of the contents of the first twenty-five years of Records
Management Journal (RMJ), this study presents a multi-dimensional view and identifies salient
aspects of evolution of published research and opinion articles in Records Management in the
period 1989-2013. The purpose of conducting this bibliometric analysis was to contribute
quantitative knowledge regarding specific issues in the field, including geographic concentration,
gender balance, geographical distribution of male and female professors and managers, degree of
research collaboration, degree of subject dispersion and citation preferences, by profiling the
characteristics of the scholarship published in one of the central journals in the field of Records
Management as a discipline and as a practice. This study also ascertains trends and patterns of
8

authorship, recognizes active authors and institutions involved in the field, and identifies the most
influential authors, journals, literature and documents of the field.

1.5.

Definition of Terms

The following conceptual and operational definitions of terms were used in this study:

1.

Bibliometrics: Bibliometrics were defined by Young (1983) as “the use of statistical
methods in the analysis of a body of literature to reveal the historical development
of subject fields and patterns of authorship, publication, and use” (p.22).

2.

Cited Work: In this study, cited work refers to work that was cited by the citing
articles published in RMJ.

3.

Significance of the Study

This study provides an overview of the worldwide distribution of knowledge contribution in RMJ
since 1989, identifies professional background and academic activities of the scholars, ascertains
patterns of research output, and anticipates future trends and directions of scholarship. With very
limited existing research concerning the development of Records Management, the need for a
systematic analysis on literature publication is undeniable. This study is needed to fill the gap of
lacking bibliometric studies in Records Management and contribute baseline information about
Records Management scholarship that can be used in future comparative examinations. This
bibliometric study is designed to contribute quantitative knowledge regarding specific issues in
the field, including geographic concentration, gender balance, geographical distribution of male
and female professors and managers, degree of research collaboration, degree of subject dispersion
and citation preferences. The results of this study will be valuable to scholars, practitioners,
11

institutions, and policymakers in the field, as this study could shed light on the most influential
scholar and literature in the field. More importantly, this study can provide indicators and
information to help develop future program curricula of Records Management as a discipline and
help establish best practice of the field as a profession.

1.8.

Assumptions and Limitations

A primary assumption is made in this study that the articles published in RMJ, as one of the leading
journals in Records Management, capture and represent the most important and original
contributions of ideas and research findings to the field of Records Management. RMJ was
assumed to be representative of Records Management research. This study further assumes that all
articles published in RMJ are selected and approved on the basis of their knowledge contribution
to the field of Records Management. It also assumes that the selection and approval processes and
criteria are the same for all published articles. However, a limitation of this study is that it is based
solely on RMJ. Articles in Records Management are scattered throughout journals of other
disciplines, such as archives and information management, and other professions, such as health
information management and legal records management (Force & Shaffer, 2013). It is recognized
that literature pertinent to the field of Records Management is published in journals other than
RMJ. Therefore, further studies of other journals in the field of Records Management may be
needed to arrive at more generalizable conclusions. In addition, scholarship is communicated
through multiple media, such as books and web-based contents, and research activity is only one
aspect of scholarly development in the field. This study recognizes the limitation that none of those
other sources of scholarship were considered in this study.

In addition, this study only measures quantitative characteristics of the scholarship. It does not
evaluate qualitative elements of the articles published in RMJ. It also recognizes the possibility of
authors with same names and initials. Furthermore, this study assumes that all information, such
as citations, recorded in the articles is accurate. It is recognized that the data gathered from the
scholarship can only accurately reflect the characteristics of the citing articles at the time of
publication. The quality of the analyses was dependent on the accurate and consistent application
of classification systems, such as Library of Congress classification system and Dewey Decimal
12

Classification system, by the individuals who assigned the subject class. Finally, despite rigorous
steps have been taken to ensure accuracy and minimize human error, this study recognizes the
possibility of minor omissions and miscounts in this study. However, these limitations are highly
unlikely to invalidate the results of this study.

Review of the Related Literature
2.1.

Introduction

After introducing the background of Records Management, as a discipline and as a practice, and
Records Management Journal (RMJ) in the previous chapter, this chapter provides a review of
literature on the field of Records Management and the basic theoretical overview and techniques
of bibliometric study.

2.2.

Records Management

2.2.1. Definitions of Records Management
According to Choksy (2006), the term “Records Management” was first used “in the
organizational chart for the Sales Department of the DuPont Company for 1919-1921” (p.18). The
term was not commonly used until after the Second World War (Choksy, 2006). Since then,
Records Management has not only become a profession, but also a scholarly discipline. The term
“Records Management” has been defined by many scholars based on the activities and functions
involved in the field. Robek, Brown and Maedke (1987) define Records Management as “the
application of systematic and scientific control to all of the recorded information that an
organisation needs to do business” (p.5). Ricks, Swafford and Gow (1992) refer to Records
Management as “a function that provides for the systematic control of records from creation, or
receipt, through their processing, distribution, organisation, storage and retrieve to their ultimate
disposition” (p.3). Penn, Pennix and Coulson (1994) define Records Management as “the
management of any information captured in reproducible form that is required for conducting
business” (p.5), which mentions the management aspect of the field. The Records Management
Society of Great Britain defines Records Management as “the systematic control, organization,
access to and protection of an organization’s information, whether it be on tape, disk, paper or
film, from its creation, through its use, to its permanent retention or legal destruction” (Bell, 1998).
Emmerson (1989) emphasized that Records Management is “an administrative system by which
14

an organization seeks to control the creation, distribution, filing, retrieval, storage and disposal of
those records which are created or received by that organization in the course of its business” (p.5).
Wallace, Lee and Schubert (1992) offer a functional definition that “records management is the
systematic control placed over the life cycle of recorded information from creation to ultimate
disposition or permanent storage of a records” (p.1).

The Australian Standard AS 4390-1996 provides a more comprehensive definition that Records
Management is “the discipline and organizational function of managing records to meet
operational business needs, accountability requirements and community expectations” (Australian
Standard, 1996, p.6). This definition includes the following different aspects of Records
Management:


“managing the records continuum, from the design of a recordkeeping systems to the end
of the record’s existence;



providing a service to meet the needs, and protect the interests, of the organisation and its
clients;



capturing complete, accurate, reliable and useable documentation of organisational activity
to meet legal, evidential and accountability requirements;



managing records as an asset and information resource rather than as a liability; and



promoting efficiency and economy, both in the management of records and in
organisational activity, as a whole, through sound recordkeeping practices” (Australian
Standard, 1996, p.4).

Furthermore, the ISO 15489-1: 2001 (International Organization for Standardization, 2001)
standards on Records Management defines Records Management as “the field of management
responsible for the efficient and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and
disposition of records, including the processes for capturing and maintaining evidence of and
information about business activities and transactions in the form of records.” This definition
highlights the concept regarding life cycle of records and emphasizes the evidential nature of
records in Records Management.
15

Although these definitions can help the field of Records Management develop its unique
characteristics and allow it to firmly establish its status in both academic and business
environments, it is often difficult to separate the functions between Records Management and other
recordkeeping related disciplines, such as Archival Management and Information Management.

2.2.2. Relationships with Other Disciplines

People who work in the field of Records Management come from a wide variety of professional
levels with different backgrounds, including lawyer, librarian and secretary (Hare, McLeod, &
King, 1996). According to Yeo (2007), the concept of Records Management is multi-disciplinary
in nature. Particularly, Records Management and other recordkeeping related disciplines, such as
Archival Management and Information Management, are closely related and share a distinct body
of knowledge (Kennedy & Schauder, 1998).

For a long time, the field of Records Management existed as a partner of Archival Management.
Both Archival Management and Records Management often grow side-by-side as two closely
related academic fields. Duranti (1989) argues that records managers and archivists “are two
branches of a single profession” (p.10), which share the same theoretical background.
Traditionally, records managers performed the function of company archivist and mainly
responsible for handling inactive and historical records (Sanders, 1993). By 1970s, Archival
Management and Records Management became two separate field due to the unique and different
skills set required by these two disciplines (Sanford, 2010). The University of Northumbria
introduced new programmes that focused on records and information (Shepherd, 2006). It was
then recognized that archivists served the past, while records managers interested in the present to
improve efficiency of business organizations (Sanford, 2010). The goal of Records Management
is to effectively, efficiently and systematically manage and control the creation, receipt,
maintenance, use, and disposition of different forms of proprietary information generated by
businesses during their normal course of operations (Mäkinen & Henttonen, 2011). Records
Management was traditionally focusing on managing physical records, but businesses are now
required to handle both paper-based and electronic information (Microsoft, 2008). By 1980s,
Records Management became a significant part of the curriculum of the universities in the United
16

Kingdom (Shepherd, 2006). However, the fields of Archival Management and Records
Management continue to maintain a strong partner relationship in academic development.

The field of Records Management also has close relationship with Information Management.
According to Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM), Information
Management is “the collection and management of information from one or more sources and the
distribution of that information to one or more audiences” (AIIM, 2014). Both Information
Management and Records Management share the same interest in material that appears in different
formats, such as print, electronic, and audio. However, one of the key differences between these
two disciplines is that Information Management has a much narrower focus to simply managing
records that support business activities, while Records Management aims broadly at “managing,
preserving, and capturing the evidential value of records” (Sanford, 2010, p.9).

Despite having close historical ties with other disciplines, Records Management has firmly
established its academic and professional status around the world. The unique characteristics of
the scholarship in RMJ identified in this study will help further growth and development of
Records Management in all settings.

2.3.

Bibliometric Methods

2.3.1. Theoretical Background

Bibliometics has been widely used in various disciplines since the 1970s, such as communications
(Reeves & Borgman, 1983), computer science (Subramanyam, 1976), economics (Coats, 1971),
education (DeYoung, 1985), and psychology (Meyers, 1970). It has further become a subdiscipline in history, sociology, and library and information science (Lawani, 1981). Bibliometric
analysis provides insights into the intellectual development within an academic field by conducting
quantitative analysis of the data gathered from published literature and studying the patterns within
a field. The underlying assumption of this method is that research articles represent knowledge
produced by scientific research (Okubo, 1997).
17

The term “bibliometrics” was coined by Pritchard in 1969 and defined as “the application of
mathematics and statistical methods to books and other media of communication” (Pritchard,
1969, p.348). Its purpose was “to shed light on the process of written communication in science.
Its primary goal is to identify the nature and course of development of a given scientific discipline
(in so far as this is displayed through written communication) by means of counting and analyzing
the various facets of written communication” (Pritchard, 1969, p.348). Then, the scope of
bibliometrics was broadened by Fairthorne (1969) in the same year by including the “quantitative
treatment of the properties of recorded discourse and behaviour appertaining to it” (p.341).
Many scholars offer their own definition to the term “bibliometrics”. Young (1983) defines
bibliometrics as “the use of statistical methods in the analysis of a body of literature to reveal the
historical development of subject fields and patterns of authorship, publication, and use” (p.22).
Boyce and Kraft (1985) state that “bibliometrics is the quantitative study of written communication
through its physical realization” (p.163). de Glas (1986) defines bibliometrics as “the search for
systematic patterns in comprehensive bodies of literature” (p.40). White and McCain (1989)
describe bibliometrics as “the quantitative study of literatures as they are reflected in
bibliographies. Its task, immodestly enough, is to provide evolutionary models of science,
technology, and scholarship” (p.119). Tague-Sutcliffe (1992) refers to bibliometrics as “the study
of quantitative aspects of the production, dissemination, and use of recorded information. It
develops mathematical models and measures for these processes and then use the models and
measures for prediction and decision making” (p.1).

In the early stage, bibliometric analysis was used to identify scholars in different disciplines and
connect them by their shared theories and concepts (Hammarfelt, 2012). Derek J. deSolla Price’s
Little Science, Big Science (1963) introduces the basic concepts of bibliometrics to the scholarly
world. In addition, Price developed the Price’s Index (Price, 1970) as a tool to map trends and
patterns derived from citation analysis against the literature of various disciplines. In 1973, Small
and Marshakova employed the citation-based mapping bibliometric technique to explore the
intellectual structure of the disciplines and associated sub-disciplines (Small, 1973; Marshakova,
1973). As the development progress, bibliometric studies have been used to identify theoretical
concepts, scholarly works and journals that have the most impact on a discipline, and to highlight
18

the most influential authors who contributed knowledge to the same field (Heberger, Christie, &
Alkin, 2010). Bibliometrics is often being used to evaluate and rank countries, universities,
research institutes, journals, specific research topics and specific disciplines (Huang, Ho, & Chang,
2006). It is also useful to generate benchmark data for the purpose of monitoring the development
of disciplines and identifying needed research areas (Gauthier, 1998). In addition, it has been used
to investigate patterns of collaboration among scholars to determine whether the field is developing
in a connected way (Melin & Persson, 1996; Melin & Persson, 1998; Traynor, Rafferty, &
Lewison, 2001).

However, the use of bibliometric approach in research has been criticized by some scholars.
According to Hung (2012), although bibliometric studies allow researchers to gather quantitative
information from large amounts of historical data, this approach pays too much attention to the
numbers and undermines the importance of the actual content. van Raan (2005) states that the
reliability of bibliometric indicators depends heavily on the level of sophistication of the technical
system and the methodology that form the basis of these indicators. In addition, the data collection
procedures and use of quantitative measures in bibliometric studies have been criticized for their
limitations to undermine the main characteristics of scholarly production and communication
processes (van Raan, 2005).

Despite the limitations of bibliometrics, the results of bibliometric studies are highly reliable and
objective as they are generated from an analysis of the published record (Broadus, 1981). Patterns
and regularities of the field can be revealed by analyzing the characteristics of the citing articles
and cited articles published over a long period of time within the field. While publishing articles
in academic journals is one of the primary vehicles of scholarly communication in any discipline,
bibliometric analysis of the contents and elements of scholarly journal can show the productivity,
trends and focuses of research in the discipline and in the journal itself, which can then reveal
changes in the interests and concerns of the authors and of the discipline itself (Koehler et al.
2000).

19

2.3.2. Bibliometric Indicators

To evaluate the quality of scientific publication, rich data is extracted from each literature, which
forms the basis of bibliometric studies. Common elements analyzed in bibliometric studies include
authorship, title, publication dates, form of publication, language of communication, subject,
references, citations, institutions, and geographical distributions (Nicholas & Ritchie, 1978;
Glänzel, 2003). These elements are mapped out through bibliometric analyses to present precise
chronological sequence of events in a discipline (Nicholas & Ritchie, 1978).

Furthermore, various indicators are established to facilitate objective measurements of the quality
of scholarship. According to Gauthier (1998), “bibliometric indicators provide the only overall
picture of the scientific output of a country” (p.9). He divided bibliometric indicators into two
categories: descriptive indicators and relational indicators (Gauthier, 1998).

Descriptive indicators, such as listings of articles and citations, aim to assess knowledge
contribution of institutions, journals, and authors to a discipline (Gauthier, 1998). Descriptive
indicators include simple counts of number of publication, co-authors, references, and citations
(Gauthier, 1998; Okubo, 1997). Publication trends and patterns of a field can be identified by
analyzing the publication behaviour of the authors and institutions in a specific geographic area
and comparing the productivity and output among scholars, institutions, and countries (Gauthier,
1998).

Relational indicators seek to highlight relationships found inside literature of a field, such as
collaborative efforts between authors. One of the most common relational indicators used in
bibliometric studies is co-author analysis (Gauthier, 1998). It is based on the assumption that when
two or more scholars publish an article together, they are intellectually and socially connected to
each other (Gauthier, 1998). This indicator is particularly useful to reveal flow of knowledge,
collaborative and cooperation efforts, and links and interactions between scholars, institutions and
disciplines (Gauthier, 1998). Co-word analysis and co-citation analysis are also examples of
relational indicators, which analyze the content of the articles to map out scholarly activities and
20

patterns of a discipline (Gauthier, 1998). By analyzing co-citation patterns, the most published and
cited authors in the field, networks of articles and authors, and structure of the scientific field can
be identified (Okubo, 1997). This information is useful to determine new research topics,
connections between disciplines, and evolutions experienced by different disciplines (Gauthier,
1998).

2.3.3. Citation Analysis
The term “citation” is defined as an “acknowledgement that one document receives from another”,
which represents a relationship between the cited and citing author (Smith, 1981, p.83). Cronin
(1981) states that citations are frozen footprints that represent scholarly achievement of
researchers. According to Garfield (1979), citation analysis has the potential to achieve various
purposes. For example, it can ascertain the original source of an idea or concept, identify
methodology, and provide support for claims.

Citation analysis is one of the most common methods used in bibliometric studies. It studies the
characteristics and patterns of citations in scholarly works to establish relationships between
researchers and their scholarly works (Smith, 1981). This method is based on the assumption that
citations are simple and explicit connections between articles that represent scholarly knowledge
flows (Garfield, 1979). It also assumes that citations of a scholarly work reflect the merit, quality,
significance, and impact of that scholarly work (Smith, 1981). Therefore, it is widely used to
examine knowledge exchange in various disciplines (Chang & Hung, 2004). Citation analysis is a
strong indicator for scientific performance when applying it to analyze a group of authors as a
whole over a long period of time (van Raan, 2005). Bauer and Bakkalbasi (2005) state that citation
analysis allows the researcher to track and measure the development and impact of an article
through time.

Citation analysis has been used to examine various aspects and structures of literature. Gross and
Gross (1927) was one of the earliest studies used citation analysis to rank chemistry journals by
the number of times they were cited. Gross and Woodford (1931) employ citation analysis to
examine six American geologic literature published in 1929 and determine the form dispersion,
21

temporal span, language dispersion, title distribution, and subject dispersion during that period.
Bandyopadhyay and Nandi (2001) use citation analysis in their study and find that books were the
most favourite source of reference in the field of political science, followed by periodical. Zhang
(2008) also uses citation analysis to analyze the degree of subject dispersion and citation
preferences of the researchers in the field of International Relations. The study finds that
international relations scholars were more heavily relied on books than on journals and that the
field had a low level of subject dispersion (Zhang, 2008).

On the other hand, researchers recognize the limitations of citation analysis. Critics often focus on
both assumptions and methods of studies in citation analysis (Smith, 1981). According to Garfield
(1983), citation analysis as an indicator of individual performance is inadequate. The analysis must
take into consideration the publishing and citing conventions of the field, the age of the authors,
and the prestige status of the journals (Garfield, 1983). In addition, multiple authorship, selfcitations, authors with same name and initials, and errors in citing of sources are important factors
that must be considered and adjusted (Smith, 1981; Garfield, 1983).

Currently, little has been done in the literature of Records Management to identify the
characteristics and trends of the scholarship development in the field. This thesis reports results
from a bibliometric analysis of the contents of the first twenty-five years of RMJ, which presents
a multi-dimensional view of published research and opinion articles in Records Management in
the period 1989-2013. This study profiles the characteristics of the scholarship published in RMJ
in order to identify salient aspects of the evolution of the field. Both descriptive and relational
indicators are used in this study to unpack specific issues in RMJ. Particularly, citation analysis is
used in this study to perform subject dispersion analysis and identify citation preferences of the
researchers in RMJ. As a result, this study achieves the purpose of ascertaining trends and patterns
of the authorship, recognizing active authors and institutions involved in knowledge contribution,
and identifying the most influential authors, journals, literature and documents of the field.

Conclusion

Bibliometric study has been widely used by various disciplines since the 1970s to reveal trends
and patterns of a discipline. Being a relatively young discipline and practice with limited
bibliometric study performed in the field of Records Management, the necessity of this
bibliometric study is undeniable. Existing literature regarding the field of Records Management
and bibliometrics have been reviewed in this chapter to set the stage for the discussion of various
issues of the field presented in Chapter 5 of this thesis.

Methodology
3.1.

Introduction

After reviewing the existing literature regarding the field of Records Management and bibliometric
analysis in the previous chapter, this chapter presents the data source, data collection and data
analysis processes used in the study.

3.2.

Data Source

In this study, bibliometrics was used to examine the evolution of records management literature.
Force and Shaffer (2013) recognized that articles of Records Management are dispersed
throughout many different journals of different disciplines and professions. One of the leading
international journals in Records Management was selected for this study: Records Management
Journal (RMJ). The journal selection process involved four stages. First, a list of 38 journals
identified by Simmons College as Archives and Records Management Journals in 2012 was
examined (Watkins, 2012). This list of 38 was then narrowed to 21 journals that received "active",
"peer-reviewed" and "academic / scholarly" rankings in Ulrich's Periodicals Directory. This list
of 21 was then shortened to seven high quality journals that were recognized with a ranking of A
or above in the ranked journal list published by Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) in
2010 (ERA, 2010). Finally, journals devoted exclusively to topics in archives were removed from
this list. Consequently, RMJ was selected as a representative example of Records Management
research literature because it is the only English-language peer-reviewed academic journal
exclusively devoted to Records Management.

RMJ began publication in 1989 and was initially published on a quarterly basis for the first three
years. Then, the publication was suspended in 1992 and 1993 when the first editor resigned
(McLeod & Hare, 2010). RMJ published two issues in 1994 and 1995. Then, it has been publishing
three issues per year since 1996. All of the articles, including book reviews, published in RMJ for
the publication period from 1989 to 2013 were examined. Documents under the headings of “Call
24

for authors,” “Editorial,” “Letter from ARMA International,” “Letter from the Records
Management Society,” and “Biographical notes” were excluded from this study, since their impact
and beneficial value to the study findings were minimal. Eight republished articles published in
Volume 20, Issue 1 in 2010 were also excluded from the analyses. A total of 23 Volumes, 70 Issues
and 502 articles were available for analysis. All articles used in this study were either accessed
from the electronic versions of the publisher’s database or the print versions of RMJ retrieved from
the library of the University of Toronto.

The data collection processes in this study are designed and planned systematically to ensure the
quality, integrity and accuracy of the data. First, a coding scheme was created based on
classification systems established in various well-recognized databases. Then, data was coded
consistently and systematically according to this coding scheme. Each citing author in the citing
article was given one data entry in the database, which equivalent to a total of 362 citing authors.
26

A total of 614 data entries were generated when citing articles with multiple citing authors were
counted. When analyzing institutional affiliation and average number of the cited works, only the
first citing author of the citing articles with multiple authors were used. The citing authors’
biographical notes provided in RMJ were analyzed to extract data regarding sex, occupation,
institutional affiliation, and geographic location of the citing authors.

The sex of a citing author was either male or female, which was determined based on the first
name of the citing author. If the sex of the citing author was not able to clearly identify based on
the first name of the citing author, a search for additional information of the citing author was
conducted on the Internet. After exhausting all publicly available sources of information to identify
the sex of the citing author, “indeterminable” was entered in the database. All citing authors for
each citing article were tabulated. Equal weight was given to all citing authors in each citing article
with no distinction between the ranking of first, second, or third citing author.

Each citing author was assigned to countries based on the information provided in the citing
authors’ biographical notes and the address of the institutions given in the citing articles.
Geographical location of the institutions was entered by continental regions, sub-regions and
countries according to the classification system of the United Nations Statistics Division (United
Nations Statistics Division, 2014). Furthermore, each citing author was assigned to one category
of institutional affiliation, which included educational institution, government agency, non-profit
organization, private organization, publisher, society/committee, others, and indeterminable. For
citing authors with academic appointments at institutions of higher education, their departmental
affiliations were identified and categorized based on the ISI subject categories.
Occupation of each citing author was identified based on the citing authors’ biographical notes
given in the publication. When more than one occupation was provided, only the most recent one
was used in the analyses. Thus, all occupations indicated in the publication were recorded and
taken into account. Each citing author was assigned to one category of occupation, which included
Archivists, Consultants, Editors/Authors, Government Officers, Historians, Librarians,
Management, Professors/Lecturers/Researchers, Records Managers, Technology Consultants,
Others, and Indeterminable.
27

Additional sources of information, such as citing author’s own website, institution website, and
publishers’ databases, were used to gather missing data. After exhausting all publicly available
sources of information to collect the missing data, “indeterminable” was entered in the database.

3.3.3. Data Collection for the Cited Authors and Cited Works

A complete list of cited works for every citing article published in RMJ was complied. A total of
4,663 cited works were gathered for analysis. Multiple data entries were generated in the analyses
when cited works with multiple cited authors were counted. All references, citations, or footnotes
that cited a specific work were included in the analyses. Each “op cit.” and “ibid” was not counted
as a new cited work. Five major sources of the cited works were identified in this study: Periodical,
Book, Government and official document or publication, Conference, and Dissertation or Thesis.
Furthermore, the cited journals were grouped by the latest name of the journal. Therefore, all
changes made to the title of a journal over the years are counted as a single title.

To measure the degree of subject dispersion of the cited works, each work was first assigned to a
class based on Library of Congress classification system and Dewey Decimal Classification
system according to the WorldCat database. Then, each class was tabulated. No Library of
Congress class was assigned to 1,966 cited works according to the WorldCat database, which were
excluded in the analyses. A total of 2,697 cited works associated with Library of Congress subjects
were analyzed. Furthermore, no Dewey Decimal Classifications was assigned to 2,103 cited works
according to the WorldCat database, which were excluded in the analyses. A total of 2,560 cited
works associated with Dewey Decimal Classifications were analyzed.

Data Analysis

The goal of conducting the data analysis was to find meanings in the raw data collected from the
citing articles of RMJ and provide answers to the research questions. Data collected from the citing
articles was counted, calculated, and analyzed statistically with Microsoft Excel 2013. First, each
data set for the citing authors, citing articles, cited authors and cited works was analyzed in
isolation to identify characteristics of the citing authors, citing articles, cited authors and cited
works. Then, different sets of data were combined and analyzed to determine relationships between
them. During the data analysis process, tables and charts were generated to illustrate results of the
study.

Conclusion

The goal of data collection and data analysis processes were to ensure quality, objectivity,
integrity, utility, reliability, and accuracy of the data. Rigorous steps were taken in the data
collection and analysis processes to achieve this goal and minimize human error. This study
recognizes the possibility of omissions and miscounts. However, they are highly unlikely to
invalidate the results of this study.

30

7.

In the citing articles published in RMJ between 1989 to 2013, who are the most
cited authors?

To answer these research questions, this chapter presents four groups of analyses as follows:

4.2.

1.

Characteristics of the citing authors;

2.

Characteristics of the citing articles;

3.

Characteristics of the cited works; and

4.

Relationships between the citing authors, citing articles, and cited works.

Characteristics of the Citing Authors

Each citing author in the citing article was given one data entry in the database, which equivalent
to a total of 362 citing authors. A total of 614 data entries were generated in some analyses when
citing articles with multiple citing authors were counted. The characteristics of the citing authors
are as follows:

4.2.1. Distribution of Citing Author by Gender

A total of 614 citing authors were included in this analysis. The gender of six citing authors (1
percent) was indeterminable. 321 (52.28 percent) citing authors were female and 287 (46.74
percent) citing authors were male. The results show very little gender disparities in publication
productivity in RMJ.

Furthermore, gender distribution based on the first citing author of 502 citing articles was
analyzed. The gender of six first citing authors (1.20 percent) was indeterminable. The results
show that the contributions of male and female citing authors were fairly equal during the period
1989-2013. Female citing authors contributed 265 (52.79 percent) citing articles, and male citing
authors contributed 231 (46.02 percent).
31

Figure 1 shows the gender distribution of the citing authors over time. A period between 1992 and
1993 was excluded from Figure 1 as there was no publication during this period. The study shows
a trend toward an increased representation of female citing authors. The results also indicate that
male and female citing authors alternately dominated each other in knowledge contribution to
RMJ. From 1989 to 1994, male citing authors outnumbered female citing authors. Then, female
citing authors outnumbered male citing authors from 1995 to 2000. Then, male citing authors
dominated from 2001 to 2005. The next five years from 2006 to 2010 were dominated by female
citing authors. Then, there were more male citing authors than female citing authors in 2011.
However, female citing authors dominated again since 2012 and representation of female citing
authors was growing. It is important to note that the number of male citing authors was declining
rapidly since 2011.

Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of the citing authors over time (by continental
origins). A period between 1992 and 1993 was excluded from Figure 2 as there was no publication
during this period. The continental origins of 24 (3.91 percent) citing authors were indeterminable.
Europe was the home of most citing authors with 435 (70.85 percent). Oceania came second with
60 (9.77 percent), followed by Africa and Asia each with 32 (5.21 percent). Finally, Americas was
the home of 31 (5.05 percent) citing authors. The results also reveal a trend toward an increased
representation of citing authors in Europe and Oceania.

positions. Each citing author was counted once. Only the most recent occupation was counted.
Based on the results found in Table 7, a total of 25 female citing authors who held management
positions were included in this analysis. The results reveal that 17 (68 percent) female managers
were from the United Kingdom and two (8 percent) from Australia. In terms of continental origins,
21 (84 percent) female managers were from Europe, two (8 percent) from Oceania, one (4 percent)
from Americas, and one (4 percent) from Africa. It is important to note that there was no female
citing author who held management positions in Asia.

Compared to the results shown in Table 10, Australia only had two female managers, but it had
ten male managers. In addition, Canada had two male managers and no female manager. In terms
of continental origins, vast majority of the authors who held management positions were in Europe.
Oceania had 11 male managers and only had two female managers. The amount of authors who
held management positions in Americas, Asia and Africa were very low.

4.2.8. Distribution of Citing Author by Institutional Affiliation

Figure 3 shows the institutional affiliation of the citing authors over time (by category). For articles
with multiple authors, only the first author of the articles was counted in this analysis. Only
educational institutions, government agencies and private organizations are shown in Figure 3. A
period between 1992 and 1993 was excluded from Figure 3 as there was no publication during this
period. Out of 502 citing authors, 237 (47.21 percent) citing authors were affiliated with
educational institutions, 109 (21.71 percent) were affiliated with private organizations, 70 (13.94
percent) were affiliated with government agencies, 20 (3.98 percent) were affiliated with
publishers, 17 (3.39 percent) were affiliated with non-profit organizations, and six (1.2 percent)
were affiliated with societies or committees. The institutional affiliation of 43 (8.57 percent) citing

Table 12 shows institutions that were affiliated with four or more citing authors. A total of 214
institutions were identified. The institution affiliation of 33 (9.12 percent) citing authors was
indeterminable. 13 institutions were associated with four or more authors, which amounted to
25.27 percent of all citing authors. In addition, the results reveal that the University of Northumbria
associated with 30 citing authors. Therefore, the University of Northumbria concentrated the
highest amount of citing authors.

4.2.9. Gender Distribution of Citing Authors in the Institutions

Based on the results found in Table 12, out of 30 citing authors associated with the University of
Northumbria, 23 (76.67 percent) were female citing authors and seven (23.33 percent) were male
citing authors. In addition, out of ten citing authors associated with the University College London,
four (40 percent) were female citing authors and six (60 percent) were male citing authors. No
regular pattern was found regarding gender distribution of citing authors in the institutions.

4.2.10. Degree of Research Collaboration among the Citing Authors

Upon examining the authorship of the citing articles in RMJ, the results reveal little multiple
authorship, which implies limited collaborative research efforts among citing authors in RMJ. The
majority of the citing articles were written by a single author. Out of 502 citing articles, 426 (84.86
percent) were single authored, only 52 (10.36 percent) with two authors, 19 (3.78 percent) with
three authors, and five (1 percent) with four authors. Overall, only 76 (15.14 percent) citing articles
were co-authored. The results indicate that the citing authors published in RMJ were not prone to
collaboration. Single authorship was the norm.
Figure 4 shows the differences between same-gender collaborations and cross-gender
collaborations. A period between 1992 and 1993 was excluded from Figure 4 as there was no
publication during this period. Out of 502 citing articles, 44 (8.76 percent) citing articles were
written by researchers, who collaborated with others of the same gender, and 32 (6.37 percent)
citing articles were written by researchers, who collaborated with others of the opposite gender.
Therefore, the results show preference for same-gender collaborations in RMJ. However, the
difference between same-gender and cross-gender collaborations is not statistically significant
according to the t-test performed in this study. There is also a trend toward an increased samegender collaborations and cross-gender collaborations.

Figure 5 shows the number of collaborations over time. A period between 1992 and 1993 was
excluded from Figure 5 as there was no publication during this period. Out of 76 citing articles
with multiple authors, 62 (81.58 percent) research was collaborated within the same country, 13
(17.11 percent) research was collaborated across different countries, and one (1.32 percent)
research was collaborated with indeterminable country(ies). The results show a trend toward an
increased number of same country collaborations and total number of collaborations in research
published in RMJ. However, the level of cross-national collaborations remained very low.

Characteristics of the Cited Works

A total of 4,663 cited works from RMJ published between 1989 and 2013 were analyzed. The
characteristics of the cited works are as follows:

4.4.1. Time Span of Publication of the Cited Works

Figure 10 shows the time span of publication of the cited works. 116 (2.49 percent) cited works
had no information on year of publication. Although the time span of publication of the cited works
is relatively long between year 1772 and 2013 (a total of 242 years), 4,143 (88.85 percent) cited
works were published within the past 25 years between 1989 and 2013. Therefore, the results show
that the citing authors preferred relatively current sources of information to support their research.

Figure 11 shows number of sources cited in each citing article over time. A period between 1992
and 1993 was excluded from Figure 11 as there was no publication during this period. A total of
4,663 sources from 502 citing articles were included in this analysis. This study shows that number
of sources cited in each citing article ranged from 0 to 99. 318 (63.35 percent) citing articles cited
between zero and five sources, 50 (9.96 percent) cited six to ten sources, 29 (5.78 percent) cited
11 to 15 sources, and 105 (20.92 percent) cited 15 or more sources. It is important to note that 226
(45.02 percent) citing articles cited no sources. The results show a trend toward a decreased
number of citing articles cited five or fewer sources. By contrast, the number of citing articles cited
15 or more sources appeared to be growing over time.

Five major sources of the cited works were identified in this study: Periodical, Book, Government
and official document or publication, Conference, and Dissertation or Thesis. Figure 12 shows the
trends of these five major sources of the cited works. A period between 1992 and 1993 was
excluded from Figure 12 as there was no publication during this period. This study shows a trend
toward an increase in citing periodicals and books by the citing authors.

4.4.4. Subject Dispersion of the Cited Works
Robinson (1973) defines subject dispersion as “the degree to which scholars in an academic
discipline … borrow literature … from other disciplines” or “the extent to which articles on a given
subject actually occur in periodicals devoted to quite other subjects”.

To measure the degree of subject dispersion of the cited works, each cited work was first assigned
to a class based on the Library of Congress Classification System (LC) and Dewey Decimal
Classification (DDC) according to the WorldCat database. Then, each class was tabulated. The
results are as follows:

Table 16 shows the top ten most common LC classes of the cited works. Out of 4,663 cited works,
1,966 cited works were not assigned to any LC class according to the WorldCat database, which
were excluded in this analysis. A total of 2,697 cited works associated with LC classes were
analyzed. 89 LC classes were identified. The top ten most common LC classes shown in Table 16
represented 2,249 (83.42 percent) cited works. The most cited LC class was Class HF, which
represented “Commerce” and accounted for 826 (30.64 percent) cited works, followed by Class
CD represented “Diplomatics/Archives/Seals”, which accounted for 663 (25.59 percent) cited
works. Both Classes HF and CD claimed 55.23 percent of the cited works. The results show
preference of the citing authors for using the literature found in “Commerce” and
“Diplomatics/Archives/Seals” subject areas over others to support their research. Since these
subject areas are closely related to aspects of Records Management, the level of subject dispersion
of citations in RMJ is low.

60

Table 16 also shows that only 79 (2.93 percent) cited works were related to the field of Technology.
Despite the impact of advance technologies on Records Management, the citing authors were only
somewhat reliant on the literature found in “Technology” to support their research.

Table 17 shows the top ten most common DDC classes of the cited works. Out of 4,663 cited
works, 2,103 cited works were not assigned to any DDC class according to the WorldCat database,
which were excluded in this analysis. A total of 2,560 cited works associated with DDC classes
were analyzed. 48 DDC classes were identified. The top ten most common DDC classes
represented 2,296 (89.69 percent) cited works. The most cited DDC class was Class 650, which
represented “Management and Public Relations” and accounted for 939 (36.68 percent) cited
works, followed by Class 020 represented “Library and Information Sciences”, which accounted
for 820 (32.03 percent) cited works. Both Classes 650 and 020 claimed 68.71 percent of the cited
works. The results illustrate that the citing authors relied heavily on the literature found in
“Management and Public Relations” and “Library and Information Sciences” subject areas over
others to support their research. Since these subject areas are closely related to Records
Management, the level of subject dispersion of citations in RMJ is low.

Table 17 also shows that only 132 (5.16 percent) cited works were related to the field of Computer
Science. Despite the impact of advance technologies on Records Management, the citing authors
were only somewhat reliant on the literature found in “Computer Science” to support their
research.

Table 18 shows the number of LC classes and DDC classes associated with the cited works by
five-year period. This analysis demonstrates the degree of subject dispersion of citations in RMJ
over time. Only four years are included in the first and last period, which could be the reason for
the lower number of LC classes and DDC classes used during these two periods. The highest
dispersion occurred between 2005 and 2009 when number of LC classes and DDC classes were
highest. This indicates that more diverse materials from other disciplines were used by the citing
authors in the course of their research, such as Mathematics, Technology, Engineering, History,
Law, Anthropology, Medicine, and Aesthetics. With the increasing number of LC and DDC
classes associated with the cited works, there is a trend toward a higher level of subject dispersion.

4.4.5. The Most Cited Journal

Table 19 shows the top ten most cited journals. Based on 4,663 cited works, multiple entries were
generated for cited works with multiple cited authors and citing articles with multiple citing
authors. A total of 9,129 data entries were generated. 5,297 (58.02 percent) entries were not
associated with any academic journals. 520 journals were identified. In this study, all changes
made to the title of a journal over the years are counted as a single title. The top ten most cited
journals represented 17.88 percent of the cited journals. The most cited journal was Records
Management Journal, which was cited 633 (6.93 percent) times. The results also suggest a low
level of subject dispersion as the top ten most cited journals were specializing in Records
Management and its related disciplines, such as Archives and Information Management. In other
words, the citing authors preferred publishing in journals specialized in Records Management
related topics. Therefore, the subject dispersion of citations in RMJ is insular with a few
exceptions. For example, the Journal of Applied Psychology was cited 46 times, Computers and
Security was cited 16 times, and Nursing Times was cited twice. It was worth noting that the citing
authors depended heavily on works that were not published in any academic journals (58.02
percent of the cited works).

Table 21 shows the top ten cited authors who received the most citations to their works. Each cited
author of the cited works was given one data entry. Multiple data entries were generated when
cited works with multiple cited authors were counted. A total of 6,171 cited authors in the cited
works were included in this analysis. It was worth noting that the top ten most cited authors were
only responsible for 472 (7.65 percent) cited works. 1,176 (19.06 percent) cited works contained
no author attribution. The results show that Professor Julie McLeod of the University of
Northumbria in the United Kingdom received the most citations to her works, which were cited in
a total of 83 times and represented 1.35 percent of all cited works. The works of Professor Sue M.
McKemmish of Monash University in Australia were cited 66 times, which represented 1.07
percent of all cited works and was the second most cited author.

Relationships Between the Citing Authors, Citing Articles, and Cited Works

4.5.1. Differences between male and female citing authors as to the average number of words
used in their articles

The study shows that male citing authors used 3,510 words on average, while female citing authors
used 3,158 words on average. Therefore, there was no significant differences between male and
female citing authors as to the average number of words used in their articles.

4.5.2. Author Self-Citations

The purpose of analyzing the rate of self-citations was to determine how often citing authors cited
themselves. The citations in which the citing articles and the cited works have at least one author
in common were counted. From a total of 502 citing articles, 75 (14.94 percent) citing articles had
one or more self-citations. Out of 502 citing articles, 4,663 cited works were received, of these 228
were self-citations. Thus, the self-citation share amounted to 4.89 percent of all cited works.

4.5.3. Relationship Between the Number of Citing Authors in a Citing Article and the Total
Number of Cited Works

The results from the correlation analysis indicate a correlation coefficient value of
r = -0.000227026. Therefore, the number of citing authors in an article and the total number of
cited works used in an article were not correlated.

67

4.5.4. Differences between male and female citing authors as to the average number of works
cited in their articles

Overall, the study shows that male citing authors cited ten sources on average, while female citing
authors cited 13 sources on average in their citing articles. A two-sample t-test was conducted to
determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between male and female citing
authors as to the average number works cited in their articles. The threshold of significance was
set at p-value = 0.05. The results indicate no statistically significant difference between male and
female citing authors as to the average number works cited in their articles (p-value = 0.44 > 0.05).

Figure 13 shows the average number of works cited by male and female citing authors over time.
A period between 1992 and 1993 was excluded from Figure 13 as there was no publication during
this period. For citing articles with multiple citing authors, only the first citing author of the citing
articles was counted in this analysis. Average number of cited works ranged from 0 to 32 for
female citing authors and 1 to 26 for male cited authors. This study shows a trend toward an
increased in the average number of works cited by both male and female citing authors of the citing
articles.

In this analysis, each cited work in the citing article was given one data entry in the database, which
equivalent to a total of 4,663 cited works. However, a total of 6,171 data entries were generated
when cited works with multiple cited authors were counted.

Table 23 shows the relationship between continental origins of the citing authors and number of
cited works from different sources. Given the majority of the citing authors were from Europe,
there is no surprise that the vast majority of cited works were cited by the citing authors in Europe.
The results also reveal that the citing authors in Africa and Oceania relied on Dissertations or
Theses to support their research more often than the citing authors in other continents.

Table 24 shows the number of cited works from different sources (by continent). The results show
that periodicals were the most commonly consulted source of records management researchers
around the world, except in Asia, followed by books. Government and official documents and
publications were also cited frequently by the citing authors. It was worth noting that the citing
authors in Asia cited more books than periodicals in their research.

4.5.7. Relationship Between Gender and Continental Origins of the Citing Authors Who Cited
Periodicals

In this study, number of periodicals cited by the citing authors represented the number of times the
citing authors cited any periodicals. If the same periodical was cited by multiple citing authors,
multiple entries were generated.

Table 26 shows the relationship between gender and continental origins of the citing authors who
cited periodicals in their articles. Based on the results found in Table 24, 1,429 periodicals were
cited by male citing authors and 2,016 periodicals were cited by female citing authors. Female
citing authors cited more periodicals than male citing authors in all continents, except in Africa.
Therefore, overall, female citing authors relied on periodicals to support their research heavier than
male citing authors.

authors and 467 periodicals cited by female citing authors in Oceania, the study reveals a trend
toward an increased number of periodicals cited by both male and female citing authors in Oceania.
There is also a sharp increase from five periodicals cited in 2010 to 83 periodicals cited in 2012
by male citing authors in Oceania. However, this trend ended with a deep fall in 2013 where only
14 periodicals were cited by male citing authors in this continent. Similarly, there is a sharp rise
from zero periodicals cited in 2011 to 166 periodicals cited in 2012 by female citing authors in
Oceania. However, this trend also ended with a deep decline in 2013 where only 54 periodicals
were cited by female citing authors in this continent.

Books

In this study, number of books cited by the citing authors represented the number of times the
citing authors cited any books. If the same book was cited by multiple citing authors, multiple
entries were generated.

Table 27 shows the relationship between gender and continental origins of the citing authors who
cited books in their articles. Based on the results found in Table 24, 896 books were cited by male
citing authors and 1,019 books were cited by female citing authors. Male citing authors in Africa
and Americas cited more books than female citing authors in these continents. However, female
citing authors in Asia, Europe and Oceania relied on books to support their research heavier than
male citing authors in these continents.

4.5.9. Relationship Between Gender and Continental Origins of the Article Authors Who Cited
Government Documents

In this study, number of government documents cited by the citing authors represented the number
of times the citing authors cited any government documents. If the same government document
was cited by multiple citing authors, multiple entries were generated.

Table 28 shows the relationship between gender and continental origins of the citing authors who
cited government documents in their articles. Based on the results found in Table 24, 210
government documents were cited by male citing authors and 372 were cited by female citing
authors. 107 government documents were cited by female citing authors in Oceania, but only 28
were cited by male citing authors in this continent. Female citing authors in Asia, Europe and
Oceania relied on government documents to support their research heavier than male citing authors
in these continents. By contrast, 29 government documents were cited by male citing authors in
Africa, but only four were cited by female citing authors in this continent.

To sum up the relationships found in this study between gender and continental origins of the
citing authors and number of works cited from different sources, female citing authors overall
relied on periodicals, books and government documents to support their research to a greater extent
than male citing authors. However, the situations were different depending on the region. In Africa,
male citing authors cited more periodicals, books and government documents than female citing
authors. By contrast, the situations in Asia, Europe and Oceania were reversed. Female citing
authors cited more periodicals, books and government documents than male citing authors in these
continents. In Americas, female citing authors cited more periodicals, but fewer books and
government documents than male citing authors.

4.5.10. Relationship Between Gender of the Article Authors and Cited Journals

Table 29 shows the top 20 most cited journals of male citing authors and Table 30 shows the top
20 most cited journals of female citing authors. Based on 4,663 cited works, multiple entries were
generated to account for cited works with multiple cited authors and citing articles with multiple
citing authors. A total of 9,129 data entries were generated. 5,297 (58.02 percent) entries were not
associated with any academic journals. 520 journals were identified. In this study, all changes
made to the title of a journal over the years are counted as a single title. The top 20 most cited
journals of male citing authors represented 17.85 percent of the cited journals. Records
Management Journal topped both lists and was cited 201 times by male citing authors and 432
times by female citing authors. The results reveal that female citing authors relied heavily on the
literature found in journals related to the fields of Records Management, Information Management,
and Archives. By contrast, male citing authors appeared to be more willing to seek support from
material that were published outside of their discipline, such as Psychology, Vocational Behaviour,
Construction Management and Economics, Construction Innovation, Engineering Construction
and Architectural Management, and Medicine.

Conclusion

This chapter aims to analyze the characteristics of the citing authors, citing articles, cited authors,
and cited works, as well as the relationships between them. More importantly, the results of this
study reveals answers to the following research questions:

Research Question 1a: In the citing articles published in RMJ between 1989 to 2013, what are the
trends with regard to sex of the author(s)?


Overall, the amount of female citing authors was slightly higher than the amount of male
citing authors. A trend toward an increased representation of female citing authors was
found. The number of male citing authors declined rapidly since 2011.

Research Question 1b: In the citing articles published in RMJ between 1989 to 2013, what are the
trends with regard to geographic distribution of the author(s)?


The majority of the citing authors were located in the United Kingdom. There is also a
trend toward an increased representation of citing authors in Europe and Oceania.

Research Question 1c: In the citing articles published in RMJ between 1989 to 2013, what are the
trends with regard to single/multiple authorship?


The results reveal little multiple authorship, which implies limited collaborative research
efforts amongst the citing authors who published in RMJ. There is preference for samegender collaborations. The results also indicate a trend toward an increased same-gender
collaborations and cross-gender collaborations. There is a trend toward an increased
number of same country collaborations and total number of collaborations in research
published in RMJ. However, the level of cross-national collaborations remained very low.

84

Introduction

After analyzing the data collected from RMJ in the previous chapter, this chapter discusses the
research findings in this study. The main focus of this chapter is to interpret the characteristics of
the citing authors, citing articles, and cited works of RMJ and to understand the relationships
between them. It also compares the findings with existing literature and provides explanations to
the phenomenon identified in this study. The main issues explored in this chapter include
geographic concentration, gender balance, geographical distribution of male and female professors
and managers, degree of research collaboration among the citing authors, subject dispersion, and
citation preferences of the citing authors.

5.2.

Discussion

5.2.1. Geographic Concentration

This study discusses the prevalence of the citing authors in the United Kingdom. The results
suggest that the institutions in the United Kingdom played a crucial role in generation and
dissemination of scholarly information. The top five most productive institutions were located in
the United Kingdom. According to Hansen (1992), high level of geographic concentration can act
as a strong magnet to attract talented people to the field. “Proximity increases the concentration of
information and the speed of information flows” (Hansen, 1992, p.97). High level of geographic
concentration also encourages establishing new firms in Records Management within the
proximity (Hansen, 1992). These findings consistent with the trends found in this study towards a
higher level of geographic concentration in Europe.

Despite having historical roots in the United Kingdom, a variety of factors can be attributed to the
reasons for such high level of geographic concentration of the citing authors of RMJ. For example,
research policies; education opportunities; availability and accessibility of resources and funding;
87

flows of ideas and information; convenient linkages with Records Management firms and
professions; political stability; level of academic freedom; government policies; and market
demand of the field in different countries. All may play a role in this clustering of scholarly activity
in the United Kingdom. According to Mutula (2009), over “300,000 highly skilled and experienced
professionals from Africa are living and working in Europe and North America” (p.4). Sitienei
and Ocholla (2010) also find that 40 percent of highly skilled professionals and intellectuals from
Kenya migrated to other rich foreign countries due to various reasons, such as political instability
and poor economies, which affected the publication performance of some countries in Africa.
Therefore, it is possible that part of the citing authors of RMJ migrated from countries in Africa to
the United Kingdom and published works using affiliations of the host institutions in this country.
This phenomena could also happen in other developing countries of different continents. Since the
actual reasons for the geographic concentration of the citing authors were not within the scope of
the investigation in this study, this high level of geographic concentration of the citing authors of
RMJ may deserve additional attention in future studies to explore the dynamic process and
determine the fundamental characteristics of RMJ that led to this result.

Furthermore, this study finds that the most productive institution of RMJ was the University of
Northumbria (Northumbria) in the United Kingdom. Many factors may have contributed to this
result. Northumbria, founded in 1880, is one of the best universities in the United Kingdom. It is
a well-established university with stable research funding and resources. Since 2005, Northumbria
began to offer Master’s programmes in Archives and Records Management (Shepherd, 2006). In
1997 to 1998, Northumbria made significant contributions to the research in Records Management,
when it was a partner in a European-funded Records Curriculum Project (Shepherd, 2006). It
proposed changes to the training programmes in Archives and Records Management to meet the
needs of the digital environment (Shepherd, 2000). In the 2000s, Northumbria continued to carry
out its research programmes through the Records Management Research Group with funding from
various organizations, such as the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), and the Joint
Information Systems Committee (JISC) (Shepherd, 2006). It is most probable that the education
opportunities and availability of research funding and resources in Northumbria played a major
role in the high level of publication productivity of citing authors in RMJ. Therefore, it may be
necessary for other educational institutions and research funding agencies to develop initiatives
88

and strategies to attract Records Management talents to the field and boost their publication
performance. Furthermore, it may be an interesting future research topic to determine whether
there is any relationship between academic ranking of the universities and publication productivity
of the authors in Records Management.

5.2.2. Gender Balance

Gender balance is another issue explored in this study. According to Fox (2005), it is important to
first understand the gender differences in publication productivity before gender inequities in
rewards, such as ranking, promotion, and paid rate, can be assessed and rectified. It is widely
accepted that the publication productivity of women is less than men in many disciplines (Cole &
Zuckerman, 1984; Fox 2005; Fox 1983; Hornig, 1987; Long, 1992; Long, 1987). Currently, there
is very little study that offers quantitative knowledge regarding the relationship between gender
and publication productivity in the field of Records Management. This study aims to trace the
gender variation in productivity and determine the degree of male and female authors participated
in the knowledge contribution to RMJ in the period 1989-2013, which may contribute to form part
of the foundation of future research to assess and correct any gender inequities in rewards.

Professions are generally considered female-dominated if at least 70 percent of the professional
population is female (Jacobs, 1989). In this study, the results show very little gender disparity in
the overall publication productivity of the citing authors. The overall gender distribution of the
citing authors was 52 percent females and 47 percent males. The contributions of male and female
citing authors were fairly equal in the period 1989-2013. Female citing authors contributed 265
(52.79 percent) citing articles, and male citing authors contributed 231 (46.02 percent).
Furthermore, the results indicate that male and female citing authors alternately dominated each
other in knowledge contribution during the period. However, it is important to note that the
representation of female authors increased over time, while the number of male authors declined
rapidly since 2011. More importantly, there is significant gender disparity in publication
productivity in Northumbria. Out of 94 citing articles produced by Northumbria, as the most
productive institution, female citing authors were responsible for 83 (88.3 percent) citing articles,
while male citing authors only responsible for 11 (11.7 percent) citing articles. Although the actual
89

reasons for the gender disparity in the institutions were not within the scope of the investigation in
this study, it may be important for records management professions and policymakers of
institutions to consider developing strategies and initiatives to maintain gender balance in the field
and in the institutions.

Studies show that the fields of Archival Management and Information Management are dominated
by female professions and scholars. Walch and Yakel (2006) find that archival profession was
dominated by female (65 percent) in 2005. In the United States, only 16 percent of the full-time
students pursuing the Master’s program in Archives were male in 2004 (Walch & Yakel, 2006).
In addition, the Library, Archive, Records and Information Management Services (LARIMS)
Workforce Survey conducted in 2012 shows that the majority of the workforce in Archives (55
percent) and Records and Information Management services (65 percent) were female (LARIMS,
2012). Study also shows that almost 70 percent of the students in the Department of Information
and Records Management of universities in Turkey were female (Subaşıoğlu & Özdemir, 2009).

The trend toward increasing female citing authors may indicate that the field of Records
Management could eventually become a female-dominated profession like its related disciplines,
Archival Management and Information Management. Therefore, it may be important for Records
Management professions and policymakers of institutions to learn from the lessons of other
female-dominated professions and prevent any potential negative consequences of gender
inequality due to lack of male contributors in the field. By contrast to the extensive studies
conducted on gender issues in male-dominated professions, the literature on gender issues in
female-dominated fields is rather sparse. According to Prevost (2011), the lack of diversity due to
shortage of male teachers in primary schools is having negative consequences on students and is
hindering the students to reach their full learning potentials. The lack of male teachers may also
contribute to problems with boys in school due to the absence of male models (Epstein, Elwood,
Hey, & Maw, 1998; Gannerud, 1999).

90

5.2.3. Geographical Distribution of Male and Female Professors

This study finds that, out of 362 citing authors, 49 male citing authors and 57 citing female authors
held professoriate positions in educational institutions. As expected, the majority of male and
female professors were in the United Kingdom. However, significant gender disparities were
found in some countries. In Australia, 11 professors were female, but only two were male. In
Canada, four professors were female, while no male professors were found in this country. The
situation is reversed in the United States, four professors were male, while no female professors
were found in this country. Furthermore, it is important to note that, in Africa, 12 professors were
male, but only three were female. By contrast, in Oceania, 12 professors were female, but only
two were male in this continent.

Studies consistently find that women were under-represented in academia. According to the 2012
Annual Statistics on Social Work Education in the United States (2012), the majority of the fulltime students in social work programs and 69.8 percent of full-time faculty members were female.
However, men held more academic positions in higher professor rank with tenure status and higher
publication rate than women (Petchers, 1996; Schiele & Francis, 1996). Particularly, in African
institutions, female academic staff were under-represented in all faculties and only held positions
in the junior ranks (Dorsey, 1989; Teferra & Altbach, 2004; Charlton, 2003). Despite the many
strategies and policies that have been proposed to address gender differences in the African
academy, there are still very few women professors (Rathgeber, 2003). According to Otunga and
Ojwang (2003), over 90 percent of the staff, 80 percent of the teachers and 75 percent of the
students in 400 public and private universities in Africa were men in 1999. Only 25 percent of the
academic staff in Mozambique in 2004; 16 percent in Tanzania in 2007; and 42 percent in South
Africa in 2006 were female (Tettey, 2009). Furthermore, studies find that women in Africa faced
difficulties in gaining and maintaining academic positions in an African university (Morley, 1999).
The findings in this study of having only three female professors in Africa concurrent with the
findings in the existing literature about this issue.

91

Considerable studies have documented the causes of gender imbalance in African institutions.
While “cultural, sociological, economical, psychological, historical, and political factors” fostered
gender imbalance (Teferra & Altbach, 2004), institutional culture in African universities also
played a major role in this issue (Barnes, 2007). Furthermore, the academic careers of females
were greatly impacted by their home and family responsibilities (Dorsey, 1989). Fapohunda (1983)
conducted a study at the University of Lagos in Africa to determine the causes of the differences
in male and female career ladders in academia. The study finds that 89 percent of differences could
be caused by lower qualifications and lower productivity of academic women and 11 percent was
attributable to discriminatory practices in a male dominated institution (Fapohunda, 1983).
Although the actual reasons for the gender imbalance were not within the scope of the investigation
in this study, it may be important for educational institutions and research funding agencies to
implement initiatives and strategies to rectify the issue and address these potential shortcomings
in the field of Records Management. More importantly, the reasons for the lack of female
professors in the United States and the lack of male professors in Canada may deserve attention in
future studies.

5.2.4. Geographical Distribution of Male and Female Managers

From the 1870s to the 1930s, it was widely believed that men have management talents that women
lacked, which was the belief that justify promoting men to the management positions
(Hildenbrand, 1999). Women have been stereotyped as lack of professionalism, leadership, or
technical skills (Hildenbrand, 1999), which may not necessary be true. Okello-Obura (2012) finds
that males dominated the management positions in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) sector
in Uganda with lack of skills in managing records and information. In addition, there is a lack of
qualified records managers employed by the SMEs (Okello-Obura, 2012). This phenomena also
appears in the female-intensive professions, such as teaching. Brand (1983) finds that the field of
teaching has been dominated by women since the late 19th century. However, they are being paid
a lower wage than men in the same position and being excluded from top management positions
(Brand, 1983).

This study finds that, out of 362 authors, only 25 female citing authors held management positions,
as opposed to 54 male citing authors. The majority of both male and female managers were located
in the United Kingdom. The number of female managers in other countries was negligible. It is
important to note that there was no female managers in Asia. More importantly, there was also no
female managers in Canada.

It is well established that despite women representing the majority of the workforce around the
world in various industries, they hold only a small proportion of management positions (Schein,
2001). “Women seldom reach senior organizational positions even in female dominated
occupations” (Cromie & Birley, 1992). Particularly, in Asia, Sato (1990) finds that women held
five percent of all management and professional positions in Japan. Similarly, only 8.9 percent of
managers were women in China (Hildebrandt & Liu, 1988). Cultural and historical background of
countries in Asia could play a role in creating barriers to women in management (Schein, Mueller,
Lituchy, & Liu, 1996). This may support the results found in this study that no female authors held
management positions in Asia.

Similarly, in Canada, the labour force participation rate for women has increased steadily over the
past decades (Norris & Wylie, 1995). However, women were still underrepresented in senior
management positions (Norris & Wylie, 1995). A recent study shows that gender inequality existed
in co-management boards across northern Canada between Aboriginal governments and federal,
territorial, and provincial governments (Natcher, 2012). The findings in this study of having no
female authors held management positions in Canada concurrent with the findings in the existing
literature in RMJ about this issue. Future studies may be needed to determine whether policies are
in place to promote gender equity in the field of Records Management. In addition, it may be
important to explore the characteristics associated with managerial success in the field.

5.2.5. Degree of Collaboration among the Citing Authors

The degree of research collaboration amongst the citing authors who published in RMJ was
analyzed in this study by examining the authorship, as well as spread and diffusion of knowledge
in RMJ. The analyses of collaboration are useful to evaluate the growth of the field. According to
93

Arora and Pawan (1995), an “increase in multiple authorship and collaboration between
researchers is an indication of growing professionalism in different fields.” Multiple authorship
can also indicate the development of a discipline and its tendency of inter-institutional and interdisciplinary study (Bandyopadhyay, 2001).

Multiple authorship and collaborative research efforts have become the pattern of academic
production in many disciplines, such as psychology (Over, 1982; Mendenhall & Higbee, 1982;
White, Dalgleish, & Arnold, 1982), astronomy (Meadows, 1974), physics (Vlachy, 1970),
sociology (Patel, 1973) and social sciences in general (Endersby, 1996; Fisher et al., 1998; De
Maio and Kushner, 1981; Hudson, 1996; Miller, Tien, and Peebler 1996a; Wildavsky, 1986).
Reasons for this trend include increase in size, expertise and complexity of research in many
disciplines (Price, 1963). Specialization, globalization, advanced communication technology,
growth of knowledge, competition for research funding, and intellectual property law development
have also contributed to this trend (Dreyfuss, 2000; Hara & Al, 2003; Russel, 2001; Gu, 2004).
The advanced development in information and communications technologies (ICT) has facilitated
the flow of information, knowledge and ideas around the world with very little spatial and temporal
constraints (Altbach, 2005). Furthermore, globalization and ICT have transformed scholarly
publishing to transnational in nature and promoted international collaboration among scholars in
many disciplines, such as physics, mathematics, medical and biomedical science, biotechnology
(Cunningham and Dillon, 1997; Newman, 2001b; Cronin, Shaw, & Barre, 2003; Glänzel and
Schubert, 2004; Wagner and Leydesdorff, 2006; Matthiessen, Schwarz, & Find, 2006). Price
(1963) predicted that one-author articles would be extinct by 1980.

Furthermore, studies find that researchers can receive significant benefits from research
collaboration. Collaboration allows researchers to share skills, knowledge and techniques, which
plays an important role in knowledge transferring (Kartz & Martin, 1997; Ocholla & Ocholla,
2007). Through the process of collaboration, researchers can connect to a wider network in the
scientific community, which can enhance the development of new ideas and insights (Sitienei &
Ocholla, 2010). Studies also find that collaboration may improve the quality of research by making
it more inclusive and more complete (Cook & Fonow, 1986; DuBois et al., 1985; Roberts, 1981;
Smith, 1974, 1977).
94

In this study, the vast majority of the citing articles in RMJ were single authored. Out of 502
articles, only 76 articles were co-authored. The level of cross-national collaborations remained
very low. The majority of the collaborations were conducted within Europe. It may be important
to note that there was no collaborations in Canada, the United States, nor in the Americas. Despite
the potential benefits of collaboration found in the existing studies, collaborative research output
is low in RMJ. However, there is a trend toward an increased number of same country
collaborations and total number of collaborations in research. In addition, preference for samegender collaborations amongst citing authors published in RMJ was found. The results of this
study were consistent with the existing empirical works regarding the trend toward an increased
multiple authorship and collaborative research efforts in academic production in other disciplines.
Nevertheless, this study did not support the proposition suggested by Price (1963) regarding the
extinction of single authorship. Single authorship in RMJ may continue to be the norm in the
foreseeable future.

This low level of research collaboration in RMJ may be caused by several factors, which may
include a lack of willingness to collaborate, poor networking, a lack of collaborative research
funding, and a lack of large scale research projects with complex issues. Glänzel and Schubert
(2005) find that co-authorship domesticity is influenced by country size and country remoteness
in terms of geographic, linguistic and political aspects. For example, it may be easier for a
researcher in the United Kingdom to find domestic collaboration partners than for researchers in
smaller countries (Glänzel and Schubert, 2005).
Although the degree of collaboration in RMJ was relatively low, there is no “good-bad” or “rightwrong” direction. The results indicate that the citing authors are highly independent. However,
with the potential benefits from collaboration, it may be important for the citing authors to increase
their effort toward collaboration. The findings of this study may also be relevant to policymakers
in the field of Records Management. McKemmish (2000) recognized the importance of research
collaboration in Records Management. She reviewed various collaborative research initiatives
carried out in Australia and outlined the importance of collaborative research in dealing with the
impact of changing technologies in Records Management (McKemmish, 2000). According to
95

McLeod (2008), “to succeed in the future records management practitioners and academics will
need to undertake research in collaboration with others—stakeholders at all levels, experts from
other disciplines such as business systems, IT design, human resources, social sciences etc.” (p.36).
Therefore, it may be important for institutions and research funding agencies to develop similar
initiatives to provide incentives to encourage and promote collaborations. More importantly, there
is an opportunity for Canada to play a leading role in promoting collaboration in Records
Management within the Americas.

According to Fonow (1991), more female scholars in the field could promote collaborative efforts.
They often seek collaboration within their disciplines and with other disciplines, as well as with
outside of the academy (Duelli-Klein, 1983; Oakley, 1981). Therefore, the degree of collaboration
could be improved when having a significant number of female scholars in the field.

5.2.6. Subject Dispersion
Robinson (1973) defines subject dispersion as “the degree to which scholars in an academic
discipline … borrow literature … from other disciplines” or “the extent to which articles on a given
subject actually occur in periodicals devoted to quite other subjects”.

According to Musib (1989), citation analysis is useful to perform subject dispersion analysis by
grouping the articles based on their subjects to determine and understand the characteristics of
literature of a discipline. Narin, Pinaski and Gee (1976) is one of the earliest research using citation
analysis to study the structure of biomedical literature. Subject dispersion studies can determine
the breadth of subject material used by authors and understand the overall structure and
development of the discipline (Musib, 1989). It can also identify the interrelationship of different
subjects used in the literature of a discipline and assess their importance for the overall
development of the discipline (Musib, 1989). The results of subject dispersion analysis can reveal
the degree to which the scholars in a discipline make use of materials from other disciplines, which
can then help determine the degree of inter- and multi-disciplinarity of the discipline (Taher, 1993).

96

Both Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification System (LC)
have been widely used as a standard to establish subject categories of articles in subject dispersion
analysis. These classification systems arrange subjects by disciplinary classes (Williamson, Han,
& Aguirre, 2009). Many subject dispersion studies have been conducted based on the Library of
Congress classification scheme (Popovich, 1978; Cline, 1982; Hubbard, 2014). However,
according to Prabha and Marsh (1997), researchers often choose DDC over LC for its simplicity.

Currently, there is very little study that offers quantitative knowledge and documents the degree
of subject dispersion in the field of Records Management. Therefore, subject dispersion analyses
were performed in this study to measure the extent to which the citing authors depended on other
disciplines or subjects in their research. The subjects of the cited works in each citing articles were
examined based on both LC and DDC classification schemes.

The results in this study show a low level of subject dispersion of citations in RMJ. However, there
is a trend toward a higher level of subject dispersion as the number of LC and DDC classes used
in the cited works were increasing over time. According to Cline (1982), a low level of subject
dispersion indicates that “the cited literature belonged to a well-defined field that drew little from
outside sources” (p.222). The results may also be in part due to the fact that Records Management
is a relatively young discipline that does not have its own class represented in the LC or DDC
system. The impact of globalization and advanced technologies may also contribute to the trend
as authors were required to draw knowledge and information from other disciplines, such as
Computer Science, in the course of their research.

In addition, this study finds that, compared to female citing authors, male citing authors appeared
to be more willing to seek support from material that was published outside of their discipline.
Therefore, it is most probable that the diversity of research topics may be enhanced and the needs
of changing environment may be met by having a significant number of male scholars in the field.
It may be important for educational institutions and professional organizations of Records
Management to develop initiatives and strategies to maintain gender balance and prevent the risk
of having shortage of male scholars in the field.
97

5.2.7. Citation Preference

The citation behaviour and preference of the citing authors was measured in this study. The study
finds that the citing authors mostly cited works that were published within the past 25 years
between 1989 and 2013. Furthermore, a trend toward increased number of sources cited by the
citing authors to support their research was found. However, the study concludes that there was no
significant differences in the average number of sources cited between male and female citing
authors.
According to Smart and Bayer (1986), “self-citations are bibliographic references by authors to
one or more of their previous publications” (p.299). Citation rates are often used to calculate
journal impact factors and assess personal impact of individual scholars, which can affect the
future academic career of the researchers (Aksnes, 2003). It is possible that the authors may cite
their own work in order to boost their citation counts (Snyder & Bonzi, 1998). Some suggest that
self-citations should be removed in citation analysis to avoid inflation in the assessments of the
impact and the quality of the research (Cheek, Garnham, & Quan, 2006). However, studies find
that criticisms dealing with self-citation may not be valid as there is no significant differences in
exposure between self-citations and citations to others (Bonzi & Snyder, 1990; Snyder & Bonzi,
1998).

In a case study including the fields of social science and humanities conducted by Snyder and
Bonzi (1998), the overall average self-citation rate was nine percent. Six percent in the social
science and three percent in the humanities (Snyder & Bonzi, 1998). By contrast, from a total of
502 citing articles, 75 (14.94 percent) citing articles had one or more self-citations in this study.
Out of 502 citing articles, 4,663 cited works were received, of these 228 were self-citations. Thus,
the self-citation share amounted to 4.89 percent of all cited works. This study did not exclude the
self-citations from the analyses as the rate of self-citation in RMJ was relatively low compared to
the findings of Snyder and Bonzi (1998). This low self-citation rate indicates the willingness of
the citing authors in RMJ to seek out and search for new information, idea and knowledge from
outside sources and scholars. Hyland (2003) finds that authors may cite their own work to increase
the visibility of their previous works, to help reinforce their arguments, and to create an image of
98

scientific authority. Therefore, the results of this study may also indicate that the influence or bias
of the citing authors themselves in their studies was quite low. Furthermore, this result may mean
that the majority of the citing authors had no relevant former works within the area of their current
research, or that the citing authors did not continue research in a particular area, or that the article
did not have any relevance in the further research activities of the citing authors (Aksnes, 2003).
Moreover, studies conclude that there is a correlation between number of self-citation and number
of authors (Bonzi & Snyder, 1990; Snyder & Bonzi, 1998). Aksnes (2003) finds that single-author
papers on average received 1.5 self-citation and articles with ten authors received 6.7. While the
vast majority of articles were written by a single author in RMJ, the relatively low self-citation
rate found in this study was consistent with the findings in the existing studies.

Furthermore, according to Aksnes (2003), there is a correlation between the total number of
citations and the number of authors. In other words, the total number of citations increases with
the number of authors. However, the findings of this study were not concurrent with the findings
in Aksnes (2003). From the correlation coefficient value (r = -0.000227026) calculated in the
correlation analysis, the number of authors in an article and the total number of citations in an
article were not correlated.

Overall, male citing authors cited ten sources on average and female citing authors cited 13 sources
on average. However, the majority of citing articles had no references (226 citing articles, 45.02
percent of 502 citing articles). The results further show a trend toward a decreased number of citing
articles cited five or fewer sources. By contrast, the number of citing articles cited 15 or more
sources appeared to be growing over time. The results may be due to the fact that the field of
Records Management was a relatively young discipline, which resulted in publishing many stateof-the-art research papers by the citing authors during the early period. As the field became mature,
more empirical research of the field was available to the researchers. Consequently, the number of
sources cited by citing authors increased over time. According to Davarpanah and Aslekia (2008),
“the references in research papers provide empirical data on knowledge flows with and between
scientific disciplines” (p.34). The works cited also provide support to the study. Therefore, it is
beneficial to the records management researchers to actively seek out support from empirical
studies.
99

In addition, this study finds that female citing authors generally relied on periodicals, books and
government documents to support their research to a greater extent than male citing authors. The
results were consistent with the findings that female citing authors cited more sources on average
(13 sources) than male citing authors (10 sources). However, the situations are different depending
on the geographic location. In Africa, male citing authors cited more periodicals, books and
government documents than female citing authors. By contrast, the situations in Asia, Europe and
Oceania were reversed. Female citing authors cited more periodicals, books and government
documents than male citing authors in these continents. In Americas, female citing authors cited
more periodicals, but fewer books and government documents than male citing authors. In
addition, fluctuations were found in this study with deep rise and falls in number of different
sources cited by male and female citing authors. Although the actual reasons for the differences in
citation behaviour between male and female citing authors in different regions were not within the
scope of the investigation in this study, these findings could serve as an important reference to
records management researchers for selecting which type of material to read, review and write.

Furthermore, studies find that visibility and accessibility of literature is a major pre-condition for
researchers to decide whether the source will be consulted in their research project (Gami & Al,
2004; Garfield, 1998). The electronic publishing of academic journals and books has greatly
improved the visibility, accessibility and availability of research resources to the researchers
around the world. This study reveals that periodicals and books were the dominant sources of
support material used by the citing authors. Particularly, periodicals were the dominant source
across all continents, except in Asia. This appeared to be a common practice in academic research
in many disciplines, which may be due to the fact that periodicals contain the most current
empirical data and findings that are easily and cheaply accessible to researchers in most regions
worldwide (Peritz & Bar-Ilan, 2002; Schubert, 2004; Onyancha, Mokwatlo, & Saurombe, 2013).
However, more books were used in Asia than periodicals. This result may be caused by a lack of
access to online publishers’ database for periodicals due to high cost of subscription. In fact, many
developing countries were unable to afford the high subscription prices of academic journals
(Kirsop, Arunachalam, & Chan, 2007). Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that government
documents and reports were also consulted frequently by the citing authors around the world. This
100

study find that the top three most cited works were government policy documents. The worldwide
movement of electronic government of making government information available and accessible
online may have contributed to this result (Layne & Lee, 2001).

Researchers of a discipline often influence the direction of research in that field. According to
Thomson Reuters (2013), a “citation is a direct measure of influence on the literature of a subject,
and it is also a strong indicator of scientific contribution, since it is derived from a pattern of
interaction among millions of published articles.” In this study, analyses were carried out to
identify the most influential researchers of RMJ by assessing the citation rate of their works. The
study revealed that the most influential author was Professor Julie McLeod from the United
Kingdom. Furthermore, lists of most cited works (Table 20) and most cited authors (Table 21)
were created to provide additional information on the citation behaviour and preferences of the
citing authors. However, it is important to note that a low citation rate of a particular cited work
or cited author did not reveal any information on the quality or standing of the authors or their
works in the field.

This study also compiled a list of most cited journals (Table 19) to serve as an important reference
to researchers in selecting the journals to which to read for generating new research idea and
finding research support material, and to which to submit their research manuscripts.

5.3.

Conclusion

Because of the lack of existing studies about journals in the field of Records Management, this
study is needed to add to the body of knowledge. This study identified many characteristics of the
literature published in RMJ, which could serve as a reference in the future studies of the field.
Topics considered in this study include geographic concentration, gender balance, geographical
distribution of male and female professors and managers, degree of research collaboration, degree
of subject dispersion, and citation behaviour of the citing authors. Many of the results of this study
departed from other studies. For example, as opposed to being dominated by female scholars in
the related disciplines like Archives and Information Management, there was very little gender
disparity in the overall publication productivity of the citing authors. In addition, instead of rising
101

in research collaborations, single authorship was the norm in RMJ. The citing authors preferred
publishing on their own and less through collaboration.

Furthermore, this study finds that the citing authors were mainly concentrated in the United
Kingdom. This high level of geographic concentration of the citing authors may be due to
education opportunities and availability of research funding. In addition, gender imbalance was
found in different geographic locations regarding the number of male and female authors who held
professorate or management positions. Future research may be needed to explore the
characteristics associated with managerial success and investigate the reasons for gender
imbalance in certain countries. Particularly, it may be significant to determine the reasons behind
the fact that there is a lack of male professors in Canada and a lack of female professors in the
United States.

In addition, the citation preferences of the citing authors in RMJ measured in this study can help
records management researchers in selecting the type of material and journal to read, review and
write, and in deciding the journal to which to submit their research manuscripts. Moreover, a low
level of subject dispersion was found, which may cause concern about the ability of research
conducted in the field of Records Management to deal with the impact of globalization and
advanced technologies. More importantly, this study finds that maintaining gender balance in the
field of Records Management is particularly important to improve the degree of collaboration and
level of subject dispersion. While more female scholars in the field could promote collaborative
efforts, more male authors could enhance the diversity of research topics. By having significant
number of both male and female authors, the overall quality of research in the field would be
improved.

Chapter 6
Summary, Conclusion & Recommendations for Further Research
6.1.

Introduction

After discussing the research findings of this study in the previous chapter, this chapter provides a
summary of findings, conclusion and recommendations for future research.

6.2.

Summary of the Findings

A summary of the key findings is given below:


Overall, the amount of female citing authors was slightly higher than the amount of male
citing authors. A trend toward an increased representation of female citing authors was
found. However, the number of male citing authors was declining rapidly since 2011.



Significant gender disparities were found in some countries, such as Australia, Canada, the
United States, and in continents, like Africa and Oceania.



The majority of the citing authors were located in the United Kingdom. There is also a
trend toward an increased representation of citing authors in Europe and Oceania.



The results reveal little multiple authorship, which implies limited collaborative research
efforts amongst the citing authors who published in RMJ. There is preference for samegender collaborations. The results indicate a trend toward an increased same-gender
collaborations and cross-gender collaborations. There is also a trend toward an increased
number of same country collaborations and total number of collaborations in research
published in RMJ. However, the level of cross-national collaborations remained very low.



The level of subject dispersion is low.
103



The University of Northumbria produced the most articles in RMJ.



Professor Julie McLeod is the most productive author in RMJ and the most cited author.



Records Management Journal is the most cited journal in RMJ.



The most cited work is a government policy document, titled ISO 15489-1: Information
and Documentation - Records Management. Part 1: General.



The rate of self-citation was low.



There is a trend toward a decreased number of citing articles cited five or fewer sources,
while the number of citing articles cited 15 or more sources appeared to be growing over
time.



Generally, female citing authors relied on periodicals, books and government documents
to support their research to a greater extent than male citing authors.



Maintaining gender balance in the field of Records Management is particularly important
to improve the degree of collaboration and level of subject dispersion. While more female
scholars in the field could promote collaborative efforts, more male authors could
enhance the diversity of research topics. By having significant number of both male and
female authors, the overall quality of research in the field would be improved.

6.3.

Conclusion

Records Management scholarship provides a structural framework for Records Management as a
discipline, which in turn influences Records Management practice. It provides knowledge that is
needed in a wide variety of settings by all Records Management practitioners and academics
working in the field. This bibliometric study may be considered as a vehicle through which

104

scholars and practitioners may attain increased understanding about problems and phenomena in
the field.

This study created a profile of the quantitative characteristics of the citing articles published in
RMJ from 1989 to 2013. Answers were provided for all research questions. Trends and patterns
of authorship have been established. The most active authors and institutions involved in the
knowledge contribution to RMJ were identified. The most influential literature or document was
recognized. Particular issues discussed in detail included geographic concentration, gender
balance, geographical distribution of male and female professors and managers, degree of research
collaboration, degree of subject dispersion, and citation behaviour of the citing authors. The
findings of this study will open up new avenues for the generation of new research topics in regard
to the evolution of Records Management as a discipline and as a practice.

6.4.

Recommendations for Future Research

This study proposes the following future empirical research:


Future bibliometric studies of other journals in Records Management to determine whether
the characteristics identified in this study are similar.



Future bibliometric studies of journals of other related disciplines, such as Archives and
Information Management, to determine whether the characteristics identified in this study
are unique to Records Management or similar to its related disciplines.



Future studies to determine whether gender inequities exist in the field of Records
Management with regard to remuneration, rank, and promotion.



Future studies to determine whether there is any relationship between academic ranking of
the universities and publication productivity of the authors in Records Management.

105



Future studies to identify the fundamental characteristics of Records Management that led
to high level of geographic concentration in the United Kingdom.



Future studies to investigate policies needed to promote gender equity in the field of
Records Management.



Future studies to identify the characteristics associated with managerial success in the field
of Records Management.



Future studies to investigate the reasons for the lack of male professors in Canada and the
lack of female professors in the United States in the field of Records Management.
