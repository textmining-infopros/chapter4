ABSTRACT
THE IMPACT OF CULTURE AND RELIGION ON THE
PERCANEPTION OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION BETWEEN OLDER
AND YOUNGER GENERATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND STATE
OF KUWAIT: AN INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE STUDY
by
Dalal Albudaiwi

The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2014
Under the Supervision of Professor Johannes Britz

Freedom of expression as a right has been protected by many
nations’ constitutions and human rights organizations. Freedom of
expression has a long history in both the Western and Islamic worlds.
Each viewed, defined, and analyzed the term differently based on their
values and principles. Unsurprisingly, the Western and Islamic worlds do
not completely agree on the meaning of freedom of expression, though
they do share an agreement on certain aspects of freedom of expression. In
particular, freedom of expression is to speak, write, act, and believe freely
without causing harm to the society or any individual. The disagreement

ii

is on the limitations of freedom of expression. Further, it is central to
mention that the existence of the Internet has impacted how people
perceive freedom of expression in both worlds.
On the other hand, as a basic human right, freedom of expression
has been examined, analyzed, and compared substantially by legal
experts. More importantly, several studies within the legal arena have
compared the notion of freedom of expression among countries’
legislations. Therefore, freedom of expression has been studied solidly
through the legal lens. However, social science scholars started to study
freedom of expression when the Internet appeared. There are not any
comparative studies in any social science field that examine freedom of
expression among countries. More significantly, no studies relating
between individuals’ cultural background and/or religious beliefs and
how these individuals shape their perception of freedom of expression
exist. For that reason, I plan to examine how culture and religion may
impact how older and younger generations perceive the notion of freedom
of expression in the digital-technology era. My study will compare South
Africa as a Western-based values country and Kuwait as an Islamic
country. To better understand the influence of culture and religion on

iii

people’s perception of freedom of expression, I intend to describe the
culture and the religion of both countries. Additionally, my research will
compare legislations concerning freedom of expression and its limitations
in each country and examine the views and perceptions of people.
In order to examine the complexity of the topic of freedom of
expression, I will conduct an international and comparative study through
the mixed-methods research approach. Drawing from social science and
information studies perspectives, I hope this study will lead to
understanding

of

culture

and

religion’s

influence

on

people’s

conceptualization of the notion of freedom of expression in digitaltechnology era, and hopefully reach valuable results that help legal
experts better understand freedom of expression and its limitations.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I would like to thank everyone helped through this journey,
including, teachers, family, and friends. I’m very grateful for all the help I
got; instructions, supportive words and advice.
I am heartily grateful to my family it would not have been possible
to write this doctoral thesis without the help and support of the kind
parents and family around me, to only some of whom it is possible to give
particular mention here. My dreaming of pursuing Ph.D. wouldn’t be
possible to have come true without my parents’ encouragement and
support. I’m very blessed having my lovely family around me all the time
and in spite of the distance, they never let me need anything. It wasn’t
only financial support that they have sent me, it was also love and care to
give me the power to make this dream to come true for me and for my
whole family.

xvi

I would also like to thank my teachers Professor Johannes Britz,
Professor Mike Allen, Tomas Lipinski Professor Wolfram Dietmar, and
Taghreed AlQudsi for their encouragement, guidance, and support from
the initial stages to the final product. They not only enabled me to develop
an understanding of the subject but also provide a foundation for others.
I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my committee chair
Professor Johannes Britz; I appreciate the unique support I got from my
advisor. Professor Britz supported me in all levels; studying, living in the
States, and at a social level as well. He was my advisor, mentor, and friend
at the same time. I never failed to find support from him, and for that I am
forever grateful. No matter how progress I make in my research,
Professor. Britz always welcome me with a shiny smile. And whenever I
discussed with Professor Britz any difficulties, he always repeat “but I’m
sure you can make it, strong-head woman.” His thoughtful advice is
always in my mind; whenever I feel I can’t do certain things, I remember
his words about nothing difficult on you. After each meeting with
Professor Britz, I felt that studying for my Ph.D. was as easy as “drinking
a glass of water.”

xvii

Professor Mike Allen, my co-advisor, mentor, and second father for
me – thank you. Professor Allen has always encouraged me, and
appreciated my work. I’ve always liked to meet him when I have lack of
confidence of my work or even myself. Professor Allen’s words always
motivated me to appreciate my work and study. Professor Allen’s fatherly
advice about studying and life in general are really unforgettable.
Professor Allen always told me “no to make things hard on myself” and to
take care of my health before even taking care of my studying life. I still
remember the first course I tool with Professor Allen, it was “Statistics in
Communication,” and of course I panicked when I saw all tables and
numbers in SPSS, but Professor Allen assured to me that panic would not
last long. Later, I easily learned SPSS and decided to choose
“Communication” as my minor. I really enjoyed all communication
classes with Professor Allen, and the experience I gained through
independent study with him is priceless.
Talking about Professor Tomas Lipinski, or if I may call him my exadvisor, would want me to talk about everything unique in life. I’ve
learned from Professor Lipinski things that I’ve always wanted to learn,
things that I thought that it is impossible for me a non-legal person to

xviii

learn but the help and guidance of Professor Lipinski, I became able to
read and understand laws and regulations. I even became able to discuss
legal cases and Articles of Constitutions. The Journey of laws started from
day one in school, when I took a “legal issues” course. I still don’t know
how my confused and scared feelings toward legislations turned to more
calm and confident feelings. After taking this course and independent
study with Professor Lipinski, I became very confident when discussing
legislations within my field.
Professor Dietmar Wolfram was the director of School of
Information Studies (SOIS) when I first join the school 2009, and was the
first teacher I contacted when I was admitted into SOIS. Professor
Wolfram helped me even before being in Milwaukee, answering my
emails and questions about the mysterious life of study that was awaiting
me. When I came to Milwaukee, Professor Wolfram supported me and
explained everything about SOIS, especially that I missed the school
orientation. I still remember how supportive and cooperative he was. I
appreciate all his efforts to encourage me and follow up with me on my
studying status.

xix

My fifth and last committee member is Professor Taghreed
Alqudsi-ghabra, whom I’m very grateful to for encouraging me to pursue
both my Master and Ph.D. degrees. Professor Alqudsi-ghabra was my
manager when I started working in Kuwait University as a coordinator. I
learned a lot of administrative issues from Professor Alqudsi-ghabra and
then she encourage me to join the graduate school. Luckily, I learned from
Professor Alqudsi-ghabra as a manager and later as a teacher. The
experience

I

got

is

very

precious.

Professor

Alqudsi-ghabra’s

encouragement was continuous throughout this journey. Thank you from
the bottom of my heart for all your support.
I extend my deepest gratitude to Professor Charlene AlQallaf. She
is the only faculty member from Kuwait University, Department of
Library and Information Sciences, who continuously contacted me to
make sure everything was fine with me in my studying. I’m really lucky
to have someone kind and tender-hearted like Dr. Alqallaf taking care of
me, in spite of the distance.
Special thanks go to Professor Sultan Aldaihani, who kept
encouraging me throughout my long journey.

xx

Very special thanks also go to Dr. Mashael AlHajiri. I’m very lucky
I got to know Professor Alhajiri, because honestly without her efforts I
wouldn’t be able to read and understand the Kuwaiti Legislation System.
Professor Alhajiri’s suggestions were very thoughtful. More importantly,
Professor Alhajiri’s wise words were impactful at all levels; especially
studying, social life, and all are unforgettable.
Special thanks go to Dr. Mashael AlHajiri. I appreciate all these
people and how each contributed in many ways to make this book a
published reality.
Special thank goes to my benevolent friend Dr. Dola Alqady for
standing with me when I have been through very critical health condition.
Thank you for your emotional support and for your precious time. I
appreciate your kindness to me all the time.
Thank you Hamsa Badrah for the spectacular days we spent
together. I would like also to thank Maram and Amna Alhilal and Sara
Fairaq for being good friends to me during this journey, and will not
forget all the lovely days we spent together. I also appreciate Juman
Albukhari for standing with me especially in the final stage of writing my
dissertation, and really appreciate your social consultant about life in

xxi

general. I would like to acknowledge some friends whom I met lately and
for few days, but having extraordinary support from them; Sittah
Alshitwee, Amal Alghasani, Selima Chagra, and Amani Alzahrani.
My dissertation would not have been possible to be written
without the help of my dedicated editor, Melanie Mullen, who
accompanied me through the whole journey. Her priceless efforts have
helped me be more confident in writing English. Melanie was a teacher
more than an editor. I appreciate her help and encouragements.
Furthermore, I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my
lovely friend Bara Alomari for always being kind to me in the few days we spent
together. I would like to also mention the help of Zafer Lababidi in editing papers
especially during the first two years in Milwaukee. I appreciate his help and time.
In addition, thank you to Dr. Jihee Beak and Chunsheng Huang who
shared this journey with me. When I first came to Milwaukee, I was lucky
meeting Dr. Beak and Dr. Chunsheng having me as a member of their
family rather than just a friend, and surrounding me with love and
affection.
I would like to express my sincerest thanks and appreciation to my
friends; Arwa Alwegayan, Dalal and Suhad Alobaid, Bashayer Alshatti,

xxii

Noura and my sister-in-law Badriy Alrushaid who kept taking care of me
and constantly contacted me in spite of the distance. Their continuous care
meant a lot. It helps to lessen the bitterness of homesickness I used to feel,
from time to time. Furthermore, I would like to thank my lovely friend
Dalia Hesnawi for sharing the parts of this journey. I appreciate her
kindness to me.
I’m also very grateful to my friends Judith Steininger and Cindy
Shaffer who were always there for me. I would like to thank them for their
generosity and for being supportive all the time.

I also would like to thank my relatives who keep asking about me
and always there for me, I highly appreciate their support. Special thanks
go for my friend Linda Barajas for her cooperation with me.

xxiii

Lastly, I offer my regards and blessings to all of those who
supported me in any respect during the completion of my dissertation.
There are many people who also deserve thanks for their assistance to me
throughout my journey. Some of these people do not even know how
much they helped me and my work. I could never express my gratitude to
each and every one of you, but I do appreciate all of your support. Thank
you to all. I appreciate all these people and how each contributed in many
ways to make this dissertation a published reality.

Chapter 1
Introduction

1.1 Background
Countries deal with freedom of expression differently in both legal
and social levels. Often times, a country has a legal foundation supporting
the right of freedom of expression but faces the problem of inappropriate
application of the legal regulations. As discussed by Wimmer (2006),
“Freedom of expression is guaranteed by international treaties, but
countries differ significantly in their view of the meaning of ‘freedom of
expression’ and how it should be protected” (p.202). The notion of
freedom of expression has become complicated in the Internet age. Before
the existence of the Internet, each nation set its own limitations to protect
freedom of expression (Wimmer, 2006). Hence, there is a subtle debate in
the literature about the impact of the Internet on reshaping the notion of

2

freedom of expression (Clarke 1999, Balkin 2004). However, the
ambiguous nature of the term freedom of expression leads to difficulty in
finding a concise definition that can be applied globally. The later resulted
in the difficulty of dealing with freedom of expression politically and
socially (Albudaiwi 2011, p. 3).

The vagueness of the definition of

freedom of expression does not deny the important role of freedom of
expression in enhancing democracy (Voorhoof and Cannie 2010, p.422).
More accurately, Voorhoof and Cannie (2010) claimed that “protecting
and effectively guaranteeing the right of freedom of expression and
information is crucial in order to develop the quality of democracy and, to
stimulate diversity and tolerance, to guarantee the respect for human
rights and ultimately to help to realize a more sustainable, and hence
better, world to live” (p.422). More importantly, freedom of expression is
crucial for knowledge acquisition. The later is specifically true in the
global society, where citizens “operate within the paradigm of the
economics of information” (Lor and Britz 2007, p. 390). Furthermore, Lor
and Britz (2007) have asserted that “the creation of knowledge (content) is
a unique feature of a knowledge society. As such, a knowledge society is
underpinned by well-developed information as well as physical

3

infrastructure allowing participation in the different socio-economic and
political activities” (p. 390). On the other hand, freedom of expression is
not only crucial but also a basic requirement for the knowledge based
society. As stated by Lor and Britz (2007), “the development of a
knowledgeable society requires freedom. It therefore requires a social
system that allows critical thinking, encourages access to the ideas of
others, and promotes freedom to communicate and participate in the
sharing of the global body of knowledge” (p. 395).
Building on what exists in previous studies; this is the case with
South Africa and Kuwait. Both are societies that deal with the information
revolution under the umbrella of certain rules and regulations. Each
country has a Constitution that guarantees freedom of expression and
each country has issued policies to control the access of information. On
the other hand, as widely discussed in the literature, Internet influences
social, cultural, and political aspects in nearly all countries (Belkin, 2004).
Therefore, I assumed that in the era of technology, the Internet plays role
in shaping people’s perception of freedom of expression in South Africa
and Kuwait, albeit

differently. More importantly, the literature

4

demonstrates that the younger generations are more liberal and tend to
refuse any control of the Internet (Albudaiwi, 2011). Unlike the younger
generation, older people tend to be more conservative and support
limiting the Internet.
It is not only the Islamic laws that make the reactions to the Internet
different but also the homogeneous or non-homogeneous nature of the
society. As literature proves, different attitudes toward the Internet exist
between generations (Thornburgh and Lin 2002, p.20-21). Further, the
literature discusses the role of the Internet in changing people’s perception
of the notion of freedom of expression. Balkin (2004) has a subtle debate
about the impact of the Internet on reshaping the notion of freedom of
expression, though their discussions have two different focuses. Balkin
(2004) argues that the Internet is the new technology that increases the
amount of freedom of expression and eases communication, access to
information, and participation in public and political spheres.

More

importantly, he indicates to the fact that the Internet created new pattern
of communication within the social sphere and changed the nature of the
public’s participation in political sphere of their countries. Consequently,

5

the Internet impacts the notion of freedom of expression (Balkin, 2004).
Balkin (2004) asserted that the Internet created new democratic culture
and intensely changed social values. He argued that the Internet gives the
chance for ordinary people, and not only the elite, to participate in the
political and social spheres. Thus, my study puts more weight on how
culture and religion impact the older and younger generation’s perception
of the notion of freedom of expression and its limitations differently.
This research attempts to examine the impact of religious values
and social norms on older and younger perceptions of freedom of
expression. To do so, this research employs a comparative methodology,
which predominantly draws upon two conceptually divergent systems;
the Republic of South Africa and the State of Kuwait. I intentionally
selected these two nations based on several reasons. The two mentioned
countries share four important similarities: both are democratic countries,
both have Constitutions that relatively that affirm freedom of expression,
both have some regulations to restrict freedom of expression, and both
South Africa (Mpedi and Darimont, 2007) and Kuwait (Aladwani, 2002)
are considered developing countries.

6

On the other hand, the two countries are different from each other
in terms of cultural milieu and religious status as Muslim and secular
nations. Kuwait is a Muslim country; Sharia (Islamic religious law)
influences its Constitution and continues to affect current legislation,
whereas South Africa is a multi-cultures country (Milazi, 2012). South
Africa is also considered to be a multi-religion country (Mestry 2006).
There are approximately nine religions; statistics show that most of the
South African population practices Christianity (Zegeye and Harris, 2002).
Accordingly, the research shows how these critical distinctions shape the
way the two countries conceptualize freedom of expression.
These two nations allow for an in-depth comparative study of the
application of freedom of expression; specifically, the research aims to
examine the impact of culture and religion on how the citizens of each
nation perceive the notion of freedom of expression that is already
protected in the legislations of both nations. Additionally, this study
investigates how religion and culture impact older and younger
generations’ perception of freedom of expression differently in each
country. Each age group compared to its counterpart in the other country.

7

Specifically, I argue that the public's perception of freedom of expression
and the social reaction to restrictions of freedom reflect a number of
issues: namely, culture and religion. Another assumption that was argued
in this dissertation is that the younger generation in both nations are
similar in being against the limitation(s) of freedom of expression,
whereas the older generation in both nations are similar in believing that
there must be more limitations on the freedom of expression, especially
when it comes to controlling the Internet.
To summarize, this dissertation investigates the differences and
similarities in Kuwait and South Africa in regards to the perception of
freedom of expression of younger and older generations from each nation
and how it is influenced by certain contexts (i.e. cultural, and religious).
The research also sheds light on the awareness of the public in regards to
the notion of freedom of expression and the policies and regulations of
freedom of expression. In particular, freedom of expression includes the
control of writing/publishing, access to information, and access to
information through new media - the Internet.

Another aspect to be

discussed through conducting the current comparative study is the

8

difference in the awareness of each nation’s citizens about the legislation
of freedom of expression in their country. Finally, this study investigates
freedom of expression legislation in both countries in order to have an indepth understanding of how each nation protects and controls freedom of
expression.
1.2 Research questions
The study seeks to scrutinize citizens’ perceptions about the
notion of freedom of expression; this research put into question the factors
that shape such perceptions. The study intends to investigate the impact
of culture and religion on how citizens of each nation perceive freedom of
expression by starting with providing a description of each nation’s
cultural and religious contexts. After that, I will gather data from the
citizens to discover how the aforementioned factors may impact their
perceptions about freedom of expression. Hence, I intend to design a
questionnaire to be distributed to South African and Kuwaiti citizens faceto-face and electronically, if needed.
Accordingly, gathering data through qualitative methods; open-ended

9

questions and focus-groups in addition to employing a quantitative
method; questionnaire, specifically close-ended questions the below
research questions will be answered.
Question 1: How do certain cultural values impact citizens’ perception of
freedom of expression between generations in both countries?
Question 2: How do religious views impact citizens’ perception of freedom
of expression between generations in both countries?
Question 3: How do younger and older generations perceive the legislation
that protects and controls freedom of expression?
Hypothesis 1: Based on the previous discussion, the first hypothesis
that will be tested in this research is that there is a positive relationship
between age and the perception of limitation of freedom of expression. I
assumed that, in both countries, the younger generation is against the
censorship of freedom of expression, while the older generation supports
the censorship of freedom of expression.
Hypothesis 2: The second hypothesis in this research is that there is a
positive relationship between the role of the Internet and the citizens’

10

perception of freedom of expression. I assume that in the Internet era, the
younger generation tends to call for more freedom of expression, while the
older generation asks for more limitations on freedom of expression.
Hypothesis 3: The last hypothesis to be tested in this research is that
the awareness and perception of freedom of expression by the younger and
older generations about the current legal framework that protects and
control freedom of expression is different. My assumption is that the
younger generations’ view of the legislations as very strict, whereas, the
older generations supports more restrictions on freedom of expression.
Together these research questions will allow for an in-depth
understanding of how culture and religion impact how younger and older
generations perceive the notion of freedom of expression in the digital
technology era. In particular, the above questions help in understanding
how culture and religion impact how younger and older generations
perceive the notion of freedom of expression in the digital technology era.
Furthermore, the study focuses on people’s awareness and perception of
the legislation that protects and controls freedom of expression. The
central theme of the first research question is to determine the manner in

11

which certain cultural values impact citizens’ perception of freedom of
expression between generations in South Africa and Kuwait. Literature
suggests analyzing cultural dimensions assists in explaining the reason of
why members of society perceive certain notions (Hofested, 1991). To this
end it is necessary to determine how culture impacts people’s perceptions
of the notion of freedom of expression.
The second research question focuses on the manner in which
people’s perception of the notion of freedom of expression might be
influenced by religious values. Literature discusses that there is a
relationship between religion and people’s actions and interpretations.
Further, religion helps to explain why people act a certain way and how
such actions can be explained (Finke and Adamczyk, 2008).

The third research question addresses legislation of freedom of
expression in both nations. The question is mainly to figure out how legal
systems in both countries deal with freedom of expression as a right.
The last research question focuses on the impact of the Internet on
how different are generations in both countries in terms of the perception
of freedom of expression. Literature discusses that in the age of the

12

Internet there are differences between older and younger generations in
terms of perceiving limitation of freedom of expression. Basically,
literature proves that the older generation supports more restrictions on
the freedom of expression (Thornburgh and Lin 2002, p.20-21).
Additionally, the literature indicates that the younger generation tends to
call for more freedom of expression, whereas the older generation is more
conservative and would appreciate having freedom of expression under
control (Albudaiwi, 2011).

1.3 Research Design and Methodology
A cross-national comparative study will be designed to address the
proposed research questions and associated hypotheses and to investigate
certain factors (i.e., cultural and religious) that influence the notion of
freedom of expression in South Africa and Kuwait and in order to
compare how citizens in both countries perceive the notion of freedom of
expression between generations. In particular, younger and older South
African participants will be compared to their peers in Kuwait

13

Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be employed to
systematically collect and analyze the data. The methodology of the
current research requires mixed-methods to gather relevant data from
specific documents and participants. Mixed methods, as explained by
Creswell (2002), is a procedure for collecting, analyzing, and “mixing”
both quantitative and qualitative methods in order to understand the
problem of the study more fully. It is beneficial to employ a combination
of quantitative and qualitative methods, because they complement each
other and allow for more complete analysis (Green et al. 1989, Tashakkori
& Teddlie, 1998).

Therefore, the rationale for mixed methods is

appropriate to capture the details of the case at hand.
By applying these methods, I will design a survey as a quantitative
method. As for the qualitative method, there will be open-ended questions
in the survey.

Furthermore, a focus-group will also be employed as

another qualitative method in the research. The sample of the current
study consists of 80 participants. The sample consists of 40 participants
from South Africa and 40 participants from Kuwait. In particular, the
participants from each country will be divided into 20 older participants

14

and 20 younger participants. The age range of the participants is 18-65
years old and they will be selected from different institutions and schools.
On the other hand, focus group participants will consist of 8-27
participants from each country. The participant groups include younger
and older participants. Though it is important to mention that some
groups will include only younger or older participants, the way of
dividing the participants will be depend on their availability. In other
words, I can interview different ages either in same focus group session or
separately, assuming that this will not affect the result of this study.
Lastly, South African participants will be interviewed through Skype and
for Kuwaiti participants it will be easier to ask participants answering the
questionnaire if they would participate in the focus group sessions.
The logic of case selection of these two countries is based on the
similarities and differences between them. As argued by de Vaus (2008),
in order to produce the most valuable comparative study the selection of
the units of comparison must be based on both similarities and differences
(p.250). The comparison will be based on established criteria with certain
parameters; in other words, I will identify relevant themes from the
results of the study and accordingly establish criteria with certain

15

parameters to assess the perceived perception of the notion of freedom of
expression in both nations and congruently draw a conclusion. In addition
to identifying themes, I will also refer to Ndwana’s (2008) criteria to build
the foundation of the current criterion and to further understand freedom
of expression legislation in each nation.
In brief, Ndwana (2008) compared the legislation of freedom of
expression between South Africa and Zimbabwe by looking into certain
aspects. Distinctively, Ndwana focused on freedom of expression
regulations and analyzed Court cases in order to understand how the
judiciary deals with the right of freedom of expression. Additionally,
Ndwana discussed and compared the notion of freedom of expression
with the two countries’ Constitutions to explore if the right is completely
protected and guaranteed. Accordingly, I will follow Ndwana’s criteria
but with some minor modifications. In other words, I will refer to
Ndwana’s criteria when comparing Constitutions, policies and human
rights conventions between South Africa and Kuwait as a part of the
qualitative method.
Based on the aforementioned issues, the nature of the current

16

research is both descriptive and exploratory. However, to compare the
notion of freedom of expression in South Africa and Kuwait, the current
research is based on a ‘deductive approach’ which works from the most
general to the most specific in regard to comparing freedom of expression.
Taken as whole, both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be
included in the study, specifically statistical testing, and content analysis.
The results will be analyzed, connected, and interpreted to better
understand the similarities and differences in South Africa and Kuwait
with regards to freedom of expression in terms of the cultural and
religious impacts on the citizens’ perception of the notion of freedom of
expression.
1.4 Significance of the study
This study may prove significant in contributing to the
underdeveloped area of research related to the freedom of expression
within the field of information policy.

An extensive literature review in

relevance databases; Proquest, Academic Search Complete (EBSCO),
ERIC, LexisNexis and Communication and Mass Media Complete,

17

showed that there is a lack of studies that have explored the impact of the
cultural and religious contexts on young and old citizens’ perceptions of
freedom of expression in the technology era. Further, the uniqueness of
my study lies in the fact that the study examines the impact of technology
on people’s perception of the notion of freedom of expression. More
significantly, the study focuses on how the Internet plays role in changing
people’s view of freedom of expression. Additionally, a review of the
literature found that most of the studies in existence discusses the notion
of freedom of expression primarily within the legal aspect. There is a lack
of emphasis in literature on people’s perception of the notion of freedom
of expression. Even more significant is that research focusing on the
factors that may impact how people perceive the notion of freedom of
expression does not currently exist.

Generally speaking, there is

inadequate literature that compares the notion of freedom of expression
between countries. Therefore, the main significance of this study lies in the
fact that there are inadequate comparative studies regarding the impact of
the culture and religion people’s perception of the notion of freedom of
expression in different countries.

18

Even though previous research has identified the value of freedom
of expression and different aspects of the notion of freedom of expression,
no studies have focused on combining cultural and religious aspects and
their relationships to people’s perceptions of legal articulation of the
notion of freedom of expression. Therefore, it is hoped that the research
discusses the topic of freedom of expression in a new and purposeful way.
Again, there have been few if any previous comparative studies of
the attitudes of freedom of expression in Muslim and Western-based
values countries. It is anticipated that the study will be useful for future
researchers, as well as for policy makers in the two countries. The
innovation of the research lies in the insightful and provocative
similarities and differences between South Africa and Kuwait in regard to
the concept of freedom of expression.
More importantly, it is noticeable that the issue of understanding
citizens’ perception of the notion of freedom of expression is one of the
most recent topics in Kuwait, where the vagueness of freedom of
expression’s legislation has reached its worst degree. Likewise, freedom of
expression in South Africa is one of the most important topics. Therefore,

19

there are a reasonable number of studies that describe the notion of
freedom of expression in South Africa, mainly focusing on legislation and
rules. Yet, in spite of the fact that there are a number of Muslims in South
Africa, there is a lack of research comparing South Africa to Muslim
countries.
To be more specific, studies by academic scholars comparing South
Africa and Kuwait do not exist. From here, the emphasis and the approach
of the current research would shed light on information policy
considerations that have been partially to wholly absent in the last few
decades in the Middle East and Africa. I expect that the research would
certainly contribute to the existing literature. The implications and the
insights derived from this comparative research have relevance for
societies with similar conditions in other regions of the world. This study
will provide deeper insight into the studied social phenomenon of
understanding the perception of freedom of expression by primarily
exploring the impact of the cultural and religious contexts on citizens’
views of the notion of freedom of expression.

20

1.5 Definition of Terms
Given that some definitions have different connotations in several
contexts, it is important to draw the boundaries of the selected terms for
the current study in order to avoid troublesome confusion.
1.5.1 Information rights:
Since the current study aims to discover people’s perceptions of
freedom of expression in a technological era, where the Internet became a
tool to access, use, and issue information, it is necessary to explain
information rights as unalienable right placed under the notion of
freedom of expression.
“Information rights” and “communication rights” are two terms often
used interchangeably with substantial sum of literature tying the concepts
together (Caidi, 2005). In a narrow sense, this study will stick to the term
“information right” which relates to
“the rights of individuals and communities to know about the collection,
use, or disclosure of personal information about them (what personal
information is collected about oneself, why it is collected, what is done
with it, and who gets access to it?). Furthermore, information rights
extend to various spheres of one's life including right of redress, freedom

21
of opinion and assembly, surveillance in the workplace, and so on”
(Caidi 2005, p.669).

However, “communication rights” is a new term that has arisen
with the information and communication technology (ICT) era.
Consequently, new Internet issues have emerged such as freedom of
speech, copyright, universal access, and privacy (Caidi, 2005).
1.5.2 Freedom of expression:
It

is

worthwhile

to

note

that

countries

differ

in

the

conceptualization of freedom of expression (Wimmer, 2006). In order to
maintain consistency with the current research, I chose to build the ideas
of my research based on the following definition. The definition used
throughout this paper for ‘freedom of expression’ is the right to freely
express your opinion through writing or speaking, and the right to freely
publish, seek, access, receive, and impart information and ideas through
traditional media or new technology within the limitations and
restrictions of ones’ country in order to protect the order of the society.
1.5.3 Censorship and Information control:
The phrase “information control” will be used in this study rather

22

than “censorship,” though the two terms have been used interchangeably
in the literature. In particular, “Information control” conveys a broader
connotation and ordinarily relates to policy matters concerning
information dissemination (Alqudsi-Alghabra 1995, p.58). Additionally,
information control “may be considered both a phenomenon and a tool
which controls the dissemination of information and maintaining control
over information itself which may relate to the development of the
political system of the nation” (Alqudsi-Alghabra 1995, p. 58).
1.5.4 Cultural context:
Culture is “a slippery and ubiquitous concept” (Birukou etal. 2009,
p. 2) that has been defined in a multiplicity of ways in the literature. Thus,
it is noticeable that social scientists attempt to define the concept of culture
accurately by connecting the meaning of it to their main topic. A variety of
definitions have been found in the literature which tend to focus on the
concept of culture as beliefs, behaviors values, norms, and habits that
grow in the society and interpreted and interacted by the members of the
society (Banks, Banks and McGee 1989, and Useem and Useem 1963).
Approaching the latter topic in different terms, the existing literature

23

stresses the fact that “the essence of a culture is not its artifacts, tools, or
other tangible cultural elements” (Banks, Banks and McGee 1989).
Alternatively, culture means how members of society share values and
behaviors and perceive and use them (Banks, Banks and McGee 1989,
Hofstede 1991 and Jones 2007). Likewise, Lederach (1995) defined culture
as “the shared knowledge and schemes created by a set of people for
perceiving, interpreting, expressing, and responding to the social realities
around them" ( p. 9).
Most of the definitions agree on the fact that culture consists of
something learned and shared by a group of people such as values,
behaviors, beliefs and norms. Another common articulation in the
literature is that culture is “a complex system” (Pheng and Yuquan 2002,
p.7).
In connection to the purpose of the current study, the need for a
strict definition of culture stems from the fact that this study seeks to
understand how culture may impact people's perceptions of the notion of
freedom of expression in two different countries and between generations.
Accordingly, to avoid any confusion, I find the most appropriate

24

functional definition for the current study is primarily similar to what
most of the literature as agreed upon. The following definition is therefore
accordingly inspired by the various definitions of culture of the existing
literature:
Culture is the shared values, norms, beliefs, behavior and
knowledge created by a group of people to perceive, interpret,
express, and respond to the social phenomena and realities around
them. Thus, analyzing values and behaviors in a cultural
dimension (i.e., dimensions proposed by Hofested) assists in
explaining the reason of why members of society perceive certain
notion (i.e., freedom of expression).

1.5.5 Religious context:
To avoid any parochialism, I will define the meaning of “religious
context” in relation to the purpose of the current study. However, it must
be acknowledged that scholars from various fields have defined “religion”
differently. First of all looking to the meaning of “religion” in the
literature, one can notice scholars agree on the fact that defining religion is

25

a difficult problem (Debbelaere, 2011). Secondly, in addition to the
difficulty of defining religion, Durkheim (1954) advised scholars to be
cautious when defining the term religion and not to proceed from their
“prejudices, passions, or habits” (p.24). Therefore, he emphasizes that
religion cannot be defined in a vacuum of the place where religion itself is
found. Thirdly, the absence of the definition of religion is common within
the legal community, for instance, international human rights conventions
and most national Constitutions. Most of the Constitutions include
Articles on freedom of religion without clear definition of the term
“religion” (Gunn, 2003). Thus, I will present, on the one hand, a general
definition of religion, and then I will explain the term itself in connection
to the purpose of this study.
The literature has presented multiple different definitions of
religion. Finke and Adamczyk (2008) addressed the issue of religion by
arguing that most religions believe in the power and authority of gods.
Additionally, in connection with the current study, Finke and Admaczyk
(2008) argued that there is a relationship between religions and people’s
actions and interpretations. As they stated, “we are suggesting that

26

religion helps to explain the ‘why.’ Why do people take certain actions
and how do they explain and interpret them” (Finke and Adamczyk 2008,
p.618).

At the same time, Finke and Adamczyk (2008) proposed that

religious context “includes both actions and belief” (p. 619).
Another view of religion is by Gunn (2003), who defines religion
differently, through a tri-faceted lens. He argued religion may be present
itself as belief, identity or a way of life. In addition to Gunn, Debbelaere
(2011) defines religion as “a system of beliefs and rituals relative to the
supernatural, which unite into a single moral community all those who
adhere to it” (p. 193).
After a partial review of the literature, I simply define the religious
context as rules, values, and beliefs of any religion which one may believe
in, follow, and practice. For instance Muslims follow values, morality,
norms, and rules that are derived from their holy book (Quran). In
particular, I define religion as a value system that controls individuals and
societies at micro-and macro levels to a different extent in each country. In
strongly theological-based countries, religion emerges in all aspects of life
(i.e. Islamic countries). Oppositely secular countries are ones in which

27

religion is considered as a personal matter and citizens have the freedom
to believe and practice any religion based on their personal decision.
1.5.6 Islamic law (Sharia):
As widely discussed in the literature, Sharia is the Islamic laws and
regulations that derived for Muslims which have been derived from
Islam's holy book ‘Quran’ and Sunna.
Sunna means “the words and practices of Prophet Mohammed,”
these laws followed and practiced by Muslims show the commitment to
Islam. Sharia is considered to be the main structure of Constitutional law
in many Islamic societies including Kuwait where Sharia is considered to
be a source, or a guide, for legislation (among other sources) (Kuwait
Constitution Article (2), 1963). However, the importance of defining the
term “Sharia” is that the current study will address a question about how
religion impacts Kuwaiti citizens’ perception of freedom of expression.
A close look at the definition of Sharia, Chatuvedi and Montoya
(2009) stated that Sharia is

a “set of Islamic laws that constitute the

Islamic holy laws and much more than a simple code book of the laws to

28

follow as conventional thought may dictate” (p.3). “Sharia” is Islamic law
that “governs the Muslim’s way of life in literally every detail, from
political government to the sale of real property, from hunting to the
etiquette of dining, from sexual relations to worship and prayer” (Foster
2010, p.7).
1.5.7 Political and legal context:
Similarly to the religious context, there is a need to explain the term
“Political and legal context.” When mentioning the term(s) throughout the
study, I distinctly indicate the scope of legal regulations and policies that
include Constitutions’ Articles as well as Human Rights committees and
conventions. It is important, though, to signify that in the current study,
political context denotes the type of political system such as democracy or
dictatorship.
1.5.8 Younger, middle age and older generations
In this dissertation, I indicated the three categories of age; younger
generation with ages ranging from 18 to 25, middle age group with ages
ranging from 26 to 55, and older generation with ages ranging from 56

29

and above.
1.6 Anticipated difficulties
A number of anticipated difficulties should be mentioned at the onset of
this research:
A. Terminology: the proposed study requires references to works in two
languages: Arabic and English. Translation of legal and informatics
(technology) terms might prove to be problematic on certain occasions,
namely with respect to theoretical presentation.
B. A major limitation of this study falls within the quantitative phase,
particularly explaining the connotation of terms used in the survey.
Given the lack of an equivalent term for freedom of expression in Arabic
language, there will be a need to accurately explain it for Arabic-speaking
participants.
C. Previous studies: studies in this discipline do not follow a clear
methodology with regard to the presentation of the problem of perceiving
the notion of freedom of expression by South African or Kuwaiti citizens.
Most work in this area of study follows a descriptive rather than practical

30

approach to the nature of the topic. In addition to the above issues, no
study comparing Islamic to non-Islamic countries within the field of
freedom of expression, specifically when it comes to rules and regulations
that control the information, currently exists.
D. Material-related difficulties: there are relative scarcity and insufficiency of
legal documents (i.e., freedom of expression in Kuwait). More
complicatedly, the ability to access a number of information policies to
support the study in Kuwait and South Africa is uncertain, especially
because both countries are developing countries, where it is hard to
separate policies out of the bureaucratic system.
1.7 Summary
In this chapter, I provided a brief introduction of the study. The
background of the study was first introduced, including two hypotheses.
After presenting the background, I stated the research problem, proposed
research questions, and associated research hypotheses. Furthermore, I
presented the research design, methods, and the processes of data
collection and data analysis. In the final section, I discussed the

31

significance of the study; I defined important terms, and mentioned the
expected obstacles associated with the research.
In order to narrow the broad conceptualization of freedom of
expression, this dissertation is structured as follows. In Chapter 2, I start
with describing the notion of freedom of expression generally. The aim is
to provide a description of the different aspects of freedom of expression
under study. This chapter also points out information regarding the
historical background of the two countries of the study; South Africa and
Kuwait. Also in Chapter 2, I review a variety of sources proposed to
explain different aspects of the notion of freedom of expression and the
relevant literature to the notion of freedom in the age of technology. The
aim is to set the background for the current study, which investigates the
impact of social norms and religion on the perception of freedom of
expression on South African and Kuwaiti participants to figure out the
differences and similarities. The study will also find if age of participants
would make a difference in regards to freedom of expression and its
restrictions. This chapter begins with a short history of the notion of
freedom of expression. Chapter 3 introduces the research methodology. It

32

presents the typology of the mixed methods and the strategy of the
comparison. This chapter describes the data collection and the analyses
process as well.
In Chapter 4, I present the legal framework of freedom of expression
in South Africa and Kuwait outline some of these related rules and
regulations. I also design criteria to be able to conduct the comparison.
The criterion looks at some freedom of expression rules, freedom of
expression in the Constitutions, and legal cases concerning freedom of
expression. I sketch some reasons for differences and similarities between
the two countries’ legalization of freedom of expression. In Chapter 5, I
report the results of the study by answering the questions of the study and
testing certain hypotheses. In Chapter 6, I present the main body of the
discussion in light of the findings of the comparison study. And finally, in
Chapter 7, I provide a summary of the study and discuss the significance
of the findings of the study and draw some conclusions.

33

Chapter 2
Literature Review

2.1 Introduction
There exists a large body of literature discussing both the growth of
freedom of expression as an international norm as a fundamental human
right. However, very little scholarly work examines and compares the
notions of freedom of expression as a human right, and few scholars in the
legal field have attempted to outline clear conceptualizations of such
rights. Unlike legal scholars, social science scholars have made little
attempts to compare the notion of freedom of expression among countries
and to study the topic holistically. There is not a significant number of
studies examining freedom of expression in a holistic view which relate
the notion with cultural and religious contexts. Hence, the latter topic is a
significant area for more in-depth analysis. In spite of the scarcity of the
scholarly literature that is directly germane to this research, the literature
includes studies by some prominent scholars from social science fields

34

and other fields that indicate to the concept of freedom of expression as a
human right.

Therefore, it would be reasonable to include the most

related literature to be able to fill in the gaps.
The following chapter provides an overview of the literature
relevant to the study. This chapter begins with the presentation of general
key concepts of freedom of expression, followed by a review of previous
literature on philosophical Western and Islamic views of the right of
freedom of expression. Next, I will address the legal aspect of the notion
of freedom of expression in both South Africa and Kuwait, including all
human rights issues and Articles of the Constitutions. Then, I will review
the impact of technology and the Internet on the accessibility and freedom
of information. Additionally, I will present a review of the status of
information and communications technology in South Africa and Kuwait.
In particular, I will focus on literature that argued older and younger
generation perceptions toward the notion of freedom of expression within
the Internet era. Finally, I will center the attention on the comparative
research on freedom of expression since it is the main focus of the current
study, aiming to draw the lines for the criterion that will measure and

35

compare freedom of expression in South Africa and Kuwait. And lastly, I
will present an assessment of the literature review chapter in a more
general way.
2.2 Freedom of Expression: Definition and Legislations
In order to make the core argument of the current paper, there will
be a need to define the major subject on which the argument will build on.
Looking to the enormous amount of literature that discusses present
freedom of expression, one can easily notice that the term is defined
differently depending on the aspect and/or approach (i.e., legal, political,
philosophical, cultural etc.). Accordingly, there is a fundamental problem
in the specification and justification of defining the scope of freedom of
expression (Fuchs 1976, p. 347). Observably, any argument of freedom of
expression would not be free from the scholars’ indication to the
complexity of defining the term. Most of them referred such density to the
possibility of classifying freedom of expression under different aspects
(i.e., legal or political).
A close examination of the literature shows that freedom of
expression has been commonly discussed as a right that needs to be

36

protected by legislation (Scanlon 1977, p. 84). Other definitions explain
freedom of expression as a political right in a democratic society, with
massive confusion of how to define the scope of the term (Moon 1985, p.
335). Similarly, Carmi (2008) linked freedom of expression and democracy
by arguing that the existence of freedom of expression may be considered
a prerequisite for democratic society (Carmi 2008, p.8). There is also an
emphasis in the literature about how close the concept “liberty” is to
freedom of expression (p.8). Furthermore, the values of freedom of
expression such as autonomy or self-determination are both dominate on
the liberal agenda (Peonidis 1998, p.1). Though some believe that
considered to be the basis of freedom of expression then the freedom’s
scope will be very broad “covering every action of the individual” (Moon
1985, p. 332). Some scholars deal simply with freedom of expression as a
right that is guaranteed by international treaties, whereas nations differ
significantly in their view of the meaning of freedom of expression and
how it should be protected (Wimmer 2006, p. 202).
Based on the literature, the majority of definitions focus on how
freedom assures individual self-fulfillment and guarantees liberty to

37

express or communicate beliefs and feelings (Fuchs 1976, p. 356). In
particular, two definitions seem to be sound in regards to the aim of the
current paper; the first definition is by Scanlon (1972) who stated that
“freedom of expression are the ‘protected acts’ that are not subject to the
restrictions that other acts are. This is true even if the acts cause harm that
would, under normal circumstances, provoke legal sanctions” (p. 204).
The other comprehensive definition is “freedom of expression is [an]
‘indispensable element’ of a democratic society. It enables individuals to
form and share opinions and thus enhances human dignity and
autonomy. There are, therefore, ‘close links’ between freedom of
expression and other Constitutional rights such as human dignity, privacy
and freedom” (O’Regan 2009, p.6). Therefore, there are many difficulties
scholars face in defining the scope of freedom of expression (Gibaly 1997,
p. 402). To avoid any ambiguity or difficulties while discussing freedom of
expression, one must do as Meiklejohn (1965) suggested; in each specific
case, researchers must keep clear what meaning he/she is using for their
argument (p. 9). For the current paper and the arguments within, I
generally define freedom of expression as the right to freely express your
opinion through writing or speaking, and the right to freely publish, seek,

38

access, receive, and impart information and ideas through traditional
media or new technology within the limitations and restrictions of one’s’
country in order to protect the order of the society.
On the other hand, at the heart of the debates around the
conceptual framework, is the notion of what constitutes freedom of
expression; hence a central theme that emerges in the discussion below is
the conceptual framework of freedom of expression and how freedom of
expression affects other issues related to citizens.
2.2.1 The importance of access to information
As argued by Martin and Feldman (1998), the importance of access
to information lies in giving a meaning to freedom of expression since
expressing an opinion needs the person to be duly informed. Similarly,
Emerson (1963) argued that accessing information assures individual selffulfillment and enables him/her to attain the truth to be participate in the
political arena effectively especially in decision-making through a process
of open discussion.
2.2.2 Appropriate environment for free access to information

39

Ackro-Cobbah (2009) discussed that in order to effectively apply the
right to access information there are social and infrastructural preconditions

that

are

essential

for

the

effective

and

successful

implementation of free access to information for the citizens. Preconditions as mentioned by Ackro-Cobbah are:


“Political stability in which rulers are confident that citizens’
participation in decision-making does not oppose them as the
governance of the country”



Independent judiciary system where justice and honest judges
applied



Communication infrastructure in term of developing persons’ skill
to communicate wisely



Library and information services also has an important role in
encouraging people to free access to information and enhance easy
access to information” (p.4)

2.2.3 The right of Freedom of Expression: Philosophical Western and
Islamic views
2.2.3.1 Western view of freedom of expression

40

The purpose of the current study is to look at the subject of freedom
of expression and freedom of expression refracted through the lens of
Muslim and Western non-Muslim societies within the cultural and
religious context. Therefore, it would be reasonable to include
philosophical perspectives and values of freedom of expression in order to
first comprehend and explore how certain factors may impact how public
and authority shape the perception of freedom of expression.
Besides, mentioning some values of freedom of expression will
help later in understanding the relation of personal values (i.e. cultural
and religious values) that may conceptualize the notion of freedom of
expression in each society. In particular, the only four values of freedom
of expression represented in this paper are discovery of truth, democracy,
individual autonomy and self-fulfillment. Those values are intentionally
selected for discussion with the assumption that there is a relationship
between those values and the values of the selected countries. In addition
to the selected values, I rely on a certain number of scholars and their
philosophical articulation about freedom of expression. I will also tackle
freedom of expression from the point of view of Islam, as one Muslim

41

country, Kuwait, will be studied in this paper. In general, I selected
specific philosophical approaches to serve the purpose of the study.
As commonly known, Western history is full of several
developments which are contributed to the concept of freedom of
expression; from the age of Renaissance with the emergence of many
philosophers (Albudaiwi 2011, p. 16). In light of that, recent Western
scholars’ views about freedom of expression will be represented under
this section, and those are: Thomas Scanlon and Richard Moon. In
addition, there will be a philosophical representation of the aspect of
freedom of expression by delving in the interpretation of Thomas
Emerson and John Stuart Mill.
To have a concrete idea about freedom of expression, it is fair to
start the argument of the Western view of freedom of expression by John
Stuart Mill’s work On Liberty. Mill’s 1859 work reveals several basic values
that he evoked to defend freedom of expression. The three main values of
freedom of expression are: truth, democracy, and individual autonomy
(Moon, 2000)

42

To summarize the major themes of Mill’s work, Mill has focused
on the term “liberalism” which allows all points of view from all citizens
regardless of right or wrong in order to guarantee the formation of a
coherent community (Moon 1985, p. 347). According to Moon (1985), Mill
fostered the idea of “freedom for truth” or “truth-base” argument. Putting
the latter in other words, Mill asserted that people must be allowed the
pursuit of the truth in all areas of life (Fuchs 1976, p. 351). Therefore, Mill
finds that freedom of expression advances the goal of truth (Moon, 2000).
Mill also focused on the value of democracy in terms of operating a
democratic government in which the government appreciates political
expression (Moon, 2000). Lastly, value freedom of expression as Mill
argued, and intensively connected to the current paper is the individual
autonomy in which he/she should have the freedom with limitation of
not harming others (Moon, 2000)
Scholars who argued that freedom of expression is necessary to
promote individual self-fulfillment variously expound a broader view of
freedom of expression. One such scholar is Thomas Emerson who related
freedom of expression with four aspects; two of which are closely linked

43

to the current paper.

Emerson’s values of freedom of expression as

mentioned by Fuchs (1976) are necessary to maintain society “1) as a
method of assuring individual self-fulfillment, 2) as a means of attaining
the truth, 3) as a method of securing participation by the members of the
society in social, including political, decision-making, and 4) as a means of
maintaining the balance between stability and change in the society” (p.
356).
More importantly, the Declaration of Human Rights Article (19)
1948 Article (19) states that
“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers”
2.2.3.2 Islamic view of freedom of expression
As indicated previously, it is necessary to mention the Islamic view
of freedom of expression in order to draw the relationship between
Islamic values of freedom to a Muslim nation such as Kuwait. In

44

discussing the notion of freedom of expression within the Islamic view,
one can notice the density and variety of the Islamic opinions. One
Muslim scholar, Maulana Wahiduddin (2002) believes that Islam was the
cause of a revolution in freedom of thought. A more rational argument
about freedom of expression in Islam is by recent Islamic philosopher
Mohammed Kamali (1997), who claims that Islam protects a number of
freedoms. Islam protects the personal freedom as an aspect of freedom of
expression. At the same time, Kamali (1997) warned that any personal
opinion must be regulated by the holy book Quran or sunna or will
otherwise be considered opinion arrived as a result of deep thought and
self-exertion by an individual (p. 62).

To avoid confusion, sunna is

defined as “whatever the Prophet made sunna, and the rightly-guided
Caliphs after him.” In other words, whatever Prophet Mohammed says or
does or whatever is done or said by the Muslim religious leader that come
after him (Caliph) is considered to be commands and instructions that
should be followed by sunna people (Haddad, 2002). Putting the latter
statement more clearly, Islam protects freedoms based on the Islamic laws
called “Sharia.” Sharia, as defined by Chatuvedi and Montoya (2009), is
the “Islamic laws that constitute the Islamic holy laws and much more

45

than a simple code book of laws to follow as conventional thought may
dictate” (p.3). On the other hand, Kamali (1997) emphasized the fact that
Muslims must speak and act as they personally believe, but in a way that
is beneficial to society and based on the value of Quran (p. 259). It is
outside the scope of this study to discuss the density of the freedom of
expression values discussed in Quran; however, it is fair enough to say
that the Quran protects freedoms within specified boundaries in order to
guarantee a balanced society (Kamali, 1997).
The previous argument about freedom of expression can be linked
to the main subject of the present paper: to conceptualize freedom of
expression within Muslim and non-Muslim societies.
In sum, in spite of the fact that the nuances of theories of freedom
of expression are varied, they all share the core values of freedom of
expression. In general, values are: discovery of truth, individual selfexpression, a well-functioning democracy, and a balance of social stability
and social change (Cohen 1996, p. 184).
2.3 Freedom of expression: South Africa and Kuwait

46

2.3.1 South Africa
2.3.1.1 Freedom of Expression in the South African Constitution and
Laws: Historical View
Given that the political and legal histories of South Africa have
impacted the notion of freedom of expression laws, it is reasonable to
generally present these two histories. However, the literature is rich in the
political and legal histories of South Africa in which the changing of the
political system and legislation have impacted the notion of freedom of
expression. Therefore, under this section I will describe the South African
political system. Additionally, I will present freedom of expression laws
and acts in South Africa and briefly discuss them in order to be able to
understand the progress and history of the law and under what
circumstances the law was issued. Moreover, it is necessary to indicate to
the history of the South African Constitution and how it treats freedoms,
mainly freedom of expression, as a right. More importantly, Internet
legislation and human rights organizations that protect freedom of
expression will also be presented below.
2.3.1.1.1 South African Constitutions

47

The 1993 Constitution included a Bill of Rights chapter but the 1996
Constitution, as stated by Ackro-Cobbah (2009), “provided the necessary
legislative opportunity for South Africans to have unhindered access to
information” (p. 8). Furthermore, the 1996 Constitution protects
democracy, its prelude “lays the foundations for a democratic and open
society in which government is based on the will of the people and every
citizen is equally protected by law” (South Africa, 1996a: 2). Therefore,
Ackro-Cobbah (2009) discussed that notion of democracy is central to the
Constitution a in two ways; informing the citizens of the governmental
activities so that they practice their democratic rights effectively, and
protects the right to access to information to all citizens to ensure the
public power fairly. Section 32 of the Constitution therefore, states
“everyone has the right of access to (a) any information held by the state,
and (b) any information that is held by another person and that is required
for all exercise or protection on any rights. According to Ackro-Cobbah
(2009) the previous Section of the Constitution “affirms the fundamental
right of access to information and seeks to promote a culture of
transparency and accountability on both the public and private sectors”
(p. 9)

48

The right to access to information was accepted in South Africa as a
prerequisite for a new era of democracy. The right has been accepted to
pursue basic values that related to implementing democracy such as:
openness, transparency and accountability (Ackro-Cobbah, 2008). Putting
the latter in other words, Ackro-Cobbah stated that “the recognition of the
right of access to information is a central pillar of South Africa’s
democracy” (p. 180). Likewise, Dimba and Calland (n.d) have argued that
the final South African Constitution includes a freedom of information
clause that not only guarantees access to information but also provides
limitations in regards to access to information and a person’s privacy.
2.3.1.1.2 South African new Constitution (1996) and the protection of the
Human Rights

Historically speaking, the drafting process for the South African
Constitution in 1996 is one of the most ample and democratic
Constitution-drafting exercises. The previous facet does not deny the fact
that there were some flaws, yet the Constitution fortified human rights as
a foundation stone of South African democracy (Sarkin, 1999).

49

As mentioned in the preceding section, the Constitution of 1996
was issued to enhance democratic values, fundamental human rights and
social justice that had been absent under the apartheid regime and
alternated with several injustices. That’s not all: the Constitution
enshrined extensive political, social, and economic rights in responding to
the injustices that invaded the apartheid era. In addition to increasing
large amount of rights in the Constitution, the Constitution contains an
enormous Bill of Rights. In this connection, the Constitution not only
imbeds Bill of Rights but also demonstrates the determination of the
separation of apartheid era, especially with the doctrine used to force the
court to activate and apply race-based legislation (Southall, 2000). Along
with the Constitution, the Bill of Rights can establish a subtle foundation
for the national unity and reconciliation, both of which were very essential
issues in the South African circumstances (Sarkin, 1999).

More importantly, the previous regime was characterized by
prevalent lack of transparency and accountability so the drafters of the
1996 Constitution uplifted the Constitutional status by elevating the right
to access to information (Peekhaus, 2011).

50

From this perspective, it can be argued that the progressive
Constitution has made very significant strides towards democracy since
1996. There have been vast amounts of literature that discuss several
features of the new Constitution. Unanimous agreement has been found
in the literature in regard to how the Constitution of 1996 provides the
basis for social justices and human rights (Goldston 1997; Sarkin 1998;
Sarkin 1999; and Lor and Van 2002). The Constitution also effectively
incorporates a Bill of Rights (Lor and Van, 2002). With this context,
Goldston (1997) has directly pointed out that “the 1996 Constitution
reaffirms the 1993 Constitution’s commitment to a justifiable Bill of Rights.
Section 7, the first provision in the Bill of Rights Chapter on Fundamental
Rights (Chapter 2), provides that: (1) This Bill of Rights is a cornerstone of
democracy in South Africa. It enshrines the rights of all people in our
country and affirms the democratic values of human dignity, equality and
freedom” (p. 4). More significantly, the integration of a Bill of Rights in the
Constitution emphasized essential issues about the protection of human
rights by parliament. In particular, the power of the parliament does not
allow the members of it to promulgate any legislation which conflicts with
any of the Constitution’s Articles that protect human rights (Lor and Van,

51

2002). Equally, another basic issue is that the Constitution has a
mandatory condition that forces the parliament to enable citizen’s
involvement and participation in the legislation process (Lyons and
Lyons, 1999).

Broadly speaking, it is tentatively discussed that in spite of the fact
that the new Constitution of 1996 protected basic human rights and social
justice for the citizens, there is still a long journey that the South African
government must go through in regards to educating the citizens of those
rights. The majority of citizens were excluded from participating in
parliament during the apartheid era, which led to lack of understanding
of the nature of such political process and hampered involvement by the
majority of the citizens in parliament (Lyons and Lyons, 1999). Against the
background of this continuum, it will be clear that the success of the new
Constitution and political process depend upon both; the government and
the citizens (Goldston, 1997).

The overwhelming government responsibility primarily lies not
only in the contentious willingness to respect the new rights (Goldston,

52

1997), but also in the emphasis of increasing the awareness among the
citizens of the new political process including new rights and parliament
(Goldston 1997; Lyons and Lyons 1999; and Sarkin 1999). In particular, in
order to ease the understanding of the raison d’être of the parliament
among the citizens, the government must focus on certain educational
activities (Lyons and Lyons, 1999). In other words, programs such as
human rights education are ultimately critical (Sarkin, 1999). By way of
illustration, examples of the programs as mentioned by Lyons and Lyons
(1999) are; “the holding of national youth parliaments, committee
meetings on the workings of parliament, the development and
implementation of communication and information strategies for MPs
support programs, and networking with private and public sectors about
parliament” (p.443).

Together, the South African government and the civil society will
be able to enhance the new Constitution and political process including
new human rights aspects by the continuous respect to all human rights
(Goldston 1997; and Sarkin 1999). Though governments’ responsibility to
support people’s awareness of the human rights is essential because “no

53

Bill of Rights can, on its own, guarantee respect for human
rights”(Goldston 1997, p. 12).

It is noteworthy to invite attention at last to the fact that the
centrality and commitment of human right and democracy in the
Constitution

is thus directly encapsulated in chapter nine of the

Constitution where there is a provision emphasizing six human rights
institutions “state institutions supporting Constitutional democracy.”
However, to avoid the possible vagueness of the meaning of the rights, the
court’s role is critical in terms of giving and assigning meaning to the
stated rights.

2.3.1.1.3 Legal system in South Africa

The South African legal system consists of a combination of legal
traditions. Wyngaard (2010) explained the reason of the mixed nature of
the system by positing that “this is because South Africa was colonized by
both the English and the Dutch. The civil legal tradition was
predominantly influenced by the Dutch whilst the common law tradition

54

enacted from the English” (p. 65). As explained by Wyngaard (2010) about
freedom of expression law in South Africa that

“Freedom of expression - clause 16 of the Bill of Rights within
South Africa Constitution protects freedom of expression with a contentbased restrictive approach. The second part of the clause provides for
certain internal content-related restrictions.
1. (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes
a) Freedom of the press and other media;
b) Freedom to receive or impart information or ideas;
c) Freedom of artistic creativity; and
d) Academic freedom and freedom of scientific research
(2) The right in subsection (1) does not extend to
a) Propaganda for war;
b) Incitement of imminent violence; or
c) Advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or
religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm” (p.66)

2.3.1.1.4 Political system: Apartheid regime
The hallmark of operations under the Apartheid regime is
characterized as ‘secrecy’ and as stated by Ackro-Cobbah (2009) “the
operations of government in those days was characterized by the
extensive use of repressive security, as well as, media censorship” (p. 5) an
example of the abnormal load of security legislation during Apartheid are:

55

The Suppression Communism Act 1950: banned any subversive
publications, the Internal Security Act 1982: includes security legalizations, mainly censoring newspaper and “provided a major assault on
the freedom of information under the Apartheid government “(AckroCobbah 2009, p.7) and the Publication Act 197: the act restricted some
undesirable publications, films, and newspaper that discuss Apartheid
regime.
After Apartheid period where whites prevented access to
information, information becomes crucial for the country and the
awareness of importance of information among South African people
increased. More importantly, the democratic parliament shaped the right
of access to information by enacting legislation in the new South African
Constitution (Dimba and Calland). As discussed by Dimba and Calland
that the new era in South Africa started in 1993 where the political system
became democratic and the Bill of Rights was added in the new
Constitution specifically to protect access to information to everyone. In
fairness, however, there was a constant development in the information
field in South Africa. That being said, the new era of 1994 also has

56

witnessed some major changes. For instance, free elections and the right
to access to information became independent and not under the right of
freedom of information and lastly the right to access to information was
expanded more than before (Dimba and Calland). One more crucial step
for progress during the 1994 era is that people in charge started to realize
that limitations on the right of access to information must be reasonable
and justifiable limitations, depending on the nature of the right. Further,
the extent between the limitation and its purpose must be clearly defined
(Dimba and Calland).
It is worth emphasizing on the constant progress in the information
field in South Africa to have comprehensive sight. However, the progress
was moving forward to the extent that a group of South Africans was able
to establish South Africa’s promotion of Access to Information Act of 2000
(PAIA) which is considered one of the most progressive legal actions.
(Arko-Cobbah, 2009). Generally speaking, main objectives and aims as
mentioned by Ackro-Cobbah (2009) are to create a framework and
legislations to allow citizens to access information. More significantly, as
stated by Dimba (2002), one of the objectives is “to give effective to the

57

Constitution all rights to access information as set out in Section 32 of the
Constitution” (p.9). On the other hand, an important objective of PAIA is
to set justifiable and reasonable limitations to regularize privacy and good
governance. Moreover, PAIA is responsible for educating people to fully
aware and understand the right to access to information (Ackro-Cobbah
2009). Unsurprisingly, PAIA faced several challenges within the
legislative and social arenas. First of all, the legislative challenges are
mainly due to the amount of secrecy in the Apartheid regime where the
government stroked to strictly protect the regime‘s secrets. Hence
numerous numbers of legislative acts appeared, such as the Protection of
Information Act, the National Archives of South Africa Act, Legal Deposit
Act, and the Protection Disclosure Act. (Ackro-Cobbah, 2009).
At a more social level, the PAIA faced the challenge of dealing
with free access to information as a major change process in which the
needs of managing it in social circumstance were considered a burden. In
particular, the level of public awareness of civil and human rights, levels
of information literacy, and the coherence of national political discourse
are all social challenges in the face of PAIA. . (Ackro-Cobbah, 2009)

58

2.3.1.1.5 Human Rights in South Africa
The history of human rights in South Africa shows that there is
reasonable amount of commitment to the international and local human
rights principles and organizations. Though, like many other countries,
Human rights in South Africa went through many processes due to
political circumstances. But where international human rights are
concerned, South Africa was not the first country to sign the convention of
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Instead, South Africa
abstained from the session of declaration (Claiming Human Rights).
In 1966, when many African states were still fighting for
independence, a provision of UDHR was established called International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to enhance the civil and
political rights protected in UDHR. As a result, African states were able to
sign the UDHR into force in March 1976 (Ndawana, 2008).
Generally speaking, South Africa has paid attention to human
rights with the new era of democracy. As Sarkin (1998) mentioned, the

59

South African Constitution was drafted based on the Bill of Rights and
there are a number of

non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that

enhance and protects human rights in different institutions in South
Africa.
On the other hand, the new Parliament enacted various legislation
items considered to be controversial from a human rights perspective.
Examples of such legislations are the Film and Publications Act74
(pornography), the Schools Act75 (education), and the Choice on
Termination of Pregnancy Act (abortion) (Sarkin, 1998).
Sarkin (1998) claimed that in several sections of the Constitution,
human rights protections are fragile. However, that does not mean, as
Sarkin (1998) said, the Constitution is empty of some commitment.
Alternatively as Sarkin (1998) posited that “the Constitution shows a
commitment to democracy and human rights by making provision for six
state institutions supporting Constitutional democracy. These six
institutions are: the Public Protector; the Human Rights Commission; the
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural,

60

Religious and Linguistic Communities; the Commission for Gender
Equality; the Auditor-General; and the Electoral Commission” (p.634).
In regard to the South African local human rights activities, two
main non-governmental organizations( NGOs) will be presented under
this section; the African Charter (Banjul) and the South African Human
Right Commission (SAHRC).
The

main

purpose

of

human

rights

non-governmental

organizations (NGOs) in South Africa is to protect civil rights to guarantee
the effectiveness of democracy’s functions in the country. In the matter of
freedom of expression, two of the common program Areas for Human
Rights NGOs are: Access to Justice and Freedom of Speech (A guide to
human rights NGOs in South Africa, 2007).
The next section presents two of the most effective human rights
organizations that play crucial roles in the human rights field in South
Africa, including the African Charter (Banjul) and the Human Right
Commission (SAHRC)

61

2.3.1.1.5.1 The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC)
It is not only the individual’s or the government’s responsibility to
recognize the importance of protecting and enhancing human rights;
Chapter Nine of the Constitution protects human rights by establishing
independent national institutions. Such institutions are to purify the South
African society from its unjust history and to guarantee the basic rights in
the Constitution to all in South Africa. Literally, the South African Human
Rights Commission (SAHRC) is the national institution, which gain its
supremacies from the Constitution other national legislation. In order to
fill the Constitutional sanctions, the SAHRC operates with a number of
institutions both nationally and abroad, such as the government, civil
society, and individuals (South African History Online).
The Human Rights Commission was a crucial decision step
towards the enhancement of human rights in South Africa (Sarkin 1998,
p.649). Particularly, the commission promotes human rights several ways.
As mentioned by Sarkin (1998), “ the major function of the Commission is
to promote human rights through a variety of methods: education and
raising community awareness; making recommendations to Parliament;

62

reviewing legislation; and, importantly, investigating alleged violations of
fundamental rights and assisting those affected to secure redress” (p.649).
2.3.1.1.5.2 The African Charter (The Banjul)
In June 1981 the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights
was established and became active in October 1986 (Berat, 1991). The
charter was adopted “as a regional treaty by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU)” (Berat 1991, p.478). The charter was considered to be an
international human rights tool established to protect the human rights
and basic freedoms of people living on the African region (Berat, 1991). In
the same aspect, Berat (1991) also stated “International human rights
norms are contained in many documents. In the African context, the most
relevant is the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights, popularly
known as the Banjul Charter (p.478). The Banjul Charter, as discussed by
Berat (1991), was entered into force only five years later in October 1986,
contrary to most expectations.
In general, human rights are internationally accepted, yet each
region has different issues related to human rights. Therefore, the African

63

Charter on Human and People’s Rights has created in line with the
African traditional norms and values (Ndwana, 2008).
Particularly, the African Charter put significant weight “on
peoples’ rights rather than individual rights” (Ndawana, 2008, p.104).
Moreover, the Charter was established to facilitate African governments
involved in the interpretation and application of different rights including
the right of freedom of expression for Africa individuals (Ndwana. 2008).
As stated in Article (9) of the Charter “every individual has the right not
only to receive information, but also to express himself and disseminate
his opinion.” To avoid the vagueness of this provision, the African
Commission on Human and People’s Rights decided to embrace the
international

standards

and

interpretations

of

the

International

Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression. Lastly, the Charter
has four main sections: to respect, to protect, to promote and to fulfill the
rights recognized. There are two categories in the charter: the African
Charter on Human and People’s Rights (Ndawana, 2008).
All in all, South Africa’s political condition was an obstacle that
paralyzed human rights from being easily enacted in the legal system and

64

in South African society. However, Human rights foundation nowadays
in South Africa is solid relatively to all political issues that the country has
been through starting from the apartheid period to the democracy
process. More importantly, freedom of expression is well protected and
identified in the South African Constitution in addition to human rights
organizations.
2.3.1.1.6 Legislations of the Internet in South Africa
Similar to Kuwait, South Africa drafted some Internet policies in
order to monitor some Internet activities such as pornography and other
sexual online tricks. As regional efforts to prevent cybercrime, an
organization was established in South Africa called the South African
Development Community (consisting of Malawi, Mozambique, South
Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). This organization drafted some
cybercrime laws for the African region. (OpenNetInitiative, 2007).
Likewise, regulations were planned to monitor obscenity and restrict
online content. As literally stated in the OpenNetInitiative that “in 2006,
the government of South Africa began prohibiting sites hosted in the
country from displaying X18 (explicitly sexual) and XXX content

65

(including child pornography and depictions of violent sexual acts); site
owners who refuse to comply are punishable under the Film and
Publications Act 1996” (OpenNetInitiative, 2007)
Generally speaking, South African legal authority has issued some
regulations to control accessing the Internet. In general, selling or
distributing certain categories of pornography neither is nor prohibited
(i.e., child pornography) while other categories of pornography is legal in
South Africa (Roux, 2010).
As discussed by Chetty and Basson (2006) that broadcasters, and
companies broadcasting or selling pornography are being socially
irresponsible in South Africa (p.4). Therefore, a number of South African
laws either refer to the exposure of children to pornography or are
applicable to the situation. For example, the South African Bill of Rights
includes a special section – Section 28 – dedicated to the rights of the child.
More importantly, in addition to the legalizations, schools in South Africa
are focusing on educational strategies to protect children by using
blocking and filtering software that only respond to keywords do have
limitations (Chetty and Basson 2006, p.55)

66

In sum, the fact that child pornography, in any form, is completely
prohibited from creation, production, possession and distribution in South
Africa seems to lessen parents’ concerns about children’s exposure to
pornographic materials.
2.3.1.1.6.1 Surveillance
The conduct of surveillance in South Africa is mainly to protect the
national security. However, surveillance has increased and the latter led to
the fact that South African government defined national security purposes
laxly. Moreover, a number of South African bloggers and journalists have
been arrested (OpenNet Initiative, n.d.)
2.3.1.2 Conclusion
The perpetual debate revolves around several aspects. The first
concerns the tension between democracy and quality. The concern
primarily relates to how South African society is trying to get over its
repression history, where the society is experiencing major social and
political changes (Southall, 2000). The last concern connects to the current
period where a lot of political concerns and responsibilities originate from

67

the fact that the South African society is going through historical
transition of inter-racial and inter-ethnic tensions (Zegeye and Harris,
2002). On the other hand, it is undeniable that the separation of apartheid
led to significant circumstances in South Africa in terms of making the
country a freer place and free of colonial-racial restrictions and
dictatorship (Southall, 147). Overall, after 300 hundred years of
oppression, South Africa currently is enjoying enormous advancements of
human rights, social justice and quality (Zegeye and Harris, 2002).

Given the support in the literature, it would therefore be safe to
claim that in spite of the fact that apartheid has negative influence on the
growth of democracy in South Africa, “April 1994 the South Africa
entered the period of momentous transition” (Dombroski 2006, p. 46).
Given that South Africa is a discriminatory and racist society, entering a
new liberal democratic system does not reduce social, economic and
political problems. Alternatively, the past of South African society helps
the interracial and interethnic to continue until today (Zegeye and Harris,
2002).

68

Looking at the above literature, one may notice that most of the
studies relate the political history of South Africa and the notion of
freedom of expression. Notably, many studies connected between the
notion of democracy and freedom of expression, especially that South
Africa’s political system was not a democracy for a very long time.
Though when trying to assess how freedom of expression was studied in
South Africa, I found that focusing on culture and religion as two factors
that may impact people’s perception of freedom of expression is absent
from the literature. Generally speaking, studies of freedom of expression
have taken place in the legal arena much more than in the social science
arena. Furthermore, there are no social science studies concerning how
people in South Africa perceive freedom of expression.

2.3.2 Kuwait

2.3.2.1 Freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution and Law:
Historical View
Given that a freedom of expression law is a sensitive topic that has
attention recently in Kuwait, it is hard to find studies about the changing

69

law of freedom of expression. Lack of sources is due to the sensitivity of
discussing such issues in a conservative society like Kuwait. Therefore, it
would be reasonable to find out what legal or any other related
commentaries have been written about the issues, in addition to Kuwaiti
Press Release news and journalism that present the freedom of expression
laws. The plan is to present freedom of expression laws in Kuwait and
briefly discuss them in order to be able to understand the progress and
history of the law and under what circumstances the law was issued;
including Internet policy. Further, it is necessary to indicate to the history
of Kuwaiti Constitution and how it treats freedoms, mainly freedom of
expression rights. More importantly, presenting information about Sharia
(Islamic laws) is important since it has been mentioned in the Kuwaiti
Constitution as a main resource of legislations in Kuwait. Moreover, the
status of human rights organizations that protect freedom of expression
will also be presented below.
A number of cases will also be presented in order to understand
how the judiciary system deals with freedom of expression cases, in

70

regard to cultural and religious values that may impact how Kuwaiti
citizens perceive the notion of freedom of expression.
This section presents the history of Kuwaiti freedom of expression laws:

2.3.2.1.1 History of Kuwaiti Constitution
In order to examine freedom of expression in Kuwait, it is
important to delve into the formation of the Constitution to have an initial
idea about it. In sum, the draft Constitution was approved on November
1, 1962 by the Amir, Sheikh Abdallah Al-Salem Al-Sabah (Khedr, 2010).
Like any other developed country, the Kuwaiti legal system is based on its
Constitution (Albaharna, p. 20).

The foundation of the Constitution is based on the principles of
democracy - on the sovereignty of the nation, freedom of the citizens and
on equality of all citizens in front of the law (Abdullah, 2006). On the other
hand, Sharia (Islamic laws) has had an undeniable impact on the
Constitution. This idea and Aseri’s idea (1990) that Article (2) of the

71

Kuwaiti Constitution ensures Sharia’s impact by announcing that the
official religion of the country is Islam (p. 229) will be discussed in detail
in the next section (along with a deeper discussion for Sharia itself).
Though Kuwait is like any other Islamic country when it comes to the
influences of Sharia on its Constitution - most of the provisions of their
Constitutions are actually influenced by Western models. At the same
time the provisions of their Constitutions fit within the teachings of the
Quran and the sunna (Kamali 1997, p. 260).

2.3.2.1.2 Definition of Sharia (Islamic laws)
Since the legal case discussed in the present study is about freedom
of expression in Kuwait as an Islamic country, where the Sharia (Islamic
laws) is just one resource for legislation among many other resources, an
understanding of Sharia is critical to an understanding of how freedom of
expression is interpreted in practice.

In spite of the disagreement among Islamic scholars upon a
definition of Sharia, Sharia is commonly defined as the Islamic laws
generated from the holy book, the “Quran” and the “sunna.” As stated by

72

Chatuvedi and Montoya (2009), “Islamic laws, which are more commonly
called ‘Sharia’ are the Islamic holy laws, and are much more than a simple
code book of laws to follow as conventional thought may dictate” (p. 3).
While sunna, as defined by an Islamic scholar Haddad (2002), is
“whatever the Prophet made sunna, and the rightly-guided Caliphs after
him.” In other words, whatever Prophet Mohammed says or does or
whatever is done or said by the Muslim religious leader that come after
him (Caliph) is considered to be commands and instructions that should
be followed by sunna people.

These broad definitions of Sharia further the complexity of the
context for freedom of expression. Therefore, Professor Mohammed
Almoqatei, a professor of law at Kuwaiti University believes that since its
emergence as a state; Kuwait has been governed by Islamic laws (1989,
p.140).

There is historical evidence for the impact of Islamic law (Sharia) on
the Kuwaiti Constitution. Kuwait’s attempts to introduce Islamic laws
goes back to the late 1930s, when Kuwaiti people submitted the following

73

document to their Amir asking him to establish a political system
according to Islamic principles. The document states:

“The basis upon which the people swore fealty to you from the
first day of your rule was their participation in the reign, through the
requirement that they be consulted according to the Islamic principle in
this matter, which was followed by Khalifs. However, because of
heedlessness on the both side this important basis was forgotten. For that
reason and because of these circumstances, loyal persons among your
people are motivated to advise you reform royal affairs by establishing a
Legislative Council formed from people to supervise the affairs of state,
and regulate its foundation. For this reason we delegate the conveyor of
this document to negotiate this matter with you” (AlMoqatei, 1989,
p.140).

Therefore, a professor of law at Kuwait University believes that in
order to avoid the density of Sharia, the second Article of the Kuwaiti
Constitution asserts that Sharia is a main resource of laws and this gives
the Kuwaiti legislators the trust of taking from Sharia whenever it is
possible (Aseri 1990, p. 229). Still, Aseri (1990) believes in the partial
influence of Sharia on the Kuwaiti Constitution. Similarly, all Islamic
nations’ Constitutions are influenced by Islamic Laws (Lal 1985, p. 1).
2.3.2.1.3 Kuwaiti Constitution and freedom of expression provisions

Since many statutes in the Constitution relate directly to the

74

freedom of expression they must also be examined. An investigation of
those Articles which address different Constitution al freedoms illustrates
that the vision of freedom of expression in Kuwait is only vaguely
defined. For example, Article (30) of the Constitution states “personal
liberty is guaranteed” while Article (37) clearly states that “freedom of the
press, printing and publishing shall be guaranteed in accordance with the
conditions and manner specific by law” (Kuwait Constitution, 1962). The
specific laws are those laws that are promulgated by the Kuwaiti
Parliament such as the Penal code and publications law.1
Scholars have addressed the chaos of the Kuwaiti Constitution by
focusing on three Articles of the Constitution: Article (2), Article (6) and
Article (36). As argued although Article (2) of the Constitution makes
Islam the religion of the country and Islamic laws as a source of
legislation, Article (6) states “the System of Government in Kuwait shall
be democratic, under which sovereignty resides in the people, the source
The “conditions and procedures specified by law are detailed in Kuwait's Printing and
Publications Law and Penal Code which include criminal punishments for a variety of vaguely
worded offenses, and provisions for prior censorship. For example, direct criticism of the Amir or
of relations with other states; material deemed offensive to religion; incitement to violence, hatred,
or dissent; or news that "affects the value of the national currency" are punishable by
imprisonment and/or fines. The provisions restricting expression in the Kuwaiti Penal Code
16/1960 are similar to those in the Printing and Publications Law but provide for harsher
Penalties.

75

of all powers. Sovereignty shall be exercised in the manner specified in
this Constitution” and indicates that the ruling regime in Kuwait is
democratic, meaning that the regime allows for the variation of opinions
even if they oppose Islam (Almullah, 2007). Also, Article (36) of the
Constitution guarantees the right to express opinion and the right of
publishing via speech, writing or in another form. Oppositely it has been
discussed by Almullah (2007) that the Constitution was drafted with
consideration of the variation of the members of the society, respecting the
inconsistency of the human intellect. He concluded:
“It is revealed that the Kuwaiti legislator relied in formulating
the Constitution on the natural human intellectual inconsistency
and variation between members of the nation. The Kuwaiti
legislator made such intellectual difference the first building
block in creating the law.”

Almullah’s conclusion indicates that the Kuwaiti Constitution
contains balanced laws which commensurate with the nature of Kuwaiti
society. Besides, he is advancing the image of Kuwaiti society as a
democratic one where all opinions are accepted. (2007)
2.3.2.1.4 Press and Publications law

76

Presenting a number of important legislation acts concerning
freedom of expression in Kuwait is very necessary to later compare
Kuwait’s freedom of expression laws with South Africa’s laws.
The law of 2006 was formed based on the Press and Publication law
of 1960. The press and publication laws were preceded by a number of
cases where the accusers violated either Islam or social norms of Kuwait
society. The continued violation of the 1960 laws was the impetus for
creating the new Press and Publication Law of 2006. The 1960 version of
the law was not enough of a deterrent for the citizenry and the authorities
found that the law was not strict enough. This led the Kuwaiti parliament
to improve the law in 2006 and to make it more rigid and strict (Personal
communication, Aljasem, April 22, 2011).
The law is as following:
“it is prohibited to publish what may touch God, the prophets, the
Companions of the Prophet, Prophet's Wives or Prophet’s Kinsfolk the
citizens, or the principles of the Islamic doctrine by slander, sarcasm,
and calumniation in writings, drawings, photos or any other way of
expression mentioned in the present law” (Kuwaiti Press and
Publication law, 2006).

One can easily notice that the language of Article (19) of the law is
vague and open to abuse (Human Right Watch Report, 2000). If there are

77

no definitions of certain terms, sarcasm, or slander for example, then how
can judges draw distinctions and consider certain things as sarcasm or
slander?
A number of questions may rise at this stage in regard to those
terms and expressions. The lack of accuracy in the language of the law
would mislead not only the judges but also the scholars, journalists and
the public. In addition to of the lack of accuracy, the religious spirit mixed
with the words of the law would lead to many questions such as; in what
way one may touch God and the Prophets and who is responsible for
drawing the distinctions of what might considered violence of the law.
In this context, multiple legal analyses revealed important evidence
that may count either for or against the law. One of legal analyses
involved the reason of replacing the press and publication law of 1960
with the newer law of (2006). This legal analysis was first carried out by
Altuwaijeri (2006). The other analysis was done by Dr. Alduhuferi, a
faculty member of law at Kuwait University.
In particular starting with the first analysis, Mr. Altuwaijeri sees
that regardless of the religious nature of the law, the law will certainly

78

prevent chaos in society. He believes that without such law there will be
absolute freedom in Kuwaiti society.

Mr. Altuwaijeri thought that

absolute freedom in Kuwait would not be a beneficial thing. Therefore, the
existence of some restrictions over such freedom in a manner that protects
the rights of others and protects public morals is essential (Altuwaijer
2006, p. 4).
Altuwaijeri (2006) thought that the new Law of Publications and
Publishing of (2006) replaced the repealed law of (1960) because of several
criticisms against the 1960 law. Some of these criticisms concern a number
of expressions which are “phrased broadly and hazily and giving a widescope of interpretation such as the following expressions: (Good Faith),
(Reasonable Reasons), (Confusing the Mind), and others.” Another criticism
was the exaggeration in Penalties for publishing violations by
imprisonment or fines (p. 2). Therefore, the authority found that such
amendments were insufficient to deal with the cons of the law itself and
this led to the promulgation of current law (Altuwaijer 2006, p.2).
Likewise, Dr. Fayeez Alduhuferi provides a legal analysis of the
law. He discussed the law on the legal basis but he also ascertained the

79

religious nature of the legal text. Further he justified the religious nature
of the text by the amount of respect and honor that Kuwaiti people have
for Islam in which no debate about Islam is acceptable in Kuwaiti society.
To avoid exaggeration, it is fair to say that only conservative debates are
allowed about Islam, any untraditional opinion would cross the red line
drawn by the authority (Alduhuferi 2007, p.2). Furthermore, the second
justification by Alduhuferi (2007) is that lawmakers intend to protect
Islam by having such law. He insisted that one of the noble purposes of
the law is to protect Islam in addition to the consistency of the provisions
of the Kuwaiti Constitution, which decided through Article (2) that the
state religion is Islam and the Islamic Sharia are a source of legislation
(p.84). Hence, Alduhuferi (2007) related the law and the Sharia by stating
that Sharia prevents any prejudice to the God or the Prophets and it is
very rational to create law based on the Sharia since Sharia is a source of
legalization in Kuwait (p.85).
On the other hand, as a legal scholar Alduhuferi criticized the law
by arguing that the law includes many expressions that are not
understandable even for the specialists in the legal field. Furthermore,

80

some expressions are ambiguous and have multi-meanings (p.81). Over
all, Alduhuferi supports his discussion by arguing that the lawmakers
want to prevent chaos in the society. Alduhuferi personally believes that
absolute freedom is absolute corruption for society. Accordingly freedom
must be balanced to protect the values and the security of societies (p.82).
2.3.2.2 Human rights in Kuwait
The Kuwaiti Constitution protects most of the human rights’
provisions Article (30), Article (35), Article (36) and Article (37). In order
to explore the Kuwaiti concept of freedom of expression it is necessary to
frame it within the broader context of the Constitution al provisions
addressing human rights.
Supportively, as discussed by Nadir (2001), the Kuwaiti
Constitution provides a framework for the protection of human rights in
Kuwait. By using the commitments of the Constitution , several laws
passed which guarantee the protection of human rights in various
domains including political, civil, Penal, economic, cultural, and social.
The Kuwaiti Constitution reiterates the principles agreed upon by the
international community (p. 267). More importantly, the discussion has

81

continued to include Kuwait’s strong commitment to particular human
rights conventions that are based on Islamic law. But the problem is that
citing “Islamic law” in the context of international treaties is difficult
because no one can be sure what those laws mean (Al-bab, 2009). Still, this
was not an obstacle that prevented Kuwait from agreeing to certain
Islamic human right conventions. Hence, Kuwait agreed to the "Cairo
Declaration on Human Rights in Islam2" issued in 1990 by foreign
ministers of Muslim countries. In relating the latter with the present case,
such commitment to the Islamic human right conventions may be
considered evidence of the tendency in Kuwait to commit to the
international human right provisions that work within the Islamic context
and that do not go against the notions of Islam (Arab human right index:
International conventions, 2010).
At an even more local level, Kuwait has two types of human rights
institutions,

a

parliamentary

committee

and

non-governmental

organizations (NGOs). A parliamentary committee called "Committee for
Kuwait has agreed to the "Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam" issued in 1990 by
foreign ministers of Muslim countries. The declaration is a guiding document that does not require
ratification. Kuwait also acceded to the "Arab Charter of Human Rights/Amended" prepared by
the Arab Summit in Tunisia in May 2004. Kuwait did not ratify the charter just like most Arab
countries.
2

82

the Protection of Human Rights" was formed on October 24, 1992. The
committee works on removing provisions that contradict human rights
from Kuwaiti legislation; monitors the performance of government
agencies in terms of their adherence to human rights principles; receives
complaints and comments on practices that violate human rights; and
forms fact-finding committees on issues within its jurisdiction. In the area
of NGOs, Kuwait witnessed the establishment of NGOs that defend
women's rights. (Arab human right index: International Conventions,
2010).
While the official written record indicates a high degree of
commitment to human rights within Kuwait, the interpretation of these
rights within practical life indicates a high degree of inconsistency and
paradox, particularly relative to freedom of expression (Arab human right
index: International Conventions, 2010).
2.3.2.3 Legislations of the Internet in Kuwait
Discussing Internet censorship as the legal reaction to the impact of
the Internet in Kuwait requires the examination of two legal aspects to
figure out the extent the restrictions on the Internet was a reasonable step

83

with visible results in society. In that view, surveillance and Kuwaiti
Internet policy are intentionally selected to be examined as the legal
reactions to the impact of internet.
2.3.2.3.1 Internet policy
On May 22nd, 2002 the Ministry of Communications (MOC) in
Kuwait issued the first Internet policy. More broadly, the MOC took
serious action to regulate the Internet. For instance, internet service
providers in Kuwait must install and operate censorship systems to block
certain websites such as the following; pornographic, anti-religion, antitradition, or anti-security. In addition to the censored websites, chat
services, email, and others must also be blocked. Moreover, MOC has the
authority to approve the effectiveness of the used censorship systems and
update them periodically (OpenNet Initiative, 2009)
In general, the policy is divided into two sections. The first one is
directed to Internet cafes and the second section is directed to the Internet
Service Providers. For the first section, there are nine regulations.
Examples of the regulations are; cabins (a small room-like box which
allows only the user to see the screen) are not allowed in the cafes, screens

84

must not be covered by any means (i.e., barriers). Screens must be located
in open areas where it can be easily monitored; there must be an Internet
filtering system to filter some sites that are related to sex, pornography,
anti-religion, anti-culture and social norms, and anti-national security;
users’ information such as names, telephone numbers, ID numbers,
addresses are required along with the time a user logs on and off the
Internet; and Internet service must be from MOC identified and legalized
Internet Service Providers. Section two includes regulations directed for
Internet Service Providers.
This section requires Internet cafes to obtain and maintain a legal
license issued by the MOC. The second regulation is about the monthly
financial reports that the Internet cafe must be submitted to the MOC
along with subscription receipts. This section also includes the
punishments for any violation of either section (punishments consist of
financial Penalties and fees) (Ministry of Communication, 2002).
2.3.2.3.2 Surveillance
The Kuwaiti government plays a role in Internet surveillance and
other similar monitoring efforts. Particularly, government’s role is to keep

85

an eye on Internet cafés. According to the OpenNet Initiative (2009),
maintaining a record of customers’ names and IDs is a basic requirement
for Internet café owners and upon request such information must be
submitted to the MOC. At the same time the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry required the MOC to order inspection of Internet chat rooms that
“promote immorality”. (OpenNet Initiative, 2009).
2.3.2.4 Conclusion
The above background about the Kuwaiti legal system shows that
there is literature presenting freedom of expression in the legal system,
yet, there are only few studies that follow the analytic or practical
approach in discovering the issue of freedom of expression in Kuwait. On
the other hand, similar to South Africa, there are no studies examining
how religion or culture influences people’s perception of freedom of
expression. Therefore, I tried to find the most related studies in which
freedom of expression was examined within any areas and approaches.
Lastly, freedom of expression in Kuwait has solidly studies through the
legal lenses.

86

2.4 The nature of South African and Kuwaiti societies
In order to understand the impact of the Internet in Kuwait and the
reactions of its social system, it would be reasonable to have a
comprehensive idea about the nature of Kuwaiti society. A brief overview
of the nature of Kuwaiti society must be made to ease the readers’
digestion of the nature of the Kuwaiti social system’s reaction to the
Internet.
2.4.1 The nature of South African society

The estimated population of South Africa in 2011 was 49,004,031.
The male population is 87% literate and 85.7 % of the female population is
literate (CIA-the world factbook, 2011). In terms of ethnic classifications,
the South African population consists of the following ethnic groups: the
Nguni people, which includes the Zulu, Xhosa and Swazi; the Sotho; the
Tsonga; the Venda; the Afrikaners; the English; the Coloreds; and the
Indians. In addition to the previous ethnic group, there are also
immigrants from Europe, Asia, Khoi, the San ethnic and other parts of
Africa as well (Zegeye and Harris, 2002).

87

There are approximately nine religions in South Africa, though
statistics show that most of the South African population follows Christian
faiths (Zegeye and Harris, 2002). Namely Zion Christian 11.1%,
Pentecostal/Charismatic 8.2%, Catholic 7.1%, Methodist 6.8%, Dutch
Reformed 6.7%, Anglican 3.8%, Muslim 1.5%, other Christian 36%, . There
are other three groups; other 2.3%, unspecified 1.4%, and people reporting
as not belonging to any religion 15.1% (CIA-the world factbook, 2011).
South Africa is classified as a middle-income country (Blignaut 2009,
p.582). More broadly, as mentioned by Fourie (2010), “South Africa is
characterized by its multiple dichotomies and paradoxes between rich and
poor, literate and illiterate, urbanized and rural. It is characterized by its
variety of cultures and languages along with its various racial and ethnic
groups” (p. 175). The political system in South Africa is characterized as a
representative democracy (Onumajuru and Chicgona 2010, p.137).

A number of scholars have classified South African society as “a
diverse society” (Zegeye and Harris 2002, p.240). South African society is
polarized and divided in which several injustices were widespread. For
more clarification, many citizens were marginalized based on their culture

88

or language. Others had been denied access to opportunities and
institutions. The majority of South African citizens suffered from severe
human rights violations (Sarkin, 1999). In particular, black people suffered
from social, economic, and political deprivations (Sarkin, 1999).

Before 1994 South Africa lived under the umbrella of the system of
‘Apartheid’ which set racial lines and severely divided society (Trusler
2003, p. 504). Such division in the society may be referred to what
Peekhaus (2011) explained about a number of oppression which
characterized the apartheid era, such as racial, ethnic, gender, and
religious repressions. Therefore, as a result of ‘Apartheid’ regime, South
Africa was considered a highly racist and discriminatory society (Zegeye
and Harris 2002, p. 242).

2.4.1.1 Access to information and cultural values
Within the realm of a burgeoning scholarly discussion of the values
and influences that impact the notion of freedom of expression among
citizens of any nation, there exists a superficial emphasis on the cultural
values. In this view, Darch and Underwood (2005) argued that in spite of

89

the fact the access to information look global, on closer investigation, local
and social values impact the notion of access to information. (p.78).
Similar to Darch and Underwood, Ackro-Cobbah (2009) have also argued
that there is a relation between access to information and the culture of
democracy in one society as he stated that “free access to information
needs to be part of the democratic culture of a country and this demands
an information-literate society’ (p.18). Though, there is only little
emphasis is placed on citizen’s education of their freedoms rights in the
South African society (Ackro-Cobbah, 2009)
All in all, Ackro-Cobbah (2009) concluded that South Africa been
through oppressive era during Apartheid regime where strict censorship
and control of the information. Later, the 1996 Constitution and PAIA act
challenged the oppression and considered as extension of the
democratization process, in spite of the all shortcomings. Additionally, he
indicated to importance of educating the civil society of their civil and
human rights to offer the most appropriate sphere for the implementation
of FOI (p.19).

2.4.2 The nature of Kuwaiti Society
It has been commonly discussed in the current literature that
Kuwaiti society shares the general Arab features (i.e. respect for Islam
conservativeness) (Ismael et al. as cited in Albudaiwi 2011, p.8). For more
clarification, conservativeness may be seen in how Kuwaiti people honor
their social norms in a way that make those norms seem to be more
valuable and precious than the Islamic ones (Ismael et al. as cited in
Albudaiwi 2011, p.8). Paradoxically, there is variance in Islam with what
exists in reality, behavior, practice, and rationale in Kuwaiti society
(Lienhardt 1993, p. 12). On the other hand, in spite of the conservative
nature of the Kuwaiti society, Kuwaiti people enjoy an ample amount of
freedom that is protected by the Kuwaiti Constitution such as political
and religious freedom, in addition to the freedom of belief, opinion, and
publication (Alrumaihi, 1994).
2.4.3 Conclusion
In conclusion, there are no studies in South Africa and Kuwait that
relate culture and religion to the notion of freedom of expression. Hence, I
presented above the nature of both societies in order to find the link in

91

literature between the power of culture and religion on the people’s
perception of freedom of expression.
2.5 The Impact of the Culture and Religion on Older and Younger
Generation’s Perception of Freedom of Expression in DigitalTechnology Era
2.5.1 The nature of the Internet and social networks
Social networks play a significant role in communication between
people as it gives people a chance to participate in the political and social
sphere. There are many sources in the literature that indicate the impact of
social networks on the concept of freedom of expression on both the
theoretical and practical levels. More specifically, with the emergence of
the Internet social networks arise as a tool for either personal
communication or for spreading political and social thoughts. As stated
by Anderson (2009), “Again, social networking exists to facilitate these
sorts of actions that are designed to help people stay connected” (p.15-16).
Generally speaking, most of the literature indicates to the fact that Internet
is a communication tools and social networks specifically ease personal
communications and increase people’s participation in the public domain.

92

As mentioned by Dutton (2007) about the importance of social networks
“the rise of online social networking applications such as Facebook, Flickr,
Friendster, MySpace, and YouTube are likely to reinforce the role of
Internet usage patterns on the development of social networks” (p.9). The
Internet is different from other communication mediums because it has a
unique and complex nature (White 2006, p.7). Mainly, the internet
involves number of communication and retrieval processes (White 2006,
p.13). Similarly, as Discussed by Dutton, Helsper and Gerber (2009) that
the Interne can be used for many purposes which make people use the
Internet differently. Consequently, the uniqueness of the internet lies in its
nature as a technology that combines a number of communication
methods. In particular, the internet is considered to be cyber-speech and it
differs from printed speech in two ways. The differences as stated by
White (2006) “include the ease with which it is accessed, as well as the
possible

multimedia

dimensions

beyond

those

of

traditional

communications medium” (p. 25). Furthermore, the nature of the internet
is very complex to the extent that some scholars described it as
“platypus”. This metaphorical description is to assert the difficulty in
classifying the internet (Jaffe as cited in White, 2006). In addition to

93

complexity, the Internet is not geographically located to any one spot.
Thus, both information providers and information consumers may be
physically located (White 2006, p. 26). On the other hand, Wheeler (2006)
treated the topic of the nature of the Internet differently. She gathered the
different assumptions of a number of scholars about the Internet and
discussed them. Most of the studies as discussed by Wheeler (2006) focus
on the role of the Internet as a technology that changes several aspects of
human life. Wheeler explained the Internet has this role is due to the open
nature of it (i.e., that it includes a number of communications methods) (p.
16). Additionally, The Internet is able to change everything in human life
because it is becoming an integral part of daily life (Wheeler 2006, p. 17).
Wheeler (2006) noticed many studies stressed the uniqueness of the
Internet by comparing it with “old media” such as the TV and newspaper.
Accordingly, she concluded that “the Internet is new media in that it is a
“many to many” form of broadcasting information and entertainment” (p.
19). Wheeler (2006) concluded that the Internet plays a vital role not only
easing life but also in shaping mankind’s future (p. 16).
The information revolution resulted in many changes throughout
the world. This is especially true when it comes to the one of the greatest

94

technological advancements of the 20th century specifically, the Internet
(Dashti and Alfadhali, 2011, p.47). Consequently, the proliferation of
different Internet activities such as social networking sites (i.e., Facebook
and Twitter) led to several changes in many aspects in both structured
and unstructured societies. Social networks “allow people to create a
public profile, share connections with other users, and view and traverse
their list of connections in a common network” (Boyd and Ellison, as cited
in Ulusu 2010, p.2949). Additionally, social networking sites have a type of
mediating effect between the individual and the society in the virtual
world (Wasser and Fuast, as cited in Ulusu 2010, p.2949). To be more
specific, the influence of the Internet is continually seen through its use to
achieve social change in social relations and in the sphere of politics. The
Internet and social networking websites in particular, have changed the
previously established pattern of social communication and social
relationships. In other words, the Internet changes our social life. Brown
(2011) claimed that “the Internet has radically reshaped our social lives
over the span of just a couple of decades, luring us into a virtual metaworld where traditional interactions require new protocols” (p. 29). On
the other hand, the use of the Internet by society has greatly impacted

95

governing bodies from individual politicians, to political parties, and
entire regimes (Wheeler, 2006). More importantly, the Internet has a
massive impact on the religious value system of even those countries
where religion encompasses all aspects of life.
2.5.2 Freedom of expression and Internet
It is important to discuss the power of the Internet in changing
people’s perception of freedom of expression especially that the main
assumption that the current study starts with is that the culture and
religion impact how people perceive the notion of freedom of expression
in digital-technology era.

Thus, it is reasonable to mention that the

Internet affects the entire world; that it eased access to all types of
information and increased public’s participation in political and public
spheres. As a result, the Internet played an essential role in changing the
notion of freedom of expression. The Internet affected Muslim and nonMuslim societies to different degrees based on the differences between the
two types of societies (i.e., the amount of social, religious and legal rules
that govern the society and depending on how each society has
functioned within the Internet).

96

To have a distinct view, a review of literature shows that the
Internet plays most crucial role in changing the notion of freedom of
expression. This role is mainly referred to the nature of the Internet in
terms of making the whole world communicating boundlessly, accessing
information unrestrictedly. A number of scholars argued the impact of the
Internet in removing limitations, boundaries, and restrictions in which the
whole world seems to be one global planet. The removal of boundaries
absolutely means that cultures, religions, politics, vales, and societal are
mingled all together to lead to a catastrophic and chaotic societies,
unexaggeratedly all over the world.
Clarke (1999) and Balkin (2004) have a subtle debate about the
impact of the Internet on reshaping the notion of freedom of expression,
though their discussions have two different approaches and focuses.
Balkin (2004) asserted that the Internet created new democratic culture
and intensely changed social values. He argued that Internet gives the
chance for ordinary people and not only the elite to participate in the
political and social spheres. Balkin explained the democratic culture as “a
democratic culture is democratic in the sense that everyone not just

97

political, economic, or cultural elites has a fair chance to participate in the
production of culture, and in the development of the ideas and meanings
that constitute them and the communities and sub-communities to which
they belong to” (p.3-4). He particularly articulated that the Internet affects
the mass media but cannot substitute it. Particularly, Balkin stated “the
digital age greatly expands the possibilities for individual participation in
the growth and spread of culture, and this greatly expands the
possibilities for the realization of truly democratic culture” (p.2). At the
same time, Balkin indicated to how the nature of the technology opposing
itself in term of expanding people’s freedom of speech and restricting
people’s ability to access some information. Accordingly, Balkin claimed
“the same technologies also produce new methods of control that can
limit democratic cultural participation. Therefore, free speech values,
interactivity, mass participation and the ability to modify and transform
culture –must be protected through technological design and through
administrative and legislative regulation of technology, as well as
through the more traditional method of judicial creation and recognition
of Constitution al rights” (p. 2).

Balkin argued that the Internet led to looking to freedom of speech
within different perspective and referred the reason to the changes in
social conditions because of the Internet.

98

Likewise, Clarke’s (1999) argument focuses on the meaning
freedom of expression in the information age. Similar to Balkin, Clarke
mentioned that in spite of the fact that Internet facilitates access to
information, governments and authorities censor large amounts of
information to avoid any unaccepted access to certain types of
information.
Clarke also indicated to the complexity of defining freedom of
information in the digital age. Clarke said that the legal aspect of freedom
of expression is treated unfairly. He argued that authorities did not draw
the legal boundaries clearly. Clarke also discussed the various
justifications for accessing information and for restricting access as well.
As Clarke posited, motivations including social, psychological economic,
democratic and law justify access to information, whereas, protecting
privacy is the most crucial justification for adding restrictions to access to
information. Clarke (1999) believed that “the golden era of information
accessibility is under threat, because governments have successfully
resisted FOI and have additional weapons to them” (p.15).

99

In the same token, Similar to Belkin is Wimmer (2006) who argued
that the Internet had added complexity to the notion of freedom of
expression. More clearly, he claimed that the boundaries of freedom of
expression were hard before the existence of the Internet, and with the
Internet they became harder. As he posited “before the emergence of the
one true global medium of communication - the Internet, each country
could workably set its own ceiling for the protection of expression without
having an adverse impact on other countries that might make a different
choice. The borderless nature of the Internet makes it more difficult for
despots and dictators to impose limits on Internet and information access
and limits on their citizens to information from outside their countries'
borders” (p. 203). More importantly, as Wimmer (2006) discussed that
each nation views the notion of freedom of expression differently, and as
result each has different meaning. As he declared, “yet various countries
differ significantly in their view of the meaning of "free expression" and
how it should be fostered” (p. 203). Thought, as argued by Wimmer there
is unanimous agreement about the basics of freedom of expression. The
agreement mainly is on how the United Nations' International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the European Convention for

100

Human Rights (ECHR), the American Convention on Human Rights
(ACHR), and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights
(ACHPR) explain the protection of freedom of expression. As Wimmer
said these organizations are primarily “the basic structure is that
individuals are guaranteed the right to receive information and to
freedom of expression through media of their choice” (p. 203).
2.5.2.1 The Impact of the Internet on the perception of freedom of
expression: Attitudes of older and younger generations
In order to have a solid base for understanding specific attitudes of
younger and older generations toward freedom of expression in South
Africa and Kuwait, the below discussion starts with general background
about the impact of the Internet on different generations in the world and
on the notion of freedom of expression. The general discussion will be
followed by background of the influences of the Internet on older and
younger generations, specifically, in South Africa and Kuwait.
Generally speaking, a number of studies have discussed the
different attitudes toward the Internet among generations, in which the
Internet considered to be a new technology that increases the amount of

101

freedom of expression and eases communication, accessing information
and participation in public and political spheres (Belkin, 2004). More
importantly, the literature indicates to the fact that the Internet created a
new pattern of communication within the social sphere and changed the
nature of public’s participation in political sphere. Consequently, the
Internet impacts the notion of freedom of expression (Belkin, 2004). My
study puts more weight on how culture and religion differently impact
older and younger‘s perception of the notion of freedom of expression and
its limitations.
Therefore, a number of studies investigated older and younger
generations in United Stated, China, and Australia (Broady et al. 2010,
Grimes et al. 2010, Olson et al. 2011, Pan et al. 2010, Wangner et al. 2010)
On the other hand, there are only few number of studies examining the
same issue in Islamic countries, mostly in Kuwait, Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia, and Egypt (Shahine 2011, Otaibi 2012, Oyai 2010).
On the other hand, there are several studies in the United States
about the usage of the Internet among older and younger generations.
These studies discuss the differences and similarities between the

102

generations in regard to the use of the Internet; in addition, they examine
the different impact of the Internet on the two generations. For instance,
most of the studies argue that the Internet impacts the social life of older
and younger generations (Tyler, 2002). Moreover, a number of studies
agree on the impact of the Internet on the communication patterns for
both older and younger generations. Other studies looked to how
differently the generations are using the Internet, as the younger
generation is usually using it for social interactions and searching for
different types of information (mostly the taboo information), whereas,
the older generation uses it for the purpose of shopping or getting health
information (Olson et. al, 2011). Other research focused on the two
generations and their awareness of the hazards of the use of the Internet
(Grimes et al. 2010).
2.5.2.1.1 Internet in South Africa
The Internet is a technology that Africans have partially mastered.
Though, there is a cultural effect of the Internet on the South African
people, especially on elites who can easily access and use the Internet
(Vittin 2010). Generally speaking, as discussed by Lewis (2005), the

103

Internet in South Africa reached a level of maturity and development in
2003 (p.7). Lewis (2005) continued to say that since 2002, the number of
Internet users in South Africa has increased dramatically every year.
Gradually the internet in South Africa has become an inescapable aspect
of both personal and commercial life. Particularly, email has become a
means of communication; therefore, several items of legislation were
recently enacted to cover online communication and Internet security
(p.7). At a more statistical level, Internet world stats (2009) stated that
South Africa has experienced a 91.3% growth in internet users in the
period between 2000 and 2008. Currently, South Africa is fourth in the
Africa Top 10 Internet Countries rating, with an estimated 4.6 million
internet users (Internet world stats, 2009).
2.5.2.1.1.1 Younger and older generation and the Internet in South
Africa
In discussing the younger and older generations’ attitudes toward
the Internet, a number of studies were found in the literature about how
parents, teachers, and young people deal with the Internet as a new
technology. However, teachers’ and parents’ reactions are not that

104

positive. In their study, Chetty and Besson (2006) focused on the role and
expectations of parents in regard to online pornography. The study shows
that teachers lack the knowledge of the danger of the Internet (p.3). The
result of the parents’ survey was not less cynical than teachers’ results.
Conversely, parents seem to be more unwilling to become involved in
their children’s online learning experience and rely on schools (p.37).
To be fair, teachers’ situations are different than parents’. As Chetty
and Basson (2006) does not show reluctance of the teachers toward the
problem of pornography, alternatively, the results illustrate that many
teachers lack the awareness of the possible risks to children posed by the
Internet. At the same time, teachers lack awareness of Internet safety
which means many children are exposed to emotional hardship from
exposure to potentially disturbing, harmful and age-inappropriate
materials on the Internet (p.3). The results of the study shows that only
slightly more than half (53%) responded that teachers discuss Internet
safety and usage. More significantly, based on Chetty and Bassons’ (2006)
findings, the schools have positive initiative to protect the children for
such risky online practices. As stated by Chetty and Basson (2006) “most

105

schools have strict mechanisms in place to prevent children from
accessing sexually-explicit material on the Internet; these include, blocking
and filtering software, educator supervision and monitoring systems” (p.
42).

In the same manner, Chetty and Basson (2006) have conducing

another survey in which they asked children about their use of the
Internet and if their parents are aware of children’s Internet activities. The
result showed that most children (56%) reported that their parents have
never discussed the Internet with them or warned them against any
possible dangers when using the Internet (p.24)
2.5.2.1.2 Internet in Kuwait
Looking at the Internet in Kuwait, what distinguishes Kuwait from
similar countries in the region is that it was the first country in the region
to give university students, faculty members, and staff Internet accounts
(Wheeler 2006, p.35). Moreover, as stated by Wheeler (2006), “10 percent
of the Kuwaiti population uses the internet; in addition more than 50
percent of Kuwaiti university students use it. Residents and citizens access
the Internet readily. Moreover, there are 300 internet cafés young people
visit on a regular basis” (p. 47). In spite of the fact that Kuwait is a

106

conservative society, since 1992, Internet use has grown rapidly. It is
estimated that almost 45,000 Internet users reside in Kuwait (Wheeler
1998, p.3).
2.5.2.1.2.1 Younger and older generation and Internet in Kuwait
In Kuwait, the Internet seems to have created new atmosphere that
has encouraged the interaction between males and females. Such a new
form of communication is considered to be against Islamic rules. Wheeler
(2000) explained “Islamic sanctions against interactions with the opposite
sex outside of relatives and marriage are transgressed” (p.443). One may
consider

such

social

interaction

through

Internet

as

distance

communication, but in fact it still counts as a pattern of communication
between males and females. As argued by Albudaiwi and Allen (2011)
“Even though the social interaction through the Internet is considered a
“virtual social interaction,” it is still a pattern of distance communication
that connects males and females and creates a type of relationship” (p. 17).
This type of communication between the sexes is not possible in everyday
life and if it should take place, it would be very dramatic and cause a lot of
stress in the community. Unlike most Western Democracies, direct

107

communication between males and females in Kuwait is not permitted
due to societal, cultural, and religious norms. The Internet creates an
opportunity for people to cross this boundary and the results cause
concern in the greater society.
In connection to the previous discussion, a number of scholars
examined the importance of the Internet within Kuwaiti culture where
they have focused on the impact of the Internet on young people. One
distinguishable name in the field is Wheeler Deborah. Wheeler (2006)
described the status of Internet use in Kuwait. She pointed out that the
Internet is excessively used by young people (57% of the population under
age twenty-five as of 2001). She continued to say that this is an important
statistic because the population under age 25 is the largest demographic in
Kuwait. As a result of using the Internet, new forms of communication
arose, such as; those practices that cross the limits of social, cultural and
religious norms (Wheeler 2006, p. 41).
In a similar manner, a study conducted by Ismail and Al-Mazeedi
about the use of the Internet among young people finds that youths share
their ideas and positive energies with people in cyberspace (Ismail and Al-

108

Mazeedi as cited in Wheeler 2006, p.226). The result of Ismail and AlMazeedi’s study proves that the use of the Internet opens up Kuwaiti
youths to contexts in which new thinking, perhaps contrary to their
upbringing, might be encountered. The result of using the Internet in the
authors’ opinion may cause fears among families and the government in
general. Particularly, fears arise regarding the easy accessibility of the
Internet and the openness of the Internet to all things not accessible in
every-day Kuwaiti life.
Even more specifically, the concern is over the other worlds that
youth may encounter which could expose them to a variety of
contradictory cultures and corrupt their values. Yet, Ismail and AlMazeedi concluded that families do not set the ethical and moral rules for
using the Internet because of families’ lack of awareness of potential
outcomes of Internet use. For example, in the same study, the authors
found that Internet eases the interaction with the opposite sex and this is
in fact against Islamic sanctions. Further, Ismail and Al-Mazeedi found
that 73.4% of students using the Internet felt that it was being used in
socially abusive and ethically unreliable ways. Additionally, 6.1% of the

109

surveyed felt that the morals and behavior of the students were negatively
affected by the internet. (Ismail and Al-Mazeedi as cited in Wheeler 2006,
p.226). Similarly, Wheeler (2006) finds that young people often use the
internet to communicate with the opposite sex through chatting with each
other. Youth’s justification in contacting the opposite sex is that they want
to know them more since it’s forbidden to have relations in real life; males
see females as a mystery and vice-versa. Such relations are banned by
religion, parents, and the whole society and it is “immoral behavior” (p.
40).
Likewise, Abbas conducted a study about the use of the Internet.
He argues that students continue to misuse the internet. He finds that
many sneak into internet cafés to browse freely through sites linked with
immoral activities. Surprisingly, in spite of the guilt students feel over
using the Internet in violating the Islamic moral and value system and the
risks they take in transgressing social norms, they fail to stop cyber dating
or visiting pornography sites. The result of Abbas’s study shows that
some students use the Internet to challenge Kuwaiti society.

The

challenge is to the conservative view against any public relations between

110

males and females. Because the Internet supports practices that go beyond
traditional norms of their lives, the Internet becomes a compelling place to
experience unfamiliar social interactions. Students’ cyber relations show
that the internet supports “decentralization,” individual empowerment,
resilience, and self- sufficiency (Abbas as cited by Wheeler 2006, p.139).
However, as discussed by Wheeler (2006), many Kuwaiti youths
remain critical of such practices. This illustrates how Muslim values help
filter and buffer the meaning and implications of such experiences. Even
within use of the Internet, the impact of the social and cultural norms has
not completely disappeared from the users’ behaviors. In contrast, the
social and cultural norms did not prevent the interruption of the value
system in the society for some Kuwaiti people (Wheeler 2006, p.140).
On a final point, as you notice that all but one of the studies about
the Internet in Kuwait focused on the young generation.
2.5.3 Conclusion
In general, it is worth mentioning that the above studies were all
conducted in the United States of America, and after searching certain

111

databases such as Proquest, Academic Search Complete (EBSCO), ERIC,
LexisNexis and Communication and Mass Media Complete, I found that
there is a lack of studies exploring the impact of the cultural and religious
contexts on young and old citizens’ perceptions of freedom of expression
in the digital technology era, specifically in Kuwait and South Africa.
Furthermore, most of the studies focused on younger generations. More
significantly, the existing literature does not separately examine how
different is the impact of the Internet on older and younger people in
Kuwait and South Africa.
2.6 Related Comparative Studies
As of this writing, only a small number of legal and social science
experts have endeavored to compare the conceptualization of freedom of
information as human rights among countries or within a single country.
In general, Western scholars undertaking freedom of expression focused
their investigation on either freedom of expression as a human right or
identifying various meanings of them as matters of law. Several find that
freedom of expression is a human right in which the right is
internationally protected (Christie 2012, Pasqualucci 2006, Carmi 2008,

112

Whitman 2008, Sedler 1988, Addo 2000, Alvarez et al. 2007, Oetheimer
2009). Likewise, a number of studies within the Islamic world have also
analyzed freedom of expression in nations such Algeria, Egypt and
Uzbekistan.
All in all, the existing body of literature compares freedom of
expression as a right among different Constitutions. Further, in order to
explain how nations apply freedom of expression, many scholars present
some related cases and attempted to compare how each country deal with
it. More importantly, in relatedness to the current research, there is a
notable lack of comparative studies that compare aspects of freedom of
expression in Muslim to non-Muslim countries and among generations.
The latter is a subtle stimulation for the current research to dig in and
discover how culture and religion might affect different generations from
different nations to shape the notion freedom of expression in the digitaltechnology era.
2.7 Final Assessment of the Literature

113

A close look to the literature easily shows the gap. There are no
studies that compare the impact of the Internet on people’s perception of
freedom of expression in Muslim and non-Muslim countries, specifically,
no study compares Kuwait and South Africa.
Therefore, it is still not clear how culture and religion impact
Muslims and non- Muslims people’s perceptions of freedom of
expression. Distinctly, it is blurred how different younger and older
generations in Muslim and Western-based values countries perceive the
notion of freedom of expression, especially in the Internet era. The current
literature does not examine the latter problem; instead it discusses the
notion of freedom of expression in a more general way. In the same vein,
freedom of expression has been intensively scrutinized by several legal
experts. Particularly, the notion of freedom of expression has been studied
as a protected basic right in which legal scholars analyzed related Articles
of the Constitutions and other legal documents. (Scanlon 1977, Kamali
1997, and Moon 2000)
After carefully reviewing the literature, I found that the influence of
culture and religion and on people’s perception of freedom of expression

114

is totally absent in the existing body of research. Furthermore, there is a
lack of comparison of those influences between different nations and
different generations. Based on the previous literature, freedom of
expression has been superficially studied in relation to other cultural and
religious impacts on people. Finally, studies comparing Muslim to nonMuslim countries in regard to this topic do not exist.
2.8 Conclusion
In conclusion, looking at the differences between Kuwait and South
Africa, I found that it is unclear how Kuwait deals with Internet
influences, whereas in South Africa it is easier to understand how Internet
influences have been treated since these influences do not consider being
serious challenges to South Africa.
On the other hand, the uniqueness of this study lies in comparing
the impact of culture and religion on the notion of freedom of expression
between older and younger generations in Muslim to Western basedvalue countries.

No comparative study between Muslims and non-

Muslims exist. No studies relate between the notions of freedom of
expression with cultural and religious values. Moreover, numerous

115

amount of literature examines the notion of freedom of expression
through legal lenses.
Thus, there are inadequate comparative studies about freedom of
expression and most of the existing literature is more of legal analysis, and
less in social sciences field. At the same time, plenty of literature discussed
the problem of defining freedom of expression. Legal experts have also
delved in information rights, adding more complexity to the issue.
Finally, the existing literature ties the notion of freedom of
expression to legal and political arenas more than any other arena such as
social or religion. On the other hand, the existing comparative studies
compare freedom of expression as a solid law or fundamental human
right. Obviously, several studies compare freedom of expression within
different Constitutions, in addition to analyzing court cases.
To summarize, since there were no comparative studies
considering the two factors, culture and religion together, the aim of this
study will be exploring the effects of culture and religion on the notion of
freedom of expression among older and younger generations of South
Africa and Kuwait.

Chapter 3
Methodology

3.1 Introduction
This chapter describes in detail the methodology used in this study
as well as how these methods were chosen. This chapter also includes the
study’s research questions, the research design, the sampling strategy,
data collection procedures, data analysis methods, and expected results.
Some limitations of the study are also discussed.
The nature of the present comparison is descriptive and
exploratory. Each section of the research represents either the descriptive
approach or the exploratory approach. The research also is a crossnational comparative case study in which selection of the case is based on
differences and similarities between the units of data. The comparison will
follow the deductive approach both qualitative and quantitative analyses
are used in this study, although, this study is not intended to compare
qualitative data to quantitative data. Instead, using the results of each
method, a comprehensive analysis will contribute to the final integrative

117

discussion. Concentrated attention must be directed to the typology of
mixed-methods, as indicated later within this section.
The method for the current research was selected to further
understand of the components of each country “within the whole case”
(de Vaus 2008, p. 252). The notion of freedom of expression was
investigated in each country within the context of culture, religion, and
politics.
3.2 Research questions
Since the main purpose of this study is to reflect on citizens’
perceptions about the notion of freedom of expression, current research
questions the factors that shape these perceptions, bearing in mind that
the nature of the question of the current research affects the type of
methodology used in the study (Punch 2005, p.239). The research
investigates the impact of cultural and religious values on how people
conceptualize freedom of expression by providing a qualitative “in-depth
description” of each nation, analyzing legislation, conducting focus
groups, and employing open-ended questions in a questionnaire.
Moreover, older and younger citizens’ perceptions will be examined by

118

conducting a survey. The research will attempt to address the following
questions:
1. How do certain cultural values impact citizens’ perception of
freedom of expression between generations in both countries?
2. How do religions values impact citizens’ perception of freedom of
expression between generations in both countries?
3. How does the younger and older generation perceive the
legislation that protects and controls freedom of expression?
The central theme of the first research question is to determine the
manner in which certain cultural values impact citizens’ perception of
freedom of expression between generations in South Africa and Kuwait.
Literature suggests analyzing cultural dimensions can assist in explaining
the reason of why members of society perceive certain notions (Hofested,
1991). To this end it is necessary to determine how culture impacts
people’s perceptions of the notion of freedom of expression.
The second research question focuses on how people's religious
values may influence their perceptions of freedom of expression. The

119

literature discusses that there is a relationship between religion and
people’s interpretations of any phenomena. Further, religion helps to
explain why people act in certain ways and how actions can be explained
(Finke and Adamczyk, 2008).
The third research question addresses perceptions of legislation of
freedom of expression in both nations. Literature suggests that the
younger generation is more liberal and tends to call for more freedom of
expression, whereas, the older generations is more conservative and
would appreciate having freedom of expression regulated (Albudaiwi,
2011). This question focuses on generational differences regarding
perceptions of how the Internet affects freedom of expression. It became
clear in the literature studies that in the age of the Internet there are
differences between older and younger generations in terms of perceiving
the limitations of freedom of expression. Studies indicated that the older
generation supports more restrictions on the freedom of expression
(Thornburgh and Lin 2002, p.20-21); while the younger generation
supports less restrictions on the freedom (Albudaiwi, 2011).
Three hypotheses will also be tested in the methodology. All

120

hypotheses are consistent for each of the countries selected for the study.
Based on the previous discussion, the first hypothesis that will be
tested in this research is if a positive relationship between age and the
perception of limitation of freedom of expression exists.
The second hypothesis in this research is that there is a positive
relationship between the role of the Internet and the citizens’ perception of
freedom of expression. I assume that in the Internet era, the younger
generation tends to call for more freedom of expression, while the older
generation favors more limitations on freedom of expression.
The last hypothesis tested in this research is that the awareness and
perception of freedom of expression by the younger and older generations
about the current legal framework that protects and controls freedom of
expression is different. My assumption is that the younger generation
views the legislations as too strict, whereas, the older generation supports
restrictions on freedom of expression.
It is worth pointing out at this stage that the above questions will
require a quantitative and qualitative analysis for cultural and religious
factors that impact the conceptualization of freedom of expression. The
result of this study will help in understanding how culture and religion

121

impact people’s perception of the notion of freedom of expression. The
study aims to answer more specific questions which the research will
develop while deeply looking in the literature.

3.3 Research design and methodological justifications
Given that social sciences research has become more complex, it is
important to design the research bearing in mind that all components of
the study must fit together and be linked with each other in order to reach
the best conclusion (Punch, 2005). An international and comparative case
study of two countries was designed to address the proposed research
questions and associated hypotheses. A mixed-method approach
employing qualitative and quantitative methods was my approach in
investigating the notion of freedom of expression within cultural and
religious contexts. Both research methodologies were selected to
systematically collect and analyze the relevant data.
In a mixed methods approach, qualitative and quantitative
methods are harmonious; as stated by Ivankova (2002), “both numerical
and text data, collected sequentially or concurrently, can help better
understand the research problem” (p.44). At this stage, methodological

122

justification of selecting mixed-methods is necessary in order to get the
largest amount of data to adequately answer adequately the in-depth
questions of the current research. Another justification may be as Punch
(2005) stated, “the reasons for combining are to capitalize on the strengths
of the two approaches and to compensate for the weakness of each
approach” (p.240).
Qualitative research methodology is advantageous because data
will be studied in its natural settings and phenomena are interpreted in
the meanings people bring to them (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005).
Qualitative research methodology emphasizes explaining the why and how
of the situation rather than investigating what, where, and when (Denzin
and Lincoln, 2008). More importantly, given the interdisciplinary nature
of the topic of the present study, qualitative methodology is useful based
on what Denzin and Lincoln (2005) have explained about how qualitative
research is interdisciplinary, trans-disciplinary, and multi-paradigmatic in
focus and works within complex historical field. Since the comparative
method accelerates several forms of interpretation understanding in
addition to the deep description (Geertz, 1973), the qualitative method is

123

in line with the nature of the comparative method.
At the level of Information Policy (IP), Vellenhoven (2006)
undertook a qualitative study and pointed out that “Qualitative research
will therefore help managers and policy makers to adopt laws that will
ensure that learners understand what legislators intend them to
understand” (p. 33). Walker (1985) suggested to the use of qualitative
research in the IP field. Walker argued that qualitative research offers
policymakers a more complete picture of those likely to be affected by a
policy-decision or thought to be part of the problem (Walker 1985, p. 19).
Due to the emphasis of the descriptive aspect of the comparative
study, documents such as constitutions and information policy have been
analyzed.

In conjunction with the previous statement, Kissam (1988)

discussed the necessity of legal analysis of IP field. Kissam (1988) clarified
that “legal analysis and synthesis is an attempt to analyze legal policy to
understanding and to critique the problem to resolve doctrinal issues”
(p.3). Quantitative research methodology was selected to hypothesize and
determine the dependent and independent variables in order to explore if
certain cultural and religious aspects are responsible for different

124

generations'

conceptualizations

regarding

freedom

of

expression.

Referring to Lor (2011), who articulated that quantitative methodology is
commonly described with an emphasis on the formulation of hypotheses,
implementation of concepts, measurement, and the design of experiments
(i.e. surveys, sampling, and the statistical testing of hypotheses) (Lor 2011,
p.6). The comparative method works hand in hand with the quantitative
approach, especially in regards to statistical analysis.
Lijphart (1971) mentioned that the comparative method is the most
appropriate method by which studies can take a first step toward
statistical analysis. More importantly, at this stage it is crucial to
characterize this research as descriptive-exploratory. Punch (2005) has
argued that “description and explanation represent two different levels of
understanding’ (p.15). The first section of my research is descriptive,
whereas the second part is more exploratory in nature. As argued by
Punch (2005), the descriptive level is necessary to accurately picture what
happened in the case. In the descriptive section of the research, cultural
and religious contexts are presented. This section also includes the legal
section in which the legal status of freedom of expression in South Africa
and Kuwait will be presented.

125

The second section of the research is exploratory. The research aims
to understand if cultural and religious factors have an impact on the
public’s conceptualization of the notion of freedom of expression in each
nation and between older and younger generations. Punch (2005) has also
discussed the nature of exploratory research. As he articulated, the
purpose of exploratory study is to find the reason for certain phenomena
and how certain aspects of the case happen. It is possible to take this line
of thought further. According to Punch (2005), there is no explanation of
any research problem without first describing the problem, but the
researcher can describe the problem of the research without explaining
why this problem has occurred. Hence, in the current research, the
descriptive section is followed by the explanation section, in which each
section is complementary to the other in order to reach a conclusion from
the research.
Regarding case selection, two nations were selected to be
compared: South Africa and the State of Kuwait. Selection of both nations
is built on what Defelice (1986) argued in terms of choosing the units of
comparison based on similarities and differences in terms of independent
variables (i.e., cultural factors) and the dependent variables (i.e., freedom

126

of expression) (p. 255).
To examine this concept in greater detail, both quantitative and
qualitative analyses are included in the analysis of citizen’s perception of
freedom of expression, including descriptive analysis and statistical
testing. A part of the descriptive analysis are interwoven with analysis of
legal documents (e.g. Articles in the Constitution pertaining to freedom of
expression). Together, qualitative and quantitative analysis are employed
to analyze cultural and religious factors that shape the notion of freedom
of expression among older and younger citizens in both nations. Results
from quantitative and qualitative methods are analyzed, connected, and
interpreted to better understand citizens’ perception of freedom of
expression.
3.4 Research methods
3.4.1 Qualitative and Quantitative Methods
As explained in the preceding section, the present study adopts
both qualitative and quantitative methods in order to gather and analyze
data. Thus, multiple methods are employed in this study, including
questionnaires, analysis of legal documents, and established criteria to
measure freedom of expression. Therefore, the below discussion which

127

follows discusses the most appropriate characteristics of qualitative and
quantitative methodology to provide a basis for adopting them for this
research.
The qualitative research method has been used widely the social
sciences. Scholars have distinguished qualitative methodology differently,
though; they agreed upon the core features of qualitative methodology in
general. In this manner, Punch (2005) stated “very often, the point of a
qualitative study is to look at something holistically and comprehensively,
to study it in its complexity, and to understand it in its context” (p.186).
Therefore, the researcher should be able to completely clarify the full
picture (Punch, 2005). In other words, it is necessary for the researcher to
provide an ‘in-depth description’’ of the situation (Punch, 2005).
Conversely, it is normal to see several natures of in-depth descriptions in
different studies as claimed by Punch (2005). The qualitative method is
therefore more flexible, more multi-dimensional, and less formal than the
quantitative method (Punch, 2005).
This debate leads to a discussion of quantitative approaches as the
other method that used in the present research. The quantitative method
is more structured and less flexible (Punch, 2005). In quantitative research,

128

the researcher relies on numerical data to expand knowledge of the
hypotheses and questions, cause and effect, and thinking and diminution
of certain variables (Charles & Mertler, 2002). In connection with the
current study, it has been discussed that the comparative method is in line
with the quantitative methodology, especially statistical analysis. As
mentioned by Lijphart (1971) that the statistical analysis is considered the
most appropriate method for comparative study.
Overall, qualitative and quantitative approaches complete one
another in respect to the current study. Though, Punch (2005) indicated
that researchers should not be restricted to the limitations of their
understanding about the purpose of qualitative and quantitative
approaches (data). Miles and Huberman (1994) support this with their
claim when they stated that “both types of data can be productive for
descriptive, reconnoitering, exploratory, inductive, opening up purposes.
And both can be productive for explanatory, confirmatory, hypothesistesting purposes” (p.42). One final point in regard to the combination of
qualitative and quantitative methods is summarized by Ivankova (2002),
“a major tenet of pragmatism is that quantitative and qualitative methods
are compatible. Thus, both numerical and text data, collected sequentially

129

or concurrently, can help better understand the research problem” (p.44).
3.4.2 Mixed-methods Typology
Mixed method research is defined as “research in which the
investigator collects and analyses data, integrates the findings, and draws
inferences using the qualitative and quantitative approaches or methods
in a single study or program of inquiry” (Tashakkori and Creswell 2007, p.
4). Punch (2005) defined the term mixed-methods as “describing different
types of combinations of the quantitative and qualitative approaches”
(p.241). However, in conducting a study, mixed methods research is not
merely mixing techniques but rather it is used to bridge the gap between
qualitative and quantitative models. Yin (2003) indicated how valuable the
combination of qualitative and quantitative methods is for case studies.
He mentioned that “the combination of both types of evidence could
contribute to the validity of the method” (p.52).
Turning to another aspect of mixed-methods, it is noteworthy to
call attention to three particular considerations in the formation of mixedmethods research: priority, implementation, and integration (Creswell et
al., 2003). As discussed by the scholars, each issue refers to a specific
aspect. Priority indicates the amount of emphasis that is given to

130

qualitative and quantitative methods in terms of which method will get
more

emphasis.

Implementation

explains

how

qualitative

and

quantitative data collection and analysis are arranged either in sequences
or in chronological phases; either sequentially, parallel, or concurrently.
Last at issue is integration, which refers to the stage in the research
procedure where the mixing or blending of qualitative and quantitative
data happens.
In fairness, however, there are many strategies to combining
qualitative and quantitative methods; selecting one strategy is in fact
determined by the nature of the study and the reason of conducting it.
Rationally speaking, making such decisions for the sake of a justifiable
research is relies too much on "common sense" (Punch 2005, p.342). Most
importantly to know is that the use of qualitative and quantitative
methods together would strengthen the results of the study (Clark and
Creswell, 2008). Hence, the questionnaire of my research includes both
definitive and open-ended questions.
At a more complex level, based on Bryman’s (1992) comprehensive
treatment of mixed-methods, he identified eleven approaches of
combining qualitative and quantitative methods. For the purpose of the

131

current study, I decided to use the approach called ‘quantitative and
qualitative research.’ This approach, as described by Bryman (1992)
provides a general picture of the studied problem. Bryman (1992) added
“quantitative research may be employed to plug the gaps in a qualitative
study which arise because, for example researcher cannot be in more than
one place at any one time. Alternatively, it may be that not all issues are
amenable solely to a quantitative investigation or solely to a qualitative
one” (p. 242).
A number of experts in mixed-methods research have focused on
the centrality of considering the stage of the research process at which
integration of qualitative and quantitative data collection occur. However,
the decision of which stage integration begins must be taken to form a
clear understanding of the design. As explained by Clark and Creswell
(2008), integration can take place within research questions, data
collection, data analysis, or the end interpretation. Clark and Creswell
(2008) posited that “the most typical case is the integration of the two
forms of research at the data analysis and interpretation stages after
quantitative data (e.g., scores on instruments) and qualitative data (e.g.,
participant observations of a setting) have been collected” (p.175).

132

However, for this study I follow Creswell’s (1994) proposed models of
combined design. Creswell described mixed-methodology as “aspects of
the two approaches are mixed at all stages of the research” (p. 243). As the
reader will discover later, mixed-methods in the present study integrate
qualitative and quantitative methods throughout the research process; for
data collection, data analysis, and final interpretations.
Hence, in connection to the current research I decided to employ a
mixed-method design for several reasons. First of all, the study seeks to
answer the impact of cultural and religious contexts on the public’s
perception of the notion of freedom of expression. This question shall be
answered through a qualitative "in-depth description" of the cultural and
religious factors, while the quantitative portion examines citizens’
perceptions about freedom of expression and its limitations by conducting
a survey.

A survey is one of the best methods to obtain the largest

amount of data from participants. In this manner, survey data provides a
quantitative and numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a
population by studying a sample of that population (Babbie, 1990).
Dillman (2007) discussed how survey data is a beneficial method in terms
of allowing researchers to statistically “estimate the distribution of

133

characteristics in a population” (p.9).
Taken as a whole, the most appropriate stage for integrating both
methods in the current research is during data interpretation and
discussion since quantitative data ultimately supports qualitative data.
Yet, as I mentioned earlier, the integration of the two methods in this
study is present throughout all the processes of research in order to gain
purposeful data and results.
3.5 Cross-national comparative study
Generally speaking, there is a long-standing debate over the term
of comparative study. Literature has provided the researcher with several
terms to define comparative study. To illustrate this, it could be observed
that terms like comparative research and comparative analysis are used in
the literature interchangeably to indicate relatively the same definition of
comparative study.
Starting with the most general view of comparative study of this
term, Przeworski and Teune (1970) have defined comparative study as
“…inquiry in which more than one level of analysis is possible and the
units of observation are identifiable by name at each of these levels”
(p.36). Similar to Przeworski and Teune is Azarian (2011) who indicated to

134

the analysis nature of the comparative study. Azarian (2011) stated
“comparative analysis is an old mode of research, widely used within
many, if not all, fields of scientific inquiry. As a method strategy
comparison plays an important part in the diverse branches of humanities
and social sciences alike” (p. 112).
Furthermore,

Azarian

(2011)

accurately

conjectured

that

comparison as a scientific method “refers here to the research approach in
which two or more cases are explicitly contrasted to each other regards to
specific phenomenon or along a certain dimension, in order to explore
parallels and differences among cases” (p. 113). Similar to Azarian, is
Collier (1993), who looked at the comparative study as method and tool at
the same time.
At a more specific level, through the current comparative study I
intend to discuss how similarly and differently certain factors (cultural
and religion) impact older and younger generations of people in South
Africa and Kuwait to conceptualize freedom of expression. Thus, after
delving into the literature I distinctively selected the cross-national
comparative study as the most appropriate method to be applied. A crossnational comparative study could be expected to lead to a reasonable

135

result regarding the current research for several reasons. First, the purpose
of cross-national comparative study as defined in the literature goes in
line with the purposes of the current research. For more clarification, de
Vaus (2008) stated that “the purpose of cross-national comparisons may
either be simply to describe national differences or to draw on the logic of
comparisons to explain cross national similarities and differences” (p.
250). Within the same context, Przeworski and Teune (1970) have also
indicated how researchers can rely on the differences between nations as a
foundation to start their comparisons and to investigate the influences of
these differences on social phenomena.
3.6 Research process
3.6.1 Cross-national Comparative study: Approach selection
In order to select an approach that fits with other elements of the
methodology, it is fair to make a decision based on the nature of the
current study. Prior to linking the type of the study with the chosen
approach, it is logical to examine the literature of several types of
approaches.
In general, there are two approaches of cross-national comparative
study; variable-based and case-based methods. (de Vaus 2008 and Ragin

136

1987). In conjunction with the current design, case-based is more
appropriate with the holistic nature and the purpose of the current
research. In particular, the case-based approach emphasizes the fact that
the part cannot be understood separated from the whole (de Vaus 2008,
p.252). As specifically defined by de Vaus (2008), the case-based approach
“seeks to understand elements of the country (case) within the context of
the whole case. It adopts a cultural and interpretive model in that it is
taken for granted that any behavior, attitude, indicator, or event can only
be understood by within its historical, cultural, and social context” (p.
252). Therefore, to justify the selection of the chosen approach for the
present study, it would be meaningless to describe and understand
freedom of expression in separately from the three contexts (cultural and
religious). In addition, it is more purposeful to focus only on the holistic
picture of the three aforementioned contexts and relate them to freedom
of expression.
On the other hand, examining the quantitative methodological
connection to the current research, case-based methodology as articulated
by de Vaus (2008) “uses variables these variables are placed and
interpreted within the context of the whole” (p.256). As mentioned

137

previously under the research questions section, my research seeks to
examine two hypotheses in which cultural and religious factors are
dependent variables. These dependent variables impact the independent
variable of the perception of freedom of expression.
Lastly, as stated by de Vaus (2008) “case-based designs seek to
build a rounded understanding of each country regarding the
phenomenon being investigated. Each case [country] is treated as a unit in
its own right and deserves to be understood as a coherent whole rather
than simply the site to which variables are somehow attached” (p.252).
This definition corresponds with the design of the present research
where South Africa and Kuwait are treated separately in regard to the
variables that connect to the impact of culture and religion on people’s
perception of freedom of expression. Yet, this explanation does not abjure
the fact that the comparison was carried out after investigating each of the
two cases independently.
3.6.2 Logic of comparative study
In regard to the complexity of case selection, Azarian (2011)
indicated that “the choice of units is a critical and tricky issue” (p. 112).
However, without embarking upon a detailed description of the logic of

138

selection and correlating it to the present research picture, the explanation
would be cloudy. Therefore, case selection is typically based on distinct
logic rather than random selection (Przewoski and Teune, 1970).
After reviewing the literature, it has been found that logic means
the strategy of selection. According to scholars in the field, there are two
main strategies of selection; Most Similar System Design (MSSD) and
Most Different System Design (MDSD) (Przewoski and Teune 1970; and
Anckar 2007). MSSD means choosing the units of comparison that are as
similar as possible (Anckar, 2007). Likewise, Przewoski and Teune (1970)
added that MSSD studies “are based on the belief that systems as similar
as possible with respect to as many features as possible constitute the
optimal samples for comparative inquiry” (p. 32). In contrast, MDSD
focuses on the differences of both cases. Przeworski and Tuene (1970)
focused on the essentiality of MDSD in which the researcher can select
diverse cases and suggest a similar process of change. Anckar (2007)
defined MDSD as “strategy to choose units of research which are as
different as possible with regard to extraneous variables” (p.390).
I found it appropriate to apply both systems to the current study
(MS&DSD), in order to achieve the purpose of the study. Using both

139

designs might be complex, yet it would help accomplish the research.
Anckar (2007) indicated that most studies combine MSSD with MDSD, to
the extent that some studies present very sophisticated applications of the
two systems (Anckar 2007, p. 390). The rationale behind this combination
of two systems for the present research is to determine both specific
similarities and differences of both South Africa and Kuwait in which
strictly connect to the essence of the research.

For more precise

comparison, I look to certain differences in regard to religion (i.e., Muslim
and non-Muslim nations). On the other hand, both countries share
similarities in their political systems, legislative measures, and issues
regarding information policy.

3.6.3 Approach of the Comparative Study: A deductive approach
As noted in the introduction, the present study follows a deductive
approach in order to logically present the flow of the argument. It is
necessary to theoretically distinguish the appropriateness of the
“deductive approach” with the current study design, which is based on
the principle of MDSD and MSSD. First, this study puts more focus on the
perception of freedom of expression as independent variables. Anckar

140

(2007) posited that if the research focuses on the independent variable
(Does X affect Y?), that means a deductive strategy is more appropriate.
As Ancker clarified (2007), “the independent variable has been identified
in the beginning of the research process by means of theoretical
reasoning” (p. 392). The latter quotation supports the current case, where I
define independent variables by combining them within the main purpose
of the study. I assumed in beginning that there are two separate positive
relations that exist; 1) a positive relation between the age and perception
of limiting freedom of expression and 2) a positive relation between the
awareness of citizens about Internet content and their opinion of limiting
freedom of expression.

3.7 Sampling Strategy and Tentative Timeline
3.7.1 Participants
Sampling strategies differ based upon the nature and the purpose
of the study. The sample also varies in regard to the type of data needed
for investigating and the hypothesis of the study. As Punch (2005) noted,
“A sampling plan is not independent of the other elements in a research
project, particularly its research purposes and questions” (p.102). On the

141

other hand, one must refer to Devers' and Frankel's (2000) discussion of
the importance of sampling and how it affects the research design. As they
stated, “the researcher must make the design more concrete by developing
a sample frame (i.e. criteria for selecting sites and/or subjects) capable of
answering the research question(s), identifying specific sites and/or
subjects, and securing their participation in the study” (p. 264).
Furthermore, Punch (2005) emphasized the importance of the basic ideas
of sampling. He states, “Sampling has been an important topic in the
research methodology literature, with well-developed and mathematically
sophisticated sampling plans” (p.101). Punch (2005) has also claimed that
in quantitative research, sampling typically means ‘people sample’. He
explained that “the key concepts therefore are population (the total target
group, who would, in the ideal world, be the subject of the research, and
about whom project is trying to say something and the sample (the actual
group who are included in the study, and from whom the data are
collected)” (p. 101). At the same time, in their debate about sampling
strategies, Miles and Huberman (1994) directed a piece of advice to the
researchers by indicating to the fact that research will not be able to study
everyone everywhere doing everything (p.27).

142

The sample of the current study is convenience, but were well and
accurately selected. Convenience sampling is considered to be a nonprobability

or

nonrandom

sampling

(Farrokhi

and

Mahmoudi-

Hamidabad, 2012).
As Farrokhi and Mahmoudi-Hamidabad (2012) stated “groups
chosen by convenience sampling are conducive to self-selection” (p.784).
Dornyei (2007) also discussed that convenience sample is selected if the
participants meet specific practical criteria, such as; the availability of the
participants at certain time, the easiness of accessing the participants and
their willingness to volunteer. More importantly as mentioned by Dornyei
there is a geographical proximity in the convenience sample.
The target population in this study consists of 80 self-selected South
African and Kuwaiti citizens between the ages of 18 and 65 who are
connected with various institutions, schools, or organizations. In
particular, the younger participants range in age from 18 to 25 while the
older participants range from 26 to 65. Forty participants from each
country were selected. Kuwaiti participants completed the questionnaire
both onsite and online to save time, whereas South African participants

143

completed the survey online because of difficulties in traveling to South
Africa in person. Kuwaitis’ second official language is English, Kuwaiti
participants should have the option to answer the questionnaire either in
English or Arabic. In South Africa, English is one of the official languages;
however, due to the difficulties of translating the questionnaire into the
other official languages, South African participants answered the
questionnaire in English.
Younger and older participants from each country were
interviewed in a focus group setting. Each focus group consists of
different numbers of younger and older participants; the number of the
participants is varied based on the availability of the participants.
Due to the difficulty of visiting South Africa, South African
participants will be interviewed through Skype. Though, a group of 13
South African Master Students visited Milwaukee Fall/2013 I met them
for interviews and questionnaires.
3.7.2 Tentative timeline
The entire study was completed in roughly 12 months while a
substantial part of the data was analyzed throughout the data collection
process.

144

3.8 Data Collection Method and Procedures
3.8.1 Simultaneous Triangulation
In order to gather data from multiple sources, I selected
triangulation, a means of interconnecting various methods and data and
employment in a single study (Denzin, 1989). I employed a simultaneous
triangulation; defined by Clark and Creswell (2008) as “the use of
qualitative and quantitative methods at the same time. In this case, there is
limited interaction between the two datasets during data collection, but
the findings complement one another at the end of the study” (p. 152).
Clark and Creswell (2008) added that the purpose of simultaneous
triangulation is “to obtain different but complementary data on the same
topic, rather than to replicate results” (p. 157).
3.8.2 Data Collection Methods
In order to accurately address the research questions of the current
cross-national comparative case study, multiple methods were employed.
The data have been drawn from multiple sources of information,
including document evidence, a focus group, and surveys.

145

3.8.2.1 Qualitative Data Collection Method
3.8.2.1.1 Documents Evidence
The current research relies on document data as one main a
primary source. The Constitutions of South Africa and Kuwait, in addition
to other freedom of expression policies and Human Rights Conventions
were used in the research to provide data about how legislation in both
countries deals with freedom of expression.
Starting with defining the meaning of documents as legitimate
sources of data, Punch (2005) mentions that documents “might be used in
various ways in social research; some studies might depend entirely on
documentary data, with such data the focus in their own right” (p. 184).
On the other hand, Jupp (1996) defined the types of documents that
researchers can use as sources for their studies. As he claimed, social
scientists can use a variety of documents such as, diaries, letters,
biographies and autobiographies, essays, personal notes, and reports, as
well as institutional memoranda, and governmental pronouncements and
proceedings (Jupp, 1996). Likewise, Wildemuth (2009) pointed out that
there are several types of documents, and they are published in different
forms. Wildemuth mentioned a number of types of public/official

146

documents that are considered as one type (p.159). Further, it is necessary
to link between the selected documents and the purpose of present study.
Wildemuth (2009) strictly emphasized the importance of specifying
documents used in the study, along with defining the link between the
purposes of the study with the selected documents (p.159).
Documents that employed in this study were: the Constitutions of
countries, related policies, and Human Rights conventions. I intentionally
chose the aforementioned documents for certain reasons. Naturally, since
one of the main themes in the research is a comparison of legislations
dealing with the freedom of expression, it is crucial to find out some
Articles of the Constitutions which discuss freedom of expression and
information.

3.8.2.1.2 Focus Group- Discussion group
Kuwaiti and South African citizens of older and younger
generations were targeted in this study, which is based on a discussion
conducted to collect raw data from the informants. A focus group is
therefore the most suitable tool used to gather the experiences of people.
As discussed by Tashakkori and Teddlie (2003), regarding focus groups,

147

“focus groups are often used in inter-method mixing (i.e., along with
additional methods of data collections), although they can also be used as
stand-alone method, focus groups are used for explanatory purposes to
delve into group members’ thinking on a research topic” (p. 309).
Focus groups usually include 6-12 homogeneous participants,
staying been 60 to 180 minutes with the moderator who starts the
discussion and facilitates using 5 to 10 open-ended questions. The
moderator can record the discussion using audio and/or video tapes
(Tashakkori and Teddlie, 2003). Without embarking on the types of focus
group, among the various types of focus group I selected the most
common type of focus group, which is “pure qualitative type”. Pure
qualitative type as stated by Tashakorri and Teddlie (2003) “is [a type]
based on one or more research questions, but the discussion tends to be
spontaneous” (p. 309). In fact, this type of focus group is suitable and
useful at the same time for the current study because it invites
participants’ ideas and impressions about the discussed topic (Tashakorri
and Teddlie, 2003).
So far as focus groups are concerned, 6 focus groups; 1) three

148

groups include younger and older South African participants; and 2) three
groups include younger and older Kuwaiti participants. Each group
contains approximately 8-27 participants. Participants in each group
represent different demographic. Interviewing participants will last for 60
to 90 minutes and the discussion will be recorded using audio tapes.
The prepared questions are chiefly to invite participants’ attention to
the core aspects of freedom of expression. Moreover, the questions are to
help the participants feel comfortable and mentally prepared for the
discussion. These questions have a direct relationship to the purpose of
this study and are important in facilitating the other questions that are
strictly connected to this study. All the questions are derived from the
study’s main questions. The questions are divided into groups, some are
general and others are specific.
-

Do you think the Internet is culturally accepted in the society?

-

Do you think people use the Internet appropriately as it relates to
access certain kinds of categories?

-

Do you think accessing any type of website is a personal matter?

149

-

To what extent do you think religion plays a role in deciding which
information can be accessed in the Internet?

-

Give them an example: ‘is an unmarried woman and an unmarried
man chatting via Skype or other online chat and is this acceptable
for you?’

-

Do you personally know people who are chatting and Skyping?
How many?

-

What do you think freedom of expression means?

-

Do you think censorship is important? Why?

-

Do you think censorship’s regulations and policies are feasible?

These interviews were not be limited to taking notes, but also were
recorded audio-visually. Recording the interviews increased the reliability
of the data.
3.8.2.2 Quantitative Data Collection Method
3.8.2.2.1 Survey

150

This research employed surveys in order to gather data about the
perception of freedom of expression from South African and Kuwaiti
citizens. Specifically, the survey is used to explore the relation between
cultural and religious values on the citizens’ conceptualization of freedom
of expression and its restrictions.
A broad outline of the significant of the use of surveys within social
science field exists in the literature. A number of scholars in the field of
social science agreed that surveys are a useful method for obtaining many
types of data from participants. Surveys provide an opportunity to gather
a variety of data such as beliefs, opinions, behaviors and attitudes of the
participants (Babbie, 1990; Dillman, 2007).
Generally speaking, the survey of the present study is designed
based on Peterson’s recommendations .Peterson (2000) suggested three
sections for questionnaires: introduction, substantive questions, and
providing classification questions. Furthermore, the questionnaire of this
study includes both open-ended and closed questions. In the literature,
attention has already been drawn to how each type of question supports
the purpose of the study. In more concrete terms, there are two types of
questionnaire questions; open-ended and close-ended (Wildemuth 2009,

151

p. 258). As Wildemuth (2009) stated that open-ended questions “do not
present respondents with any response categories; rather, respondents
compose and submit their own responses” (p. 258). Therefore open-ended
questions are more appropriate for exploratory studies (Wildemuth, 2009).
In contrast, Wildemuth (2009) indicated to the fact that close ended
questions “require less time and effort “(p.258). Moreover, close-ended
questions as Wildemuth (2009) claimed, “present respondents with a
limited number of predetermined response categories” (p.258).
In order to deal with the specific topic of public perception of
freedom of expression, the questionnaire is divided into three main
sections; the first section includes demographic questions such as age,
gender, marital status, nationality, educational degree level, employment
status, and religion affiliation. The second section contains three parts
with a total of 20 questions. Each part consists of close-ended questions
about specific aspects of the topic. The first part has 6 questions about
public perception of the ability of the government to control access of
information. The second part includes 3 questions about accessing illegal
materials. The final part of section two consists of 11 questions regarding
the use of social networks.

152

The survey instrument adopted in the research consists of three
subscales, awareness of the freedom of expression policy, perception of
censorship, and effectiveness of personal values (i.e. cultural and religious
values). The items were identified to represent each subscale. To measure
each item, the instrument is equipped with five-point scale. The five
points of scale are the following:
1) Strongly agree
2) Agree
3) Neutral
4) Disagree
5) Strongly disagree
Other questions were provided with specific items for the participant.
For example, to measure the public's perception about the notion of
censorship, the following question was formed:
What type of websites do you think governments should control?
1) Pornography
2) Gambling
3) Political websites (i.e., protesting against the president, protesting
against government etc.)

153

4) Anti-social values
5) Anti-religion (i.e., insulting religious symbols)
6) None

The third section of the questionnaire includes 6 open-ended
questions. The questions provide data particularly about publics’ opinion
of the following issues; advantages and disadvantages of the Internet,
freedom of expression and censorship, and religious opinion about the use
of the Internet. An illustration of open-ended question is below:
-

Is your use of the Internet informed by your religious beliefs?
Explain any opinion.

Kuwaiti’s had an option to complete the survey in English or Arabic.
Recall that English is a widely accepted language in both Kuwait, where it
is the second official language, and in South Africa. As articulated in the
introduction, special attention has been paid to clear up definitions of
such terms as; freedom of expression, censorship, cultural, and religious
values. Additionally, the sample of this study from both nations must
equally and fully address the topic and the questions, especially since each

154

nation uses a different language. Therefore, the English and Arabic
versions of the questionnaire must carry the same meanings of any
terminologies, expressions, and definitions. Yet, language carries the
culture of the country rather than just the words, as result, “the words can
reflect culturally specific meanings and concepts that may have no
equivalent in other culture” (de Vaus 2008, p. 260).

3.9 Data Collection Procedures
The study started with recruiting participants, continued with a
consent form sent via email. The consent form included information
explaining the purpose, procedures, benefits, and risks of the study. I
distributed the questionnaire for students and faculty members of Kuwait
University, in addition to other institutions. Dr. Abdulredah Aseri of the
University of Kuwait agreed to distribute the questionnaire to a number of
faculty members and students in the Social Sciences department. The
same goes for the chair of the department of Library and Information
Science at Kuwait University, Dr. Charlene AlQallaf. Finally, the
regulations

of

the

University

of

Wisconsin

Milwaukee

Institutional Review Board (IRB) gave approval for the study.

3.10 Data analysis techniques
Specific qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques were
used to analyze the collected data. Qualitatively speaking, in the first
phase of the research, data was analyzed by employing thematic analysis
and documentary analysis. The quantitative analysis was performed to
statistically analyze and identify the impacts of cultural and religious
values on the public's perception of freedom of expression among
different generations.

Multiple correlation and regression techniques

were used to provide the statistical results of the study.
3.10.1 Qualitative Analysis
3.10.1.1 Document Analysis
Turning to document analysis, documentary evidence from
documents serves as a basic data source to complement information
gathered from the literature and the survey. Analysis of such documents
requires particular attention to certain points. As I stated elsewhere in this
chapter, a number of scholars have agreed that documents are a social
production and are issued as a result of human activity. Documents are
formed based upon certain ideas, theories, or common principles.
Additionally, documents are usually situated within the constraints of

156

specific social, historical, or administrative conditions and structures
(McDonald and Tipton, 1996; Finnegan, 1996). Punch (2005) accordingly
stated that “words and their meanings depend on where they are used, by
whom and to whom” (p. 227). Wildemurth (2009) warned that researchers
must comprehend and interpret the meaning of the document accurately,
especially that Miller (1997) has also pointed out (1997) that documents
are the result of “socially constructed realities” (p.77). Similar to Miller,
Punch (2005) posited that, “documents and texts studied in isolation from
their social context are deprived of their real meaning thus understanding
of the social production and context of the document affects its
interpretation” (p. 227).
Taken as a whole, the current study has analyzed a number of legal
texts such as Articles of Constitutions and other policies regarding
freedom of expression. Consequently there is a serious need to have an
accurate understanding of these texts, especially since it is commonly
known that legal texts bear more than one interpretation depending on
the context and the circumstances where the text was issued.
3.10.1.2 Content analysis
In order to analyze the data from the focus groups and open ended

157

questions, I used content analysis.

Given that content analysis

accomplishes the premise of library and information research, it is widely
used in information field (Gorman and Clayton, 1997). The literature is
full of definitions of content analysis mostly agreed that this tool focuses
on the actual content. It emphasizes on the words, phrases, characters, or
sentence within the text or a number of texts through an objective manner
Cartwright 1953, Janis 1949, Berelson 1954, Busha and Harter 1980, and
Osgood 1959). One comprehensive definition was suggested by Berelson
(1954). Berelson stated that content analysis is "a research technique for
the objective, systematic, and quantitative description of manifest content
of communications” (Berelson 1954, p.489). Briefly, as Powell (1997)
discussed content analysis is “a systematic analysis of the occurrence of
words, phrases and concepts” (p. 50). For the purpose of content analysis,
a number of broad code categories were formed (such as cultural values,
religious opinion, personal values, freedom of expression, social
relationships,

the

meaning

of

social

action,

and

pattern

of

communication). Respectively, the process of interpretation involves the
counting frequency of the aforementioned themes and the discussion
them to the main context of the research.

158

3.10.2 Quantitative Analysis
3.10.2.1 T-test Analysis
The study employed a t test or independent samples in order to
quantitatively analyze the data and complete the comparison between
South Africa and Kuwait. A t test is used to determine if there is a
significant difference between two group means (Allen, Titsworth, and
Hunt, 2009). There are different types of t tests, but for the current
research, independent samples test were tested because there are two
groups of participants (Allen, Titsworth, and Hunt, 2009).
3.11 Criterion for the Comparison
In this section, I will consider criterion for making the comparison.
First of all, to determine the status of freedom of expression, I will develop
a criterion with specific parameters. Building upon the preceding
literature, one parameter is to look upon the Articles of the Constitutions
in which the notion of freedom of expression is discussed. Another
parameter to be compared is the justification of proposing legal policies
and regulations is to restrict freedom of information in countries. One

159

more aspect measured is the country's commitment to Human Right
conventions, by counting the number of legal cases involving freedom of
expression cases. Further, another indicator of the status of freedom of
expression regards how the acts dealing with freedom of expression are
enacted. Considering the political system of the countries as a parameter
to compare freedom of expression would compound the complexity of the
issue. It should be borne in mind that the primary purpose of this research
is to investigate the impact of cultural and religious contexts on Kuwaiti
and South African citizens; therefore, these proposed criteria should allow
for better understanding of the issues involved based on available sources
and data.
In addition to the above, I am specifically inspired by the work of
Ndwana (2008) in building the foundation of criteria. Ndwana (2008)
compared the legislation of freedom of expression between South Africa
and Zimbabwe by looking into certain aspects. Distinctively, Ndwana
focused on freedom of expression regulations and analyzed Court cases in
order to understand how the judiciary deals with the right of freedom of
expression. Additionally, Ndwana discussed and compare the notion of

160

freedom of expression with the two countries Constitutions to explore if
the right is completely protected and guaranteed. Accordingly, I will
follow Ndwana’s criteria but with some minor modifications.
3.12 Expected results
For the expected results of the survey, participants with different
cultural and religious backgrounds are expected to demonstrate various
views toward freedom of expression and its restrictions. They are
expected to reveal their particular cultural and religious opinions about
freedom of expression and its limitations. Moreover, by conducting this
research, I am trying to gain more in-depth insight about freedom of
expression in a Muslim and a pre-dominantly non-Muslim country, which
is in fact partially absent from the literature.
Participants from each nation with conservative beliefs are
expected to explain their rationale for the relation between religion and
free access to information; whereas, more open-minded or liberal
participants may insist on personal freedom while accessing the Internet.
On the other hand, younger participants may have a surprising answer in
regards to their use of the Internet and their awareness of their religious

161

values. For participants who are parents, a generational gap may appear
about their opinion of the Internet. Parents’ religious opinions in regards
to free access to information may also be astonishing; since parents are
usually aware of the kind of websites their children may access (i.e.
pornography and chat rooms). Academic people may show their concern
about the use of Internet policy and the dilemma of censoring access to
information.
3.13 Limitation of the study
There are some limitations for this study, regarding the
quantitative and qualitative data collection method. Expectedly, the
questionnaire may not be clearly understandable for Kuwaiti participants
and that may affect the results of the study. Thought, a full explanation of
the notion of freedom of expression for the participants would help in
overcome this problem. On the other hand, I expect difficulty in
comparing legislations of freedom of expression of the two countries. The
reason for such difficulty is the either the lack of resources or the
complexity of the legal terms.

Chapter 4
Legal Issues in Freedom of Expression

4.1 Introduction
In order to compare the concept of freedom of expression between
South Africa and Kuwait through legal lenses, it is reasonable to first
specify the criterion of comparison. Therefore, certain aspects were
assessed to understand the differences of meanings and applications of
freedom of expression in both nations. A general comparison was made
between how the South African judiciary system and the Kuwaiti
judiciary systems have handled cases dealing with the right to freedom of
expression.
The purpose of the assessment of freedom of expression in relation to
the general purpose of the current dissertation is to evaluate the concept
within the legal system and how the legal system in both countries deal
with freedom of expression on both theoretical and practical levels. In
view of this, the comparative analysis allows for better understanding of
the issues involved, yet, it is important to mention that not all laws and

164

regulations will be covered in this chapter. I intentionally selected certain
freedom of expression laws and regulations to serve the purpose of the
chapter.
My plan of campaign in the detailed comparison in this chapter
will be as follows; there will be three criteria. Each criterion will be
discussed in separate section. At the end of each section there will be a
concise comparison. After explaining and comparing each action
separately, a conclusion will be presented at the end of the chapter.
4.2 Comparative criteria
Freedom of expression has been studied and compared among
countries from different angles across fields. As noticed, a number of
criteria in the literature focus on comparing the Articles of the
Constitution that discuss the right of freedom of expression. Another
criterion found in the literature is to measure and compare the legislation
that control the right of freedom of expression among nations. Further,
there are some studies in which policies of freedom of expression were

165

also compared among nations such as Internet policy (Xue 2005, Fan 2005,
and Flew 2002).
Therefore, to create comparative criteria for this research I referred to
one scholar’s criteria. Criterio was established by Ndwana (2008) to legally
compare the notion of freedom of expression between Zimbabwe and
South Africa. According to Ndwana (2008) the right of freedom of
expression in South Africa and Zimbabwe was compared by focusing on
the Articles of the Constitutions that guaranteed the right of freedom of
expression. Further, Ndwana (2008) also emphasized on evaluating and
comparing censorship legislation that impact freedom of expression.
Particularly, Ndwana (2008) discussed these types of legislation in
addition to evaluating some issues surrounding the protection of the right
by the related authorities.
In regard to the legal comparative of this chapter, after referring to the
above criteria I would particularly focus on the Articles of the
Constitution and the legislation that influence the right of freedom of
expression. Consequently I come up with the following criteria, in which
only certain aspects are compared:

166

4.2.1 Freedom of expression in the Constitutions: South Africa and
Kuwait
4.2.1.1 Historical background of the South African Constitution
4.2.1.1.1 Freedom of expression in the South African Constitution
4.2.1.2 Historical background of the Kuwaiti Constitution
4.2.1.2.1 Freedom of expression of the Kuwaiti Constitution
4.2.2 Implementation of freedom of expression legislations
4.2.2.1 Regulations of freedom of expression in South Africa
4.2.2.1.1 Film and Publications Act of 1996
4.2.2.1.2 Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination
Act 2000
4.2.2.1.3 Protection of State Information Bill
4.2.2.2 Regulations of freedom of expression in Kuwait
4.2.2.2.1 Internet Policy 2002 No.(70)
4.2.2.2.2 Press and publication law of 2006 the Law No. (3)
4.2.2.2.3 New Media Law of 2013.
4.2.3 Application of freedom of expression: Case model

167

4.2.3.1 Case model: CONSTITUTION AL COURT OF SOUTH
AFRICA-- Case CCT 36/01 THE ISLAMIC UNITY CONVENTION VS.
THE INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING AUTHORITY
4.2.3.1.1 Court reasoning and final decision
4.2.3.2 Case model: Kuwait: IN THE CASE No. 274/2012 CAPITAL –
118/2012 INVESTIGATIONS-FILED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTION VS.
HAMAD FAISAL TAHER NAQI
4.2.3.2.1 Court reasoning and final decision
4.2.3.3.1 Case Model comparison table
Giving a comprehensive idea about the criteria of the current
research, the first criterion is to present and compare the historical
background and the ideology of each Constitution. Putting the latter in
different words, the nature of the Constitution may be restrictive or open
depending on the environment that inspired the legislator during the
drafting of the Articles (i.e., Islamic laws, or Bill of Rights). Therefore,
historical background of the Kuwaiti and South African Constitutions
were compared to discover the textual and contextual meaning of freedom
of expression underneath these two Constitutions.

168

The second criterion is to compare the implementations of freedom of
expression by evaluating some censorship legislations issued by either
ministries or parliaments. The legislations are evaluated to determine the
motivations of drafting limitations that control the right to freely express
opinions, write, and read. In more concrete words, what are the nature of
the motivations, are they more religious, social or political of its kinds.
The measurement includes how regulations control free access to
information, specifically through the Internet.

This is achieved by

assessing the identified regulations of freedom of expression – the
rationales behind controlling freedom of expression as a basic right.
Third, in order to be able to comprehend freedom of expression
within each country’s legal system, I will present a case model in each
country with the intention to discover how courts and judiciary systems
deal with such cases and what theologies the courts depend on when
reasoning its final decision. Bearing in mind, that through comparing the
court cases it is remarkable to find out what the court relied on when it
made its decision. Generally speaking, cases related to social networks
and media-- broadcasting will be introduced.

169

In sum, this chapter draws a comparative legal analysis
between South Africa and Kuwait. Comparison has been drawn between
the two countries due to the similarities and differences in the countries’
legal systems and historical backgrounds.
4.2.1 Freedom of expression in the Constitutions: South Africa and
Kuwait
In order to investigate the differences and the similarities of the
Articles that discuss freedom of expression in the South African and
Kuwaiti Constitutions, a brief review of the historical background of the
Constitutions, along with discussing the Articles of the Constitutions that
discuss and guaranteed the right of freedom of expression is needed.
It is convenient to begin with the kind of the governance of each nation.
First, South Africa is a “democratic state which has a Constitution as its
supreme law. South Africa was colonized by the British and has a Roman Dutch law and English law background” (Ndwana 2008, p.224). As stated
in Section 1 (c) of the South African Constitution, the Republic of South
Africa is a democratic state which is founded on the supremacy of the
Constitution and the rule of law (Ndwana, 2008). Like South Africa,

170

Kuwait is a democratic country. Article (6) of the Kuwaiti Constitution
states “the System of Government in Kuwait shall be democratic, under
which sovereignty resides in the people, the source of all powers.
Sovereignty shall be exercised in the manner specified in this
Constitution” (Constitution of Kuwait 1961, Article 6). On the other hand,
Kuwait was also colonized by Britain in 1941 (Olsson, 2009).
All in all, both countries, as indicated in literature, have history of
freedom of expression within their legal systems. At the theoretical and
practical levels, freedom of expression has changed in both countries. It is
for these reasons that a comparison between South Africa and Kuwait is
appropriate.
4.2.1.1 Historical background of the South African Constitution
After Apartheid period where whites prevented access of
information, information became crucial for the country and the
awareness of the importance of information amongst

South African

people increased. More importantly, the democratic parliament shaped
the right of access to information by enacting legislation in the new South
African Constitution (Dimba and Calland). As discussed by Dimba and
Calland, the new era in South Africa started in 1993 where the political

171

system became democratic and a Bill of Rights was added in the new
Constitution specifically to protect access to information for everyone. In
fairness however, there was a constant development in the information
field in South Africa. That being said the new era of 1993 also witnessed
some major changes.
Switching to the most flourishing era in the history of the South
African Constitution, the drafting process for the South African
Constitution in 1996 is one of the most ample and democratic Constitution
-drafting exercises. This does not deny the fact that there were some flaws,
yet, the Constitution fortified human rights as a foundation stone of South
African democracy (Sarkin, 1999).
Historically speaking, the Constitution of 1996 was issued to
enhance democratic values, fundamental human rights, and social justice
that were absent under apartheid regime and alternated with several
injustices. That’s not all; the Constitution enshrined extensive political,
social, and economic rights in responding to the injustices that were
prevalent in the apartheid era. In addition to increasing large amount of
rights in the Constitution, the Constitution contains an enormous Bill of

172

Rights. In this connection, the Constitution not only imbeds a Bill of
Rights but also demonstrates the determination of the separation of
apartheid era, especially with the doctrine used to force the court to
activate and apply race-based legislation (Southall, 2000).
The 1996 Constitution, as stated by Ackro-Cobbah (2009),
“provided the necessary legislative opportunity for South Africans to have
unhindered access to information” (p. 8). Furthermore, the 1996
Constitution protects democracy, its prelude “lays the foundations for a
democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of
the people and every citizen is equally protected by law” (South Africa,
1996a: 2). Therefore, Ackro-Cobbah (2009) discussed that the notion of
democracy is central to the Constitution

in two ways; informing the

citizens of the governmental activities so that they practice their
democratic rights effectively, and protects the right to access to
information to all citizens to ensure the public power fairly. Section (32) of
the Constitution therefore, states “everyone has the right of access to (a)
any information held by the state, and (b) any information that is held by
another person and that is required for all exercise or protection of any

173

rights. According to Ackro-Cobbah (2009), the previous Section of the
Constitution “affirms the fundamental right of access to information and
seeks to promote a culture of transparency and accountability on both the
public and private sectors” (p. 9).
From this perspective, it can be argued that the progressive
Constitution has made very significant strides towards democracy since
1996. Unanimous agreement has been found in the literature in regard to
how the Constitution of 1996 provides the basis for social justices and
human rights (Goldston 1997; Sarkin 1998; Sarkin 1999; and Lor and Van
2002). The Constitution also effectively incorporates a Bill of Rights (Lor,
and Van, 2002). With this context, Goldston (1997) has directly pointed out
“the 1996 Constitution reaffirms the 1993 Constitution ’s commitment to a
justiciable Bill of Right. Section (7), the first provision in the Bill of Rights’
Chapter on Fundamental Rights (Chapter 2), provides that: (1) This Bill of
Rights is a cornerstone of democracy in South Africa. It enshrines the
rights of all people in our country and affirms the democratic values of
human dignity, equality and freedom” (p. 4). More significantly, the
integration of a Bill of Rights in the Constitution emphasized essential

174

issues about the protection of human rights by parliament. In particular,
the power of the parliament does not allow the members of it to
promulgate any legislation which conflicts with any of the Constitutions’
Articles that protect human rights (Lor and Van, 2002). Equally, another
basic issue is that the Constitution has a mandatory condition that forces
the parliament to enable citizen’s involvement and participation in the
legislation process (Lyons and Lyons, 1999).

4.2.1.1.1 Freedom of expression in the South African Constitution
South African history has witnessed a long journey of denial of
fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression and
freedom of the press. Censorship was one example of a tool that used to
control the free flow of information in South Africa (Ndwana 2008).
However, in the new democratic era the 1996 Constitution guaranteed the
protection of fundamental rights in the Bill of Rights. As Ndwana (2008)
stated “The rights in the Bill of Rights are intended to safeguard against
the established pattern of censorship and secrecy of the apartheid era by
entrenching a set of rights that is not open to abuse by future
governments” (p.224).

175

Looking at the South African Constitution, one can notice the
amount of freedoms that are protected. As discussed by Wing (2008), the
South African Constitution is progressive, open, and protects a lot of
rights. Furthermore, it has been mentioned several times in the literature
that the South African Constitution was drafted based on a Bill of Rights
(Sarkin, 1999).
Now to consider the Articles that discussed freedom of expression
in the South African Constitution. In particular, the Bill of Rights protects
the right of freedom of expression by Section (16) of the Constitution with
an explanation of what is specifically included under this right. Section
(16) of the Constitution states:
(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes (a) freedom of the press and other media;
(b) freedom to receive or impart information or ideas;
(c) freedom of artistic creativity; and
(d) academic freedom and freedom of scientific research.
(2) The right in subSection (1) does not extend to – restrictions

176

(a) propaganda for war;
(b) incitement of imminent violence; or
(c) advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion,
and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.
It is important to mention that the right of freedom of religion is not
included under Section (16); instead, Section (15) of the Constitution states
“Freedom of religion, belief and opinion.-(1) everyone has the right to
freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion”
4.2.1.2 Historical background of the Kuwaiti Constitution
Likewise, the Kuwait Constitution has been through several
processes to be lastly drafted in 1962. However, the history of the attempts
of drafting the Kuwaiti Constitution began before the independence of
Kuwait. In 1899 Kuwait was under a protectorate agreement with Britain
which led to Kuwait to lose its sovereignty in and become becoming a
protected Emirate. But due to the increased political awareness among
Kuwaiti citizens the political reform movement started in 1921. The 1921
movement resulted in the establishment of the first consultative body

177

which dissolved swiftly. The second movement in 1936 was better the first
since it resulted in the formation of the first legislative council. However,
because of Britain’s resistance for these movements, the second attempt
did not last long. Afterword, the Kuwaiti economic condition improved
because of the discovery of oil in 1946. The economic change led to the
establishment of administration. More importantly, in 1959 the law of
judiciary regulation and legislative law were formulated. In essence, on
June 19 1961 the period of transition occurred, when British colonization
ended on 29 January 1963 and Kuwait achieved its independence. Hence,
in 1963 the Kuwaiti Constitution was implemented (Hussain, 2010).
More specifically, as discussed by Tetreault (2000), the history of
the Kuwaiti Constitution goes back to the late 30s. As stated by Tetreault
(2000) “the 1962 Constitution was not the first document of its kind in
Kuwait. Its antecedent was a charter written in 1938 by a small group of
merchants who had more more-or-less elected themselves to be the first
Kuwaiti parliament” (p.62). On the other hand, the 1938 Constitution was
drafted based on the Islamic laws (Almoqatei, 1989).

The Kuwaiti

merchants submitted the following document to their Amir asking him to

178

establish a political system according to Islamic principles. The document
states:

“The basis upon which the people swore fealty to you from the first day of your rule was
their participation in the reign, through the requirement that they be consulted according
to the Islamic principle in this matter, which was followed by Khalifs. However, because
of heedlessness on both sides this important basis was forgotten. For that reason and
because of these circumstances, loyal persons among your people are motivated to advise
you to reform royal affairs by establishing a Legislative Council formed from people to
supervise the affairs of state, and regulate its foundation. For this reason we delegate the
conveyor of this document to negotiate this matter with you” (AlMoqatei, 1989, p.140).

Later, the new Kuwaiti Constitution started with the first draft
which was approved on November 1, 1962 by the Amir, Sheikh Abdallah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah (Khedr, 2010). The new Constitution was officially
published in the newspaper on November 12, 1962 and became valid on
January 29, 1963 (Hussain, 2010). Though, as claimed by Hussain (2010)
“Constitution al legislator tried to balance the Constitution characteristics
by emphasizing the Islamic notion in the Constitution to be compatible
with the Islamic Shari’a law and with the Universal Declaration of Human

179

Rights” (p.130). Unsurprisingly, like any other developed country, the
Kuwaiti legal system is based on its Constitution (Albaharna, p. 20).

In fairness, however, the foundation of the Constitution is based on
the principles of democracy - on the sovereignty of the nation, freedom of
the citizens and on equality of all citizens in front of the law (Abdullah,
2006). By analogy, Sharia (Islamic laws) has had an undeniable impact on
the Constitution. As Aseri (1990) discussed that “Article (2) of the Kuwaiti
Constitution ensures Sharia’s impact by announcing that the official
religion of the country is Islam” (p. 229). Conversely, some legal experts
argue that the Kuwaiti Constitution is open and protects many freedoms
(Alhajeri, 2013). Therefore, the Kuwaiti Constitution based on a few
number of studies is partially liberal and does not completely depend on
Islamic laws (Alhajeri, 2013).
More significantly, Kuwait is like any other Islamic country when it
comes to the influences of Sharia on its Constitution - most of the
provisions of their Constitutions are actually influenced by Western
models. At the same time the provisions of their Constitutions fit within
the teachings of the Quran and the sunna (Kamali 1997, p. 260).

180

4.2.1.2.1 Freedom of expression of the Kuwaiti Constitution
Similar to South Africa, the Kuwaiti Constitution protects freedom
of expression under a number of provisions; such as Article (30), Article
(35), Article (36), Article (37), and Article (39) (Constitution of Kuwait,
1961). As stated in the Constitution:
Article (30)
Personal liberty is guaranteed
Article (35)
Freedom of belief is absolute. The State protects the freedom of practicing
religion in accordance with established customs, provided that it does not
conflict with public policy or morals3.
Article (36)
Freedom of opinion and of scientific research shall be guaranteed. Every
person shall have the right to express and propagate his opinion verbally,
3

As Aldhaferi define it “Incitement to commit a crime or a criminal act, for example, the call for
civil disobedience or debauchery and porn.” and as Ghanam and Alkandari (1998) discussed that
moral is what people are accustomed to live through it as a way of life and customs, social and
religious life, a belief that the concepts embedded in a particular time and place and this concept is
the evolution and variation of time to time and from place to another place.

181

in writing or otherwise, in accordance with the conditions and procedures
specified by law.
Article (37)
Freedom of the press, printing and publishing shall be guaranteed in
accordance with the conditions and manner specified by law.
Article (39)
Freedom of communication by post, telegraph, and telephone and the
secrecy thereof shall be guaranteed; accordingly censorship of
communications and disclosure of their contents shall not be permitted
except in the circumstances and manner specified by law.
An investigation of those Articles which address different
Constitution al freedoms illustrates that freedom of expression is
theoretically protected in Kuwait but vaguely defined. For example,
Article (37) clearly states that “freedom of the press, printing and
publishing shall be guaranteed in accordance with the conditions and
manner specific by law” (Kuwait Constitution, 1962).

182

The specific laws are those laws that are promulgated by the
Kuwaiti Parliament such as the Penal Code and publications law.4 A more
comprehensive Article is number Article (30) of the Constitution states
“personal liberty is guaranteed.”
At first blush, (30) seems to be very comprehensive though as noted
above, there are some Articles that restrict the right of freedom of
expression, such as Article (37) of the Constitution. Parallel to Article (37)
is Article (35) which declares “freedom of belief is absolute. The State
protects the freedom of practicing religion in accordance with established
customs, provided that it does not conflict with public policy or morals”.
Apparently, a reading of Article (35) reveals that it guarantees freedom of
belief as one aspect of freedom of expression but with some restrictions.
This makes clear that freedom of expression is protected in the Kuwaiti
Constitution but restricted by several laws.

The “conditions and procedures specified by law are detailed in Kuwait's Printing and
Publications Law and Penal Code which include criminal punishments for a variety of vaguely
worded offenses, and provisions for prior censorship. For example, direct criticism of the Amir or
of relations with other states; material deemed offensive to religion; incitement to violence, hatred,
or dissent; or news that "affects the value of the national currency" are punishable by
imprisonment and/or fines. The provisions restricting expression in the Kuwaiti Penal Code
16/1960 are similar to those in the Printing and Publications Law but provide for harsher
Penalties.
4

183

In effect, Article (36) enunciates that “freedom of opinion and of
scientific research shall be guaranteed. Every person shall have the right
to express and propagate his opinion verbally, in writing or otherwise, in
accordance with the conditions and procedures specified by law.” Again,
freedom of opinion as a major aspect of freedom of expression is also
protected by the Kuwaiti Constitution in accordance with certain laws.
Moreover, Article (39) governs cases where technological communication
arises. Specifically, Article (39) declares that “freedom of communication
by post, telegraph and telephone and the secrecy thereof shall be
guaranteed; accordingly censorship of communications and disclosure of
their contents shall not be permitted except in the circumstances and
manner specified by law.”
It is worth stressing here that all freedom of expression provisions
in the Kuwaiti Constitution indicates to the fact that the Kuwaiti
Constitution appreciates freedoms. Yet, freedom of expression in the
Kuwaiti Constitution is not absolute and is restricted by laws as will
appear from what follow.

184

4.2.1.3 Comparison
In comparing the notion of freedom of expression within the two
legal systems, I found some differences and similarities as well. Starting
with the historical background of the Constitutions, the Constitutions of
South Africa and Kuwait play a very important role in the protection of
the individual’s fundamental rights. These rights are protected in the
South African and Kuwaiti Constitutions as basics rights but are somehow
restricted for either security or moral reasons. In fairness, however,
freedom of expression as a right has been covered and guaranteed in the
South African and Kuwaiti Constitutions.
From the foregoing background of the South African and Kuwaiti
Constitutions, various points of convergence and divergence between the
two Constitutions arose.
In comparing the history of the Constitutions of both countries;
several differences and similarities were found. Historically speaking,
South Africa went through a difficult political era when freedoms were
suppressed. Specifically, during the apartheid era, whites controlled
freedoms including freedom of expression. Eventually, South Africans’

185

awareness of freedom of expression increased and the political system
became democratic in 1993. At this period of time, in 1993, the new
Constitution was drafted and a Bill of Rights was added to it. The amount
of freedom of expression in the progressive South African Constitution
continued to increase until 1996 when democratic values and fundamental
human rights were fully protected.
In more exact terms, the political instability and the lack of
freedoms in South Africa during the era of apartheid led to opposing
reactions from the citizens and the law–makers who drafted the
Constitution later. The continuous striving of the South African citizens to
obtain their freedoms was crucial motivation for the law-makers and the
authorities to draft a Constitution where freedom of expression and other
freedoms were completely guaranteed. Likewise, the study showed that
Kuwait went through political environments that had an impact on the
process of drafting the Kuwaiti Constitution. Politically speaking, the
British protection agreement was considered to be an obstacle in front of
drafting the Kuwaiti Constitution. Yet, that does not deny the fact that the
attempts to draft the Constitution started before the Independence Day of

186

Kuwait. Repeatedly, the Constitution was drafted to protect freedoms
under the religious umbrella. As noted earlier, the 1962 Kuwaiti
Constitution was not the first of its kind. Its originator was a charter
written in 1938 by the elite (aka, merchants) who had elected themselves
as the first Kuwaiti Parliament (Tetreault, 2000). In particular, since the
Kuwaiti initiators asked their Amir to

draft

the Constitution

and

establish a political system according to Islamic principles, the nature of
the 1938 Constitution was influenced by the Islamic rules

(Almoqatei

1989). The previous fact does not deny that freedom of expression and
other freedoms were protected in the final Kuwaiti Constitution of 1962.
It is hardly surprising that the fundamental changes in the Kuwaiti
Constitution started after the country declared independence from the
British and were no longer a British colony. After the British colony, in the
1962 Constitution all freedoms including freedom of expression were
guaranteed.

But the influence of the Islamic rules was continuous

especially that the Article (2) 5of the Kuwaiti Constitution asserts that
Sharia is a main resource of laws and this gives the Kuwaiti legislators the
Article 2 [State Religion] The religion of the State is Islam, and the Islamic Sharia shall
be a main source of legislation.
5

187

trust of taking from Sharia whenever it is possible (Aseri 1990, p. 229).
However, the 1962 Constitution was drafted in the beginning of a
democratic era in Kuwait when authorities’ and citizens’ awareness of
freedom of expression was notably increased.
Compared to the history of the South African Constitution, the
Kuwaiti Constitution was drafted in a more stable political environment.
The situation in South Africa is different especially with the apartheid
where all freedoms were suppressed. Oppositely, in spite of the fact that
Kuwait was a British colony the history did not witness suppression of
freedoms in Kuwait at that time. Alternatively, the attempts of drafting
the Kuwaiti Constitution started during the colony period, specifically, in
1938. Nevertheless, the notion of freedom and democracy was completely
enhanced and spread after Kuwait was no longer a British colony,
whereas in South Africa the political elites during the apartheid era
precluded freedoms in South Africa.

Given the historical heritage of

apartheid and the struggle against apartheid, racial segregation during
apartheid led to continuous tension and conflict in the political process.

188

At the same time, white and black people were separated on all levels
especially at the economic and political levels.
A posteriori, the difference between the historical background of
drafting the South African and Kuwaiti Constitution is significant. Briefly,
the political environment in South Africa was less stable than in Kuwait
when attempts of drafting the respective Constitutions began. Also, the
Kuwaiti Constitution was impacted by Islamic rules while there was no
religious impact on the South African Constitution.
As will be shown momentarily, the similarity between the
Constitutions concentrated in freedom of expressions’ Articles. Still, that
does not deny that there are some minor differences between the Articles
of the Constitutions. In particular, I examined the Articles that discuss
freedom of expression in both Constitutions. As a result, I found that both
Constitutions protect freedom of expression in accordance with some
limitations. In particular, rights that are protected in both Constitutions
are freedom of opinion, religion, belief, publications. The main different
between the two Constitutions is that Kuwaiti Constitutions does not
mention freedom of receive and impart information.

189

Significant similarities were found in regard to guaranteeing the
right of freedom of expression in both countries’ Constitutions. Thus far, I
have presented the Articles of the South African and Kuwaiti
Constitutions that discuss the right of freedom of expression. Accordingly
it is notable that both Constitutions protect the Articles of freedom of
expression in accordance to different restrictions. The slight different
between the Articles of freedom of expression in both Constitutions is
related to the presentation and wording of the Articles and its restrictions.
More distinctively, the right of freedom of expression in the South African
Constitution is stated and explained under one section. Section (16) in the
South African Constitution is where the right of freedom of expression is
explained. This section explains that the protection of the right of freedom
of expression for everyone includes several rights, whereas, the right of
freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution is discussed in six
provisions; Article (30), Article (35), Article (36), Article (37) and Article
(39). Accordingly, each of the above mentioned Articles of the Kuwaiti
Constitution stated a specific right, except Article (30) which is considered
very broad as it protects the personal liberty in general. However, the only

190

subject that has not been clearly stated in the Kuwaiti Constitution is the
protection of the right to receive and impart information.
At the same time, in the South African Constitution , the protection
of the right of freedom of belief is not included under freedom of
expression Section (16); instead, the right of freedom of belief, religion and
opinion, is stated under Section (15).

To be more specific, in both

Constitutions similar subjects are guaranteed that are considered to
protect the right of freedom of expression; namely freedom of media,
press, opinion, belief, religion, scientific research, and freedom of
information.
In regard to the limitations, the South African Constitution
specified those limitations as not to express anything that might
negatively impact social security. Thus, it is not allowed to provoke
discrimination through any kind of expression. In regard to Kuwait as
Islamic, limitations on freedom of expression are different than those in
South Africa. The only similarity between the two countries limitation is
that both disallowed threating the national security by any kind of
expression. Again, the limitations in Kuwait are more influenced by

191

Islamic rules. For more clarification, freedom of opinion is guaranteed in
the Kuwaiti Constitution, at the same time, it is forbidden to criticize the
Amir or to express any offensive opinion about religious symbols (i.e.,
Prophet Mohammed and his wives).
Taken as whole, the restrictions on the right of freedom of
expression, the difference between the two Constitutions is that the South
African Constitution literally states what the certain restrictions are, while
the Kuwaiti Constitution states only general terms to indicate the
restrictions. Explaining the latter in more detail, the South African
Constitution enacts the restrictions as follows;
(2) The right in subsection (1) does not extend to – restrictions
(a) propaganda for war;
(b) incitement of imminent violence; or
(c) advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion,
and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.
On the other hand, the restrictions in the Kuwaiti Constitution are
stated differently. For instance, the freedom of opinion is guaranteed in

192

accordance with the conditions and producers specified law. Moreover,
freedom of belief is protected without the conflict with public policy and
morals. Explanations of the restrictions is stated and explained clearly in
the explanatory memorandum 6of the Kuwaiti Constitution. Again, both
Constitutions protect the right of freedom of expression using different
words. Though, wording of the provisions did not lead to fundamental
differences.
To sum up, the study shows that the Articles of freedom of expression
in the Constitutions of South Africa and Kuwait are conceptually similar,
but there are only slight differences. The points of convergence revealed
by this study include:


The Constitution is the supreme law of the land in both countries.



The right to freedom of expression is not absolute and is subject to
restrictions

The traditional concept of this explanatory memorandum is that it illustrates the meaning of the
text in the Constitution and what the legislator meant by it. It clarifies matters not mentioned in the
texts and interprets certain wording that might lead to a different interpretation of the text.
6

193



Freedom of the press is included in the right to freedom of
expression



Both Constitutions drafted the Articles of freedom of expression
based on the Human Rights Declaration

7

The points of divergence as revealed by this study include:


Freedom to receive and impart information is explicitly protected
in the South African Constitution whereas it is not stated in the
Kuwaiti Constitution .



Freedom of expression is limited in both Constitutions with
restrictions stipulated either in the Constitution like South Africa,
or in an explanatory memorandum as in Kuwait.



In South Africa, the right to freedom of religion is explicitly
protected as a separate right, whereas in Kuwait freedom of
religion is also protected as separate right but it is not explicitly
explained.
4.2.2 Implementation of freedom of expression legislations

7

See Chapter three—Literature Review

194

This section is a discussion of legislation impacting the right to
freedom and the practical issues surrounding the protection of the right
by the relevant authorities. As noted previously, the second criterion is to
compare the implementations of freedom of expression by evaluating
some censorship legislations that issued by either ministries or
parliaments. Accordingly, the legislations are evaluated to determine the
strength of the limitations that control the right to freely express opinions,
write, and read.
More importantly, I discuss the nature of rational of the regulations
and I compare the nations’ regulation in order to discover the influence of
these regulations.
Lastly, since the Internet significantly impacts access and
expression of information, it is central to look at the Internet regulations
and the motives behind issuing such regulations. As claimed by Balkin
(2004) “Freedom of speech is rapidly becoming the key site for struggles
over the legal and Constitution al protection of capital in the information
age, and these conflicts will shape the legal definition of freedom of
speech” (p.3).

195

It is expected that the regulations in South Africa and Kuwait have
different titles due to their differing histories.

Nonetheless, the

regulations in both countries; South Africa and Kuwait were issued in
countries where legal systems protect freedom of expression as a basic
right.
This section will start with presenting each country’s regulations
separately followed by the final comparison.
4.2.2.1 Regulations of freedom of expression in South Africa
As mentioned several times in this research, the South African
Constitution has a Bill of Rights. Within the Bill of Rights the right of
freedom of expression is guaranteed by Section (16) of the Constitution .
In connection, there are also legislations in South Africa that directly and
indirectly impact the right to freedom of expression (Ndwana, 2008).
These include among others: the Films and Publications Act No, 65 of
1996, Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act,
and the protection of state information bill. Each has different objects and
interpretation of restricting freedom of speech.

196

Thus far, the purpose of this chapter is to present only certain
regulations and proclamations issued in South Africa. These regulations
ought therefore to be applicable to regulate media and press for specific
reasons. It should be recognized that some regulations, especially those
that regulate the speech on the Internet, would be extensively curtailed
freedoms (Freedom House Report, 2012).
Meanwhile, based on the Freedom House latest reports (2012) and
(2013), most of the regulations issued are in line with the restrictions
written in the South African Constitution . 8
To great degree, there is high level of freedom of speech, press, and
Internet in South Africa in which few of restrictions were issued. The
government does not restrict political content of the Internet and there are

197

not any cases of prosecuting bloggers or Internet users for online activities
(Freedom House, 2009). However, there was concern that practicing free
media may result in defamation cases and therefore free speech may be
limited (Freedom House, 2009). Additionally, some political officials and
government, on the other hand, condemned journalists for the failure of
practicing their job professionally. In reaction to media criticism the
government has sharply accused journalists of racism and disloyalty.
Consequently, government actions resulted in media self-censorship
(House freedom, 2011).
More complexly, the fears were increased in regard to some
controversial content in which may be restricted. In particularly, as argued
by Chetty and Basson (2006) that after the Internet became crucial sources
of information and substituting school libraries “more and more children
will be exposed to risk of exposure to objectionable materials” (p.3). For
instance, children might be under psychological trouble by “exposure to
potentially disturbing, harmful and age-inappropriate materials on the
Internet” (Chetty and Basson 2006, p. 3).

198

As a result the Film and Publications Act of 1996 was established; it will
be discussed momentarily along with other actions.
4.2.2.1.1 Film and Publications Act of 1996
The Film and Publications Act of 1996 (See Appendix A) main
object is to censor pornography in the publications and online forum
(Freedom House, 2011). More distinctively, the Act makes a provision to
ban child pornography (See Appendix A). On this account, a concern was
raised that the law of censoring pornography might be used to restrict
other types of online content (Freedom House, 2009).

For more

illustration, the amendment of the Film and Publications Act of 1996
obliges online publication that is not a considered to be a newspaper to be
presented to the classification to the government-controlled Film and
Publications Board if the work includes representations of “sexual
conduct which violates or shows disrespect for the right to dignity of any
person, degrades a

person, or constitutes incitement to cause harm;

advocates propaganda for war; incites

violence; or advocates hatred

based on any identifiable group characteristic and that constitutes
incitement to cause harm.”

199

In a nutshell, as claimed by Nel (2004) “the aim of this Act, in its
present form, is to allow adults the maximum amount of freedom, while
simultaneously protecting children against material that is harmful. Its
Constitution ality has not been examined by the Constitution al Court” (p.
217).
In terms of Section (2) of the Film and Publication 9Act the object of
this act is to
to regulate the distribution of certain publications and the exhibition and
distribution of certain films, in the main by means of classification, the
imposition of age restrictions and the giving of consumer advice, due
regard being had to the fundamental rights enshrined

A “publication” is defined in the above Act, among others,
(i)

any message or communication, including a visual presentation,
placed on any distributed network including, but not limited to
the Internet. 10

Additionally, a “visual presentation” is described as

10

Act No. 65 of 1996

200

(a) a drawing, picture, illustration, paining, photography or image; or
(b) a drawing, picture, illustration, painting, photography or image or
any combination of thereof, produced through or by means of
computer software on a screen or a computer printout.11
Despite that exemptions were given to artistic and science speech,
the board has the right to allow or deny these exemptions (House
Freedom, 2011).
As posited by Nel (2004) “the prohibition on the possession of the
child pornography shall not extend to bona fide scientific, documentary or
literary publications” (p. 218).
In addition to the prohibition of pornography, the Act No.65 of 1996 also
issued regulations for hate speech. In terms of Section 29 (1) Any person
who knowingly distributes a publication which, judged within context:12

(a) Amounts to propaganda for war; (b) incites to imminent violence; or
(c) advocates hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion,

11
12

Section 1 Act No. 65 of 1996

201

and which constitutes incitement to cause harm, shall be guilty of an
offence
4.2.2.1.2 Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination
Act 2000
Another act that played role in the legal atmosphere of restricting
freedom is the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act 2000. The main purpose of the act is to
“give effect to Section (9) read with item 23(1) of Schedule 6 to the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, so as to prevent and
prohibit unfair discrimination and harassment; to promote equality and
eliminate unfair discrimination; to prevent and prohibit hate speech; and
to provide for matters connected there with” (the REPUBLIC OF SOUTH
AFRICA GOVERNMENT GAZETTTE No. 20876, 2000). On the other
hand, there are several objects in the act, though under this section I will
discuss only the relevance to this chapter. Some of the objects of the act as
stated

in

the

REPUBLIC

OF

SOUTH

GAZETTTE No. 20876 are: (See Appendix B).
The objects of this Act are—

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
Chapter two of the GAZZETTE has presented in detail the meaning of
hate speech and discrimination.
4.2.2.1.3 Protection of State Information Bill
The third and last act to be conferred under this section is the
Protection of State Information Bill. The main aim of the act is “to provide
for the protection of sensitive state information; to provide for a system of
classiﬁcation, reclassiﬁcation and declassiﬁcation of state information; to
provide for the protection of certain valuable state information against

205

alteration, destruction or loss or unlawful disclosure; to regulate the
manner in which state information may be protected; to repeal the
Protection of Information Act, 1982 (Act No. 84 of 1982); and to provide
formatters connected therewith” (REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
GOVERNMENT GAZETTTE No. 32999, 2010). For more clarification, the
object of the Protection of State Information Act, 1982 is “to provide for
the protection from disclosure of certain information; and to provide for
matters connected therewith” (the Protection of Information Act, 1982) 13
Putting the above in other words, the bill primly aims to certify that
the right of access to any information held by the state may be restricted
for the reasons of national security. The bill also guarantees that the state
information will be protected within a justifiable legislative framework.
Lastly, the bill encourages the free ﬂow of information within an open and
democratic society with the protection the national security of the
Republic (Ad Hoc Committee on Protection of Information Bill (National
Assembly) introduced as Protection of Information Bill [B 6—2010]).

(Act No. 84 of 1982): http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1982-084.pdf

Similar to the above two acts, the Protection of State Information
Bill has plenty of objects but limited ones will be examined under this
section. The objects of the bill as stated in the REPUBLIC OF SOUTH
AFRICA GOVERNMENT GAZETTTE No. 32999 are as follows:
Objects of Act
2. The objects of this Act are to—
(a) regulate the manner in which state information may be protected;
(b) promote transparency and accountability in governance while
recognizing that state information may be protected from disclosure in
order to safeguard the national security of the Republic;
(c) establish general principles in terms of which state information may be
made
available or accessible or protected in a Constitution al democracy;
(d) provide for a thorough and methodical approach to the determination
of which
state information may be protected

207

(e) provide a regulatory framework in terms of which protected state
information
is safeguarded in terms of this Act;
(f) describe the nature and categories of state information that may be
protected
from alteration, destruction, loss or unlawful disclosure;
(g) regulate the conditions for classiﬁcation and the declassiﬁcation of
classiﬁed
information;
(h) create a system for the review of the status of classiﬁed information by
way of
regular reviews and requests for access to classiﬁed information and
status
review;
(i) regulate the accessibility of declassiﬁed information to the public;

208

(j) establish a Classiﬁcation Review Panel to review and oversee status
review,
classiﬁcation and declassiﬁcation procedures;
(k) criminalize espionage and activities hostile to the Republic and
provide for
certain other offences and Penalties; and
(l) repeal the Protection of Information Act, 1982 (Act No. 84 of 1982)
Sequel to the above, the South African Acts restrict freedom of
expression. Each of the selected Acts has its own motives and rationale to
limit freedom of expression, hereto; acts are aimed to protect the society
and the national interest. First of all, the Films and Publications Act of
1996 is mainly to avert the use and dissemination of pornography.
Secondly, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act 2000 issued regulations to guarantee the prevention
and general prohibition of unfair discrimination. As clarified under this
section state and any person may unfairly discriminate against any

209

person. More intensively, the act assures the prohibition of hate speech.
Accordingly, the document stated in chapter (2), the following:
10. (1) Subject to the proviso in Section 12. No person may publish,
propagate, advocate or communicate words based on one or more of the
prohibited grounds, against any person, that could reasonably be
construed to demonstrate a clear intention to
(a) be hurtful;
(b) be harmful or to incite harm;
(c) promote or propagate hatred
Prohibited grounds.’ are—
(a) race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin,
color, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief,
culture. Language, or birth; or
(b) any other ground where discrimination based on that other ground—
(i) causes or perpetuates systemic disadvantage:(ii) undermines human
dignity; or(iii) adversely affects the equal enjoyment of a person’s rights

210

and freedoms in a serious manner that is comparable to discrimination on
a ground in paragraph (a);
Thirdly, like the above two acts the Protection of State Information
Bill, 2010 is also aims to guarantee the right of access to any information
held by the State may be restricted for the reasons of national security
without compromising the national security. Accordingly, the state would
classify the information 14is justifiable only when it is necessary to protect
national security. As stated chapter (5) of the bill: (See Appendix C for the
rest of the clauses (d), (e), (f), and (g) )
3) Speciﬁc considerations with regard to the decision whether to
classify state information must include whether the disclosure may—
(a) expose the identity of a conﬁdential source, or reveal information
about the application of an intelligence or police source when the
unlawful disclosure of that source would clearly and demonstrably

14

Classification of information means to decide the degree of confidentiality is the information;
might be top secret, secret, and confidential

211

damage the national security of the Republic or the interests of the source
or his or her family;
(b) clearly and demonstrably impair the ability of government to
protect officials or persons for whom protection services, in the
interest of the national security, are authorized;
(c) seriously and substantially impair the national security, defense
or intelligence systems, plans or activities;
In short, in regard to the rationale behind the restrictions of
freedom of expression of the above three acts is primarily protecting
national security, prohibiting the dissemination of child pornography, and
preventing discrimination. Thereafter, the general purpose of the acts is to
protect the security and the morality of the South African society.
4.2.2.2 Regulations of freedom of expression in Kuwait
Similar to South Africa, the Kuwaiti Constitution protects freedom
of expression and press but limits them by some restrictions. As stated in a

212

report by Freedom House (2012)

15that

“Freedoms of speech and the press

are protected under Articles 36 and 37 of the Constitution , but only "in
accordance with the conditions and in the circumstances defined by law.”
Turning to presenting the Kuwaiti legislation surrounding the
media, I should not lose sight of the fact that Kuwait is considered to be
the most open environment in the Middle East. At the same time, it is
expected that a conservative country like Kuwait would issue regulations
to protect the morality and security of the nation. As mentioned by
Human Rights Reports (2010), the Ministry of Communication has the
right to censor all films, books, and periodicals if considered morally
assaulting.
Looking at the Kuwaiti press, in 2010 the characteristics of the
Kuwaiti newspaper became more open than the broadcasting media. As
discussed in the Human Rights Reports (2010) that “more in-depth
reporting and a greater diversity of opinions appear in newspapers than
in broadcast media. Eventually, the amount of freedom in the atmosphere
Freedom of the Press 2012 – Kuwait: http://www.refworld.org/cgibin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&docid=50e1612b28&skip=0&query=internet%20regulation&c
oi=KWT
15

213

and the self-censorship led to violation by some journalists. Accordingly,
the situation opened the government’s eyes and increased its tolerance
toward the critical approach of the journalists who failed to practice selfcensorship as a privilege.
In addition to the restrictions in the Constitution , Kuwaiti
Parliament and Ministry of Communication (MOC) issued several
regulations to control and limit the freedom of media and press. For the
purpose of this chapter, three main regulations will be examined, namely;
Law NO. 3 of 2006 Concerning Press and Publication, Internet Policy 2002
No.70, and Kuwait Media Law 2013.
Historically speaking, the first law issued was the Press and
Publication Law No. 3 which was promulgated on January 26th 1961
(Alhajeri, 2010). As argued by Alhajeri (2010), the law was effective during
its period, thereafter, the technological development made the law
inadequate to organize the press and publication affairs within the
technological sphere. As a result, new laws were drafted in 2006,
particularly, Law NO. 3 of 2006 concerning Press and Publication, to make
the press and publication legislation effective with the new technological

214

development. Quoting Alhajeri 16(2010) on this point “henceforth, starting
from point and taking into account the expected development role of
media and publication in its all various fields, in order to bridge the gaps
of

the

legislative

development

organizing

the

same,

thus

the

accompanying law is drafted and prepared accordingly” (p. 2).
Prior to the invention of the Internet and during the effective era of
the usage of it, the public and journalists in Kuwait enjoyed greater
freedoms than did some of their counterparts in the Middle East region.
Due to the amount of freedom that Kuwaiti citizens enjoyed at the
technological level in the media and press sphere, regulations to restrict
media and press by the government increased. In May of 2000, the
Ministry of Communications (MOC) issued an Internet policy to restrict
the use of it. The issuing of the regulation was after a number of
incursions conducted by MOC on abundant of Internet cafes which allow
users to search through sites deemed immoral (a.k.a); anti-Islamic, Islamic
extremist, or pornographic, as well as certain types of political
websites.Hereafter, MOC issued Internet policy that compels the owners

16

215

of the Internet cafes to collect the names and civil identification numbers
of customers.
Due to the ease of communication and participation in all fields;
social, religious, and political caused by the emergence of the Internet,
Kuwaiti users of social networks eventually increased. Further, the
Kuwaiti local political situation was becoming more complicated in terms
of new election rules, the Amir, highest degree of corruption, and
increased number of rallies against the Amir and in support of human
rights, particularly, the situation of stateless people (Bidun)17. On the other
hand, parallel to the Kuwaiti political complication is the events in the
Middle East, specifically, the Arab Spring and its consequences.
Henceforward, the previous circumstances led to a number of violations
at the political and religious levels in Kuwait. For more clarification,
Kuwaitis began to noticeably participate in the political sphere through
social media; Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. Users started to cross their
limits by expressing their opinions against the Amir, Shi’a and Sunna, and
Kuwait’s Bidun population originates from three broad categories: 1) those whose
ancestors failed to apply for nationality or lacked necessary documentation at the time of
Kuwait’s independence in 1961; 2) those recruited to work in Kuwait’s army or police
force during the 1960s who permanently settled in Kuwait, along with their families; and
3) children of Kuwaiti mothers and stateless or foreign fathers.
17

216

Bidun as well. As a result, the authority conducted numerous
prosecutions and imprisoned people in jail. For instance; Mohamed Abdel
Qader al-Jassem18, the founding editor of the Arabic editions of Foreign
Policy and Newsweek was found guilty of criminal defamation and
sentenced to one year in prison in November 2010 and served 62 days in
prison. Another prosecutor was the online activist, Nasser Abul, who was
detained in 2011 for two months because he was convicted of criticizing
the Bahraini regime. After an uproar from international human rights
organizations, the accused was released

(Freedom House, 2012).

Moreover, an editor of the online Kuwaiti website al-Aaan Zayed al-Zaid
posted an Article

that criticized a former government minister and

because of it he was accused of defamation of a former government
minister and was accordingly sentenced to prison for a month (Committee
to Protect Journalists, 2013).

Saqr Alhashash is also one of the most

famous online activists. He was given a sentence by a lower court on
18

he was charged with "instigating to overthrow the regime," "slight to the personage of
the emir," and acting to "dismantle the foundations of Kuwaiti society." The charges
stemmed from Articles critical of the Kuwaiti government and the ruling al-Sabah family
that were published on his personal website. A court in Kuwait City acquitted the
journalist of all charges in September. Just two months later, however, al-Jassem had
been arrested again, this time on defamation charges related to coverage of the prime
minister. He was sentenced six months in prison for “slander” against the prime
minister. (committee to protect journalists –defending journalists worldwide)

217

charge of criticizing the Amir of Kuwait on his Twitter account.
Accordingly, a jail sentence of two years against blogger Saqr Al Hashash
was declared and later after his appeal, the sentence reduced to one year
(Gulfnews, 2013).
Henceforth, in 2013 MOC drafted new media law with stiffer
financial fines and punishments in order to control the conservative
society from the continuous chaos. It is important to stress that on April 8,
2013, MOC drafted Media Law with the intention to substitute both the
2006 Press and Publication Law and the 2007 Audio-Visual Media Law
(Human Rights Watch, 2013). Regulations are as follows:
4.2.2.2.1 Internet Policy 2002 No.(70)
Attention has been drawn to the fact that Kuwaitis enjoy the use of
the internet, where Kuwait was one of the first countries using the Internet
in academic life and among the public (Wheeler 2006, p. 41). As discussed
by Wheeler (2006) that with the emergence of the Internet Kuwaitis
concerned about misusing this technology. As a result of using the
Internet, new forms of communication arose, such as; those practices that
cross the limits of social, cultural, and religious norms (Wheeler 2006, p.

218

41). As a way of illustration, teenagers spend time in chatting-rooms,
where males and females can interact. This considered an immoral act.
Further, younger people started to violate some religious and moral
values by browsing through pornography and gambling websites (Abbas
as cited by Wheeler 2006, p.139).
The type of uses of the Internet by some younger Kuwaitis
eventually led to the drafting of the Internet policy. In spite of the fact that
some Internet service providers block certain sites, in May of 2002, the
MOC held on a number of Internet cafes on the charge of that they were
not blocking sites considered morally wrong by Islamic members of the
National Assembly (Freedom House, 2012). New policy by MOC was
drafted that obligated the owners of the Internet cafes to keep customers’
personal information, such as names and civil identification numbers
(Freedom House, 2012).
Sequence to the above, the MOC took serious actions to regulate
the Internet. For instance, internet service providers in Kuwait must install
and operate censorship systems to block certain websites such as the
following; pornographic, anti-religion, anti-tradition, or anti-security. In

219

addition to the websites, chat services, email, and others also have to be
blocked. Moreover, MOC has the authority to approve the effectiveness of
the used censorship systems and update them periodically (OpenNet
Initiative, 2009). The policy is divided into two sections. The first one is
directed to Internet cafes and the second section is directed to the Internet
Service Providers.
Section (1): regulations 19for Internet cafes:
1. Cabins (a small room-like box which allows only the user to see the
screen) are not allowed in the cafes.
2. Screens must not be covered by any means (i.e., barriers). Screens
must be located in open areas where its use can be easily
monitored.
3. There must be an Internet filtering system to filter some sites that
are related to sex pornography, anti-religion, anti-culture and social
norms, and anti-national security.

19

Internet Policy 2002 No.(70)

220

4. Users’ information such as names, telephone numbers, ID numbers,
addresses are required along with the time he/she logs on and off
the Internet.
5. National and international calls service is not included in Internet
cafes activity and is not allowed.
6. No Internet service is provided to any user under the age of
eighteen.
7.

Internet cafes are responsible for any financial cost of the filtering
system.

8. The MOC permission certificate must be shown for the users.
9. No Internet services shall be provided out of the café.
Internet service must be from MOC identified and legalized Internet
Service Providers
Section (1): restrictions for Internet services providers

221

1. There must be an Internet filtering system in place to filter some
sites that are related to sex pornography, anti-religion, anti-culture
and social norms, and anti-national security.
2. No Internet services for cafes that do not have a MOC issued legal
license.
3. Monthly financial reports must be submitted to the MOC along
with subscription receipts.
Punishments for any violation of either section are of a financial nature
only. Fines for the cafes range from 2000 KD to 10000 KD. While for the
providers is ranging higher from 10000 KD ($30000) to 50000 ($150000)
KD.
In essence, the Kuwaiti Internet policy was a result of users’
religious and social violations and practices through the use of the
Internet. The primary consequence of the chaos of using the Internet by
some younger Kuwaitis was the drafting of the Internet policies to protect
the morality of the society. These policies limit freedom of speech.

222

4.2.2.2.2 Press and publication law of 2006 the Law No. (3)
As noted previously, the Press and Publication law of 2006 was
drafted to revoke the Press and Publication Law No. (3) of 1961.
Accordingly, as stated in Press and Publication Law of 2006 Law No. (3)
Article (32)20 that “the Law No. (3) of 1961 promulgating the Press Law
shall be repealed.”
The law was revised in 2006 and increased regulations that
considered a protection to the media. The new regulations strictly
prohibited the publications of any materials that insult and criticize God,
the prophets, or Islam). As Article (19) in 2006 law

21stipulates,

“It is

strictly prohibited to touch on the almighty Allah, the Holy Quran, the
Prophets, the Righteous Companions, Prophet's Wives or Prophet's
Kinsfolk by way of insinuation, defamation, sarcasm, contempt, or by any

other manner of expression stipulated in Article (29) of the Law No. (31)
of 1970 amending certain provisions of the Penal Code No. (16) of 1960.”
Furthermore, the regulations forbid criticizing the Amir of Kuwait
the disclosure of secret or private information. It is also rigorously
forbidden to call for overthrow of the regime. As enacted in Article (20) in
2006 law that “It is strictly prohibited to deal with the personality of the
Amir of Kuwait in any critical behavior and no statement should be
attributed to him unless a special permission from the Amiri Diwan is
issued in this respect.”
More significantly, the law gives the right to any citizens to file
criminal charges against any author who they think has infringed the
Press law. On the other hand, under the 2006 amendment the Penalties
were increased, especially for criticizing Islam. The punishment may
extend to prison sentencing of more than a year and financial fines of up
to 20,000 dinars ($72,000) (Freedom House, 2011).
Without embarking upon a detailed analysis of all of the Articles of
2006 Press and Publications Law, below is one of the most important

224

Articles that exhaustively explain all the prohibitions in regard to the
publication of materials is Article (21).
As Article (21) in 2006 Law prescribes 22
“The publication of any of the following shall be prohibited:1. Any degradation or contempt to the Constitution of the State.
Any humiliation or degradation to the judiciary system, public
prosecutors or anything deemed to constitute violation to the fairness and
impartiality of the judiciary or its neutrality or to what is deemed to be
confidential by the courts or investigation authorities.
3. Any violation to public morals 23or any investigation to violate the
public order or contravention to the laws or committing crimes even if it
does not take place.

5. Any effect to the value of the national currency or any act that may
affect the confidence in the economic situation of the country or news on
the bankruptcy of merchants, trading companies, banks or exchanges
unless a special permission is issued by the competent court.
6. Disclosing the minutes of any meeting or any contents of any document,
papers, or printings decided to be confidential and not for publication
under the Constitution or by the law, even if what has been published
about them is right and correct. The publication should be limited to the
official statements in this respect.
7. Touching the integrity of persons or their lives, or religious beliefs as
well as encouraging hatred or degradation to any class of the society or
publishing any information in their financial situations, or disclosing a
secret which may impair their reputations, or disclosing a secret which my

226

8. Touching the private life of the employee or whoever entrusted by a
public service or attributing any incorrect statements or acts to him which
entail any defamation or contempt to his character.
9. Causing damages to the established relations between Kuwait and other
Arab or friendly countries if this is made through media campaigns.
10. Deviation by the specialized newspaper from the purpose for which
the license is issued”
4.2.2.2.3 New Media Law of 2013.
Reference has already been made to the essence of the new Media
law of 2013. The law consists of fifteen chapters in which chapter fourteen
explains all restrictions and punishments that control the users of social
media.
Generally speaking, the new social media rules were issued by the
MOC in April 2013. The law of social media was not drafted to target
social media, rather, the law sets out general guidelines on what is
prohibited in all media. However, social media in Kuwait is still not
categorized as a separate unit; therefore there is no specific or special law.

227

The law of 2013 was issued as a result of the chaos that happened in
Kuwaiti media, especially in social media such as Twitter and Facebook.
As public domain information-sharing media, Twitter and Facebook
enabled people to freely discuss several issues in Kuwait such as: the
Amir of Kuwait, government, and religion. Mainly, with social media
Kuwaiti people began to criticize these issues in a way that might be harsh
and socially unacceptable24. Social media gave Kuwaiti citizens a new
opportunity to cross the red lines in the political, social, and religious
aspects.
To some extent as argued by Human Right Watch (2013) that the
Kuwait Media Law of 2013 violates international standards protecting free
speech. Likewise, as discussed by the same report, the law allows MOC to
have extreme power to restrict freedom of expression (Human Rights
Watch, 2013).
The law of social media specified the prohibited topics as follows:

Amir of Kuwait and Islam are protected by Kuwaiti law- people cannot criticize, evaluate or
question them by any means. Article (54) [Head of State, Immunity, Inviolability] of the Kuwaiti
Constitution states the Amir is the Head of the State. His person is immune and inviolable.” This
was also explained the publication law of 2006 and the Media law of 2013.

4.2.2.3 Comparison
I investigated several legislative enactments in both countries in

order to understand the how freedom of expression was limited. To this
point, I have presented in the above section the regulations that control
freedom of expression in South Africa and portrayed Kuwaiti regulations.
One central theme that emerges in the above background about the
regulations in both South Africa and Kuwait is that the Internet has
changed the notion of freedom of expression. In other words, the Internet
gave people in both nations more freedom to participate in the political
arena and increased their involvement in the social sphere. At the same
time the increased amount of freedom led the violation of political and
social norms and the crossing of moral limits.

231

At this stage it seems appropriate to seek out the similarities and
differences between South Africa and Kuwait. Based on the above
background given the conservative nature of the Kuwaiti legal system and
the society as well, the base of the Kuwaiti regulations is unlike the South
African regulations. Several factors impacted the nature of the Kuwaiti
regulations such as cultural and religious norms, and these factors do not
exist in South Africa. An additional motive is the orthodoxy nature of the
Islamic rules. Therefore, religious influences are very notable in the
Kuwaiti regulations. For instance, a number of Kuwaiti regulations in the
three laws examined above protect religions, prophets, and religious
symbols. Further, several regulations prevent the access pornography and
gambling sites, as these two activities are totally forbidden in Islam. More
significantly, there are some regulations that severely warn the public not
to insult the Amir or even criticize him in any way (i.e., evaluating,
questioning, or commenting). It worth stressing that respecting the Amir
is compulsory by law and required by religion. 25

25

There are certain words (Hadith) by Prophet Mohammed to advise Muslims to obey and respect
their leaders unless they conduct something against Islam.

232

In addition to the latter, any expression through any media or
publication that is a threat to the national security is strictly disallowed.
The conclusion thus far is that the main purpose of the Kuwaiti
regulations is to protect national security and the societal morals.
Looking to South African regulations, one can notice the motives
behind issuing them are to protect national security by specifically
preventing any expression that provokes any racism or discrimination. In
this case, it seems fair to say that when issuing the regulations South
African authority considered the complicated political history of the
country. The authority realized how sensitive discrimination and racism
issues were, especially after the apartheid era. Hence, preventing such
type of expressions would guarantee the protection of security.

In

addition to protecting national security, regulations aim to monitor and
protect minors from accessing certain types of sites, such as pornography.
As discussed previously, the Film and Publications Act of 1996 defined
the meaning of pornography and specified number of punishments that
the guilty users may be sentenced to a fine or to imprisonment for a
period not exceeding five years (See Appendix A)

233

At the same time, there is a regulation in the Film and Publications Act of
1996 that bans publications that motivate hatred. Particularly, as stated
29. (1) Any person who knowingly distributes a publication which, judged
within context(c) advocates hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion,
and which constitutes incitement to cause harm, shall be guilty of an
offence.
In general, in comparison to Kuwait, South Africa has a similar set
of free expression guidelines. In terms of free expression, both countries’
Constitutions equally protect freedom of expression. At the same time,
both countries had a rationale behind issuing the regulations restricting
the right of freedom of expression. On the other hand, although Kuwait
has regulations influenced by religious rules (i.e., Islam), the motivation
for drafting regulations of restricting freedom of expression in both
countries have the same nature in terms of the purpose.
In more exact terms by issuing the regulations, both nations aimed
to protect the morality of the society and the national security. The

234

significant difference is that in the case of Kuwait, Islam as the official
religion of the country should also be protected. Thus, numerous of
regulations of freedom of expression in Kuwait prohibit the insulting of
Islam, prophets, his wives and the holy book.
Likewise, it is necessary to indicate under this section that Kuwait
is a conservative country (Wheeler, 1998), while South Africa is
considered to be fairly liberal. Equally, authorities in both countries seem
to realize that the regulations could decrease the individual freedom that
is protected by the Constitutions. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the
authorities in both countries prioritize national security and protection of
morals above freedom of expression.
In regard to freedom of the press, South Africa had a similar
situation as Kuwait in terms of authorities’ attempts to control the media
from displaying information of national security.
A good place to begin is looking at how the media in South Africa
and Kuwait are treated. Kuwaiti journalists are considered to be the freest
in the region; Kuwait is one of the very few Gulf States to respect
individual freedoms to the utmost (Alqudsi-habra, Al-Bannai, and Al-

235

Bahrani, 2011). In reverse, Kuwaiti authorities (i.e., ministries and
Parliament) prevent journalists from criticizing the Amir or writing freely
about Islam. Numerous journalists were arrested and imprisoned on the
charges of defaming the Amir or the prime minister, or even for alleged
offenses regarding religious sanctions. In view of that, publications laws
were issued in order to prevent the lack of respect for the highest
authorities and religion.
Like Kuwait, the press in South Africa is free as well and journalists
practice self-censorship. However, the South African government, as
mentioned previously, thinks that journalists are trying to degrade the
nation. The government thinks that white journalists are racists and black
journalists are disloyal to the country. Accordingly, regulations in regard
discrimination and hate speech were drafted Unfair Discrimination Act
and the protection of state information bill in order to prevent such
discrimination and racism.
From the foregoing discussion, I can conclude that the above legal and
technological policies are seemingly curtailing freedom of expression. In
spite of the fact that the core of the regulations in both nations aim to

236

protect the security and the morality of the society, the right freedom of
expression may be infringed by these regulations. In addition to infringing
the right of freedom of expression, by issuing such regulations, both
nations contradict the Articles of their Constitutions where the freedom of
expression is

protected.

One final point26, South Africa and Kuwait

signed Human Right (HR) conventions that protect freedom of speech,
though regulations of freedom of expression in both nations would
question the extent of their commitments to the HR conventions.
4.2.3 Application of freedom of expression: Case model
Undoubtedly, the judiciary plays pertinent role in democratic
nations. Yet, an effective judiciary must be independent to guarantee that
its purpose will not be defeated. Further, there must be rule of law so that
the judiciary can operate effectively.
In this section, two cases will be discussed to illustrate the role that the
judiciary has played in protecting the right to freedom of expression.
Further, the section provides a general analysis of cases by the South
African and Kuwaiti judiciary. Particularly, one case from each country

26

See Chapter Three “Literature Review” p. 41 and p.57

237

will be presented and compare to its counterpart.

A comparison will be

conducted between how the South African and Kuwaiti judiciary systems
have deal with freedom of expression. Among the issues raised in these
cases will be the remedies granted by the judiciary. Moreover, the
effectiveness of these remedies will be generally assessed. An important
question to be answered in this chapter; what did the court rely on when it
made its decisions? Specifically did the court consider the Constitution,
statute, regulation, other case law, other official documentation (report,
directive, etc.), comment or testimony, writing by a scholar, surrounded
social or political pressure in its decision?
This section presents one freedoms of expression case from South
Africa and other case from Kuwait. The comparison between the cases
demonstrates the similarities and differences of the two judiciary systems
and how each system deals with the right of freedom of expression.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the Constitution in both nations
considered to be the supreme law. More importantly, the right of freedom
of expression in both nations’ Constitution is guaranteed.

Without

embarking upon a detailed sketch of legal schema, the cases will be
compared with the intention to understand the way in which the legal

238

system operates particularly with regard to the protection of fundamental
human rights and freedoms.
Lastly, cases to be examined under this section were purposively
selected to serve the purpose of this chapter. Below I briefly describe the
two cases and some of the decisions passed by the judiciary and the
reasoning

behind

such

decisions.

These

cases

and

the

above

considerations will figure out if the South African and Kuwaiti courts are
instruments of freedom of expression policies or neutral and independent
arbiters of justice and upholders of fundamental rights and freedoms

4.2.3.1 Case model: CONSTITUTION AL COURT OF SOUTH
AFRICA-- Case CCT 36/01
THE ISLAMIC UNITY CONVENTION VS. THE INDEPENDENT
BROADCASTING AUTHORITY
Post-Apartheid, a new political era of South Africa witnessed a
high protection of all freedoms including the freedom of expression. The
public began to practice their freedom of expression, a right guaranteed
by the South African Constitution. In spite of citizens enjoying freedoms

239

some people violated the legal lines of freedom of expression. The
authority found that this violation negatively impacted national security
and social unity.

Several legal cases in regard to racism and

discrimination within press and media sphere appeared in South Africa’s
society.
The case which will be presented discussed the Islamic Unity v
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IUC) case.27 The events of the case
began on May 8, 1998 when the historian Dr. Yaqub Zaki was interviewed
in a program on a public broadcast on radio 786. The program was run by
the Islamic Unity Convention (IUC) --under a broadcasting license issued
by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (the IBA).
During the program entitled “Zionism and Israel: An in-depth
analysis” Dr. Zaki discussed the historical, political, social, and economic
factors which he believed were relevant to the establishment of the state of
Israel. In particular what agitated the case was Dr. Zaki’s analysis where
he mentioned that that “only one million Jews had died during the

Islamic Unity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority and Others (CCT36/01) [2002]
ZACC 3; 2002 (4) SA 294; 2002 (5) BCLR 433 (11 April 2002)- Case CCT 36/01
27

240

holocaust and these had died due to infectious diseases rather than being
gassed” (Ndwana 2008, p. 247).
Consequently, because of Dr. Zaki’s analysis, following the
broadcast, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies (the Board), settled
a formal complaint with the Head: Monitoring and Complaints Unit. In
more detail, the South African Board of Jewish Deputies issued a
complaint claiming that Radio 786 had violated clause 2 (a) of the Code of
Conduct for Broadcasting Services. In particular, this section provided
that broadcasting licensees was not allowed broadcasting material ‘which
was likely to prejudice relations between sections of the population.”28
The IUC defending itself by explaining that this section was
unbalanced with the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed in the
Constitution , and hence the clause was unsound. Particularly, as literally
mentioned in the explanatory note

29that

“before a formal enquiry could

be held to deal with the complaint, the IUC launched proceedings in the
High Court challenging the validity of the decision to hold the enquiry as
well as the Constitution ality of the relevant provision of the Code,
28

Schedule 1 of the IBA Act

241

claiming that it was a violation of the Constitution al right to freedom of
expression (Section 16 of the Constitution)”. The provision states that it
was “likely to prejudice relations between Sections of the population, i.e.
Jews and other communities.” As held by the court that the provision
went beyond the scope of Section 16 (2), and hence it was invalid.
4.2.3.1.1 Court reasoning and final decision
Looking at the High Court’s treatment of the case, the core of the
South African Board of Jewish Deputies’ complaint was the Clause 2(a)
and High Court had to examine its validity in order to make a decision
and settle the issue between the two parties. Henceforward, the Court’s
main issue in reasoning its decision was the Constitution al validity of
Clause 2(a). Though, in the circumstances of the case, the Court saw that it
would be inappropriate to conduct a broad-based examination of the
whole Clause 2(a).
After reviewing the Clause 2(a) in relation to the Bill of Rights
(Section 16) which protects freedom of expression but excludes some
material from its protection for the purpose of preventing harm in the
South African society, the Court found that a portion of clause 2(a) limits
the right of freedom of expression. The Clause 2(a) as concluded by the

242

Court regulated the right of freedom of expression that is protected in the
Constitution by the right to freedom of expression. The question therefore
that was revolve around the case as stated in the explanatory note was
“whether the limitation was nevertheless Constitution ally justifiable”
Accordingly, the Court noted that the regulation of the
broadcasting—Clause 2(a) is eligible by the Constitution because the
Clause was drafted to enhance certain values; national unity, values of
dignity, equality and freedom, in fairness however, the Court added that
the characteristic of Clause 2(a) does not deny the fact that the Clause
limits the right of freedom of expression.
In connection to the previous, as stated in the explanatory note “it
held nevertheless that the prohibition went too far and was not
sufficiently focused to guide broadcasters in what they may or may not
broadcast. Since the prohibition was too intrusive and made serious
inroads into the right to freedom of expression.” Thereafter, the appeal of
the IUC was successful and the limitation of Clause 2(a) was declared
Constitution ally unjustifiable. The Court had no difficulty in finding the
rationale and reasoning behind its final order. It is apparent what factors
weighed on the Court’s mind when reaching this decision.

243

The first factor was the power of court in deciding if the law is
inconsistent

with

Constitution

or

Constitution

ally

justifiable.

Accordingly, the Court declared flatly that Clause 2(a) was invalid based
on the fact that “As exactly stated in the explanatory note that

30the

Court’s decision was de facto taken liable to “that no protection is given to
the broadcasting of material that amounts to propaganda for war, the
incitement of imminent violence or the advocacy of hatred that is based on
race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause
harm.” Basically, the High Court declared the invalidity of Clause 2(a) by
exercising its power in terms of Section 172(1)(a) of the Constitution .
Specifically, Section (172) of the Constitution is considered to be
Constitution al source for the Court. Section (172) of the Constitution
enacts
172. Powers of courts in Constitution al matters
1.

When deciding a Constitution al matter within its power, a court ¬

a.

must declare that any law or conduct that is inconsistent with the

Constitution is invalid to the extent of its inconsistency; and
Islamic Unity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority and Others (CCT36/01) [2002]
ZACC 3; 2002 (4) SA 294; 2002 (5) BCLR 433 (11 April 2002)
30

244

b.

may make any order that is just and equitable, including ¬

i.

an order limiting the retrospective effect of the declaration of

invalidity; and
ii.

an order suspending the declaration of invalidity for any period

and on any conditions, to allow the competent authority to correct the
defect.

Accordingly, under this section the Court has the power to “declare
law or conduct that is inconsistent with the Constitution invalid”
(Constitution al Court of South Africa
Case (CCT36/01) [2002]).
Turning to the second factor, which is Section (36) of the
Constitution that draws the limitation of rights. Section (36) enunciates:
36. Limitation of rights
1.

The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of law

of general application to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and
justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity,
equality and freedom, taking into account all relevant factors, including
a.

the nature of the right;

245

b.

the importance of the purpose of the limitation;

c.

the nature and extent of the limitation;

d.

the relation between the limitation and its purpose; and

e.

less restrictive means to achieve the purpose.

2.

Except as provided in subSection (1) or in any other provision of

the Constitution, no law may limit any right entrenched in the Bill of
Rights.
Similar to Section (172), the attitude of the Court in regard to Section
(36) seems to be restrictive. Section (36) allows limitation in which
reasonable to be exercised in a democratic society where human dignity,
equality, and freedom are completely guaranteed. In other words, Section
(36) of the Constitution specifies what limitations and restrictions policy
makers can draw when drafting any internet, broadcasting and media
regulations. Policy makers must be sure that the policies they issue go in
line with Section (36).

In this view, the Court found no grounds for the justification of the
IBA and the Fifth Respondents, the Minister of Communications. As a
result, the Court revised the Clause 2(a) to find it Constitution ally

246

objectionable and inconsistent with the Constitution

because the

prohibition went too far and was not sufficient. Putting the later in
different words, Clause 2(a) has more restrictions on freedom of
expression than the ones specified in the Constitution.
Eventually, the board denies the latter claiming that the limitation
is justifiable by explaining that “if the prohibition against the broadcasting
of material “likely to prejudice relations between sections of the
population” were given a narrow interpretation by the Court.
The board believes that the clause is consistent with the Constitution, and
board argued that if the Court judged that this clause is unjustifiable, that
means the clause were interpreted narrowly by the Court.
In accordance to the above case reasoning, the Court declared the below
order:
1. The application for leave to appeal directly to this Court is granted;
2.

The appeal is upheld;

3.

The decision of the Witwatersrand High Court declining to consider

the issue of the Constitution ality of clause 2(a) of the Code of Conduct for
Broadcasting Services as contained in Schedule 1 to the Independent
Broadcasting Authority (IBA) Act, 153 of 1993, is hereby set aside;

247

4.

Clause 2(a) of the said Code of Conduct for Broadcasting Services is

declared to be inconsistent with Section (16) of the Constitution

and

invalid to the extent that it prohibits the broadcasting of material that is
“likely to prejudice relations between sections of the population”;
provided that this order does not apply to (i) propaganda for war; (ii)
incitement of imminent violence; or (iii) advocacy of hatred that is based
on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to
cause harm.
5.

No order is made for costs.

4.2.3.2 Case model: Kuwait: IN THE CASE No. 274/2012 CAPITAL –
118/2012 INVESTIGATIONS-FILED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTION VS.
HAMAD FAISAL TAHER NAQI
As pointed out several times, Kuwait is considered to be vastly
more liberal than its Arabian Gulf neighbors. In spite of the amount of
freedoms which are guaranteed in Kuwaiti legislation, exercising those
freedoms seems to lead to inappropriate exercising of freedom of
expression. In particular, exercising the right of freedom of expression

248

through media and social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, have
led to the prosecution of people for insulting political and religious
symbols. Therefore, I intentionally selected the below case to illustrate the
chaotic situation that exists when citizens exercise freedom of expression
and to present the judiciary reaction to such cases.
The theme of the selected the case is the defamation of

31religious

and political symbols. Specifically, the case is about a Kuwaiti blogger,
Hamad Naqi, who was sentenced by the Kuwaiti Court to ten years in
prison for insulting the prophet Mohammed and for harming Kuwait's
interests by derogatory tweets on the social media site Twitter. The
blogger degraded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabian and Kingdom of
Bahraini regimes as two appreciable neighbors to Kuwait (Gulf news,
2012). Consequently, on June 5, 2012 Kuwait’s Court of First Instance
Penalized Naqi, 26, on those charges (Human Right Watch, 2012). Naqi is
still in jail and on 28.10. 2013 has lost his appeal.

31

Defamation is criminal law case based on the Kuwaiti law

249

In more detail, the public prosecution accused the respondent from
05.02.2012 until 27.03.2012 at the criminal investigations department in the
State of Kuwait:
1. In his capacity as a Kuwaiti citizen intentionally issued abroad,
through two accounts he established on twitter in the international
information network (internet) "offensive news and statements
regarding the behavior of the Prophet and his companions: Abu
Bakr Al Siddiq, Omar Bin Al Khattab, Othman Bin Affan, and the
Mother of Believers Aisha Bint Abi Bakr in32 a way causing discord
between the members of society, leading to the separation of its
members and their dividing based on their religious beliefs. His
announcement

also

included

statements

humiliating

and

disdaining the governing systems in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and the Kingdom of Bahrain. This shall lead to the damage of
national interests in the country as indicated in the investigations.
2. He announced, using the same previous means, opinions of mock,
disdain, and belittling of the Islam religion by objecting to its
beliefs and teachings. He indicated the terms and statements
32

Prophet’s Mohammed companions—Religious symbols

250

indicated in the investigations which mock and insult the figures of
the religion as is indicated in the investigations.
3. He intentionally ill- used one of the telephone communication
means (mobile telephone) by sending statements of the previous
subjects to the Twitter website with obscene language as indicated
in the investigations.
In accordance with the above, the prosecution requested punishing
him in accordance with the Articles 111 of the Penal Code, 15 of the law
No. 31 of 1970 for amending some of the provisions of the Penal Code No.
16 of 1960 and Article (1) of law No. 9 of 2001 pertaining to ill using the
telephone and tapping devices.
As explained by Naqi’s lawyer, Mr. Khalid Alshatti, that based on
Article (15) of the National Security Law, which specifies a minimum
three-year sentence for “intentionally broadcasting news, statements, or
false or malicious rumors … that harm the national interests of the state,”
the Court convicted Naqi for tweets that belittled and insulted the political
regimes in two Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and could
have

damaged Kuwait’s national interests(Human Right Watch 2012,

251

Gulfnews 2012).

He also indicated that it the Kuwaiti freedom of

expression laws violate the International standards of freedoms (Human
Rights Watch Report 2013, Hamad Naqi Case 274/2012).
At the same time, in accordance with Article (111) of the Penal
Code

33which

sets a maximum of one-year sentence for scorning and

criticizing religion, the Court found Naqi guilty for a tweet supposedly
insulting the Prophet Mohammed and his wife, Aisha (Human Right
Watch, 2012). Naqi defended himself by insisting that someone had
impersonated him and used his Twitter account after they hacked it.
Therefore, Naqi pleaded not guilty to the charges (Human Rights Watch,
2012).
The case began in March 28, 2012 when the first investigation
started. Naqi admitted that he was the one who tweeted against God,
prophets, and other countries by using his iPhone device. Naqi justified
his actions by saying that some Twitter users who belong to the Sunni
religious sanction ignited his anger by insulting his religious sanction
which is Shi’a. Upon questioning the accused during the investigations of

33

Article 111 of the Penal Code of 1960 prohibits defamation of religion

252

what he wrote with regard to the companions Abu Bakr Al Siddiq and
Omar Bin Al Khattab and the text of the tweet (I curse their fathers and
the father of Al Saud the sons of adultery and Al Khalifa, the sons of
sodomy and a thousand curses upon Abu Bakr, Omar and Othman, and
fuck you” he answered that he wrote these words on 25.05.2011 in his
Twitter account (HamaD NoQi @ @Naqi88) to the account (@HQ121@ ifr –
howaj). The persons intended by this tweet are Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, Omar
Bin Al Khattab, and Othman Bin Affan.
At the outset Naqi admitted that he did all the charges, but the
defendant lawyer insisted that Naqi confessed under coercion and illtreatment during investigations. Later, during the investigations, Naqi
changed his words and denied all charges against him claiming that other
users have hacked his Twitter account and that he was forced by the
investigator of the state security to admit to something he did not do.
More complicatedly, the defendant lawyer indicted to the mystery in
reporting Naqi to the authority, specifically, the opacity of how the case of
Naqi transferred from the police station as a misdemeanor to the Court

253

room as a felony claiming that the procedures of transferring the case
were full of vagueness (Hamad Naqi Case, 274/2012).
Reaction to Naqi’s tweets began in the jail. In April 19, 2012 Naqi
was attacked by a prisoner so in order to protect Naqi, prison authorities
decided to imprison Naqi in solitary (Human Right Watch, 2012). During
the events of the case, Naqi stayed three months in solitary confinement.
In regard to the political arena reaction to Naqi’s case, specifically
in June 6, 2012,

numbers of the Kuwaiti Parliament suggested a

modification for Article (111) of the Penal Law by requesting the death
Penalty as a punishment for those who mock God and religion (Human
Rights Report, 2012). As discussed in Human Right Report (2012) that the
suggested legislation is to modify

Article (111) of the Penal Law” to

authorize the death Penalty or life imprisonment for anyone who “mocks
God, the prophets and messengers, or the honor of his messengers and
wives”. However, the legislation suggested by the Kuwaiti Parliament
members was rejected by the current Amir of Kuwait Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah(Human Right Watch 2012, Gulfnews 2012).

254

4.2.3.2.1 Court reasoning and final decision
It is apparent what factors have weighed on the Court’s mind when
reaching this decision. The Court invoked three specific rationales for
charging Naqi. First of all, with regard to the first accusation referred to
the accused, it was established from the accusation report that the same
included two incidents. The first incident was that the accused, in his
capacity as a Kuwaiti citizen, intentionally circulated abroad through two
accounts he established on the website Twitter offensive news and
statements regarding the behavior of the Prophet and his companions;
Abu Bakr Al Siddiq, Omar Bin Al Khattab, Othman Bin Affan and the
Mother of Believers Aisha Bint Abi Bakr Al Siddiq in a way that shall
cause discord between the members of the society and that shall lead to
the separation of its members based on their religious beliefs. The judges
prudently argued that Kuwait is a Muslim nation where Islam is sacred
and

protected. Further, the Kuwaiti society including all Muslim

sanctions refuse all kinds of defamation against Islam and God.
Accordingly by such tweets, Naqi degraded and disrespected the whole

255

society (Hamad Naqi Case, 274/2012).The second

34incident

was that the

accused, in his statements humiliated and disdained the governing
systems in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Bahrain
which led to the damage of national interests of the country.
The judges argued that the doer should be a Kuwaiti citizen or a
resident in Kuwait, which is present in this case. Second, the doer should
spread false news or information or rumors. The law required as
condition that the effective action in this case result in a certain danger,
which is the weakening of the financial trust in the country, its status and
consideration. This is not proven in this case, since what is understood
from the previous is that the elements of the effective action in the crime is
represented the issuance of a positive activity from the accused by
announcing news, statements or rumors by spreading it to an unlimited
amount of people and spreading the said news between people. The news,
statements or rumors which had been spread should be invalid and the
same is established once they contradict with reality or cause fear amongst
Article (15) of the Kuwaiti National Security Law states “Shall be punished with temporary
imprisonment of at least three years, every Kuwaiti or resident in Kuwait, who intentionally
announced false news or statements of rumors regarding the internal situation in the country and
which shall decrease the financial trust in the country or its financial status or who shall in any
means execute an activity that shall damage the national interests of the country”
34

256

people and cause discord and division leading to a certain results, which
is the weakening of the financial trust or status of the country.
Further, with regard to the second incident indicated in the
description of the first accusation indicated above, by referring to the
provisions of Article (15) of law No. 31 of 1970 for amending some
provisions of the Penal Code No. 16 of 1960, which articulates that any
degrading to other nations or ruining the relation between Kuwait and
other nations by offending them with words or actions leads to minimum
of three years in jail.

Consequently, the judges found that there are

several important conditions for the elements of the crime to be present
(Hamad Naqi Case, 274/2012).
Notwithstanding, it is necessary to mention that since Naqi faced
a number of charges including insulting religious symbols and degrading
other nations, the Court referred to Article (84) of the Penal Law in order
to make the final decision (Hamad Naqi Case, 274/2012). This Article
governs cases where a person who committed a number of crimes for the
same purpose or committed a single act that includes a number of crimes,
therefore, the punishment will be based on the tougher crime.

257

Accordingly, the Court punished Naqi based on threating Kuwaiti
national security as the tougher crime. Hence, Naqi was sentenced ten
years based on the National Security Law Article (15) (Hamad Naqi Case,
274/2012).
In light of the previous, and in accordance with the confession of
the accused during the investigations of the Investigations Department
which the court is convinced by, therefore,
The court ruled:
First: to clear the accused from the first section of the first accusation as
indicated in the reasons of the present claim.
Second: to imprison the accused for ten years with labor for the remaining
accusations and to confiscate his mobile device.
Third: to refuse the civil claims and bind the parties filing the same to
expenses.
Lastly, the judges argued that even if the defendant lawyer trying
to justify what Naqi did by referring to Article

(36) and (37) of the

Constitution , he will certainly fail. As the judges discussed that the

258

Kuwaiti Constitution protects freedom of belief and opinion- Article (36)
and Article (37) but do not give the right to criticize, ridicule, and/or
mock the Islamic fundamentals and threating National Security.
Instead, the two mentioned Articles restrict freedom of expression
and draw some limitations especially for religions and other National
Security issues (Hamad Naqi Case, 274/2012).
After the Court has its final decision, Naqi lost his appeal on
October 28, 2013 and the Appeal Court found that Naqi is responsible for
all charges against him (Appeal Court, Hamad Naqi Case, 1483/2012274/2012-118/2012)
4.2.3.2.2 Comparison
The last criterion discussed in this chapter is to compare two case
models in order to explore how judiciary systems in both countries deal
with freedom of expression cases. In other words, the purpose of
comparing case models is to illustrate the role that the judiciary has
played in protecting the right to freedom of expression by comparing two
cases model and trying to figure out what the Court relied on when it

259

made its decision? Specifically did the Court consider the (Constitution ,
statute, regulation, other case law, other official documentation (report,
directive, etc.),comment or testimony, writing by a scholar, surrounded
social or political pressure) in its decision?
In analyzing the two cases I found that the South African Courts
mainly relied on the Articles of the Constitution, while the Kuwaiti Court
was mainly relied on the Penal Law. In Kuwait the Court referred to the
Penal Law and paid less attention to the Constitution because the
Constitution is general rule and there are no any specifications so there
must be Penal Laws to explain the rules. These Penal laws are basically
drafted based on the spirit of the general rules of the Constitution. Putting
the latter in another words, the Constitution is embodied in all Penal Laws
in Kuwait, any laws drafted by the legislative power must be based on the
Constitutions Articles. Besides, Constitutions’ Articles have no mechanism
and therefore there must be Penal Laws. On the other hand, Kuwaiti and
South African legal systems follow the mixed law in which both civil and
common laws are applied.

As stated by Abdulla (n.d) “The State of

Kuwait follows the civil law system with Islamic law significant in

260

personal matters and has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.
Kuwait legal system gives a very prominent position to the civil laws of
the country and therefore it will fill the lacunae of any substantive law if
there is confusion.” (Abdul Razzaq Law Firm).
In the case of the South Africa, the Court obviously relied on the
Constitution when made its decision. In particular, the Court relied on
Section (172) and Section (36) of the Constitution. Accordingly, the South
African High Court declared the invalidity of the Clause 2(a) by exercising
its power in terms of Section 172(1)(a) of the Constitution . As mentioned
earlier, this Article gives the Court the right to declare that the consistency
or inconsistency of any law or conduct with the Constitution. Further, the
Court referred to Section (36) which enacts the limitations on freedoms
that can be drawn in the democratic society.

Section (36) allows

limitations in which reasonable to be exercised in a democratic society
where human dignity, equality, and freedom are completely guaranteed.
Thus, the Court found that Clause 2 (a) is Constitution ally objectionable
and inconsistent with the limitations which are stated in Section (36) of the
Constitution. Thereafter, the Court decided that Clause 2(a) has more

261

restrictions on freedom of expression than the ones specified in the
Constitution.
Unlike the South African Court, the Kuwaiti Court has made the
final decision based on some Articles of the Penal Law. Due to the
complexity of the Islamic rules, it is important to stress on the fact that
dealing with such cases in Islamic countries is more of dilemmatic legal
situation. For more illustration, the judge of the Naqi case argued that the
protection of the freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution is
limited to some restrictions. The Court relied on the Penal Laws in Naqi
case because as the judges mentioned that the Kuwaiti Constitution
protects freedom of expression Article

(35), (36),(37) and (38) under

certain restrictions. Therefore, the Court relied on the Penal Laws which
considered being the restrictions that has been indicated to in the
Constitutions. The judge claimed that Islam or any matters related to it is
considered to be sacred in the Kuwaiti society, where the whole society
including all religious sanctions refuse the defamation or degrading of
Islam in any way. Thus, the Court depended on the Kuwaiti Penal Law
Article (111) which strictly punishes any violation against Islam (i.e.,

262

opinion, publication, speech, newspaper Articles, and media). Likewise in
regard to the second charge to Naqi, which is threating the National
Security by degrading the Bahraini and Saudi regimes, the Court relied on
Articles (15) of the National Security Law to prove that accuser was guilty.
More significantly, since Naqi faced a number of charges including;
insulting religious symbols and degrading other nations, the Court
referred to Article (84) of the Penal Law in order to make the final
decision. Article (84) governs cases where person committed a number of
crimes for the same purpose or committed single act that includes a
number of crimes, therefore, the punishment will be based on the tougher
crime. Accordingly, the Court punished Naqi based on threating the
Kuwaiti National Security as the tougher crime.

Hence, Naqi was

sentenced ten years based on the National Security Law Article (15). What
might be concluded from the Court decision is that national security has
the superiority upon the right of freedom of expression; second, there is
vagueness toward the application of Islamic rules in the Kuwaiti legal
system, and the instability in authority’s view toward Islam.

263

In arriving at the decision, the Court stated that although the right
to freedom of expression was important, it was not supercilious to other
matters. It must therefore be weighed up with other competing matters; in
this case the right to freedom of expression does not include the right to
expression an opinion about security and religion, particularly, Islam or
any related matters to it
Finally, looking at other angles of the case, I found that the Kuwaiti
judiciary was surrounded by the reaction of the social and political
spheres; the fuming public opinion reaction and the Kuwaiti Parliament
members’ harsh suggestion. As reported in Human Right Watch (2012)
harsh legislation was suggested by the Kuwaiti Parliament members who
asked for revision of Article (111) of the Penal Law to sharpen the
punishment to authorize life imprisonment or the death Penalty for the
guilty of mocking God or any religious symbols. Likewise, Kuwaiti
citizens expressed their anger toward Naqi’s declarations (Reuters, 2012).
At the same time, as a Shi’a citizen who insulted Sunnas’ symbols, Naqi
changed the conflict in the society into sectarian; Shi’a and Sunna conflict.
The sectarian played fatal role in Kuwaiti society in terms of dividing the

264

view of Shi’a and Sunna people toward Naqi’s case (Reuters, 2012).
Moreover, as stated in Reuters report (2012) about the anger of Kuwaiti
society that “dozens of Sunni activists protested to condemn him.” More
importantly, Kuwaiti media indicated that the whole Shi’a people should
not be attacked for a mistake by one of them (Reuters, 2012).
However, it’s important to mention that based on the Kuwaiti
Constitution Articles (53) and (163) the

35judiciary

is independent by law.

Though, as Hussain (2010) discussed that there some evidences proved
the interferences executive authority. As stated by Husain (2010)
“Constitutions usually state that the judicial authority is independent and
that no other authority has the right to interfere in its affairs, due to the

Article (53) [Judicial Power] The judicial powers is vested in the Courts, which exercise
it in the name of the Amir within the limits of the Constitution.
35

Article (163) [Independence of Judiciary] In administering justice, judges are not subject
to any authority. No interference whatsoever is allowed with the conduct of justice. Law
guarantees the independence of the Judiciary and states the guarantees and provisions
relating to judges and the conditions of their irremovability.

265

mutual separation principle between the authorities, this independence of
the judicial authority in Kuwait does not mean the non-existence of a
relationship with other authorities” (p.382). Therefore, people protesting
against Naqi did not prove that there are social influences on the Kuwaiti
judiciary system, it’s just proved that that Naqi action did ignited public’s
anger which account against Naqi and his action.
In conjunction with the debate over the notion of freedom of
expression, comparing the meaning and the application of freedom of
expression within the legal environment in South Africa and Kuwait I
reached the following result. Theoretically speaking, both countries
protect freedom of opinion, religions, and belief. The difference is that
Kuwait did not state an Article in the Constitution that protects freedom
of information as the one in South African Constitution. Furthermore, it
seems that the limitations on freedom of expression affected the concept of
freedom in both countries. For more illustration, in spite of the fact that
the Kuwaiti Constitution protects freedom of religion and opinion,
criticizing Islam is not allowed and it leads to strict legal punishment.
While in South Africa, following or criticizing any religion is considered to

266

be completely allowable.

Turning to the practical aspect of freedom of

expression, I find significant differences across the two nations. In general,
looking to the South African case model I found that the judiciary has a
reasonable level of commitment to the Constitution. As pointed to earlier,
the Court referred to Articles (36) and (172) of the Constitution to make
the final decision.
On the other hand, the Kuwaiti Court relied on Article (111) of the
Penal Law and on Article (15) of the National Security law which proves a
commitment to the existence law. Nonetheless, it has been mentioned in
Human Rights Watch report (2013) that the Kuwaiti freedoms of
expression laws violate the International standards of freedoms.
In this balance of reasonableness, great weight was given to the
final decision of the two compared Courts. I reach the following results. It
is obvious that when making the final decision judges of the South African
case emphasized on the values of democratic society, whereas the in the
Kuwaiti case the judges focused more on the Penal Law to protect Islamic
values and security issues. Hence, the mentioned results indicate to the
fact that South African legal system is more impacted by of the essence of

267

the democratic values. As noted several times in this chapter, during the
Apartheid era freedoms were suppressed by the elite. The absence of the
values of democratic society at the Apartheid era causes a backlash in
which within the South African legal environment the right of freedom of
expression covers other substantial rights. As explained in the case, the
judges considered discussing the existence of the Holocaust by a Muslim
historian did not exceed the limits set for the freedom of expression.
In respect to the Kuwaiti legal environment and based on Naqi
case, the Kuwaiti Court seemed to be somewhat less protective of freedom
of expression. The Court put reasonable weight on the nature of the
conservative society and on the attachment of the Kuwaiti citizens to
Islam. Furthermore, the judges focused on how the Constitution protects
freedoms in accordance with some conditions explaining that talking
about Islam is not covered under the right of freedom of expression. Also,
the judges logically discussed the essentiality of protecting national
security. They indicated to how firm the relations of Kuwait are with its
neighbors in the region. To some extent, the judges appreciated the
Constitution equally to their appreciation to the value of Islam and the

268

public opinion.

Looking at the legal environment through historical

lenses, I found that the Kuwaiti Constitution itself was drafted based on
Islamic rules, which makes it reasonable to protect Islam by the Kuwaiti
judiciary system.
To recapitulate, what emerges from this closer look at the above
cases is that the South African judiciary system prioritizes the

values of democratic society where everyone is freely able to express
his/her opinion about religions. On the contrary, the Kuwaiti judiciary
system deals differently with freedom of expression cases. Fundamentally,
the Kuwaiti judiciary system has other priorities to be considered besides
protecting the right of freedom of expression. Therein while making the
final decision in the freedom of expression case above, the judges have
discussed the severe impact of the case on the society unity and national
security

as

well.

4.2.3.2.3 Conclusion
In a nutshell, the current chapter includes a concise legal comparative
of the legislation regarding freedom of expression in South Africa and
Kuwait. The established comparative criteria emphasized on three aspects
in order to find out how judiciary systems in both countries deal with and
protect the right of freedom of expression. Namely the aspects are;
freedom of expression in the Constitution, Legislations of freedom of
expression, Case models of freedom of expression. To some extent, on
both levels, the theoretical and the practical, the two examined countries
protect the freedom of expression.

Theoretically, both Constitutions

guarantee the right of freedom of expression with different certain
limitations. Given that the South African legal system is not influenced by
any religion, the right of freedom of expression covers many aspects of
freedom. Hence, the nature of the South African laws and regulations are
more liberal. Oppositely, the Kuwaiti legal system is affected by religion,
specifically, Islam as the official religion of Kuwait; therefore, written laws
and regulations are mainly Islamized.

277

On the practical level when making final decisions, the South African
judiciary system stuck to the Articles of the Constitution , whereas the
Kuwaiti judiciary system referred to the Kuwaiti Penal Laws in which the
core of this Laws consider the society nature and reaction.

Chapter 5
Results

5.1 Introduction
The purpose of this research is to investigate the differences and
similarities in Kuwait and South Africa in regards to the perception of
freedom of expression of old and young generations from each nation and
how those perceptions are influenced by certain contexts (i.e. cultural, and
religious). As mentioned earlier in chapter two, mixed methods will be
employed to conduct the comparative analysis in addition to the legal
analysis.
By way of organization, this chapter first presents the hypotheses,
which have been designed based on the literature review. Second, the
chapter presents the findings of this study, which are divided into two

279

sections; the first section is the quantitative followed by the qualitative.
Specifically, in the qualitative sectionI will present the results based on
major themes, whereas in the quantitative section I will present the
statistical results rendered from SPSS. In this connection, it is necessary to
emphasize that data were gathered based on simultaneous triangulation
which means interconnecting various methods and data and employment
in a single study. Generally, the purpose of the simultaneous triangulation
is to get different but complementary data on the same topic, rather than
to replicate results. Therefore, I gathered both qualitative and quantitative
data about the people’s perception of freedom of expression in order to
figure out if culture and religion effect how people perceive freedom of
expression.
In chapter 3 I have already explained the methodology in length.
As a reminder, this study applied mixed method and accordingly,
designed a survey as a quantitative method. As for the qualitative
method, there was an open-ended question in the survey. Furthermore, a
focus -group was also employed as another qualitative method in the
research.

280

The target population in this study consists of 80 self-selected
educated South African and Kuwaiti citizens between the ages of 18 and
65 who are connected with various institutions, schools, or organizations
in their respective countries. In particular, the group representing the
younger generation consists of participants between the ages of 18 and 25,
while the group representing the older generations consists of participants
between the ages of 26 and 65. Each group consisted of 20 participants.
Three focus groups were conducted in each country and consisted of 8 to
20 participants whose ages ranged from 18 to 65
40 Kuwaiti participants completed the questionnaire both onsite
and online; 27 South African participants completed their survey during
their visit to Milwaukee in Fall/2013, and the remaining 13 participants
from South Africa completed their survey online.
Overall, this chapter presents the results of the study. First, results
of the focus group interviews will be presented. Next, a description of the
study sample is followed by an analysis of reliability of scale results. Next,
descriptive statistics and results pertaining to each hypothesis are
presented and additional analysis of data collected in the survey is also

281

included. Finally, legal comparative analysis of freedom of expression
legislations will be included.
5.2 Participants and Instruments
Participants involved in the study are regular citizens who
participate in various forms of institutions, universities, and other schools
from South Africa or Kuwait. Their ages range between 18 and 65. Each
participant completed a survey during the 2013 academic year.
Additionally, participants provided data through a series of focus groups.
5.3 Restatement of the Problem
This Ph.D. research investigates the differences and similarities in
Kuwait and South Africa in regards to the perception of freedom of
expression of old and young generations from each nation and how it is
influenced by certain contexts (i.e. cultural, and religious). The research
sheds light on the awareness of the public in regards to the notion of
freedom of expression and the policies and regulations of freedom of
expression. In particular, freedom of expression includes the control of
writing/publishing, access to information, and access to information
through new media - the Internet. Another aspect to be discussed through
conducting the current comparative study is the difference in the

282

awareness of each nation’s citizens about the legislation of freedom of
expression in their country. Finally, this study investigates freedom of
expression legislation in both countries in order to have in-depth
understand of how each nation protect and control
5.4 Hypotheses and Research questions
5.4.1

Hypotheses

Three hypotheses were tested in this research. All analyses were
conducting using SPSS version 17.0 Hypotheses were tested using t-test.
Hypotheses are the following:
Hypothesis One
Hypothesis one predicted a positive relationship between the age
and the perception of limitation of freedom of expression. This hypothesis
assumes that in both countries, the younger generation supports more
freedom of expression, while the senior generation generally supports
restrictions on freedom of expression.
Hypothesis Two

283

The second hypothesis predicts that there is a positive relationship
between the role of the Internet and the citizens’ perception of freedom of
expression. I assume that in the Internet era, the younger generation tends
to call for more freedom of expression, while the older generation favors
more limitations on freedom of expression.
Hypothesis Three
The third hypothesis predicts that there is different between the
awareness by the younger and older generations about the current legal
framework that protects and controls freedom of expression.
4.5.2 Research Questions
To study whether cultural and religious values may impact people’s
perception of freedom of expression and the generational differences of
perceiving the legislation that protects and control freedom of expression,
the following main research questions were investigated:

1. How do certain cultural values impact citizens’ perception of
freedom of expression between generations in both countries?

284

2. How do religious views impact citizens’ perception of freedom of
expression between generations in both countries?
3. How do the younger and older generations perceive the legislation
that protects and controls freedom of expression?
Together these research questions will allow for an in-depth
analysis of the multiple factors (i.e., cultural and religion). In particular,
the above questions help in understanding how culture and religion
impact how younger and older generations perceive the notion of freedom
of expression in the digital technology era. Furthermore, the study focuses
on people’s awareness and perception of the legislation that protects and
controls freedom of expression. The central theme of the first research
question is to determine the manner in which certain cultural values
impact citizens’ perception of freedom of expression between generations
in South Africa and Kuwait. Literature suggests analyzing cultural
dimensions assists in explaining the reason of why members of society
perceive certain notions (Hofested, 1991). To this end, it is necessary to
determine how culture impacts people’s perceptions of the notion of
freedom of expression.
The second research question focuses on the manner in which

285

people’s perception of the notion of freedom of expression might be
influenced by religious values. The literature discusses that there is a
relationship between religion and people’s actions and interpretations.
Further, religion helps to explain why people act a certain way and how
such actions can be explained (Finke and Adamczyk, 2008).
The third research question addresses legislation of freedom of
expression in both nations. As literature indicate to the fact that the
younger generation is more liberal and tend to call for more freedom of
expression, whereas, the older generation is more conservative and would
appreciate having freedom of expression under control (Albudaiwi, 2011).
Regarding the legal analysis, it is crucial to mention that in chapter
four, while comparing freedom of expression legislations between South
Africa and Kuwait, a number of similarities and differences were found.
Hence, under this section I will present the results of the legal analysis in
order to appropriately discuss it in chapter six by connecting the result of
the legal analysis with the research questions and hypotheses.

286

5.5 Statistical results
The quantitative phase of the research showed interesting results.
SPSS version 17.0 was employed to statistically analyze the questionnaire.
In particular, t test and correlation were used to conduct the analysis.
Below is a summary to discuss the statistical results.
5.5.1

Summary of quantitative results

The three hypotheses were tested by t test and correlation. When
testing the first hypothesis, SPSS result showed that there is a significant
relationship between the age and the perception of limitation of freedom
of expression. Surprisingly, younger and older generations from both
countries call for less limitations on freedom of expression, while middle
aged participants from the two countries asked for more limitations and
more restrictions on freedom of expression. According to SPSS (See
Appendix E for the tables)
(M = 1.26, s = 1.26) and 1, t(45) = 1.410, p < .05, α = .05.
The second hypothesis examined how the Internet impacts these
generations’ perception of freedom of expression. Accordingly, SPSS
result showed that there is significant relationship between the role of the

287

Internet and the citizens’ perception of freedom of freedom of expression.
Statistical analysis showed that age plays a role. The younger generation
calls for more freedom of expression. However, the unexpected result is
that the older generation does not call for more limitations on freedom of
expression. Instead, the result showed that middle age participants favor
more limitations on freedom of expression. Accordingly,
(M = 1.26, s = 1.26) and 1, t(45) = 1.410, p < .05, α = .05.
The last hypothesis investigated the awareness of younger and
older generations of the freedom of expression legislations. Therefore, the
statistical analysis showed that the older generation has a higher
awareness of the legal framework of the freedom of expression; whereas,
the younger generation lacks the awareness of such framework.
According to the statistical analysis
(M = 1.26, s = 1.26) and 1, t(45) = 1.410, p < .05, α = .05.

On the other hand in addition to the above test, hypotheses were
also tested through running correlations test and the results are showed as
the following: (See Appendix E for the table)

288

A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed
to assess the relationship between the government control access to the
Internet and rating of restricting freedom of expression. There was a
significant positive correlation between the two variables, r = 266, n = 79, p
= 0.018. Overall, there was a strong, positive correlation between
Government control access to the Internet and restricting the right of
freedom of expression. Increases in government control were correlated
with increases in rating of limiting the right of freedom of expression.

A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed
to assess the relationship between the government’s control websites and
rating of restricting the right of freedom of expression. There was a
significant positive correlation between the two variables, r = 0.347, n = 58,
p = 0.008. Overall, there was a strong, positive correlation between
government’s control websites and restricting freedom of expression.
Increases in the control of certain websites by the government were
correlated with increases in rating of limiting the right of freedom of
expression

289

A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed
to assess the relationship between the amount of parents’ control on using
the Internet on their children and rating of restricting the right of freedom
of expression. There was a positive correlation between the two variables,
r = 0.254, n = 79, p = 0.024. A scatterplot summarizes the results (Figure 1).
Overall, there was a strong, positive correlation between parents control
access to the Internet and limiting the right of freedom of expression.
Increases in parents’ control access the Internet were correlated with
increases in rating of limiting the right of freedom of expression.
A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed
to assess the relationship between the government control access to the
Internet and rating of Internet’s bad influence on the religious values.
There was a positive correlation between the two variables, r = 0.273, n =
80, p = 0.014. A scatterplot summarizes the results (Figure 1) Overall, there
was a strong, positive correlation between government control access to
the Internet and the bad influence of the Internet on the religious values.
Therefore, even if the government increases the control on the access of
the Internet, the bad influence of the Internet on the religious values will
not be decreased.

290

A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed
to assess the relationship between the use of illegal materials for
educational purposes and rating of Internet’s bad influence on the
religious values. There was a significant positive correlation between the
two variables, r = 0.273, n = 80, p = 0.014. A scatterplot summarizes the
results (Figure 1) Overall, there was a strong, positive correlation between
using illegal materials for educational purposes and the bad influence of
the Internet on the religious values. Therefore, even if the illegal materials
were used for educational purposes only, the bad influence of the Internet
on the religious values will still exist.

In sum, it is necessary to mention that the statistical analysis
proved that the younger generation in both countries is similar in regard
to three issues:

their perception about freedom of expression, their

opinion about limitations, and their awareness of legislations of freedom
of expression. Equally, the older generations from both countries has the
same perception of the same three mentioned issues. Also middle age

291

participants from both countries have the same view of freedom of
expression.
5.6 Qualitative results
There were 80 respondents of the surveys distributed through
emailed surveys and onsite.

All 40 Kuwaiti participants had the

questionnaire onsite, while only 13 South Africans had the questionnaire
onsite; the remaining 27 participants received the questionnaire through
email. As mentioned earlier, the three hypotheses were tested and
analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 in particular, t-test was used.
The purpose of the focus groups was twofold; first, to discover if
cultural and religious values impact perceptions concerning freedom of
expression, and second to observe a possible difference between the
younger and older generations when it comes to the perception of
legislation protecting and/or controlling the freedom of expression. 6 total
focus groups were conducted; three for each country. For South Africa,
the first group included 27 participants; their ages vary from 28 to 45
years. The interview with the participants took around 80 minutes. As
mentioned in Methodology chapter that I conducted the other two focus

292

groups through Skype. The second focus group also consisted of 12
younger people from (Add university name). Their ages range from 21 to
40 years. The duration of this interview was 45 minutes. The third and last
group included 8 people, their ages varied between 23-30 years. The
interview lasted for 45 minutes.
Similarly, three focus groups were conducted in Kuwait.
Participants in the first group were 8 Kuwaiti citizens from different
institution who range in age from 46-60 years. Interviewing the
participants of the first group took 80 minutes. The second focus group
consisted of 20 younger students in Kuwait University (KUNIV). The age
range of the second group is 19-35. The duration of the interviews with
Kuwait University (KUNIV) students was 80 minutes. The third and last
group included 15 students from Kuwait University (KUNIV), their ages
between 19-23 years. The duration of interviewing the older group was 80
minutes. It is important to indicate that all 6 focus groups consisted of
both male and female participants though gender is not a main variable in
this research.

5.6.3 Legal Analysis
In chapter four I discussed and compared freedom of expression
legislations between South Africa and Kuwait, aiming to find how each
country’s judicial system deals with freedom of expression cases. The
result of the legal comparison indicated several significant differences and
some similarities. Generally speaking, the following comparisons were
found:
-

Both countries protect the right of freedom of expression

-

Both countries have legislations to restrict the right of freedom of
expression

-

Each country’s judicial system deals with freedom of expression
differently; Courts in the two countries referred to different sources
to reason the final decision

-

Both countries have independent judiciary systems, but each is
differently impacted by the surrounding social and political
environment.

Furthermore, research question 3 “how do the younger and older
generations perceive the legislation that protects and controls freedom of
expression?” will be answered through connecting

the legislation of

300

freedom of expression with the notion of legal culture that has been
widely discussed in the legal comparative studies. Generally speaking,
legal culture was defined as how people perceive and deal with the
legislations of their country. As defined by Friedman (1994) “by legal
culture we mean the ideas, values, attitudes and opinions people in some
society hold, with regard to law and legal system…Legal culture is the
source law—its norms create the legal norms; and it is what determines
the impact of legal norms on society” (p.118 )
5.6.4

Summary of Qualitative Results
Through focus groups consisting of young and old participants,

several themes became apparent. These were censorship, restrictions, and
pornography. The most significant quotes are presented in this section
organized by research question.
Separately, themes apparent through open ended questions
consisted of personal values, privacy, information misleading (inaccurate
information), misrepresentation of information, anonymous offenders,
easy access to immoral materials such as pornography, children
pornography, cybercrime, volatile information, addictive nature, over

301

reliance, and hate mongering. Yet, in order to simplify the representation
and discussion of the results, it was reasonable to categorize the themes to
appropriately utilize the content analysis and get readable results.
Moreover, some unexpected data appeared in the open-ended
questions for both countries. First of the all, two of the South African
participants discussed freedom of expression in connection to human
rights. As the first participant wrote “when information is controlled in
such a way that people cannot access it, then it is against the Universal
declaration human rights which state that everyone has the right to access
any information that is held by the state. People should not be denied
access to information.” The second participant articulated that freedom of
information access is one of the basic human rights. Second, Kuwaiti
participants have some surprising answers especially for questions about
religion and social norms. A number of participants said that there is no
religious opinion about the Internet or even freedom. Others said that
there is no relation between social norms and the Internet. Specifically,
many answers indicated that the Internet does not impact social norms or
religious values.

302

For the focus group, South African participants discussed some
unexpected answers.

There were some unexpected answers by some

participants of focus group number (2). Three participants indicated to the
relation between the economy status of the citizens and the right of
freedom of expression. For more illustration, one of the participants
explained about “technological restrictions.” The participant posited that
there is no Internet in poor rural areas, where people will not have the
chance to express their opinions or participate in any field. Likewise,
another participant (5) discussed the classes in South African society. The
participant (5) said that because there are economic problems (i.e., rich
and poor) poor people cannot participate in any field. He added South
Africans still suffer from lack of education in rural areas. He literary said
“they don’t have even computers”. One final economic issued was
mentioned by one of the participants who claimed that the Internet in
South Africa is manipulated by one company; this company was partially
owned by the State until the year 2007.
It is important to mention that explaining the economy factor is not part of
the current study and was unexpected during focus group.

303

5.7 Summary of the Quantitative and Qualitative Findings
To summarize, several findings emerged in analyses of the
relationship between the ages of the participants’ perception of the notion
of freedom of expression. For all targets, there is a positive association
between the proportion of a participant’s age and their perception of the
freedom of expression. There is also a connection between the roles of the
Internet and how younger and older participants view freedom of
expression. Lastly, there is no significant different between the awareness
and the perception of freedom of expression by the younger and older
generations about the current legal framework that protects and controls
freedom of expression. As will be shown momentarily, chapter six
includes full discussion of both qualitative and quantitative results in
order to build the bridge between the assumptions and the purpose of this
dissertation.
5.8 Conclusion
The above presentation of the qualitative and quantitative results,
gives a hint about the nature of the discussion in the following chapter.

304

However, based on the results, people may be impacted by the culture
and religion when perceiving the notion of freedom of expression.
Further, participants with similar ages from the two countries share the
same view of freedom of expression. The latter indicates that age plays
crucial role in shaping people’s perception of freedom of expression.
Lastly, in regard to the participants’ awareness of freedom of expression
legislation, according to the quantitative phase, the majority of
participants of both countries are aware of the legislation. On the other
hand, based on qualitative analysis, although participants from both
countries repeatedly mentioned that they are aware of the legislation of
the freedom of expression, these legislations seem to be unclear and vague
for them.

305

Chapter 6
Discussion

6.1 Introduction
The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the differences and
similarities in Kuwait and South Africa in regards to the perceptions of
freedom of expression of old and young generations from each nation and
how it is influenced by certain contexts (i.e. cultural, and religious. The
research also sheds light on the awareness of the public in regards to the
notion of freedom of expression and the policies and regulations of
freedom of expression. In particular, freedom of expression includes the
control of writing/publishing, access to information, and access to
information through new media - the Internet.

Another aspect to be

discussed through conducting the current comparative study is the
difference in the awareness of each nation’s citizens about the legislation
of freedom of expression in their country. Finally, this study investigates
legislation concerning freedom of expression in both countries in order to

306

have in-depth understanding of how each nation protects and controls
freedom of expression.
At this stage it seems appropriate to seek the relationship among
those facets of the current results. However, in order to clearly present the
discussion, it is easier to start by discussing the qualitative results of each
country followed by the discussion of the quantitative results. The last
section is the comparative analysis of the results of both countries. This
analysis allows for better understanding of similarities and differences
between the two nations in regard to the spectrum of the notion of
freedom of expression.
Statistical analyses revealed several key findings. For the first set of
predictor variables (the age of the participants), data analyses indicated a
positive relationship between proportion of the age and the perception of
freedom of expression.
6.2 Overview of the problem
This research examines how culture and religion may impact how
older and younger generations perceive the notion of freedom of
expression in the digital-technology era.

The study compares South

Africa as a Western-based values country and Kuwait as an Islamic

307

country. To better understand the influence of culture and religion on
people’s perception of freedom of expression the study compared
legislations concerning freedom of expression and its limitations in each
country and examined the views and perceptions of people. Accordingly,
the following main questions were investigated:
1.

How do certain cultural values impact citizens’ perception of

freedom of expression between generations in both countries?
2.

How do religion views impact citizens’ perception of freedom of

expression between generations in both countries?
3.

How do the younger and older generations perceive the legislation

that protects and controls freedom of expression?
Three hypotheses were tested in the methodology. All hypotheses
are consistent for each of the countries selected for the study.
The first hypothesis tested in this research was that there is a positive
relationship between age and the perception of limitation of freedom of
expression. This hypothesis assumed that in both countries, the young

308

generation supports more freedom of expression, while the senior
generation generally supports restrictions on freedom of expression.
The second hypothesis in this research is that there is a positive
relationship between the role of the Internet and the citizens’ perception of
freedom of expression. I assumed that in the Internet era, the younger
generation tends to call for more freedom of expression, while the older
generation favors more limitations on freedom of expression.
The last hypothesis tested in this research is that the awareness and
perception of freedom of expression by the younger and older generations
about the current legal framework that protects and controls freedom of
expression is different. My assumption is that the younger generation
views the legislations as too strict, whereas, the older generation supports
restrictions on freedom of expression.
6.3 Review of the Methodology
In order to examine the complexity of the topic of freedom of expression,
the study was decided to be an international and comparative study.
Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to collect and
analyze the data. The methodology of the current research required

309

mixed-methods to gather relevant data from specific documents and
participants.
By applying these mixed methods, I designed a survey as a
quantitative method. As for the qualitative method, there were openended questions in the survey.

Furthermore, focus-groups were

employed as another qualitative method in the research. The sample of
the current study consisted of 80 participants. The sample consisted of 40
participants from South Africa and 40 participants from Kuwait. Ages
ranged from 18-65 years old. The number of the focus group participants
was varied from 8 to 30 participants in each group.
More importantly, both quantitative and qualitative analyses were
included in the analysis of citizen’s perception of freedom of expression,
including descriptive analysis and statistical testing. A part of the
descriptive analysis there is interwoven with analysis of legal documents
(e.g. Articles in the Constitution pertaining to freedom of expression).
Together, qualitative and quantitative analyses were employed to analyze
cultural and religious factors that shape the notion of freedom of
expression among older and younger citizens in both nations. Results
from quantitative and qualitative methods were analyzed, connected, and

310

interpreted to better understand citizens’ perception of freedom of
expression.

6.4 Qualitative Discussion
This section presents the content analysis of the focus groups and the
open-ended questions, in addition to describing the themes were found in
each method separately.
6.4.1 Focus group themes
As mentioned earlier in the methodology chapter that one of the
qualitative data collecting methods is the focus groups. Below is a
description and analysis of six focus groups, three from South Africa and
three from Kuwait. I employed content analysis in order to analyze the
gathered data. After analyzing the data, I will compare the six groups to
find out similarities and differences.
As

mentioned

earlier

in

the

methodology

chapter,

qualitative data has been analyzed using content analysis. Content
analysis may be carried out in many different ways and no rules are set
about what to do first. Weber (1990) says this clearest when he said that

311

“there is no simple right way to do content analysis. Instead, investigator
must judge what methods are most appropriate for their substantive
problem” (p.13). Given this, I selected thematic content analysis in order
to make build the steps and extract the main themes of the text. Though, it
is important to indicate that I followed the traditional and basic steps of
the content analysis. In particular, after collecting the qualitative data the
below steps were followed:
-

Finding general themes for each country separately.

-

Relating the themes to the questions of the focus group and open-ended
questions

-

Finding common themes in both groups; South Africa and Kuwait

-

Creating certain themes based of the groups of each country

-

Categorizing participants’ answers under the themes.

Expectedly, there is one theme that appeared in answers of the
Kuwaitis participants. The theme is that Kuwaitis referred to their holy
book as Muslim people, which is the “Quran.” For South Africans, the
majority of the participants are Christian as statistics show that most of

312

the South African population follows Christian faiths (Zegeye and Harris,
2002).
The participants did not refer to the “Bible.” Important information
to be mentioned is that because of the cultural differences and the
sensitive nature of the topic the directions of the focus groups were
different between Kuwait and South Africa. The nature and the purpose
of the questions were the same, though, the reformations of the questions
was slightly different. And accordingly, it was a challenging task to unify
the themes of the focus groups of both countries. I tried to ask each group
the question differently so that I can get the data I need for my research
questions. Table 2 shows the extracted themes.

6.4.2

Focus groups discussion

6.4.2.1 South Africa
In terms of the South African participants, I conducted three focus
groups. In particular, each group includes a different number of
participants with different age range. Collecting data from South African
participants started in the Fall of 2013 when a group of South African
graduate

students

visited

Milwaukee,

Wisconsin.

Accordingly,

I

313

conducted the first focus group. For South Africa, the first group included
27 participants; their ages vary from 28 to 45 years. The interview with the
participants took around 80 minutes. As mentioned in Methodology
chapter that we conducted the other two focus groups through Skype. The
second focus group also consisted of 12 younger people from (Add
university name). Their ages range from 21 to 40 years. The duration of
this interview was 45 minutes. The third and last group included 8 people,
their ages varied between 23-30 years. The interview lasted for 45 minutes.
It is important to indicate that the three groups included male and female
participants, though gender is not main variable in this research

Group number: 1

Time: 2:30 pm
Participants: South African student
Number of participants: 27

314

Gender of participants: Male and female
Age of participants: 28-45
Duration of meeting: 80 minutes

1. Definition of freedom of expression
When I asked the participants about the notion of freedom of
expression, a number of participants interacted with the questions. One
participant (1) answered “what you feel about the presented and ministers
the way you like”. Other participant (2) said “what you want to say but
you should be responsible about the things you express”. Other
participant (3) said “you express your opinion with no hostility or
defamation”. When I asked about how Internet impacts freedom of
expression, all of them said that they already had freedom before the
Internet. One participant (4) said “you should do no harm when you use
internet”. One participant (5) posited “in South Africa we have different
notions of freedom of expression and almost everyone has different
perception so that’s why we are using social networks differently based

315

on our understanding of freedom”. The usage of the Internet and
censorship
When I asked about people’s misuse of the Internet and the idea of
restricting the Internet, one participant claimed that “there are no
restrictions and we are happy that there are no restrictions”. Only one
participant (1) posited “I will be very happy if authority restricts all
pornography, because minors might be in danger”. One participant (2)
said that “there are some governmental organizations and institutions
have their own policies about pornography”. Another participant argued
that Internet education is more important than censorship in order to
increase the awareness among people about the danger of the Internet.
One participant (3) angrily claimed that it is not the government
business to control Internet; instead, it is parents’ responsibility to monitor
their kids.

All of the participants agreed to have some restrictions to

protect national security only. One said that” we have a double standard
because in real life for example we have restrictions on some illegal
drugs”. Majority of the participants are against censorship and agreed
that education is better than restriction.

316

2. Religion and freedom of expression
When I asked about religion and freedom, a participant (1) claimed
that because in South Africa there are a lot of religious groups we cannot
decide the meaning and values of freedom since every group has different
values. One other participant (2) said that in a way religion has an impact
on freedom, he claimed that religions vary for the freedom that they
allowed; even within one religion there are different sanctions who
understand freedom differently.
3. The usage of the Internet by younger and older generations
When asking participants about how younger members of society
use the Internet, participant (1) replied that “younger people are very
skillful when it comes to technology”. Another participant (2) said “older
people were raised not to talk about politics and church but younger
people are more open to say their opinion very freely in social network;
the younger generation has a better opportunity because they have the
freedom to talk”. Two participants (3) and (4) agreed that teenagers are
responsible when using the Internet. One participant (5) said that the

317

younger generation should have freedom to participate in all aspects in
life to draw future.

Group number: 2
Date: November 13, 2013
Sitting: Skype
Time: 8:00 Am – Milwaukee time
Participants: South African student
Number of participants: 12
Gender of participants: Male and Female
Age of participants: 21-40
Duration of meeting: 45 minutes

1. Definition of freedom of expression

318

Similar to the first group, the second group interacted well with the
first general question was about the notion of freedom of expression. The
answers vary, but each participant in the group identified the same
meaning. Basically, the participants believe that freedom of expression is
to freely express you opinion through any means of media. Though,
despite the fact that all participants agreed upon the meaning of freedom
of expression, there were some differences regarding how one can express
his/her opinion. As an example, one of the participants said that
“freedom of expression is to express your opinion freely and say anything
you want.” While another participant argued that even though freedom of
expression is to say your opinion freely, one still needs to make sure that
he/she does not disrespect others by their opinion. As the participant
said, “you can freely express yourself as long as you don’t disrespect
others”.” Another participant agreed with the latter participant by saying
“you should be free to express your opinion freely but without causing no
harm others.”
2. Restrictions on freedom of expression by the government
After that, the first question led to questioning the participants
about if freedom of expression must be restricted by rules and regulations.

319

Several participants agreed that there must guidelines to clarify the
boundaries but not regulations. As one of the participants (1) clarified,
“there must guidelines but not policies and nor regulations but only
guidelines because regulations infringe the right of freedom of
expression.”
Later, the focus of the third question was specifically about
controlling the Internet.

Mostly, participants’ reactions were little

different from their reaction to the second question.

Participants

discussed that people must be able to use the Internet freely but there
must be kind of protection especially in regard to National Security,
pornography, and defamation. One of the participants (2) said “we need
to use internet freely without being defamed or cause harm to other, and
also without having pornography posted online.” Another participant
focused on the importance of restrictions on the Internet when it comes to
protecting the National Security of the country. The participant (3)
mentioned “there must restrictions on the Internet for National Security—
so we protect the country from terrorism.”

320

Purposely, at this time I tried to evoke the discussion by asking
about the need for policies in South Africa. This question is quite similar
the earlier question about the regulations on the Internet, but since I did
not get adequate answers for the question, I reformed it. Accordingly, one
of the participants (17) claimed that there are already some forms of
control by the South African government. The participant gave an
example of a few recent cases where the government prosecuted someone
in charged for defamation on Facebook. The participant (17) described the
cases as harsh ones and said “that’s why there must be some control and
guidelines for Internet and freedom of expression”.” Another participant
(18) argued that there should be legislation to protect human rights but as
the participants (18) posited “everyone decide what harmful to them and
avoid it based on their values and the government should not interfere.”
3. Internet and freedom of expression
From there the next question was about if the free access to
information through the Internet would impact the notion of freedom of
expression. The way the question was through seemed unclear for the
participants, where the session witnessed a moment of silent and
whisperings. To clarify for the participants, the question was formed as do

321

you think the Internet (Access to all websites) impact freedom of
expression? And does the internet give you more freedom? The
participants started to interact again, mostly focusing on how Internet
increases citizens’ participation in the political sphere. One of the
participants (4) claimed that “the Internet enhances freedom of
expression.”

The same participant (4) explained, “the Internet helps

people in South Africa easily participate in the political environment.”

Since the participants specifically focused on how the Internet increases
their political freedom, the following question was about how the Internet
increases citizens’ involvement in the political sphere. One participant (7)
said, “I think it helps us to participate in political views and discuss
politics with many expert people.” Another participant (8) argued that the
older generation teaches the younger people some political issues without
giving them the chance to think freely, so through the Internet younger
people can see other political opinions and choose freely whatever they
want to follow. To support the pervious argument, this participant (8)
said that the Internet helps younger generation to be discovering new

322

ideas and think freely about politics because some younger people follow
their parents point of views, thus, the Internet broadens their views.
Looking to the issues differently, one of the participants (9)
mentioned that in spite of the fact that the Internet increases and eases
people’s participation in the political environment, it also increases bias
between people. As the participant reasoned that

the Internet gives the

chance equally to educated and not educated or unqualified people to
participate; thus, some discussions will certainly be biased and subjective.
Finally, the participants showed their anger because of the inappropriate
application freedom of expression legalizations.

4. Freedom of expression in the South African Constitution
Therefore to avoid changing the direction of the discussion, I went
to ask new question the notion of freedom of expression in the South
African Constitution and about if the participants think that they need
more freedom in South Africa. The provoking question was answered
adequately.

323

Most of the participants believe that the legislation in South Africa,
including the Constitution, fairly protects the right of freedom of
expression. Though, the problem as the participants believe is laid in the
application of the legislation. One participant (6) claimed that “we have
policies and many freedoms in the Constitution but it is not implies
appropriately, so the legislation are good but not good application of
them”
One of the participants (15) thought that they need more freedom
of expression in South Africa due the era of suppression and racialism that
they have been through. Another participant (5) argued “we should deal
with what we already have because we have good legalization and
Constitution but we should work on better application of freedoms.” One
more participant added that “we should believe that we can’t have the
freedom to access all information.”
5. The impact of religion and social norms on freedom of expression
To manage the session’s time, so a new question about the relation
between culture, religion, and social norms with the notion of freedom of
expression was asked. Specifically, the question was; do you think there is

324

relation between culture, religion and religious norms and the use of the
internet?
When the question was asked, it took a while for the participants to
interact. One of the participants (10) started to answer enthusiastically by
arguing that one should not be deprived to access any information but at
the same time, as the participant mentioned “within your ethics and
values you should know what is right and what is wrong.
The question about social and religious norms led the session to
start the discussion about who is responsible for the protection of
children. In responding to this question, the participants focused on three
main aspects; parents, government, and education. In particular, one of
the participants (11) argues that it is more parents’ responsibility to teach
their kids what is right and wrong based on the family value system. The
same participant (11) added parents should teach their kids what the
harmful materials are. Another participant (12) interrupted and said that
parents will not be able to control their kids without the help and
intervention of the government. Another two participants (13) and (14)
added to the discussion the importance role of the education. In

325

particular, one participant (13) claimed that “we stop teaching religion in
schools so that religion classes should be replaced by a course about ethics
in information to guide students on usage of the Internet.” Another
participant (14) agreed that children should be guided about information
technology and the internet.
6. The usage of the Internet by younger and older generations
At this point, while participants were discussing children and
technology education it was reasonable to ask a question about the
differences between the older and younger generations in regard to the
use of the Internet. The majority of the participants said that younger
people are more expert in using the Internet and technology. One
participant (15) claimed that “older people don’t use technology as
younger because we don’t know how to use it.” Another participant (16)
discussed the behaviors of some younger people when they use the
Internet by saying that “younger also how to hide in anonymous names or
use nickname and say and do whatever they want”
7. The impact of the Internet on the morality

326

At this stage of the session I realized that the participants fairly
answered the question about the impact of the Internet on the freedom of
expression and on the political life, so I changed the direction of the
session to discover other areas of impact of the Internet. Hence, I asked if
the participants think that the Internet may impact the morals of the
society. Participants were silent for a while when the question was asked;
I tried to give example to make it clearer for them but there was only one
participant who interacted with this question. The participant (1)
explained that there are few cases where crimes were committed because
of social media, especially for kids because they lack awareness of the
dangers of social media.

Group number: 3

Sitting: online - Skype
Time: 9:30 am – Milwaukee time

Duration of meeting: 45minutes

1. Definition of freedom of expression
The first general provoking question was what you know about the
notion of freedom of expression and how you define it. The discussion
started with one of the participants (1) saying that “I think its freedom to
access information, participate and communicate in social media, express
your opinion anywhere any time. Another participant (2) supported the
answer by claiming that “say anything and say what you want freely with
no restrictions.” In order to understand what the participants meant by
saying “saying anything you want” I asked how you express your
opinion? Is it in certain way?. The answers varied between saying what I
want “the way I like” and “I say it carefully.” One of the participants

328

(3)discussed that freedom of expression means saying the thing you want
in the way you like, while another participant (4) interfered and argued
that one should be careful when expressing his/her opinion. Conversely
at this point, minor or transitional questions would sometimes stimulate
dynamic wide-ranging discussion and much interaction among the
participants. Therefore, I asked if there is a need for restrictions to control
freedom of expression. A participant (5) argued that if everyone can talk
freely but carefully and with considering the consequences of what
he/she says, there will not be a need for policies or restrictions. Because
this is the real meaning of freedom of expression as the participant added.
To energize the discussion more about the restrictions I asked again if the
participants have any thought about the restriction policy or if they think
that policies are considered to be a contradiction to the right freedom of
speech. One of the participants (3) started talking about the negative
impact of the restrictions on the citizens, as the participant (3) said “the
problem of control you will create paranoid citizens so it’s better to let
them free to release tensions, besides people should have option to
express their self.” Further, another participant (5) indicated to the same
point of contradiction, as the participant said “if you create a policy to

329

control people that’s mean that you will add something that contradict
your Constitution, so we need just guidelines.” Interestingly, one of the
participants (6) claimed that censorship is the real freedom.

As the

participant (6)t literally said “censorship system proves freedom because
if people know their boundaries and know what to say so this is real
freedom.”
2.

Restrictions on freedom of expression by the government
To get some clarifications about what participants’ opinions were

about being cautious and careful, I asked if there is a policy that explain
things that not are allowed to be said or any policy that defines the word
defamation for example. One participant (6) said that “I think they explain
it our Constitution and there is no other place they explain to us- like no
accessible policy that explain what is defamation”. The latter explanation
led to us to as how do you think government increase the awareness
among citizens about what is allowed to be said and what is not allowed.
One participant (2) discussed that government should find a way to teach
people about it. In responding to the latter participant, another participant
argued that government may find difficulty increasing the awareness

330

among all people especially that some people will not be able to access to
the Internet.

3. Internet and freedom of expression
As the participants seemed too silent when I asked about religion,
the next question was about the purpose of using social networks.
Specifically if social networks mostly used for socializing, entertainment,
or participating in the political sphere. The participants generally agreed
that social networks are mainly for communicating with other people and
to express their opinion. Just one participant (8) said that “we can use
social network to get information and news.” One of the participants (4)
argued that the communication between people is easier through social
networks. Two participants (5) and (6) have agreed that communication
and the expression of opinions is easy through social networks.
Interference from another two participants (2) and (3) argued that even if
one can communicate and express opinion freely through social networks,
there must be a kind of caution. In particular, one participant (2)
mentioned “I’m cautious about what I say in Twitter because I know that

331

some people have took to jail so I don’t want to go through this that’s why
I’m very careful about what I say.” Another participant (3) lent additional
support to the ideas of the cautious participant by explaining that it is
difficult to justify your opinion on social networks so some people may
misunderstand and as a result you may end up in jail.
Another participant (9) added that social networks are for
expressing our opinion freely, and as the participant gave example
“Twitter is used for expressing opinion about everything whether you like
or don’t like it”

4. Freedom of expression in the South African Constitution
Since the participants mentioned the South African Constitution
several times, I asked about what the participant think about the South
African Constitution and if the Constitution protects freedom of
expression fairly. Most of the participants said that South Africa fairly
protects the right of freedom of expression. A participant (1) said that “we
have good Constitution and we can say whatever we want.” In
supporting the previous participant, another participant (2) discussed that

332

South Africa has a good Constitution that protects the right of freedom of
expression and creating a policy to control freedom of expression is a
reasonable idea in order to increase people’s awareness of the meaning of
freedom of expression.
5. The impact of religion and social norms on freedom of
expression
After getting a good amount of information about the freedom of
expression policies and the Constitution, I threw question about the
relation between religion and freedom of expression, very few
participants expressed their opinions about this matter. The first
participant (7) who talked about the topic said that there is connection
between religion and practicing freedom of expression because religions
have a lot of values. The other participant agreed that there is relation
between freedom of expression and freedom of expression and explained
that “in terms of religion, there are regulations in which regulate what to
say and how to say it.”
When I asked about how culture and religion impact people’s use
of the Internet, participants seemed to be quiet and willing to answer just

333

like group number (2). Surprisingly, one of the participants (8) insisted
that religion and culture impact the way people practice freedom. The
same participant added “one should practice freedom by focusing on
his/her values.”
6. The usage of the Internet by younger and older generations
Turning to the differences between younger and older generations
in regard with using the Internet and technology, I asked about the
differences and I found all participants agreed that there are significance
differences. As one of the participants (1) explained, there is a difference
because older people did not study technology and do not use social
media except for seeing someone didn’t see for long time but younger
generation love social media to communicate with each other and find
new friends. Another participant (4) gave a personal example saying that
“my grandparent uses the Internet to check on medication or look for
places to spend a holiday, so they just use it for these needs”. Another
participant (2) explained the topic on personal level as well by saying that
“my parents against Internet so I use it cautiously and as I see that
younger generation post anything, like for example any pictures with no

334

restrictions and this is wrong use of social media, if I may call it this way”.
Likewise, a participant (6) discussed that the older generation considers
their values when using the Internet, whereas, the younger generation
expert of the Internet and technology are not careful when using them.
Interestingly, participants looked to the issue differently by relating the
use of the use of the Internet with the level of the education by articulating
that “the use of the Internet or the technology in general depends on the
level of the users’ education and not only the age.” Accordingly, I asked
the participant to explain more, and he clarified by saying that the more
educated is the user, the wiser use of technology and the Internet.
1. The impact of the Internet on the morality
I turned to ask about the impact of the Internet on the morality of
the society and if it is a negative or positive impact. One participant (7)
interacted by saying that discussing freedom of expression in regard to
morals is such complicated topic because the participant explained, it
depends how one practice freedom; besides, one should certainly respect
the moral of the whole society when practicing his/her freedom. At that
moment, another participant (3) argued, “that’s why we need to increase
the awareness among younger people in regard to the Internet use.” The

335

respondent continued to say “we need more awareness about freedom
because younger have no awareness about freedom they need to be warn
and apparently older people have more awareness of the dangers of the
Internet and technology.”
6.4.2.1.1 General notes and limitations about content analysis results
-

Participants see that there are weak connections between religion
and freedom of expression.

-

Participants think that culture has more impact than religion on the
perception of freedom of expression. Participant referred culture to
each family’s rules.

-

Participants refuse all kind of restrictions on freedom of expression
except those to protect national security.

-

Participants seemed to be very talkative about freedom of
expression and proud of the amount of freedom they have.

-

Younger participants change their minds about one topic either
because they feel embarrassed or afraid of the authority.

-

Participants focused on politics and economy. They mentioned
several time that citizens should respect all political parties.

336

Regarding economic issues, discussed that poor rural will not be
able to access all information since they do not have the ability to
have smart phones or computers.
-

Participants talked less about religions and morals. They seemed to
avoid talking about such issues and tried to give very specific
answers.

-

The direction and the questions of the three sessions were different
based on the nature of each session. Group (2) and (3) seemed to
talk less and needed provoking questions in ordered to stimulate
the discussion

-

Questions about morals seemed to be unclear for the participants,
so examples were illustrated to clarify the nature of the questions.

6.4.2.1.2 Unexpected Results: Focus groups- South African Participants
Some answers of the participants were unexpected and slightly
related to the purpose of the study; though these answers helped to
comprehensively understand the situation in South Africa. Surprisingly,
three participants in Group number 1 indicated to the relation between
economy status of the citizens and the right of freedom of expression. For
more illustration, one of the participants explained about “technological

337

restrictions.” The participant posited that there is no Internet in poor rural
areas, where people will not have the chance to express their opinions or
participate in any field. Likewise, another participant (5) discussed the
classes in South African society. Participant (5) said that because there are
economic problems (i.e., rich and poor) poor people cannot participate in
any field. He added South Africans still suffer from lack of education in
rural areas. He literary said “they don’t have even computers”. One final
economic issued was mentioned by one of the participants who claimed
that the Internet in South Africa is manipulated by one company; this
company was partially owned by the State until the year 2007.
It is important to mention that explaining the economy factor is not
part of the current study and was unexpected during focus group.
6.4.2.2 Kuwait
Parallel to South Africa, in Summer/2012, I conducted three
different focus groups in Kuwait. Each group includes a different number
of participants with different age range. For more illustration, participants
in the first group were 8 Kuwaiti citizens from different institution who
range in age from 46-60 years. Interviewing the participants of the first

338

group took 80 minutes. The second focus group consisted of 20 younger
students in Kuwait University (KUNIV). The age range of the second
group was 19-35. The duration of the interviews with (KUNIV) students
was 80 minutes. The third and last group included 15 students from
(KUNIV), their ages were between 19-23 years. The duration of the
interview with the older group was 80 minutes. It is important to indicate
that all 6 focus groups consisted of both male and female participants
though gender is not a main variable in this research.

Group number: 1
Date: July 20th, 2012
Sitting: onsite
Time: 3:00 pm
Participants: Kuwaiti employees
Number of participants: 8
Gender of participants: male and female

339

Age of participants: 46-60
Duration of meeting: 80 minutes
1. Definition of freedom of expression
The opening question I asked was how the participants would
define freedom of expression. The eight participants all agreed that
freedom of expression is to express your opinion freely but with
limitations. Five of the eight participants believed that one should express
his/her opinion freely but without crossing the authority’s limitations.
The same five participants emphasized the importance of expressing the
opinion should not be against the religion. As participant (1) mentioned “I
can express my opinion but there is framework based on my personal
values and the authority’s limitations and all citizens should commit to
these limitations” Surprisingly, participant (1) continued to say that “there
must be rules to restrict all people’s freedom and even if they don’t like
country’s restrictions they should follow them and don’t break the laws”.
Likewise, participant (2) discussed that freedom of expression to is:
express opinion without going against the religion. Participant (2) added
that “one cannot but impose his/her opinions on other”. Participants (3),

340

(4) and (5) agreed with participants (1) and (2). As participant (3) claimed
“one can express his/her opinion freely without going against the
religion, everyone must respect the religion”. Further, participant (4)
agreed with participant (3) but adding that authority’s limitations are also
as important as respecting religion. Participant (5) also agreed with the
four previous participants and also adding that one should not hurt others
with his/her opinion.
The other three participants focused more on the notion of
expressing the opinion freely without hurting others by defamation or
blasphemy. As participant (6) argued that freedom of expression is to a
basic right for everyone equally. Additionally the participant (6) said
“freedom of expression is the ability of people to express their opinions
about anything and anyone without defaming, hurting, and degrading
anyone”. Participant (7) and (8) agreed but participant (7) argued that
people have the right to criticize freely without hurting each other.

2.

There

are

no

clear

verses

in

the

Quran

about

freedom

Almost all participants agreed upon the fact that there is no clear

341

religious verses about freedom, though number of participants indicated
to the fact that Muslims should deal with the freedom within the
boundaries set by the religion. Participant (1) gave an example; he said
that “we all know that in Islam male and female interaction is forbidden,
and in this case we should apply this into the social networks. Male and
female should not talk to each other except for educational, political, or
religion discussion.” Another older participant (4) also gave an example
about how citizens should respect and obey their presidents based on
Islamic laws and she claimed that “Twitter and Facebook should not be
used to affect the national security or to talk badly against the Amir of
Kuwait” she continued “this is not freedom at all, we call this disrespect.”
The latter participant (4) indicated to the respecting of the Amir which is
in fact one of the social commitments and legal commitments. She also
mentioned that Muslims must obey the president because Islam requires
this.
2. Restriction on freedom of expression.
On the other hand, older participants saw that self-censorship is
unfeasible especially when it comes to children. In particular, older
participants believe that self-censorship is infeasible for both young

342

members of society and adults. As mentioned earlier, conservative
participants believe that all people regardless of age need to be censored
by the country, while liberal older participants sees that children only
need to be censored by their parents and not the country. Liberals also
believe that self-censorship is feasible for because adults can control their
actions and should have the freedom to use technology the way they want
without hurting other.
However, a number of responses from younger and older
participants showed the concern about censoring the Internet.
Conservative adults think self-censorship would not work with minor
groups like children. To protect the morality of the society, participant (5)
thought that controlling direct (private) messages in any social networks
would not solve the ethical dilemma. Authority should control social
networks to a certain extent to keep the national security and protect
religions only, but other things such as (chatting and flirting) is a personal
matter and is uncontrollable. Participant (6) asked some questions to
ensure that the idea of controlling private massages by the authority is
unfeasible, as the participants stated “if the authority can see our private
messages, are they going to punish us? If they find for example that some

343

men talk sexually with women? What kind of punishments would he get?
Or maybe the authority will tell a woman that your husband is flirting
with another woman in private messages? That is really insane.”

Surprisingly participant (4) wished that there is no option for
private messages in any social networks. Additionally participant (2) said
“I don’t know what my teen kids talk through private messages and I
don’t know whom they talk to.” Another participant (3) claimed “I cannot
do anything for my kids but only warn them and watch them carefully.”
Participant (6) seemed to be more broad-minded, the participant argued
that “whatever was said in the private messages is a personal matter and
each one has his/her value system that they can decide what is allowed
and what is not”.

4. Internet and freedom of expression
Unlike younger participants, the older participants believe that
accessing any site on the Internet must be controlled either by the country
or at least parents’ responsibility. However, all participants agreed that

344

the idea of accessing any site without any restrictions was totally
unacceptable. For example participants who seemed to be more
conservative controlling the internet is the responsibility of parents and
government together. While participants who seemed to more openminded believe that only parents are responsible for controlling what their
children do with technology. Generally, open-minded participants believe
that adult users are responsible for themselves when using technology,
whereas more traditional participants believe that even adult users must
be controlled by the country.

5. Freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution
The majority of the participants believe that there exists a
fair amount freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution.
Participants believe that the Kuwaiti Constitution guaranteed freedom
of expression fairly, in spite of the restrictions on the freedoms.
Participant (1) said that “since we were born we realized that Kuwaiti
Constitution

is

protected all freedoms in addition of freedom of

expression but the older we become the more we realize that there is

345

no proper application for freedom of expression and other freedoms.”
37

6. The impact of religion and social norms on freedom of expression
The result of the content analysis shows how participants have
some inner-conflict about their religion and social norms. To be more
specific, in a Muslim country like Kuwait, there are many sacred social
norms that may be thought of as religious. There is confusion in the
Kuwaiti conservative society about some social norms to the extent that
even some Kuwaitis think of them as religious norms. For more
clarification, the interaction between males and females is socially
unacceptable in Kuwaiti society except for a clear purpose (i.e., medical,
political or educational). Yet, the matter is more complicated than it
seems, since some Kuwaitis refuse interaction even for those purposes.
Male/female interaction is socially forbidden as a social-friendship for
example, but no clear verses exist in the Quran that define the boundaries
of male/female interaction. Based on the previous confusion, participants

For more clarification, in Kuwait recently many people were imprisoned because of the violation
of the regulations. For example, a number of cases of young and old Kuwaitis talking against the
Amir of Kuwait were punished. Additionally, several cases in which some people insulted
religious symbols or discussed the issue of Shi’a and Sunna were prosecuted.
37

346

in group (1) defined the meaning of freedom of expression unclearly
within the religious and the cultural frames. Additionally, the result
showed that because the participants are already confused about their
religion and culture, they cannot clearly understand how freedom of
expression is defined by religion and culture.

7. The usage of the Internet by younger and older generation
Listening to the older generation’s opinion in group (1) about the
notion of freedom of expression, one can notice how older participants
want it to be controlled. Though, that does not mean all older participants
call for more restrictions on freedom of expression. Particularly, as
mentioned above a number of older open-minded participants have a
more open view of freedom of expression.
Again, the participants defined freedom of expression as the
freedom to speak, write, and act freely but that the country should have
restrictions to protect national security and social morality. As participant
(2) mentioned “the amount of freedom of expression in Kuwait is ruined
our children morals. They can contact each other by phones, they can

347

watch any movie, any pictures, chatting with whomever they want and no
one knows they type of things they are doing.” 38
Most of the participants appreciate freedom but showed fears
about how children use technology. Participant (8) discussed that the
amount of freedom of expression Kuwaitis have causes a lot of trouble.
The participant gave an example about how Kuwaiti people fight with
each other on Twitter and Facebook about political matters such as the
Amir of Kuwait and Shi’a and Sunna issues. Participant (3) and
participant (4) indicated to the importance of the regulations that control
the use of technology in Kuwait. It is important to emphasis on the fact
that before the Arab Spring, Kuwaitis

39would

not discuss the issue of

Shi’a and Sunna since both sects live together peacefully in Kuwait.
Nevertheless, after the political conflicts in the Arab region such issues of
Shi’a and Sunna became very sensitive. More importantly, the use of
social networks in Kuwait ease the discussion about Shi’a and Sunna and
users find it easier to talk freely and sometimes cross the boundaries of
polite communication while talking about this sensitive issue. As a result,
38

As a conservative society, most of Kuwaiti parents considered the easy communication between
kids and easy access of information caused by the Internet would negatively affect kids’ behavior.

networks.

Unexaggeratedly, political and religious discussion is literally transferred
to ‘war talk’.

8. The impact of the Internet on the morality
Likewise, participants of this group are more orthodox when
discussing social norms. A discussion between two participants showed
the fear of losing the social norms of the Kuwaiti society and impossibility
of living without technology. The discussion started when participant (3)
who insisted that “we don’t want a freedom that change our social
norms.” The latter statement stimulated participant (6) to ask the group
“do you want us to live without Internet and technology?”. Surprisingly,
participant (3) answered “no way.”

Group number: 2
Date: July 24th, 2012
Sitting: onsite

349

Time: 3:00 pm
Participants: Kuwaiti student (KUNIV)
Number of participants: 20
Gender of participants: male and female
Age of participants: 19-35
Duration of meeting: 80 minutes
1. Definition of freedom of expression
I started the session by through the general question about how
participants defined freedom of expression. Most of the participants said
that freedom of expression is express our opinion freely but without
crossing the authority of religion limitations. In particular, participant (1)
said that freedom of expression is a basic right for everyone to say what
he/she thinks. Participant (2) agreed with participant (1) by saying
everyone should be able to express his/her opinion freely. As participant
(2) mentioned “we should even be able to criticize government freely
without limitations”. Participant (3) disagreed with participant (2) by
claiming that there must be limitations for freedom of expression.

350

Participant (4) agreed with participant (3) by saying “it is impossible to
have obsolete freedom, so limitations are necessary to avoid any chaos in
the society”
2. There are no clear verses in the Quran about freedom
The younger participants not only believe that there are no relevant
verses about freedom, but most of the participants strongly believe that
there is nothing in religion about freedom. Participant (4) claimed that
“the use of social networks is totally personal freedom.” Other participant
(6) discussed that Muslims should not do what Islam prohibits even with
technology and social networks. At the same time, he mentioned “who
knows Islam very well, he/she can know how to use technology.”
Surprisingly, in spite of the fact that personal freedom is protected in the
Kuwaiti Constitution, Kuwaiti society would not accept any act that
opposes Kuwaitis social norms, legal commitments, or Islamic rules.
3. Restriction on freedom of expression
Younger participants think that self-censorship is feasible and also
believe that the idea of self-censorship shows respect and trust to the users
of the Internet. One of the young female participants, (10), asked “why the

351

country does not let us control ourselves and leave the rest to God,
because he is the only one who can judge us. The matter is between the
person and his God. The country cannot always keep an eye on us and
deal with us as children.”
Generally speaking, younger participants, even if they are
conservative, believe that self-censorship is feasible. As one of the
participant (8) claimed, “if Muslim has strong foundation and value
system, he/she will know how to use the Internet without any violation to
the Islamic rules or social norms.”
When discussing private messages in social networks, a number of
participants believe that controlling private messages in any social
networks would not solve the ethical dilemma. Some participants agreed
that authority should control social networks to protect national security
and religions as well. Other use of private messages as participants think
is considered to be a personal matter and is uncontrollable, such as
chatting and flirting. At the same time, a number of younger male
participants showed anger about how some people use private messages
and one of the younger participants (12) asked other participants “do you

352

guys use private massages? Can I ask you how? Are you sure that you are
not flirting with girls in private messages?” Apparently, the question was
very embarrassing for the whole group and the led to quiet in the room.
4.

Internet and Freedom of expression
The younger generation agreed that accessing any website is a

personal matter; most of them indicated that people should use selfcensorship. Participant (13) and (15) were more broad-minded; they
believe that every person should have his/her own value system. They
argued that what might be forbidden for one person might be allowed for
another one. They gave examples of the interaction with females through
technology.
5. Freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution
Most of the participants are aware of the amount of the freedom of
expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution, though, they were cautious about
this topic. Participant (10) claimed that “Kuwait is well known among all
Arabian countries of protecting individual freedoms, but unfortunately
the protection is only written on papers and either no
application or authority apply it inappropriately.”

practical

353

6. The impact of religion and social norms on freedom of expression
When asked about the impact of religion and social norms, one of
the participants started to discuss male-female interaction as an example.
The participant (9) mentioned that based on Kuwaiti social norms, males
and females cannot interact even in the educational environment but as he
said “this is not truly in Islam, instead, Islam allows male and female to
interact with respect in educational or political fields” he continued,
“because our social norms do not allow us as males to interact with
females, its undeniable to say that most of males and females chatting
with each other in Twitter and Facebook through private messages.”
Another young male participant (4) asked “Why they don’t want us to
know each other through social networks? Isn’t that good way to know
girls and to propose to them?”.
As noticed, most of the younger participants believe that there is
chaos in understanding freedom of expression within religion and culture.
One female participant (20) posited “talking to guy through social
networks is totally personal matter, not culture or even religion can do
anything about it.” Younger generations strongly believe that in culture
there are a lot of restrictions on freedom of expression, while Islam deals

354

better with freedoms. One participant (16) said “there are some general
instructions in Islam about freedom of expression and Islam is very fair
about individual freedoms, though, the emergence of Internet makes life
very complicated instead of ease it”
7. The usage of the Internet by younger and older generation
Younger participants clearly believe that freedom of expression
applies to speaking, writing, and acting and there should be few
restrictions on freedom. Most of the younger participants who call for a lot
of freedom of expression explained that a democratic country should
guarantee freedom of expression as basic right. Younger participants also
believe that each person should know how express his/her opinion based
on personal values that one learns at home with parents and family. It is
true that the Kuwaiti Constitution protects freedom of expression but it
seems young people are confused about the extent the freedom is
restricted by the Kuwaiti law.
On the other hand, young participants related freedom of
expression to harming others. Specifically, a number of participants
believe that one can enjoy her/his freedom without causing harm to other

355

individuals and the society should not be restricted and would consider it
to be something personal. One of the participants (4) said “if talking to
girls in Twitter for example does not harm anyone, why it’s not allowed?.”
Such responses indicate that most of the young participants do not realize
the fact that there are a lot of restrictions and commitments that Muslims
are advised to follow even if disobeying these commitments would not
cause harm to the people or society (i.e., Muslims should pray five times a
day, even though disobeying this will not cause harm to people or
society).
Furthermore, participants of group (2) think that freedom of
expression is protected only in the legal documents and Constitution
while freedom is absent from real life. Accordingly, participant (1) argued
that freedom of expression is only theoretically protected but on the
practical level malfunctions. Participant (2) supported participant (1) by
asking “why Kuwaiti Constitution is protected freedom of expression but
then if citizens discuss any religious or political matters, authorities would
take them to jail.” On the other hand, the only matter that almost all of the
participants agreed upon is that differences between the two major Islamic
sects Shi’a and Sunna should not be discussed in the social networks. The

356

participants think that this topic is sensitive and people might
misunderstand each other while discussing such issues.
8. The impact of the Internet on the morality
A number of the participants agreed that social norms should not
change no matter what is going on in the world. The majority of younger
participants believe that social norms should not be changed but must
adjust with technological progress. Younger participants’ responses
showed that Kuwaitis are strongly attached to their social norms. Overall,
the participants believe that fewer restrictions on freedom of expression
does not hurt. At the same time participants insisted the amount of
freedom of expression should not change the social norms. The previous
responses indicate to the inner-conflict between increasing freedoms and
the need for more restrictions to maintain social norms.
Group number: 3
Date: July 24th, 2012
Sitting: onsite
Time: 1:00 pm

357

Participants: Kuwaiti student (KUNIV)
Number of participants: 15
Gender of participants: female
Age of participants: 19-23
Duration of meeting: 80 minutes
1. Definition of freedom of expression
Like group (2), participants in group (3) believe that there must be
freedom of expression in any society but with some restrictions. As I did
in Group (1) and group (2), I started the session asking about the meaning
of freedom of expression. Three participants interacted; participant (1)
argued that freedom of expression is to express your opinions freely but
with limitations set by the country. Participant (2) added that there must
be limitations by the country to avoid chaos. Likewise, participant (3)
articulated that “even if we are Muslims, we may practice freedoms
wrongfully especially in the era of the Internet”. It was obvious that when
defining the meaning of freedom of expression, participants brought up

358

the issue of restrictions, although, my question was about the definition of
freedom of expression.
2.

There are no clear verses in the Quran about freedom of expression
I asked the participants if they believe that Islam protects freedom of

expression and if there are no clear verses in the Quran about freedom of
expression. Unsurprisingly, all of the participants believe that freedom of
expression is limited by Islam and there are some general Islamic texts
that discuss freedom of expression. Participant (1) and (5) argued that
there are some text talking about obeying the Amir and never go against
him. The participants in group (3) were hesitant to talk about freedom of
Islam because as noticed they lack information about the topic.
3. Restrictions on freedom of expression by the government
The second question was about if the government should set
limitations on the freedom of expression. Participant (4) started to answer
by saying that even if the parents have the biggest role in monitoring their
kids, they will not be able to completely do so. Therefore, participant (4)
claimed that there must be some restrictions by the government.
Participant (5) agreed by discussing that “parents always do their best to

359

control their kids’ use of the Internet but since almost everyone has smart
phones, it seems impossible to surely control their kids.”
Furthermore, participant (2) claimed that there must be limitations
especially for some websites. Participant (2) continued to explain that
these rules are mainly to emphasis on the age of the Internet users.
Participant (2) gave example by articulating that “some websites should
ask about the age so that appropriate age only can log in”. To get more
clarifications, I asked participant (2) what she meant by “some websites”
and “appropriate age” and she answered that some websites includes
medical or sexual information that is only certain age of people can access
them. Similarly, participants (5) insisted that rules are only for minors.
Almost all of the participants believe that parents cannot be
completely responsible of controlling their kids; therefore, the country
should have some laws. At the same time as the participants agreed that
the country cannot control Internet users’ private message because that
would violate the right of privacy. Private massages as the participants
think are personal matter. Participant (2) claimed that “even if there are
rules for private messages some people will still misuse freedom by

360

having a fake account and especially that Internet gives users a lot of
freedom- there must be self-censorship.”
Participant (3) also argued that some educational programs about
the use of the Internet is even better than strict limitations. Participant (3)
indicated to the importance of increasing the awareness among people of
all ages about how to use the Internet. Participant (3) posited that “there
must be programs in TV for parents and lectures in schools for children
and adolescent”. All of the participants agreed that such programs are
better and more effective than the restrictions. Participants agreed that
there are no purposeful programs to increase the awareness among people
about the use of the Internet and about the limitations and there are only
some programs that present only some simple instructions.
Generally speaking, participants believe that rules on freedom of
expression should protect the Amir and religion but should not control
other personal matters like communicating with other sex or having
relations. Participant (4) indicated that there are reasonable amount of
regulations to control freedom of expression but the problem lies in the
application of these regulations. As participant (4) literally said “the

361

authority don’t seriously punish people who infringe freedom of
expression and that’s why people don’t afraid.”
4.

Internet and freedom of expression
I asked the participants if they think that the Internet has changed

their view of freedom of expression. Most of the participants argued that
their practice of freedom is changed. For more clarifications, participant
(4) discussed that communication between male and female is allowed
only for some purposes; such as education and jobs. But with Internet as
participant (4) said “I can reply to a private massage that was sent by a
male user saying you are beautiful”. Participant (3) agreed with
participant (4), but participant (3) literally said “yes I can say thank you
for his nice words but would not go further in the conversation”.
Participant (6) strongly disagreed by claiming that we should stick to our
values and should not be impacted by the Internet, as she mentioned “if a
guy tells me nice words I should ignore him, because this is what we
supposed to do in real life.”
5. Freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution

362

I asked the participants what they think about the amount of
freedom of expression in the Kuwaiti Constitution, but I found that the
participants were skeptical when I asked the question.
Participant (4) started the argument by claiming that Kuwaiti
legislation protects freedom of expression and all other freedoms and
people are familiar with such legalization but she thought that the Internet
adds chaos. Participant (7) thought that the Kuwaiti Constitution protects
freedom of expression but the problem as she mentioned is that” people
misunderstand both the legislation and the freedoms –that’s why we need
control from authority”
6. The impact of religion and social norms on freedom of expression
When I asked the participants about if the religion and social norms
have impacted the perception of freedom of expression, it was notable that
the participants interacted fairly with the question. All of the participants
agreed that religion and social norms have strong impact on how people
perceive freedom of expression.
Participant (1) argued that peoples’ religion impacts their perception of
freedom of expression. As she argued that Muslims are impacted by

363

Islam which has a lot of restrictions. Specifically, participant (1) gave
examples of the limitations of male and female communication through
social networks. As she mentioned “I can talk to men through Twitter but
only if we will discuss something religious, political or social. I will not
talk to a man only for having fun or having relation with him”. As
noticed, the participants of group (3) were not sure enough about the
impact of religion or social norms on the notion of freedom of expression.
Participant (6) claimed that in spite of the fact that Kuwaitis are Muslims
and appreciate their social norms; some people are practicing their
freedom in isolation of their social and religious values.

7. The usage of the Internet by younger and older generations
When I asked about if the participants think there is different
between younger and older generations in using the Internet, Participant
(11) explained that the younger generation prefers to use the Internet for
entertainment and sometimes for educational purposes. Participant (11)
added that there are some younger generation misuse the Internet in the
name of freedom, but, as she said that “even older people misuse

364

freedom, some older people uses the Internet to have new relations or to
watch pornography.” Majority of the participants agreed with participant
(11) about how the younger generation uses the Internet. Participant (7)
discussed that younger generation likes to use the Internet mostly to
communicate with other people through social networks, while the older
generation would use the Internet for business or reading.
8. The impact of the Internet on the morality
The last question was about if accessing any site on the Internet is
considered to be personal freedom. I specifically gave the participants
some types of websites; gambling, pornography, and matching couples.
As I noticed, the participants became very quiet because morality issue is
sensitive especially for females. One of the participants argued that the
Internet gives a lot of freedom in which some people cross their social and
religious boundaries. Participant (3) believes that “most of the Kuwaitis
misuse the internet and also practice freedom improperly.” Participant (3)
also gave an example, she said that “Internet helps people to practice
freedom wrongfully, for instants, people talk against the Amir and
criticize Islam and think this is freedom.”

365

6.4.2.2.1 General notes and limitations on the content analysis
-

The majority of the participants in the three groups, avoid talking
about the relation between Islam and freedom of expression

-

Most of the younger and older participants have some confusion
about social and religious values

-

Younger participants avoid discussing current freedom of
expression cases and legal systems

-

Participants in the three groups have inner conflict about changing
the social norms to be in line with the new era of the Internet or to
stick to the social norms and practice freedoms of expression based
on these norms

-

Mostly, all participants in all groups are not sure of Islam indicated
to the notion of freedom of expression

-

Older and younger generation indicated to the danger of the
Internet to minors

-

Most of the participants are quite aware of the amount of freedom
of expression in the Kuwaiti legal system and the Constitutions

366

6.4.2.2.2 Unexpected Results: Focus groups- Kuwaiti Participants
The only unexpected result was that a number of older participants
thought there must not be very strict rules on the use of the Internet
because of the Internet should be based on personal values. The older
participants thought that when it came to minor using the Internet, the
parents should be responsible for controlling their children’s use of the
Internet.

6.4.3 Open ended questions
The second qualitative data collecting method was the open-ended
question which was part of the survey. Similar to the focus groups
analysis, content analysis was used to analyze the answers of the openended questions. The themes of the open-ended questions were based on
the participants’ answers.

Deriving the themes of this section was

relatively easier than focus group sections, because participants’ answers
were specific to the questions.
6.4.3.1 South Africa
A number of 40 South African participants answered the questionnaire

367

2. Internet is not dangerous
The majority of participants thought that the Internet is dangerous
when users use it inappropriately. One participant thought that the
Internet itself is not dangerous but the way human use it makes if unsafe.
As the participant wrote “the dangers exist because of human immorality.
Children pornography, online murder, exploitation, all of these things
exists, but it is human failure that causes it to be a danger.” Similarly,
another example is the beliefs of another participant who thought that the
Internet is dangerous if used irresponsibly and it depends on how one
uses the Internet. Another participant argued that the fact that the Internet
is dangerous depends on users’ skills of using it.
Another participant said, “yes, because like in many cases where
people have given their details on social networking sites have been
victims of human trafficking and other criminal activities. Then there is
the aspect of all the crime that can take place on the internet like phishing
and other related cybercrime.” Some participants mentioned that children
or people with less experience may be more vulnerable. As one
participant mentioned “it depends on the persons, their skills and what

368

they do on the internet otherwise when used probably I think it is not
dangerous at all.”
One participant surprisingly argues that it is unfair to classify the
Internet as a dangerous tool since it has many advantages. The participant
added that “one can actually say that people cause the dangerous nature
of the internet.”
Most of the participants believe that the Internet is a weapon with
two edges. As one of the participants explained, “in my opinion, the
internet is both dangerous and good depends of what you use the Internet
for. The internet may be used for academic reasons and some may use it
for knowing how to make a bomb or hacking.” One last participant
argued that the Internet has advantages and disadvantages but as he said
“the advantages of the internet greatly outweigh the disadvantages.”
One participant wrote “in my opinion, the internet is both
dangerous and good depends of what you use the internet for. The
internet may be used for academic reasons and some may use it for
knowing how to make a bomb or hacking.” Other participants focused on
the morals of the users. As they mentioned, users may use the Internet to

369

harm others, steal, view pornography or participate in gambling which
indicates to their defected value systems. As one participant wrote, “the
dangers exist because of human immorality. Child pornography, online
murder, exploitation, all of these things exists, but it is human failure that
causes it to be a danger. Morality is the primary importance in control of
any society, not censorship.” Moreover, one respondent argued that the
Internet is dangerous but for every danger there are precautions and
protections tools to lessen any dangers.
In general several answers were focused on; cybercrimes,
pornography, National security, hacking, and privacy intrusion. Mostly,
participants indicated to children who may be exposed to pornography or
may be molested through chatting with older people.

4. Internet impacts users’ social norms
The majority of participants thought that the Internet cannot impact
one’s social norms. One participant claimed that “some people when they
expose to different social norms they might question the differences and
keep asking questions that might lead to an impact on them.” Likewise,
another participant said, “yes, internet has no boundaries; it requires
internet users to control themselves when using the internet.”
A theme that was frequently mentioned in the answers is that the use
of the Internet should not be beyond ones’ social norms and value
systems. One respondent thought that the use of the Internet does not
oppose ones’ values “as long as it is used with those values in mind.”
Likewise, another participant explained that the internet does not oppose
ones’ cultural values since “this matter greatly depends on the purpose
why one uses the internet.” One participant gave examples about what
type of websites might oppose with his cultural values, he exactly

371

mentioned “no, not unless the use is in a way that directly conflicts with
my moral and value system, e.g. if I go to a pornographic website, then I
am the one who is opposing my cultural values but if I do innocent thing
like look for information, socialize with friends etc. then it does not.”
Lastly, a respondent indicated that one’s strong cultural values system
must not be negatively affected by the use of the Internet; the participant
mentioned about the value system that “if you feel strong about it your
opinion will not change.”
One respondent argued that there will be always opposition to
ones’ values on the Internet; therefore, users should avoid any
information that is against their cultural and social norms, as the
respondent said “there will always be material and comments on the
Internet that I do not approve of, but I choose not to read it, or ignore even
going to websites that I know will provoke me. People have different
opinions and I respect that. If I disagree, I will not create more conflict,
because it won’t solve anything.”
One participant related between the open nature of the Internet to
the social and cultural norms by saying that the Internet certainly opposes

372

her norms because the Internet has no boundaries and that’s why as the
participant mentioned that Internet users must control themselves when
using the Internet to make sure their usage will not go beyond their social
and cultural norms.
In the same vein, a participant mentioned that the Internet does not
oppose his cultural values “as this matter greatly depends on the purpose
why one uses the internet.” Likewise, another respondent discussed that if
the person knows how to use it the Internet, then it will not oppose
his/her cultural values.
Two respondents thought that the Internet is a positive impact their
culture norms by opening their eyes to other cultures. As the first
respondent wrote that the Internet “broadens my cultural horizons.” The
other participant said “culture is mostly about expressing who you are
and the Internet gives you this other outlet to do so.” Lastly on of the
participant mentioned that Internet does not impact social norms but did
some changes. As the participant said, “Not really. It just lessens the
normal means of communicating face-to-face”

5. Your religion have an opinion about Internet
The majority of participants thought that there is no connection

personal matter and even if each religion allows a certain degree of
freedom, it will remain a personal matter when it comes to using the
Internet.

6. You have religious opinion about Internet
The majority of participants have no religious opinion about the
Internet. South Africa is secular country and there are a lot of religions but
Christianity has the highest percentage among other religions (i.e., Islam,

374

Judaism, Hindu, and others). On the other hand, some participants
expressed their opinions about the relation between religions and the
Internet by focusing on self-censorship. Those participants were talking
about how one’s strong religious foundation would guide him/her while
using the Internet. One of the participants mentioned “if the access to
information about the world threatens your religious convictions then you
are not truly devout or religious. True faith cannot be changed or
challenged with information.” Similarly, another participant argued that
if people have control of themselves when accessing some websites, their
morality will not be affected by the use of the Internet. As the participant
wrote “No, as long as the individual themselves control what they access
and what they view on the internet, the Internet does not then influence or
guide people in a opposite direction from their cultural norms, morals and
values.”
On the other hand, some participants said that the Internet should
be used based on ones’ religious rules.

In particular, one of the

participants indicated the importance of avoiding information and
websites that contradict with ones’ religious thoughts. As the participant
claimed “I believe that if you use the Internet for the right reasons, it will

375

provide you with more advantages than disadvantages. I choose to ignore
websites that differ from my own beliefs, as this might lead me to start
questioning my own values and beliefs. Many good websites exist that
make up for the bad ones.” Likewise, a participant discussed that one
must use the Internet within his/her religious values.
Specifically, only one participant discussed how different religions are
in regard to the restrictions of the free access in the Internet, as the
participant mentioned “I think that some religions are quite restrictive in
the use of internet. Some people of a certain religion may not be allowed
to access some information content, especially information that goes
against their religion.”
Interestingly, one of the participants has transformed her answer
about religion to the conflict between the bad versus the good. The
participant discussed the importance of commitment to the religion as
well. She also mentioned that based on her religion, the Internet may
cause harm to people if they misuse it. As the participant wrote “I feel that
the internet has changes the world irreversibly. In both good and bad
way, in a good way, that information to build knowledge has become

376

more easily obtainable. But in a bad way, where people with bad
intentions have exploited the internet to benefit them. I have heard of
many relationships to end because of cheating through the internet.
People who gambling debt that lost everything because it was so easy just
to sign up with a credit card on a gambling site. I have also heard of
broken marriages where pornography was the reason and even the
availability of prostitutes online. All these “irresponsible” uses of the
Internet have led to bad things happening, causing pain, heartache and
despair. And the last time I checked these things were not good in any
way. So for me, with regards to my religion, even though the internet has
its advantages, it has given people the opportunity to cheat and commit
sin more easily because nothing is any trouble or difficult to do because
Google isn’t a person with values and will simply fulfill your request
without seeing what harm it can do to you.”
Two respondents discussed the topic differently. One of the
respondents mentioned that the Internet can be used as a powerful tool
for religious purposes. The respondent explained that the Internet helps
some religions to be spread all over the world. Likewise, the other

377

respondent argued that the Internet promotes religion but at the same
time it eases criticizing religions.
In a nutshell, the answers either no religious opinion about the
Internet or most of the answers is about how one must use the Internet
within his/her religious rules and norms.

The Internet has advantages

Most of the participants said that the Internet has a lot of advantages.
All of them mentioned that the Internet eases access to all types of
information and communication with other people all around the world.
The

main

themes

emerged

from

the

answers

are;

education,

communication such as (meeting new people, and sharing ideas with
others), variety of information, lack of privacy, broadening of world-view,

7. The Internet has disadvantages
Basic themes appeared in the answers were; lack of privacy,
misleading information (inaccurate information), misrepresentation of
information, anonymous offenders, easy access to immoral materials such
as pornography, child pornography, cybercrime, volatile information,
Internet may be addictive and people rely a lot on it, and the Internet can
promote hatred
The majority of the participants agreed that the Internet may
impact children negatively especially when they expose to wrongful
information or pornography. Participants also indicated to how children
may be molested through Internet (i.e., chat rooms). Some participants
thought that adults may be in danger due to inappropriate use if the

379

Internet and three participants mentioned gambling as a danger. One
participant wrote that the Internet “can corrupt people’s mind.” Similar to
the latter respondent, a participant claimed that the disadvantages of the
Internet are “anonymous offenders, easy access to immoral materials,
increased victimization.” Furthermore, another participant mentioned that
the Internet may expose the users to some sensitive content, and
mentioned “videos showing bodily harm.” The same participant indicated
to how the Internet is dangerous in regard to children accessing
pornography. Another participant said that the Internet exposes children
to inappropriate information. Surprisingly, one of the responses was that
there is no means of control for the Internet.
Privacy issues were also fairly mentioned in the answers. A
number of respondents thought that one of the disadvantages of the
Internet is the privacy issues. One participant mentioned “people can
access your personal information such as your address, contact numbers.”
Another participant is concerned about identity theft.

In their answers, the participants also focused on how the Internet
eases the spreading for unreal facts or rumors. One participant posited

380

“sensationalism and lack of verification of facts – too many people are too
quick to post information online, or make comments on news stories
without first verifying facts and educating themselves in the topic of
discussion.” A different view of one of the respondents is that one of the
main disadvantages of the Internet is that one may become antisocial and
stop appreciating real relationships.

Interestingly,

one

of

the

respondents

thought

that

the

disadvantages and advantages are two sides of the same coin.

The

respondent wrote that the “advantages are access to different kinds of
information (i.e. what happens in other countries), instantaneous access to
information (i.e. news), ability to communicate with others across the
globe.” While the disadvantages are “access to different kinds of
information that one previously did not have access to (i.e. pornography),
instantaneous access to information (i.e. trends followed in other countries
that are actually not relevant in one’s own country – easily influences
children), ability to communicate with others across the globe and share
unnecessary information (i.e. sharing of personal information, cyberbullying, etc.).”

Censorship is important and it means restricting the access to some

information. It also impacts the notion of freedom of expression.
Words repeatedly mentioned in the two questions about censorship
were; regulations, limiting access to information, limited information
choices,

freedom of expression is basic right, manipulation of the

government, pornography, personal freedom, and government agenda.
Notably, there is a kind of conflict in the participants’ answers about
censorship in a way that participants thought that censorship restricts free
access to information, at the same time, they believe of the necessity of the
censorship to protect the morality and children. An example of the
mentioned conflict, participant argued that internet censorship is
necessary for protecting social norms and security of the society to
prevent chaos. At the same time the participant believes Internet should

382

be a free sphere where people can express their opinions and access any
information freely. Likewise, another participant has a similarly conflicted
answer about censorship. The participant argued that Internet is
dangerous especially for children when they easily access to inappropriate
information and it is understandable that the government is working to
prevent such dangers. Still the participant does not think there should be
internet censorship because as the participant explained that the internet
can be used in a positive way.

A number of respondents who partially agree to censor the Internet
believe

that

censorship

may

infringe

people’s

rights or

doubt

government’s ability to accurately censor inappropriate information only.
As one of the participants mentioned that “I believe internet censorship
can be somewhat beneficial, because the government can have control on
what is being searched for on the internet. This could help with especially
illegal uses of the internet. Internet plays a big role in information sharing
and people may use it badly to sabotage other people and censoring can
outweigh the disadvantages thereof. However, it could bring to question
to freedom of information and access which might be regarded as

383

infringing on people’s rights. If internet censoring is kept at a minimum
then it would be beneficial.” Another participant who partially agreed
with the idea of censorship argued that some materials could harm people
under age 18; therefore, the participant is against restricting all
information. As noted, a large number of the participants admitted that
restricting

the

Internet

protects

people

from

accessing

harmful

information but it may also restricts educational information sources for
researchers.

A number of participants emphasized on the parents’ role in
monitoring the use of the Internet by their children instead of censoring all
information. As one participant answered “the information on the internet
should not be censored, I believe in universal access; however parents
should censor their own children’s internet usage.” Moreover, the phrase
“censor certain information” appeared frequently in the answers without
mention as to what that certain information is.
Some participants believe that censorship is good in order to
protect the society but if the government censors some information based
on the government agenda, then the right of freedom of expression is

384

violated. As one participant said, “however, there is a fine line between
censorship for protection of society and children, and online censorship
for the sake of political control (an example of this is seen in China).
When censorship is done for the sake of a government rather than for the
universal good of society, then it becomes a violation of freedom of access
to information and freedom of expression.” Other participants thought
that the government cannot be objective when limiting access to some
information and bias will certainly exist. A participant mentioned “all
options should be open for anybody who might want to access
information. It cannot be up to a government to decide what is permitted
or not, because you will always end up with a biased and subjective view
of what information should be allowed or not.”
Similarly, a participant argued that censorship means “blocking of
material on the internet by government for their own agendas.” A similar
view of a respondent who thought that censorship might be beneficial to
protect children is that government who supposed to censor is not trusted.
Literally, the participant wrote that “some information needs to be
restricted, but that does not mean “deleted” or “removed” entirely.
Children, for example, are not yet aware of the possible dangers of the

385

internet, and by restricting their access, together with the provision of
information as to why their access is restricted, might be beneficial. I do
not think that all information is necessary to be known, but unfortunately
if one has a government one does not trust in, then the censorship of
(specific) information, by the government, will also not be trusted.”
Some participants have positive view of censorship. Putting the
latter in different words, the participants thought that censorship protects
children from accessing inappropriate materials. As one of the
participants wrote, “it is a good thing because not all information should
be accessed by everyone particularly information such as pornography,
gambling etc. should not be accessed and viewed by everyone due to its
nature and age appropriateness.” One of the participants thought that
pornography and gambling are dangerous and illegal activities. The
participant argued that if there is no censorship, children may be involved
in such dangerous activities and be may be exposed to immoral content.
Another participant said that censorship is necessary, especially because
children have knowledge and good technology skills and they can find
any information very quickly. Another participant wrote that censorship
is needed because “not everything is beneficial and good to be easily

386

accessible to our younger generation.” Another participant emphasized on
the importance of censorship especially that “there is some information
that should not be exposed to the public.” The participant also explained
that censorship is not bad but it should not contradict with the privacy
right of the Internet information holder.

On the other hand, a number of respondents are completely against
the idea of censorship. The main reason for their total refusal of
censorship is that restricting the Internet is a form of violation of freedom
of expression. As one participant mentioned, “Internet censorship is a
violation of human rights simply because it prevents the freedom of
speech and expression. It prevents the intellectual, economic and social
development of a person. How is one supposed to earn a livelihood if that
person cannot get the knowledge desired for the very advancement of his
or her life”.
Likewise, one respondent claimed that by limiting the access to
certain information “the government can make decisions that can affect
the lives of people and the people will not be informed about those
decisions.” One more participant indicated to the fact the main purpose of

387

the Internet is to ease to access all information, so censoring the Internet
would conflict with the main purpose of the Internet. As the participant
wrote” I really don’t understand why there’s internet censorship because
the main reason for internet creation was to transfer and disseminate
information, therefore why coming up with something like internet
censorship you clearly mean the above mentioned reasons for internet
creation are not appropriate.”

6.4.3.1.2 Unexpected Result:

Open ended-questions- South African

Participants
In addition to the above, some unexpected data as appeared in the
open-ended questions. Two participants discussed freedom of expression
in connection to human rights. In relevance to the latter, the first
participant wrote “when information is controlled in such a way that
people cannot access it, then it is against the Universal declaration human
rights which state that everyone has the right to access any information
that is held by the state. People should not be denied access to

389

information.” The second participant articulated that freedom of
information access is one of the basic human rights”.

6.4.3.2 Kuwait
A number of 40 Kuwaiti participants have answered the questionnaire
1. Internet is not dangerous
Most of the participants believe that Internet is dangerous but as
most of them mentioned it depends on how one use the Internet and what
sites accessed. Most of the participants thought the Internet is weapon
with two edges. A number of participants mentioned that it’s dangerous
because users can access sites that contain sexual activities and pictures.
One of the participants wrote “the Internet is dangerous because it helps
the kids to have different ideas about other religions and cultures”.
Similarly one of the participants stated that “Internet is dangerous because
it changes people’s ideology”. Another participant has same opinion; she
posited “it is very dangerous especially that the use of Internet is
negatively affected Muslims’ beliefs and value system”. However, several
participants claimed that if users of the Internet have weak religious

390

foundation they might be in danger when using the Internet. While small
number of participants mentioned that users of Internet might be in
danger because some of online sources contain wrong information. The
reason behind the Notable fears of the participants in regard to some sites’
contents and activities is that sexual activities outside marriage are
forbidden in Islam. Persons cannot have any sexual relation until they get
married. There are no such sexual rights protected for individuals. Thus,
the engagement in any sexual online activities considered forbidden as
well.
Another participant indicated to how Internet may help in
spreading rumors in the society and may affect national security.
Furthermore, one participant claimed that Internet is dangerous because it
eases the use of such sites “gambling, pornography and terrorism
websites” he explained that a lot of young people were brain-washed
through Islamists-extremists websites that motivate them to be involved
in dangerous acts under the name of “Jihad”. The participant said that
these ideas that encourage violence are against Islam as he added. Some
participants claimed that Internet is dangerous only if the users are not
aware of what they read and see. As one participant wondered “can we

391

imagine if a teenager read something about drugs and want to try it or
read about devil-worship and want to join them, how our society will face
such problems” . For more clarification, in regard to freedom of religion
and belief in Kuwait is protected by law though practically, individual
will considered to violate the law if they believe in other than the three
Abrahamic religions, namely; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
Several participants wrote that Internet may be dangerous if we
misuse it without explaining what the word “misuse” means is. Some
participants discussed that Internet might also waste users’ time if it
misused. Instantly, participant wrote “what’s the point of spending long
time in chatting rooms? what benefits the users will get?”
One participant also stated that “Internet is dangerous because it
negatively impacts physical and mental health of the users”. Another
participant discussed that Internet is dangerous because it leads to social
and political problems in the society. He also mentioned that Internet can
help in stealing personal and confidential information in addition to the
online commercial swindle. Likely, small number of participants
mentioned about privacy violation through Internet.

392

There is also number of participants who discussed that Internet is
mainly dangerous for children. As one participant literally stated
“Internet might be dangerous for children and people of any age who
cannot control their behaviors”. One participant said ‘chatting rooms is
the most dangerous for children because they can contact mentally sick
users”
A participant also said that Internet might distract people of other
more important life’s priorities. Surprisingly, a participant believes that
Internet is useful and not dangerous at all but as he mentioned “it
depends on how users react to what the Internet offers them”. Likewise,
another participant mentioned that “Internet is not dangerous but it
certainly changes and affects social life” without explaining how Internet
might affect social life but the way he stated his answer showed the
participant specifically means to indicated to the negative effects.
Small number of participants literally stated that Internet is not
dangerous at all without giving an explanations or examples. Only one
participant discussed that Internet is dangerous if we completely depend
on it and forget our reality and real life.

Another participant said

393

“Internet is dangerous only if we become addicts to it”. One participant
wrote that “Internet could be dangerous depending on who use and how
being used”. The same participant gave example and she wrote that “if a
teenager or child use the Internet to go through pornography websites
that would be very harmful”

2. Accessing any site in the Internet is considered to be personal freedom
Most of participants thought that accessing any site is not part of
the personal freedom especially that almost all participants agreed on the
fact that authority must control some websites such as pornography,
gambling and other inappropriate political sites that either talk against
Islam or discuss Shi’a and Sunni issues Several participants thought that it
is the authority’s responsibility to censor all inappropriate websites. One
participant wrote “if we consider accessing any sites as a personal
freedom that would result in having a lot of people go through

394

inappropriate sites, either because they are too young or immature
enough to realize what is allowable to be seen”
Another participant believes that people must have freedom to
decide what sites they are interested in. As one participants mentioned
“each person have different value system so the authority cannot block
some sites and restrict people’s freedom. It is really not fair and show
disrespect to the citizens”
The majority of participants believe censoring the Internet by the
authority would protect the security and morality of the society. It is very
noticeable the participants’ concerns about minors and young people.
Additionally, one participant stated “we live in Muslim country in which
the authority is responsible for protecting Islamic manners”.
Again, there are many moral restrictions in the Kuwaiti society and the
violation of such moralities is either forbidden based on the religious or
social level.

3. Internet impacts users’ social norms
In spite of the fact that most of the participants as mentioned earlier
believe that there are some inappropriate websites, most of them thought
that the Internet does not impact their social norms and a number of them
claimed that Internet cannot impact their social norms because they know
how to use it based on their religious and cultural limitations. Mainly, the
participants related between the impact of the Internet and the way they
used it. A number of the participants mentioned that one should use the
Internet within the boundaries of his/her social norms and any behaviors
go against ones’ social norms, should not be conducted.

4. Your religion have an opinion about Internet

396

Several participants said that Islam does not have specific opinion
about the Internet but there are clear specifications of what Muslims can
do and cannot do. Accordingly, Muslims follow those rules even with the
use of the Internet (i.e., gambling is forbidden in Islam, this applicable also
in the virtual world). Moreover, participants gave example about
gambling and pornography. They mainly said that such activities are
forbidden in real life and then similarly Muslims cannot do it through the
Internet. One participant also mentioned that a communication between
male and female is forbidden in Islam and the Internet ease such activity
through chatting rooms (there is confusion about if male and female
interaction is forbidden or disliked only in Islam). Therefore, participants’
responses varied. Some participants believe it’s not allowable for male and
female to interact even if this interaction is for purpose. One the other
hand, some participants thought that male and female can interact with
some boundaries. As one participant stated that “male and female can
interact in social networks if this interaction is about educational, political
or religion discussion but chatting with each other without specific
purpose is totally forbidden”.

Most participants thought that is that they just avoid doing in

they do not have any religious opinion because the only people who have
religious opinion are the religious men who they can have “fatwa” about
everything in Muslims’ life. For more clarifications, the only individuals in
Islam who have the authority to give their religious opinion in all aspects
of life are “religious men”.

Specifically, the religious opinion called

‘fatwa”. Expressing religious opinion is such responsibility, expertise in
Quran and Sunna are the only people who can be involved.

freedom that us given by the Internet led to some chaos. One of the
participant mentioned that the internet give the users the chance to know

Participants defined censorship differently but all believe that
censorship restricts and limits freedoms. Participants believe that the
reason of censoring is to protect the morality and security of the society.
Some participants believe that there must be censorship; others see that
censorship is a form of contradiction with the freedoms protected in the
Kuwaiti Constitution. Also most of the participants mentioned that
although censorship restricts freedom, it is good to protect children from
being exposed to inappropriate information. Many answers by the

400

participants indicted to the hidden fears of children being involve in
dangerous online activities. At the same time several participants see that
authorities cannot censor websites because protecting and monitoring
children is parents’ responsibility only.

Notable expressions were

repeated several times in the two questions about censorship were;
restrictions, violation of freedom laws, children protection, and morals.
6.4.3.2.1 General notes and limitations on the content analysis of
open-ended questions
-

Some of the younger participants felt embarrassed discussing the
issue of morality

-

Participants have “inner-conflict” especially, when it comes to
religion and the use of the Internet.

-

Participants could not giving full explanation of their answers

Due to the sensitivity of the matters participants changed their
answers several times in some questions.
6.4.3.2.2 Unexpected Result: Open-ended questions- Kuwaiti
participants

401

There are some surprising answers especially for questions about
religion and social norms. A number of participants said that there is no
religious opinion about the Internet or even the freedom. Others said that
there is no relation between social norms and the Internet. Specifically,
many answers indicated that the Internet does not impact social norms or
religious values.

Legal Culture Analysis

For the sake of the main purpose of the current dissertation, a
connection between the core of chapter six and legal culture was made to
understand how people comprehend and commit to the legal issues. In
discussing and comparing the notion of legal culture between South
Africa and Kuwait, research question 3 “ how does younger and older
generation perceive the legislation that protects and controls freedom of
expression?” is answered. As widely have been discussed in legal
comparative studies the notion of legal culture was defined as follow “by
legal culture we mean the ideas, values, attitudes and opinions people in
some society hold, with regard to law and legal system…Legal culture is
the source law—its norms create the legal norms; and it is what
determines the 40impact of legal norms on society”

How do certain cultural values impact citizens’ perception of freedom of
expression between generations in both countries?
Content analysis of the open-ended questions and the focus groups
revealed that both South African and Kuwaiti participants agreed that
people should practice their opinions based on their cultural values and
do not go beyond those limits. Kuwaiti participants talked about the
relationships

between

males

and

females

through

the

Internet,

specifically, social networks. Several answers by Kuwaiti participants
indicted to inner conflict about changing the social norms to be in line
with the new era of the Internet or to stick to the social norms and practice
freedoms of expression based on these norms.
South African participants were having less inner conflict.
Particularly, the conflict for South African participants is more about if
there must be a censorship policy by the government or to leave people
practicing their freedom under self-censorship. Similar to the Kuwaiti
participants, South Africans, when it comes to the cultural norms,
majority of the South African participants said that one must practice
his/her freedom within their cultural and social values.

407

Major Finding: Research Question 2
How do religious views impact citizens’ perception of freedom of expression
between generations in both countries?
Content analysis of the open-ended questions revealed that both
South African and Kuwaiti participants said that either “no religious
opinions” or that “their religion does not have opinion” about the notion
of freedom of expression. On the other hand, content analysis of the focus
group revealed more information. It did come as surprise that similar to
the cultural values, a number of the participants from the two countries
believe that people should use the Internet and practice their freedom of
expression within the boundaries of their religious and cultural values.
Major Finding: Research Question 3
How do the younger and older generations perceive the legislation that protects
and controls freedom of expression?

408

Unsurprisingly, content analysis of the focus groups showed that
younger generation of both countries is against the legislations of
controlling freedom of expression. At the same time, older generations of
both countries are with legislation. Though, the results of content analysis
showed a lot of contradictions. Some South African and Kuwaiti younger
participants believe that there must be some restrictions on freedom of
expression to protect children and young adults and to control some older
people who used to practice their freedom wrongfully.
6.4.8 Summary of Qualitative Interpretation
This assignment has explained the central importance of cultural
and religious values and how they impact South African and Kuwaiti
participants’ perception of freedom of expression. The most significant
quotes that became apparent through the conducted focus groups are
namely; censorship, restrictions, and pornography. On the other hand,
themes apparent through open ended questions consisted of personal
values,

privacy,

information

misleading

(inaccurate

information),

misrepresentation of information, anonymous offenders, easy access to
immoral materials (pornography) cybercrime, volatile information,

409

addictive nature, over reliance, and hate mongering. Accordingly, themes
were categorized to utilize the content analysis and get readable results.
Moreover, some unexpected data appeared in the open-ended
questions in both groups of participants. First of the all, two of the South
African participants discussed freedom of expression in connection to
human rights. As the first participant wrote “when information is
controlled in such a way that people cannot access it, then it is against the
Universal declaration human rights which state that everyone has the
right to access any information that is held by the state. People should not
be denied access to information.” The second participant articulated that
freedom of information access is one of the basic human rights. Second,
Kuwaiti participants have some surprising answers especially for
questions about religion and social norms. A number of participants said
that there is no religious opinion about the Internet or even freedom.
Others said that there is no relation between social norms and the Internet.
Specifically, many answers indicated that the Internet does not impact
social norms or religious values.

410

For the focus group, South African participants discussed some
unexpected answers.

There were some unexpected answers by some

participants of focus group number (2). Three participants indicated the
relation between the economic status of the citizens and the right of
freedom of expression. One of the participants explained about
“technological restrictions.” The participant posited that there the lack of
Internet access in poor rural areas deny people living there the chance to
express their opinions or participate in any field. Likewise, another
participant (5) discussed the classes in South African society. The
participant (5) said that because there are economic problems (i.e., rich
and poor) poor people cannot participate in any field. He added South
Africans still suffer from lack of education in rural areas. He said “they
don’t have even computers.” One final economic issue was mentioned by
one of the participants who claimed that the Internet in South Africa is
manipulated by one company; this company was partially owned by the
State until the year 2007. It is important to mention that explaining the
economic factor is not part of the current study and was unexpected
during focus group.

411

6.5 Quantitative Discussion
This section presents the quantitative results by discussing the SPSS
results and the Major quantitative finding for both South Africa and
Kuwait
6.5.1 Major finding: quantitative phase
Using SPSS version 17.0 the quantitative analysis revealed the below
results
Major Finding: Hypothesis 1
There is a positive relationship between age and the perception of
limitation of freedom of expression. This hypothesis assumes that in both
countries, the young generation supports more freedom of expression,
while the senior generation generally supports restrictions on freedom of
expression.

Major Finding: Hypothesis 2
There is a positive relationship between the role of the Internet and
the citizens’ perception of freedom of expression. I assume that in the

412

Internet era, the younger generation tends to call for more freedom of
expression, while the older generation favors more limitations on freedom
of expression.

Major Finding: Hypothesis 3
The awareness and perception of freedom of expression by the
younger and older generations about the current legal framework that
protects and controls freedom of expression is different. My assumption is
that the younger generation views the legislations as too strict, whereas,
the older generation supports restrictions on freedom of expression.

6.6 Comparative Analysis of the qualitative and quantitative results
At this stage, the qualitative and quantitative results of the study
allow to conduct the comparison. However, it is important to mention that
qualitative results will not be compared to the quantitative data; instead, I
will compare South Africa to Kuwait by presenting both result types.
Though, several unexpected data related to the topic of this dissertation
were found in the answers.

413

Generally speaking, the logic of the current comparative study is
based on Most Similar System Design (MSSD) and Most Different System
Design (MDSD) (Przewoski and Teune 1970; and Anckar 2007). Briefly,
MSSD means choosing the units of comparison that are as similar as
possible. Anckar, 2007 defined MDSD as a “strategy to choose units of
research which are as different as possible with regard to extraneous
variables” (Anckar 2007, p. 390).
The three research questions and the hypotheses of the current
research were addressed by discovering the similarities and differences
between the two countries. Starting with the similarities, both countries’
participants did not report that religion and culture may impact the
practice of freedom. Instead, the majority of South African and Kuwaiti
participants argued that everyone must practice freedom of expression
within the boundaries of his/her social norms and religious values. In
fact, the previous answers of the participants proved that people are
actually impacted by their religion and social norms. In other words, in
spite of the fact that participants denied such impact, their answers
proved the opposite. Participants answered that one should practice
freedom of expression and use the Internet without exceeding their social

414

and religious boundaries. This response answered the research questions
(1) and (2), which examine how certain cultural values and religious views
impact citizens’ perception of freedom of expression.
To be more specific, the results suggested that when it comes to
perceiving the notion of freedom of expression people are impacted
inherently by their social norms and religions, even if they are not aware
of such impacts or not admitted it. Evidently, most of the South African
participants claimed that one must practice freedom of expression within
the boundaries of his/her value system. Likewise, Kuwait participants
mentioned that practicing freedom of expression must not oppose Islamic
rules and social norms. Nevertheless, when I asked same participants
about if there is relation between practicing their freedom of expression
and religion or social norms, they insisted that there is no relation, instead,
they believe that practicing freedom of expression is something personal.
On the other hand, the results show that age plays a main role in how
people perceive the notion of freedom of expression and its restrictions.
Accordingly,

the

results

answered

research

question

(3)

which

investigated how younger and older generation perceive the legislation
protecting and controlling freedom of expression. Likewise, the results

415

answered hypotheses of the research that tested if age plays role in these
two issues; (1) supporting more freedom of expression; and (2) supporting
restrictions of freedom of expression.
Based on the focus groups and questionnaire answers, younger and
older generations of both countries are aware of the legislations
concerning freedom of expression. Participants were also aware of the fact
that the Constitutions of their countries fairly protect the right of freedom
of expression. Surprisingly, the results showed that younger and older
generations were equally against a lot of restrictions on freedom, whereas,
middle aged participants support more restrictions. However, the reason
might be that older are not aware how dangerous is the Internet while
middle age people are more stable in their social and emotional life and
aware of the danger of having a lot of freedom

Furthermore, both younger and older generations of both countries
thought that restrictions and policies of freedom of expression are unclear
and vague. Unexpectedly, both generations from both nations asked for
some policies and restrictions on the Internet and freedoms of expression
in general. The participants claimed protecting children and minors from

416

exposure to inappropriate materials or other misuse of the Internet were
the reasons they requested additional policies and restrictions on the
Internet. The latter articulations proved the notion of the “third person”
that repeatedly showed in the participants’ answers. As discussed widely
in the literature, third person affect is defined as “the expectation that a
message will not have its greatest influence on “me” (the grammatical first
person), or “you” (the second person), but on “them”- the third persons.
Individuals may overestimate the impact that mass media exert on others,
or underestimate media effects on the self, or both” (Cohen et. al 2008,
p.490).
Particularly, the majority of the participants from both countries
indicated children when discussing how dangerous the Internet is.
Participants also assumed that children and minors are the only category
of society that may practice their freedom wrongfully in the era of the
Internet and new technology.

Additionally, some older and younger

participants from both countries claimed that even some adults may
practice their freedom of expression wrongfully, but participants
considered this as personal matter.

417

Younger and older participants from both countries have nearly the
same opinions about the restrictions on freedom of expression. In
particular, both younger and adult participants thought that there must be
some restrictions on freedom of expression to protect children from
misusing the Internet. Obviously, both younger and adult participants are
impacted by the third person affect. On the other hand, middle-aged
participants from both countries call for more restrictions on freedom of
expression for all ages.

Generally speaking, both South African and Kuwaiti participants
argued that there must be clear regulations to control Internet use and to
restrict some freedom of expression practices. As a result, the latter proves
that people are willing to perceive and follow the regulations for the sake
of protecting morals and security in their societies.
To be more specific, there was one notable commonality between
South African and Kuwaiti participants. Both focused on how cautious
one should be in regard to his/her countries’ limitations and rules of
freedom of expression. Equally, South African and Kuwaiti participants
showed their willingness to follow freedom of expression regulations in

418

their countries. Additionally, participants from both countries indicated
that freedom of expression regulations must be accessible and
understandable to all citizens equally. Hence, South Africans and
Kuwaitis discussed the integral role of the education system in enhancing
the notion of freedom of expression based on the legal system of the
country. Moreover, both nationalities have awareness of the amount of
freedom of expression in their countries Constitution s.
On the other hand, there are several differences between South
African and Kuwaiti participants regarding perceiving the notion of
freedom of expression. What emerges from the content analysis of the
focus groups and the open-ended questions is that participants from each
country have defined the notion of freedom of expression differently, each
based on their social norms and religious rules, if they exist. Though, as I
mentioned in the above paragraph that the social norms and religious
rules equally impact South African and Kuwaiti participants. Again, when
looking at the definitions of freedom of expression of the participants, one
will notice the differences between South African and Kuwaiti
participants.

419

In particular, social norms are certainly different in both countries.
Kuwaitis tend to be more conservative because of the strict religious rules
they follow, whereas South Africans are more liberal with an appreciation
and respect to mostly Christianity. Therefore, a number of South African
participants claimed that freedom of expression is to express your opinion
freely but without the disrespect or harm to others. Other participants
emphasized that one should say whatever he/she wish to say carefully.
Most of the participants who articulated the latter, discussed that being
careful protects the citizens from questioning by the authority. Noticeably
when defining the notion of freedom of expression, South African
participants focused on the value of respecting others and respecting the
authority.
As discussed in the literature, the value of respect is one main value
of the South African ethical system, namely, Ubuntu. As defined by Shutte
(1993) Ubuntu is “(a Zulu word) serves as the spiritual foundation of
African societies. It is a unifying vision or world view enshrined in the
Zulu maxim umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, i.e. "a person is a person
through other persons" (p. 46). Furthermore, as discussed by Louw (2001),
Sindane (1994), and Degenaar (1996) that the true Ubuntu requires a true

420

respect for values related to human and individuals rights. Ubuntu also as
they claimed requires honest appreciation of differences. As Wiredu
(1995) articulated, one main aspect of the Ubuntu is to respect the beliefs
and practices of others.
Sequel to the above, through their answers South African
participants showed the same values of the Ubuntu. Even if the
participants did not indicate to the Ubuntu directly, one can notice that
the values of Ubuntu are inherent in their answers. Distinctively, the value
of respect for others was frequently mentioned in the participants’
answers when defining the notion of freedom of expression. For more
clarification, the majority of the South African participants stressed the
importance of respecting each other and the differences between each
other when expressing an opinion. Moreover, a number of participants
mentioned that being cautious is very crucial in the age of the Internet and
people should know their boundaries and avoid defaming others.

However, most of the Kuwaiti participants are confused about the
social norms and religious rules. In fact, the line between the social norms
and the religious rules seems to be invisible. For example, I noticed while

421

conducting the focus groups that most participants were confused for
example about the communication between male and female. Some
thought that such behavior is religiously forbidden and others referred it
as culturally taboo.

Thus, participants were confused if one can

communicate with the opposite sex through social networks. Moreover,
Kuwaitis have a lot of inner conflicts about their religion, for instance,
Kuwaitis were confused if social norms should be changed based on the
new technology or if social norms should be adapted to new technology.
The reason of the inner conflict of the Kuwaiti participants may be the
social norms and the religious rules overlapping. Contrariwise, South
Africans seemed to be surer that social norms should not be changed and
firmly believe that everyone should follow their value systems’ rules
when practicing their freedoms. Subsequent to this, when defining the
notion of freedom of expression South African participants talked about
respect indicating the influence of social values.
Compared with South African participants, the majority of the
Kuwaiti participants defined the notion of freedom of expression as to
express opinion and access information freely but with high consideration
to the religious rules and authority regulations. Also, a number of

422

participants of all ages from both countries argued that people can
practice their freedom of expression without hurting or defaming each
other. Some participants stressed on the importance of respecting the
Amir of the country while expressing opinion about him. Generally
speaking, it sounds reasonable that Kuwaiti participants repeatedly
mention such values as; respecting religion, respecting the Amir, and
respecting each other as these values considered as basic Islamic rules. De
facto, there are number of religious text discussed these values, mostly,
discussing them indirectly.
Unpredictably, several Kuwaiti participants posited that there no
religious verses about the notion of freedom of expression. Others said
there are some indirect verses. Kuwaiti participants seemed to be
confused about if there are any Islamic text that discuss freedom. The
reason for this confusion might be difficult to dispel as it is widely argued
in the literature that Sharia has many interpretations and many of verses.
Surprisingly, although Islamic rules in Kuwait are part of the education
system and children start taking Islamic classes in the first grade, where
they can learn Islamic principles until they graduate from high school,

423

there are still differences in understanding of these principles when many
people get together (Safwat, 1993; and Alqudsi-ghabra, 2007).
Likewise, some answers to open-ended questions showed that
some Kuwaiti participants are not sure if there are religious texts about
freedom of expression. Thus, the majority of participants when answering
the open-ended question about their religious opinion said that only a
religious man can discuss this matter and declare an opinion about it.
Using Islamic criteria, religious men are the only people possessing the
authority to express an opinion on a religious matter or as Muslims call it
“fatwa” (Kamali, 1997)
Another significant difference to be discussed is how the judiciary
system of both countries deals with freedom of expression cases.
According to the two cases I presented in chapter 4, Courts of each
country respect the legislations of freedom of expression when making
final decisions. The difference is that each Court has atypical reasoning
while making its decision. The South African Court put much weight on
the laws, specifically the Constitution, whereas, Kuwaiti Court relayed on
Penal Law to make the final decision for the case.

424

As discussed previously in chapter 4 that South African Court
relied on Articles in the Constitutions when making the decision. While
Kuwaiti Court relied on the Penal Law which is in fact considers as an
explanation of the general laws of the Constitution. As remarked in
chapter 4, both countries drafted laws and regulations from the respective
Constitutions, yet the Kuwaiti Constitution characterized as very general
and has broad Articles. Hence, Penal Laws are the specifications
abstracted from the general statements of the Constitution. On the other
hand, the South African Constitution includes several detailed laws about
freedom of expression which led the South African Court to rely on these
laws when making its last decision.
In regard to the public opinion to the Court cases, in South
Africa, public opinion was not showed while the case of Islamic Unity was
contentious, whereas in Kuwait, the public opinion was totally interactive
with the case of Naqi. I can refer the reason of latter issue, is that the South
African society is considered to be secular and includes a number of
religions. On the other hand, Kuwaiti society is conservative and Islam is
the state religion as mentioned in the Kuwaiti Constitution. What
happened in the Kuwaiti society toward the case of Naqi evidently proves

425

a number of issues. First of all, in regard to Naqi’s case, the Kuwaiti
society has divided into two groups; opponents and allies.
The majority were opponents to Naqi’s act, whereas, Naqi’s families,
relatives and some friends supported him and thought that he is innocent.
The majority of the society showed their anger when they heard about
Naqi’s Tweets about God and Prophet Mohammed and his companions.
Regardless of the fact that Naqi is guilty or innocent, most of the citizens
found that talking about God and Prophets does not considered freedom
of expression, which proves that people are influenced by Islam as their
religion. Moreover, as the participants frequently mentioned in focus
group interviews that religion must be protected and as some participants
thought that it is taboo to express an opinion about Islam.
When Kuwaiti participants in the focus group were asked, they said that
there is no clear relation between religion and freedom of expression. Still,
they were upset about Naqi’s talks about religion and politics. The table
on the next page summarizes the similarities and differences.

6.7 Limitations
This study is a cross-national comparative case study in which
selection of the case is based on differences and similarities between the
units of data, and as such, cannot determine if differences in
characteristics of social networks are determined by Internet use, or if the
use of the Internet is caused by differences in characteristics of social
networks.
To be more specific, the limitations I faced in this study is that firstly, the
topic is sensitive which makes participants more cautious while
interviewing in focus group. Secondly, participants changed their opinion
continuously, especially, Kuwaiti participants because they were confused
about things related to religion. Thirdly, South African participants
seemed to be skeptical when asked direct questions about religion. More
importantly, the number of the participants will not allow for generalizing
the findings of my dissertation.

6.8 Finding Related to the Literature
Generally speaking, in regard to what exists in the literature about
the impact of cultural and religious impacts on people’s perception of

430

freedom of expression, I barely found anything about this topic. Instead,
the literature frequently examined the notion of freedom of expression as
a legal right. More importantly, the literature widely discussed the impact
of the Internet on the notion of freedom of expression and how the
Internet increased people’s participation in social and political spheres.
As Wimmer (2006) argued, the Internet had added complexity to the
notion of freedom of expression. Particularly, as discussed in the
literature, the Internet helps people enjoy more freedom of expression in
all fields of life; specifically, political and social (Belkin 2004, Wimmer
2006 and White 2006).

Additionally, in regard to younger and older

generations and their perceptions of freedom of expression, as debated in
the literature, most of the studies argue that the Internet impacts the social
life of older and younger generations (Tyler, 2002). Moreover, a number of
studies agree on the impact of the Internet on the communication patterns
for both older and younger generations equally.
Other studies looked at how the different generations use the
Internet. The younger generation is usually using the Internet for social
interactions and for searching for different types of information (mostly
the taboo information), whereas, the older generation uses it for the

431

purpose of shopping or getting health information (Olson et. al, 2011).
More specifically, as discussed by Wheeler (2006), many Kuwaiti youths
remain critical of such practices in which they can freely participate in
political and social spheres. This illustrates how Muslim values help filter
and buffer the meaning and implications of such experiences. Even within
the use of the Internet, the impact of the social and cultural norms has not
completely disappeared from the users’ behaviors. In contrast, the social
and cultural norms did not prevent the interruption of the value system in
society for some Kuwaiti people (Wheeler 2006, p.140). On the other hand,
the literature examined younger South African people, specially, high
school students and parents and teachers. The result of the latter study
showed that teachers lack the knowledge of the danger of the Internet.
The result of the parents’ survey was not less cynical than the teachers’
results. Conversely, parents seem more unwilling to become involved in
the children’s online learning experience and rely on schools. The study
demonstrated that most children (56%) reported that their parents have
never discussed the Internet with them or warned them against any
possible dangers when using the Internet (Chetty and Besson ,2006).

432

Regarding the comparative legal studies, I found that these studies
have compared the right of freedom of expression among several
Constitutions and legal documents. (Scanlon 1977, Kamali 1997, and Moon
2000). In literature, connecting the right of freedom of expression with the
idea of the impact of culture and religion of people’s perceptions of
freedom of expression is almost absent. Therefore, the results of my study
draw attention to new aspects in which freedom of expression has been
examined in the age of the Internet. My research as tried to figure out the
impact of cultural and religious factors in order to understand the
differences and similarities of the perception of freedom of expression
between younger and older people in secular and Islamic countries.
Distinctively, since my research solely looked at the topic of freedom of
expression through culture and religion lenses, the result of the research
would certainly add something new by connecting the bridges together to
figure out the full picture of how people might perceive the notion of
freedom of expression.

Putting the latter in a more specific way, the

result of my study showed that culture and religion influence how people
perceive and practice freedom of expression, even if they denied so.

433

Interestingly, the perception of freedom of expression by the
citizens of South Africa as secular country and Kuwait as religious
country are equally impacted by religion and values. The assumption was
that religious, specifically, citizens of Islamic country like Kuwait might be
more impacted by religion and social values than citizens of secular
country such as South Africa. Alternatively, what I found is that Kuwaiti
people are more confused about their religion, culture, and the notion of
freedom of expression. South African participants seemed to be more
confident about their value system and the notion of freedom of
expression.
On the other hand, according to the focus group interviews,
participants from both countries have different views about the notion of
freedom of expression. In particular, when asking the South African
participants to define freedom of expression, their answers were mainly
focused on certain aspects of freedom of expression. Aspects such as
respecting each other and avoiding defaming each other were repeatedly
mentioned by the participants of the three groups. On the other hand,
looking at the Kuwaiti participants, social and religious values were
frequently repeated by the participants of the three groups. For instance,

434

values such as communicating with the opposite sex, respecting the Amir,
respecting God and Prophets - including all religious symbols were
important. The differences between the two groups referred to different
cultural and historical backgrounds of the participants.
More importantly, while defining the notion of freedom of
expression the vocabulary selection used by the two groups also indicated
how different people are when perceiving the notion of freedom of
expression. For more clarification, the tone of the emotional association for
the words that often were used by South African participants such as;
“access to information,” “not defaming,” and “expressing opinion with
caution” seemed to be mixed between asking for freedom with some fears
Kuwaiti participants used the words and phrases “communicating”
and “expressing opinion with limitations” because communication
between males and females in Islamic countries such as Kuwait has a
number of limitations. Therefore, Kuwaiti participants related between
freedom of expression and the amount of freedom that social networks
give them to communicate with the opposite sex. Additionally, the tone of
expressing

our

opinions

with

limitations

showed

that

Kuwaiti

participants also have some fears in regards to how to practice their

435

freedom, especially that there is Islamic text that encourages people to
respect the Amir of the country and not to go against him. Though, both
nationalities mentioned the word “respect” several times.
In a nutshell, the difference between the natures of words used to
define freedom of expression by South Africans and Kuwaitis proved that
South African society is more influenced by the social norms while
Kuwaiti society by religious and social norms. Either way, the result
ensures that in both secular and religious countries people are impacted
by their value systems and religion when perceiving the notion of
freedom of expression
Moreover, younger and older participants from the two countries
believe there must be some restrictions on freedom of expression, but only
a few restrictions specifically for minors and children. At the same time,
most of the South African and Kuwaiti younger and older participants
thought that currently there are some unclear restrictions. They believe
that such restrictions on freedom of expression must be understandable
and accessible for all people equally.
Therefore, a number of South African and Kuwaiti participants
indicated to the importance of education’s role in increasing the

436

awareness of how people practice their freedom in the age of the Internet.
On the other hand, the unexpected result of my study is that middle aged
people from both countries asked for more restrictions on freedom of
expression.

However, the unexpected data of how middle-aged people

tend to have the idea of having many restrictions on freedom of
expression added value to the result of the study. In other words, the
unexpected result indicated to some important points

437

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSION
7.1 Introduction

This chapter will provide a brief summary of the study, relate the
findings to prior research, and suggest possible directions for future
studies

I began this work by placing this research at the intersection of
social, legal, and information policy studies. Indeed, the study of freedom
of information in the age of the Internet must inevitably combine various
theories, concepts, and research techniques developed in the fields of
information policy and social science because study of the freedom of
expression laws through the normative prism—as others have done
through the orthodox legal scholarship—remains woefully ignorant of the
importance of how people perceive the notion of freedom of expression.
How people perceive this notion in the era of the Internet is arguably one
of the most important general legal-social questions. Therefore, the
current study focused on linking culture, religion, and legal aspects all

438

together to come up with clearer vision about how culture and religion
impact people’s perceptions of freedom of expression. Accordingly, it was
important to present the legislations concerning freedom of expression in
each country and measure people’s awareness of such legislations.
Therefore, after unpacking the research question by looking at the
influence of certain social norms and religious values, I came up with the
following findings:
There exists a connection between the role of the Internet and how
younger and older participants view freedom of expression. The last
hypothesis investigated the awareness of younger and older generations
of the freedom of expression legislations via statistical analysis. The
statistical analysis showed that the older generation has a higher
awareness of the legal framework of the freedom of expression whereas
the younger generation lacks awareness of such framework. Based on
results obtained from focus groups, regardless of age or home country,
participants mentioned their awareness of the existence of the legislation
of the freedom of expression, but the legislations themselves seem to be
unclear and vague for them. Additionally, the qualitative phase of this
dissertation has also proved that both countries’ participants are impacted

439

by their respective social norms and religious values when defining
freedom of expression and are so impacted regardless of their religion
and/or social norms.
Based on the focus interviews answers of both countries’
participants, people in society in the society must practice and define
freedom of expression based on his/her value system. This means the
latter is considered stimulation to delve in the power of values and one’s
behaviors and perceptions of freedom of expression. Accordingly the
similarities exist between the two countries because the value system in
each country has power regardless of its religion. This proves that people
are more affected by their cultural and social norms than their religion.

7.2 Unexpected Results and additional Questions
As mentioned earlier, some unexpected data were found in the
results of this study. Fortunately, the unexpected data added value to the
study and clarified the final result. In particular, some issues arose in the
focus group interview with South African participants. In particular,
South African participants mentioned how the economic situation in
South Africa affects citizens’ access to information. As the participants

440

discussed, in the poor rural areas citizens are not able to have Internet
either due to financial status or the unequal Internet service provided by
the government. The participants indicated that the elite in South Africa
receive priority to get Internet.
Another unpredicted result is that both secular and religious
countries’ citizens are impacted by either religious or value systems when
perceiving and practicing freedom of expression. The latter result was
unanticipated because, as I have explained in the beginning, a religious
country would be impacted by their religious rules when it comes to
defining and practicing freedom of expression more so than a secular
country. Additionally, both younger and older generations in South Africa
and Kuwait equally call for fewer restrictions on freedom of expression
while the middle aged group from both countries ask for more
restrictions. It was unforeseen that the middle aged groups would call for
more restrictions. The latter result discredits the hypothesis where I
assumed that the younger generations would ask for less or no restrictions
on the right freedom of expression and older generations would ask more
control on freedom of expression.

441

The results obtained from the collected data were beyond some of
my expectations, especially those related to age and restrictions. Some
other unexpected data was that regardless of the type of country, society,
level of religious adherence, or secular freedoms, people are influenced by
their culture and religion. Due to unexpected results regarding age and
views regarding restriction of freedom of expression, I suggest a future
study to investigate the potential universality of cultural and religious
attachment to such perceptions

7.3 Implications of the findings
My study is the starting point, I believe, for scholars to dig in the
power of culture and religion on the freedom of expression in the era of
the Internet. The study hopefully grabs scholars’ attention and opens their
eyes to the importance of the topic. Both Middle Eastern and African
regions are in their infant stages of how to deal with freedom of
expression in the information age. Three things must be taken into
consideration; the amount, quality, and application of the rules that
control the freedom of expression of the citizens who are obviously
impacted by their culture and religion when conceptualizing and

442

practicing the right of freedom of expression. When these three things are
considered, there are important implications of the findings described
above. They are as followed:

-

By understanding people’s vision toward freedom of

expression, policy makers would certainly design better and
clearer policies which people could easily absorb and follow.
-

Equally, South African and Kuwaiti participants’ showed

high awareness of freedom of expression legislation, but
indicated to the inappropriate application of such legislation,
which would certainly open policy makers eyes at the necessity
to consider the practical level of these kinds of legislation.
-

As participants from each country have the frequently

mentioned the importance of the education system in increasing
the awareness of the people about freedom of expression as
right and its limitations, educators in each country might
consider such opinion. Hence, adding new subject to the
curriculum would be beneficial for the whole society.

443

7.4 Significance of the findings
Such a study would help in understanding how social norms and
religion impact people perception and practice of freedom of expression.
The study might clarify the awareness of the people of freedom of
expression regulations, in addition to, highlighting the legislations.
Further, this study explained people’s opinions of the restrictions of
freedom of expression and how different ages would have different
perceptions of such restrictions and ties and the spectrum between. Only
through this kind of study one can start understanding the impact social
values and religion have on people’s perceptions of freedom of
expression.

7.5 Research Future Directions
The results of this study, along with other studies reported in the
literature, suggest a need for a detailed study of the social values and
religious values that make up the perception of freedom of expression, the
effect Internet use has, and social networks. More encompassing details of
social and religious values also need to be included in such studies,
including level of extroversion/awareness for example. With the increase

444

usage of the Internet, it is critical that one understands the impact on
society, specifically, on the notion of freedom of expression. Awareness is
not the only issue when it comes to laws, regulations, and other legislation
concerning freedom of expression; understanding of those codes should
constitute a primary focus in any future study. Focus must be on how
effective the laws are on people and if these laws are in harmony with
people’s cultural and social environments. One final point, researchers
may consider the issue from opposite way, by looking at how the notion
of freedom of expression impacts people’s vision of freedoms; either an
inverse relationship or a positive relationship.

ANNEXURE C
CODE OF PRACTICE
1. PURPOSE AND STATUS OF THE CODE
1.1 The code forms part of the regulations promulgated by the Minister of
Justice and Constitutional Development in terms of section 30 of the
Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000
(Act No. 4 of 2000)(the Equality Act) and has as such the force of law.
1.2 The code aims to improve understanding on the Equality Act to
enhance efforts for effective implementation. Page 32 of 42 1.3. The code
also aims to give practical guidelines to assist in auditing policies and
practices, developing new policies and practices and adopting action
plans for the promotion and achievement of equality.
1.4. A failure of a person to follow the guidelines contained in this code
does not in itself render such person/s liable to proceedings of any kind.
Evidence of such breach may be admissible in other proceedings, for

542

instance in an Equality Court where matters relating to unfair
discrimination will be adjudicated.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 The Constitution
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act No. 108 of
1996) creates a new order in which all South Africans are entitled to a
common South African citizenship in a sovereign and democratic state in
which there is equality between men and women of all races. The right to
equality enshrined in the Constitution enables all men and women to
enjoy and exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms as
contemplated in the Bill of Rights. The right to equality is entrenched in
section 9 of the Constitution. What does this right entail? Equality
includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and freedoms.
Section 9 of the Constitution further provides that neither the state nor
any person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone
on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital
status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability,
religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth. These are called
the grounds of discrimination.
Direct discrimination occurs where a person is disadvantaged simply on
the ground of his or her race, sex, ethnicity, religion or some other
distinguishing feature, or on the grounds of some characteristics that are
specific to members of a particular group. Indirect discrimination occurs
when policies are applied which appear to be neutral, but which adversely
affect a disproportionate number of a certain group.
In terms of section 9 of the Constitution legislative and other measures
designed to protect or advance persons, or categories of persons
disadvantaged by unfair discrimination, may be taken to promote
equality.
This means that redistributive measures are permitted. They are designed
to counteract patterns of inequality persisting from the past into the
present. In this regard one can, for example, refer to the so- called
affirmative action measures which have the effect of ensuring that
equality is achieved. Page 33 of 42

543

Section 9 of the Constitution also requires that national legislation be
enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination. Particulars of the
legislation that has been enacted are dealt with in paragraph 2.2 below.
2.2 The Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination
Act
The Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act,
2000 (Act No. 4 of 2000) (the Equality Act) was promulgated to give effect
to section 9 of the Constitution. It endeavours to facilitate the transition to
a democratic society united in its diversity and guided by the principles of
equality, fairness, equity, social progress, justice, human dignity and
freedom.
The Equality Act makes provision for the prevention and prohibition of
unfair discrimination. Discrimination means any act or omission,
including a policy, law, rule, practice, condition or situation which
directly or indirectly(a) imposes burdens, obligations or disadvantages on; or
(b) withholds benefits, opportunities or advantages from,
any person on one or more of the grounds of discrimination. The Equality
Act sets out the procedures for the determination of circumstances under
which discrimination is unfair. The Equality Act also facilitates the setting
up of Equality Courts for the hearing of matters relating to this Act.
The Equality Act is based on the premise that there are systemic patterns
of discrimination and material disadvantage based on race, gender, class
and other forms of inequality. It therefore facilitates the implementation of
pro-active measures to eradicate such patterns and hence requires positive
action. The Equality Act therefore also provides for the promotion of
equality.
The promotion of equality entails the promotion of a society in which all
people are secure in the knowledge that they are recognised as human
beings equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration. It also
entails the development of opportunities which allow people to realise
their full human potential within positive social relationships.
Section 24 read with section 28 of the Equality Act provides that the State
and all persons have a duty and responsibility to (a) eliminate discrimination on the grounds of race, gender and disability;
and
(b) promote equality in respect of race, gender and disability.

544

In carrying out the aforementioned duties and responsibilities - Page 34 of
42 (a) policies and practices must be audited, with a view to eliminating
all discriminatory aspects thereof;
(b) progressive policies must be developed and codes of practice must be
initiated in order to eliminate discrimination on the grounds of race,
gender and disability;
(c) viable action plans must be adopted for the promotion and
achievement of equality in respect of race, gender and disability; and
(d) priority must be given to the elimination of unfair discrimination and
the promotion of equality in respect of race, gender and disability.
Section 27 of the Equality Act deals with the social commitment by all
persons to promote equality. It includes persons (natural and juristic),
nongovernmental organisations, community-based organisations and
traditional institutions. This section places an obligation on the Minister
for Justice and Constitutional Development to develop regulations in
relation to the Equality Act, which require companies, closed
corporations, partnerships, clubs, sports organisations, corporate entities
and associations to prepare, amongst other things, equality plans or abide
by prescribed codes of practice.
3. APPLICATION OF THE CODE
This code applies to all persons (natural and juristic), non- governmental
organisations, community-based organisations and traditional institutions
as contemplated in section 27 of the Equality Act. This includes, for
example, companies, closed corporations, partnerships, clubs, sports
organisations, corporate entities and associations.
4. CONTENT OF CODE
4.1 Notes and Explanations
Remember that acts of discrimination are unlawful if all of the following
are present:
(a) people are treated differently;
(b) the different treatment constitutes discrimination;
(c) the discrimination is unfair; and
(d) the discrimination is not reasonable and justifiable in accordance with
the provisions of section 36 of the Constitution. Page 35 of 42

545

Note that it is not unfair discrimination to take measures to protect or
advance persons or categories of persons disadvantaged by unfair
discrimination or the members of such groups or categories of persons.
Further remember that the guidelines provided for in this code must be
read within the context of the Equality Act which prohibits unfair
discrimination.
Where-ever in this code reference is made to equal treatment, this means
treating like cases alike and unlike cases differently in proportion to their
likeness or difference.
This means that in certain cases it is the very essence of equality to make
distinctions between groups and individuals in order to accommodate
their different needs and interests.
4.2 General aspects
Policies and practices: Review current policies and practices to
eliminate factors that undermine equality. Remove all discriminatory
provisions from policies and practices.
Language: To the extent possible, the language used must
accommodate differences. Measures must be taken to ensure that
language usage is responsive to the language needs of different persons.
Promotion of equality: In the first instance, exclusion must be avoided.
Secondly, pro-active measures must be designed to address indirect
exclusions that are a result of past discriminatory practices. Thirdly, proactive measures must be implemented to promote equality for the present
and the future.
4.3 Specific sectors
In this part of the code, reference is made to different sectors such as
education, pensions and employment. In respect of each sector, general
statements are made, followed by specific do's and dont's as examples.
Membership of organisations, clubs or sport associations
Pro-active measures should be developed and implemented to include
persons who were previously excluded from membership due to past
patterns of discrimination. Membership criteria must be of such a nature
to ensure representivity.

546

The following are examples: Page 36 of 42 (a) No person is excluded from
membership solely because of him or her being a member of a particular
group for example exclusion on the grounds of race, gender, disability,
etc;
(b) Certain groups are not relegated to certain categories of membership;
and
(c) Every member enjoys the same rights, for example the right to vote, to
elect the leadership of organisations, clubs or sport associations, etc, and
the equal right to participate in the decision-making processes of such
entities.
Procuring goods and services
In procuring goods and services, no person must be excluded solely on
the basis of her or his race, gender or disability. Moreover, measures must
be developed and implemented to ensure that goods and services are
procured from persons who were previously disadvantaged.
The following are examples:
(a) An invitation for the procurement of goods and services must be
formulated in a manner that ensures that every person has an equal
opportunity in supplying the goods or rendering the service. The
specifications and the conditions in the invitation must not by their mere
nature have the effect of excluding persons from disadvantaged groups.
(b) The media used in inviting persons to supply the goods or to render
the services must be chosen with circumspection so as to ensure that all
categories of the community have access thereto and are allowed an equal
opportunity to respond to the invitation. It must therefore be as inclusive
as possible and include new ways to reach people previously excluded.
(c) The time periods mentioned in the invitations must ensure that all
persons are afforded an equal opportunity to respond timeously thereto.
(d) The language used in the invitation must, as far as possible, be
understandable to all persons.
(e) The criteria for selection must be non-discriminatory. It must
furthermore include measures to address historical imbalances
particularly in terms of race, gender and disability. Page 37 of 42

547

(f) Contracts for the procurement of goods and services must not contain
discriminatory (directly or indirectly) clauses. Contracts must also not
bring about less favourable terms for persons previously disadvantaged.
(g) In securing accommodation for events, make sure that the facilities are
accessible to all. This includes accommodating differences, for example
disability, or accessibility by means of public transport, etc.
(h) In securing accommodation for events, special measures must be
implemented and efforts must be made to make use of accommodation
owned or controlled by previously disadvantaged persons.
Accommodation, property, land and facilities
Accommodation refers to residential and business accommodation. Equal
opportunity and non-discrimination must guide policies and practices
relating to the above.
The following are examples:
(a) Make sure that your business premises and the facilities are accessible
to all persons. This includes accommodating differences such as disability.
(b) If you provide accommodation as part of your business, all persons
making use thereof must be treated equally.
(c) If you have property to let, all prospective tenants must be treated
equally and you may not refuse to offer premises to a person owing to his
or her race, gender, disability, etc.
(d) No person may be evicted solely on the basis of him or her being a
member of a particular group.
