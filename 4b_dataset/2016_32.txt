Perspectives on Research, Writing, and Academic Integrity
(Under the direction of Sandra Hughes-Hassell)



This qualitative study explores the cultural adaptation of international graduate students
studying in the United States at three universities in North Carolina, focusing on how they
conduct their academic research and writing, and how they perceive and negotiate issues of
academic integrity. Critical incident technique and semi-structured interviews were used to
collect and analyze data. Participants were asked to describe a specific critical incident, in this
case the process of completing a major assignment that required research and writing. Findings

       -cultural adaptation theory.
When asked about the best aspects of living and studying in the United States, participants

named the people (particularly their professors and classmates), opportunity to learn and grow,
and educational environment. They identified language, cultural, and academic issues as the
most challenging aspects. Many described similar research processes and difficulties. They
struggled with issues like coming up with a research topic, and specific skills like finding and
assessing resources. Academic writing proved to be challenging due to the lack of experience,
familiarity with the American scholarly style, and English-language vocabulary.
Participants were familiar with American academic integrity standards and expectations,
and viewed paraphrasing and proper citation as the most important tools in avoiding
plagiarism. Half of them learned about the concept of academic integrity upon arriving in the
United States, and half learned about it in high school or undergraduate programs in their home

iii

countries. The majority acknowledged that they thought about these issues differently after
spending one or two years in graduate school in the United States.
The findings of this study have implications for faculty and staff on American college and
university campuses, particularly academic librarians, professors, and writing center staff. It
was clear that participants were eager to adapt and to learn new skills that would help them to
succeed in their graduate programs. Librarians, teaching faculty and writing center staff can and
should provide research, writing, and academic integrity support and training for international
students. Recommendations include incorporating cultural perspectives into instruction,
providing opportunities for international and domestic students to collaborate, and promoting
on- and off-campus tools and resources.

and issues of academic integrity, and focuses on helping international students understand and
function within the American higher education system. The primary goal of this study is to
explore how these students approach their graduate-level academic work, how they learned
about academic integrity in their own academic cultures, how they perceive and negotiate this
concept in an American context, and how these perceptions affect the process of completing
scholarly work.

Open Doors Report on

International Education Exchange (2015a), the number of international students studying in
the United States during the 2014-2015 academic year increased by 10%, up to 974,926
students. These students, almost half of whom come from China or India, contribute a great deal
to the American economy and system of higher education. The presence of international
students in the American classroom supports a global perspective and diverse learning
environment (Trice, 2003), and helps prepare students  both domestic and international  to
work in an intercultural environment (Pandit, 2013). During this time of austerity, international

1

students also provide a much-needed source of revenue for universities (Altbach, 2004). Their
financial impact is not limited to campuses, however. NAFSA, the Association of International
Educators (2014), reported that international students and their families contributed almost 27
billion dollars to the U.S. economy in 2013-2014.
International students face some unique challenges in U.S. higher education. Personally,
these students may struggle with issues such as homesickness and loneliness (Rajapaska &
Dundes, 2002; Robertson, Line, Jones, & Thomas, 2000), discrimination (Lee & Rice, 2007),
and general acculturative stress (Johnson & Sandhu, 2007). Academically, international
students may have difficulties related to English-language proficiency (Senyshyn, Warford, &
Zhan, 2000; Yeh & Inose, 2003), different pedagogical styles (Andrade, 2006a; Eland &
Thomas, 2013), and unfamiliar academic integrity standards (Hayes & Introna, 2005). It is clear
that they may benefit from specialized support from a variety of university offices and
organizations

from the student health center to the library

so that they can take full

advantage of the U.S. higher education system and American students and faculty can benefit
from their presence.

processes, and perceptions of and engagement with issues of academic integrity as they
complete their major assignments. Librarians are natural and involved proponents of academic
integrity on university and college campuses, teaching students to find, evaluate, and use
information in an ethical manner. The results of this study may be used to inform practice in
librarianship related to both services for international students and advocacy for academic
integrity. In addition, insight into how these students complete and perceive their scholarly
work may help university staff, such as those in international student offices and writing centers,
to provide improved support, and help faculty to understand better how to teach and advise
international students. Improved and specialized support for this student population from

2

librarians, faculty and staff would likely result in better learning outcomes and student
satisfaction.

American setting, which is appropriate for this study which takes places in the U.S. state of
North Carolina. Identifying a succinct and useful definition for academic integrity proved to be a
challenge. For example, The Greenwood Dictionary of Education (2011) gives the following
definition:
Academic integrity is academic honesty integrated into all aspects of academic life,
including crediting sources used in all forms of publications, research, experiments,
assignments, and papers. Academic integrity also encompasses students refraining from
cheating on examinations and in all of their classroom assignments. Academic integrity is
the standard by which individuals are expected to create their own work and not reproduce
or copy the work or ideas of others without giving proper credit (Werre, p. 4).
I considered this to be too lengthy and detailed for the purposes of this study, and thus the
following simpler definition, adapted from Wikipedia (2015), was used:
Academic integrity is the moral code of academia. Under this code, scholars must avoid
cheating and plagiarism, adhere to academic standards, and be honest in their research
and writing.
Many scholars interested in international students and non-native speakers of English
have written about how plagiarism should be defined and handled (Abasi & Graves, 2008;
Deckert, 1993; Pecorari, 2003; Pennycook, 1996). Again, I prefer a broader definition:

Research Questions
This study seeks to address the following research question and sub-questions:

RQ1: How do international graduate students studying in the United States conduct their
academic research and writing?

" What steps do they take in the process of completing an academic assignment?
" How do they conduct research and use the library and other resources in this process?
" How do they integrate these sources during the writing stage of an academic
assignment?
RQ2: How do international graduate students studying in the United States perceive, engage
with, and negotiate issues of academic integrity?

" What and how did they learn about academic integrity prior to entering graduate
school in the United States?

" How do they think about academic integrity during the research and writing process?

1. Human beings construct meaning as they engage with the world they are interpreting.
2. Humans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their historical and

culture.

3. The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of interaction with
a human community (Creswell, 2014, p. 9).
The second assumption is particularly relevant in this study, as it will involve exploring
concepts (scholarly research, academic integrity) from a variety of cultural perspectives, but
making meaning as a result of engaging with the world and social interactions are pertinent as
well.

education environment in the U.S., specifically related to the ways that they approach their
academic work and perceive issues of academic integrity. Three boundary conditions frame
cross-cultural adaptation theory:
(1) The strangers have had a primary socialization in one cultural or subculture and have
moved into a different and unfamiliar culture (or subculture), (2) they are at least
minimally dependent on the host environment for meeting their personal and social needs,
and (3) they are regularly engaged in firsthand communication experiences with that

This chapter synthesizes the literature on international students. It begins with current
statistics related to international students studying in the United States, and continues with a
discussion of the major issues that these students face. The next section focuses specifically on
the LIS literature, which covers international student use of library spaces and resources, as well
as library instruction and reference services. The chapter closes with a section about
institutional support for international students. Some details regarding terminology should be

Issues for International Students
The majority of the research included in this section explores the problems and coping

difficulties of international students, which seem to have changed little in the last fifty years. In
a two-part study conducted in the late 1970s, Hull (1978) collected data from participants at
three universities, via questionnaire and interviews with foreign students (the term used at the

8

time). The top reported difficulties with coping were financial problems and depression.
Decades later, international students still cite their finances as a major stressor (Robertson,
Line, Jones, & Thomas, 2000), and identify a need for more work opportunities and
scholarships (Sherry, Thomas, & Chui, 2010). In fact, the 2015 Open Doors Report indicated
that 64% of international students are self- or family-funded (IIE, 2015a). According to Johnson
and Sandhu (2007), international students may experience acculturative stress due to
homesickness, loneliness, social isolation, identity and values confusion, uncertainty and
anxiety, and depression. Other issues for these students may include discrimination (Gonzalez,
2004; Lee & Rice, 2007), English-language proficiency (Heikinheimo & Shute, 1986; Yeh &
Inose, 2003) and academic difficulties (Gonzalez, 2004; Ladd & Ruby, 1999).
2.2.1

Homesickness and isolation. Homesickness and loneliness are universal

problems for international students (Robertson et al., 2000; Rajapaska & Dundes, 2002),
because they generally do not have as much social support as domestic students usually do, as a
result of the distance between them and friends and families in their home countries
(Hechanova-Alampay, Beehr, Christiansen, & Van Horn, 2002). Pedersen (1991) points out that
  

-esteem and self-image are validated by significant others, who provide

emotional and social support in culturally patterned ways (p. 12), and that these support
systems become far less accessible when a student moves to a new country and attempts to settle
in an unfamiliar culture. Heikinheimo and Shute (1986) theorized that international students
tend to immerse themselves in academic work in order to keep themselves occupied and combat
loneliness (p. 402).
2.2.2

Mental health and counseling. Despite struggling with depression and

feelings of isolation, mental health services are underused by international students (Abe,
Talbot, & Geelhoed, 1998; Bradley, Parr, Lan, Bingi, & Gould, 1995; Mori, 2000), often because
these students tend to prefer informal networks for collecting information and solving problems

9

instead of relying on university services (Heikinheimo & Shute, 1986). Even when international
students utilize these services, they are more likely than American students to end treatment
prematurely (Pedersen, 1991). Mori (2000) provides a summary of the reasons why these
students are hesitant to avail themselves of mental health services, including the belief that
psychological issues are beyond their control and thus cannot be addressed by counseling, the
idea that disclosing personal problems to a counselor is shameful, and an inability to distinguish
emotional distress from physical illness. The literature recommends cultural competency
training for counselors and mental health professionals, so that they are able to meet the needs
of international students through specialized counseling (Heikinheimo & Shute, 1986;
Zimmerman, 1995). For example, focusing on Asian students studying in the United States, Lin

the literature:
Many foreign students, students from the Middle East for example, will initially have
difficulties studying in our system. They often have not been trained to do independent
library research or to write imaginative or even logical essays. Generally, they have only
experienced the lecture method of teaching and have been required to memorize facts in
preparation for exams once or twice a year (Bultheis, 1986, p. 25).
While these assertions may often be true, the negative tone regarding other (supposedly
inferior) styles of education may have a deleterious effect on perceptions of international
students and their relationships with domestic students, faculty, and staff. It is essential that
educators do not think of these styles of education as inferior or backwards, but simply as
alternative and different. In these systems, fact is vital and analysis is secondary, if considered to
be of relevance at all. The Western concept of research may be unfamiliar, and Badke (2002)

their educational career considering textbooks (and their professors) to be the ultimate
authority may falter when asked to critique the ideas of an expert. In a case study at the
University of Alberta, librarians found that international students placed the highest value on
information given to them by professors and other figures of authority. They used these
materials to identify the most important authors, and then searched for other papers by those
authors (Morrissey & Given, 2006, p. 233).

The Predeparture Phase, in which the student prepares to return to the home culture.

16

Readjustment Phases, in which the student readjusts to life in the home country,
including changes in interpersonal relationships, cultural shifts, and professional
opportunities.
In his book on counseling international students, Barry (2004) lists the following as
common transitional issues: academic goals as a central concern, communication problems,
building social support, costs of living, discrimination and racism, gender role expectations, and
family matters. Du Bois (1956) also identifies the following as crucial factors in sojourn
adjustment, and some of which have been addressed in this chapter:
Language Facility
Age and Academic Status
Duration of Sojourn
Alienation
Freedom of Choice
Interpersonal Relations
Reference Groups
Status and Self Esteem (p. 78)
Lysgaard (1955) developed the U-curve hypothesis to model the adjustment process,

their study that included international students studying all over the world, including Brazil,

Gullahorn and Gullahorn (1966) changed this model to a W-curve, to take into account both the
transition to the host culture, and the transition back to the home culture.

Easing the transition. Studies show that some factors in the international

student s experience ease the transition, including frequent contact and relationships with
domestic students. Some research finds that more interaction with American students, or hostcountry students, led to better cultural adjustment and a better academic and social experience

conclusion in the second part of this study. However, length of time spent in the U.S. is not
correlated with perceptions of adjustment (Zimmerman, 1995) or feelings of alienation (Schram
& Lauver, 1988). It is important to understand that international students are not so different
from domestic students in many ways. Survey data collected by Klomegah (2006) showed that
the feeling of alienation or social estrangement is not peculiar to foreign students, but occurs in

of the international student experience at a university in the U.K., Brown (2009) found that
students see the transition as a positive growth experience:
Early feelings of disorientation were replaced by newfound strength; fear of being alone
contrasted a new capacity to withstand stress. Self-efficacy was therefore the product of the
confrontation with hardship: this was the necessary precursor of a universal growth in selfbelief (p. 510).
Few studies focus on the retention of international students, but Andrade (2006b)

LIS Research on International Students
The recent LIS literature on international students tends to be anecdotal and descriptive in

nature, as opposed to research-based (Click, Wiley, & Houlihan, 2016). This section focuses on
original research, and much of it demonstrates that language, cultural differences, and lack of
awareness about library services can all be barriers for international students using an academic
library (Baron & Strout-Dapaz, 2001; Curry & Copeman, 2005; Liu, 1993). In a survey of
international students on one American campus, Jackson (2005) collected data about
demographics, computer and library exp      

     

of library services in the United States. She found that the students had more experience with
computer and library use than older literature would indicate, although library services such as
interlibrary loan, reference consultations, and online reference services were often unfamiliar to
students prior to arriving in the United States. However, the results of a survey of international
graduate students at Virginia Tech showed that these students used t          

In an article about cross-cultural communication and the implications for library services,
Wang and Frank (2002) observe that:
Academic libraries are organizations that exist within the context of specific cultures that
are shaped and, to a degree, governed by various underlying assumptions. Libraries and
librarians develop and implement services that are influenced by specific assumptions that
are culturally and intellectually based (p. 209).

2.4.1

Use of library spaces and resources. International students seem to value

the library as a physical space. A study that surveyed both domestic and international business
students found that domestic students use the library primarily for access to research resources,
while international students use the library primarily as a space in which to study individually or
in groups (Song, 2004). Librarians who surveyed international students at three universities in
California found that these students regularly use the library for study spaces, course materials,
and computers, but do not usually interact with the librarians or make use of other library
services (Knight, Hight, & Polfer, 2010). In a case study of ethnic minority students at San Jose
State University, researchers found that 62% of the Asian respondents indicated that using the
library was easy and felt that they were successful in finding the information they needed (Liu &
Redfern, 1997). However, among those that were not confident in their abilities to use the
library, Liu and Redfern found that 

resources, including the catalog and Academic Search Premier database (Martin, Maxey-Harris,
Graybill, & Rodacker-Borgens, 2009). The authors expected to find that international students
lagged in information seeking ability, but this was not the case. International and domestic
students demonstrated similar information seeking behaviors, although international students
were more likely to use resources other than the designated database. A study at Virginia Tech
drew similar conclusions about information seeking ability, but depended on students to selfreport behaviors as opposed to tracked information retrieval (Liao, Finn, & Yu, 2007).
International students at three universities in California reported preferences for friends,
teachers, and Wikipedia as information sources (Knight, Hight, & Polfer, 2010). Hughes (2005)

vocabulary and spelling mistakes. She noted that these students possessed strong IT skills but
limited information literacy skills.
Mehra and Bilal (2007) interviewed Asian students at the University of Tennessee in order
to explore their information seeking strategies using information and communication
technologies (ICT), both on the internet (e.g., search engines) and in the library (e.g., online
databases). Participants reported that challenges in using library ICTs included limited search
skills, poor search functionality, unfriendly interface design, and irrelevant search results (p. 8).
The researchers also asked students to discuss experiences with libraries and research
processes. Participants reported that the library was not so integral in supporting research in
their home countries, and that the research process generally focused on class notes and
textbooks as opposed to journal articles (pp. 8-9).

Library instruction. International students tend to respond positively to

library instruction. Research shows that it reduces anxiety and increases motivation to use
library resources for this population. In his dissertation work, Battle (2004) studied the effects
of information literacy instruction on international stu  

students enrolled in an English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) course were asked to
use library resources to complete a research assignment. One group attended several library
instruction sessions, and the other group did not. Participant anxiety levels were measured
using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Library Anxiety Scale, and Battle determined
that receiving information literacy instruction reduced both general and library anxiety for these
international students. In a comparative study, Song (2004) found that international students
were more likely than domestic students to find library instruction workshops helpful, and to
feel motivated to use library services after attending these workshops. However, Song also
discovered that 94% of the international business student respondents began their academic
research on either Google or Yahoo instead of the library website (p. 31), so the true meaning of
these findings is unclear. In a study of students in Canadian business schools, 52 students were
interviewed about information literacy instruction (ILI) and learning outcomes (Detlor, Julien,

2.4.3

Reference services. Language issues, such as the use of library jargon, and

unfamiliarity with U.S.-style library services and resources can create a barrier between
international students and reference services. Curry and Copeman (2005) conducted a field
stimulation study

p. 412), in which an international student who spoke heavily-accented English

approached eleven reference desks in academic libraries in need of research assistance. This
student recorded the details of the interaction, including a behavior checklist for the reference
librarian, step-by-step narrative, and satisfaction and willingness to return rating. Results of this
study showed that the reference librarians were generally approachable, careful listeners.
However, the use of library jargon and expectation that the student would interrupt with
additional information during the reference interview could both be problematic in providing
research support for international students. Liu (1993) interviewed 54 international students at
the University of California, Berkeley, and discovered that these students were perplexed by
open stacks, the classification system, and reference materials. The author recommends that
libraries offer glossaries of library terminology in both English and other languages, bi-lingual
library tours, and special workshops to teach international students about library concepts that
may be unfamiliar, like the Library of Congress classification system. As a result of survey data
collected from international students at two universities in the Midwest, Zhuo, Emanuel and
Jiao (2007) recommend activating database language interfaces so that students can search in
their native languages. However, when undergraduate and undergraduate international
students at the University of Colorado Denver were surveyed, 83% of them indicated that they
preferred to use English at the reference desk (Ferrer-Vinent, 2010). The majority of

24

respondents (55%) said that they would prefer additional assistance in their primary language, if
they considered the initial reference desk interaction to be inadequate (p. 194).
2.5

Institutional Support for International Students
While most of the literature focuses on the need for international students to adjust to the

host culture as quickly and smoothly as possible, a few authors address the need for institutional
adaptation as well. Citing some of the literature included in this review (e.g., HechanovaAlampay et al., 2002; Klineberg & Hull, 1979; Pritchard & Skinner, 2002) Lee and Rice (2007)

assumption:
The imperative for the foreign student, accordingly, is three fold: first, to seek continuously
to improve English-language proficiency if needed; second, to avoid patterns of association
that might isolate the person from his or her American counterparts; and, third, to make a
good-faith effort to better understand and adjust to the local culture (Bevis & Lucas, 2007,

Andrade (2006a) also expresses concern about this deficit view and its impact on interactions

literature.

and it is important that institutions make a particular effort to support this student population.

countries. Arizona State University offers an intensive English as a second language program
called the American English and Culture Program, which helps international students improve
language capability and learn about American culture at the same time (Chang, 2011). Reiff and
Kidd (1986) conclude that orientations for international students should:
(1) welcome new student and provide an opportunity for them to meet college or university
staff and faulty, as well as community volunteers; (2) provide specific information to
facilitate their adjustment to the campus; (3) increase their knowledge and understanding
of the American system of higher education; (4) increase their understanding of American
culture, values, and customs; (5) impart some awareness of the impending cross-cultural
adjustment process (p. 40-41).
It is important to remember, however, that international students need and deserve
university support throughout their time studying outside of their home countries, beyond the

The following chapter discusses the literature related to academic integrity.

CHAPTER 3: ACADEMIC INTEGRITY2
This chapter begins with a more thorough explanation of academic integrity, and then
discusses the literature on why students, international students in particular, engage in
academic dishonesty. The next section explores plagiarism, including why the concept can be
considered to be problematic. The chapter closes with a review of the literature on international
perspectives on academic integrity, including a variety of countries from Lebanon to Sweden.
3.1

What is academic integrity?
This study uses the following definition for academic integrity, as stated in the Definitions

section (1.3) of Chapter One:
Academic integrity is the moral code of academia. Under this code, scholars must avoid
cheating and plagiarism, adhere to academic standards, and be honest in their research
and writing.
While this is a useful and succinct definition, students may be more interested in understanding
exactly which behaviors are considered honor code violations. Academic dishonesty covers a
variety of behaviors, some of which are obvious for students (e.g.,  

  

answers during an exam) and some of which may not be so obvious (e.g., submitting the same
paper for two different classes). 

3.2

Why do students engage in academic dishonesty?
Why do students cheat? Why do they plagiarize? These and similar questions have been

asked often, by researchers and scholars in numerous fields. Studies have found that students
engage in academic dishonesty because they have certain personality traits (Kisamore, Stone, &
Jawahar, 2007), because they see others cheating (McCabe & TreviÃ±o, 1997), because they have
strong relationships with classmates and weaker relationships with professors (Stearns, 2001),
because they are unlikely to be forced to face the consequences (Hutton, 2006), and because
they think that faculty do not care if they cheat (McCabe, Butterfield, & TreviÃ±o, 2006). Clearly
there is no simple answer. The academic integrity research tends to be divided into two
categories: cheating as related to personal characteristics, and cheating as a result of
environment or context. The following subsections provide more information about each of
these perspectives.
3.2.1

Personal characteristics. While Kisamore, Stone, and Jawahar (2007) agree

that studying situational variables is important, they suggest that investigating the ways that

(Hogan & Hogan, 2007), which focuses on qualities related to successful performance, affect
how students perceive academic integrity culture and behave within this culture. They found
that students who have high scores on Prudence, which is related to responsibility and
conformity, and Adjustment                

Research based on student characteristics has shown that men tend to cheat more than
women (Bowers, 1964; Davis, Grover, Becker, McGregor, 1992; McCabe & TreviÃ±o, 1997),
although some studies have shown no difference between men and women (Lipson & McGavern,
1993; Ward & Beck, 1990). Younger students cheat more than older students (Lipson &
McGavern, 1993; Mustaine & Tewksbury, 2005). Academic achievement has also been shown to
have a positive relationship with academic integrity; students with higher GPAs are less likely to
cheat than those with lower GPAs (Bowers, 1964; Roig & Caso, 2005; Klein, Levenburg,
McKendall, & Mothersell, 2007). Research also demonstrates that students involved in the
Greek system are more likely to cheat (Storch & Storch, 2002; Williams & Janosik, 2007), as are
intercollegiate athletes (Mustaine & Tewksbury, 2005)
3.2.2

Contextual factors. In a seminal work from the mid-1990s, McCabe and

TreviÃ±o (1997), two leading scholars in the study of academic integrity on college and university
campuses, conducted a multi-campus investigation on the influences of individual and
contextual factors on self-reported academic dishonesty   Their most important finding
was that contextual or situational factors, particularly factors that were peer-related, have a
stronger effect on behavior than individual or personal characteristics of students. McCabe and
TreviÃ±o suggest that social learning theory might provide the most appropriate context for
educators to approach issues of academic integrity. Social learning theory, developed by
Bandura (1986), suggests that much of human behavior is learned through the influence of
example and that people learn and change their behavior based on their observation of
credible others in the environment and the consequences of their behaviors (McCabe &
TreviÃ±o, 1997, p. 392). Learning by observation is one of the most powerful means of
transmitting values, attitudes, and patterns of thought and behavior (Bandura, 1986, p. 47),
making it a potentially useful tool for understanding student choices related to academic
integrity. Similarly, Imran and Nordin (2013) found that students who perceive that social

31

norms permit cheating engage in academic misconduct more often than other students,
although this observation is made under a different theoretical framework (p. 105).
McCabe also worked with faculty at the American University of Beirut to conduct a study
of students in Lebanon (McCabe, Feghali, & Abdallah, 2008). They found that the perceptions
of behaviors of ones peers with regard to academic integrity showed a very strong relationship
with a students individual decision on whether to engage in academic integrity (McCabe et al.,
2012, p. 63), indicating that social learning theory can explain choices related to academic
integrity in non-American student populations as well. A more thorough discussion of this study
can be found in the International Perspectives on Academic Integrity section (3.4).
Relationships also play an important role in academic integrity on college and university
campuses. Student evaluations of instructor classroom behavior and perceptions of studentinstructor relationships affect ethical behavior. For example, students who admit to academic
dishonesty tend to have lower evaluative perceptions of their instructors (Stearns, 2001, p.
278). In addition, some research has shown a faculty versus students mentality that is
detrimental to the culture of academic integrity (Kidwell, Wozniak, & Laurel, 2003). Social
network theory indicates that because relationships between students have strengthened as a
result of multiple modes of social interaction, relationships between students and faculty have
weakened, and dishonest behavior is promoted as students observe one another making
unethical choices (Hutton, 2006).
3.2.2.1 Honor codes. McCabe and his colleagues are strong advocates for honor codes.
Bowers work in the 1960s showed that the presence of an honor code reduced cheating, as has
their own research (summarized in McCabe et al., 2012). They argue this contextual factor is of
particular importance, and that honor codes:


are effective in promoting integrity and reducing cheating;



must be more than window dressing to be effective;
32

affect faculty attitudes and behavior;
can have an enduring effect;
can be effective in both traditional and modified formats (McCabe et al., 2012, pp. 102111).

  actors. In Cheating Lessons: Learning from

Academic Dishonesty, Lang (2013) identifies four features of an environment that may cause
cheating:
1. an emphasis on performance;
2. high stakes riding on the outcome;
3. an extrinsic motivation for success;
4. a low expectation of success (p. 35).
Although these environmental features may be present for students at any educational
level and/or from any culture, some of the research indicates that international students feel
them acutely. Razek (2014) interviewed students from Saudi Arabia studying at a Midwestern
university about their views on academic integrity. His research built on a multi-campus study
in which survey data was collected from 673 students. Findings showed that students regularly
engaged in academic dishonesty, and their words aligned    

participant referred to the high stakes and extrinsic motivations, saying of the unauthorized

The participants also expressed fear of losing scholarships or being kicked out of their
programs, which represents additional extrinsic motivations. They also had low expectations of
success; Razek points out that the students saw

ideas and demonstrates the need for further research on this topic.

Hayes and Introna (2005) found that the international students in their study, particularly
the Greek and Chinese students, cheated on undergraduate exams in their home countries
because high grades were seen as essential for finding a good job or successfully applying to a

could be

attributed to an environment in which there is an emphasis on performance, high stakes riding
on the results, and extrinsic motivations.
It is important to note that these environmental factors can apply to all higher education
students, not just international students in the United States. Love and Simmons (1998) found
that the following factors contributed to cheating among graduate students: grade pressure
(corresponding to emphasis on performance) and lack of competence (corresponding to low
expectation of success). Minarcik and Bridges (2015) surveyed psychology graduate students
about academic dishonesty. They found that inadequate preparation and task difficulty, which
lead to low expectation of success, were common instigators of academic integrity violations.
3.3

Plagiarism
Much of the literature related to international students focuses on plagiarism, which is to

be expected since language proficiency and familiarity with American-style scholarship are
prominent issues. International students, particularly those who are non-native English
speakers (NNES) may plagiarize, intentionally or unintentionally, for a variety of reasons. Some
34

of these reasons are shared by university students globally (e.g., poor time management skills),
but some are mostly experienced by international students (e.g., varying levels of English
proficiency). Hayes and Introna (2005) conducted a study in which they interviewed students in

example, students take notes as they research, sometimes writing down text exactly as it

Problems with plagiarism. Some scholars and educators have found the

concept of plagiarism to be problematic. First, plagiarism has been oversimplified by professors,
universities, academic integrity councils, and many others. It can be quickly defined as the

Where is the line between inspiration and theft? Is there truly "      ,
Secondly, plagiarism is just not that easy to identify. For example, the phrase "  
    appeared in the previous paragraph without a citation, because it can be

considered a known idiom and thus categorized under common knowledge. But this phrase
might not be considered common knowledge by an Egyptian graduate student writing a
literature review or a Chinese professor grading research papers. There are many guidelines to
be interpreted for identifying plagiarism, and few clear rules. Because plagiarism is not so easily

36

identifiable, and because it is often considered an issue of honor, it is also difficult to approach
objectively (Pennycook, 1994, p. 278). Passing judgment on plagiarizers, a task assigned to
professors, administrators and honor councils, is no easy task.

in American higher education are Western and have not always been in vogue; these are modern
ideas (Pennycook, 1996). Globally, the West may play the biggest role in advancing academia,
but this does not mean that Western ideas of scholarship are the only or best ideas. Bloch

professor may have an understanding of what constitutes plagiarism, but be unable to explain it
to outsiders. In this case, international students are outsiders because they are not yet members
of the culture.
Pennycook, a professor who has taught all over the world and published extensively on
plagiarism and non-native English speaking students clearly articulates some of the problems
with the way that many in academia view plagiarism. First, he points out that often publications
that are identified as the result of original academic work actually depends on what he calls the

assistants (Pennycook, 1996, p. 213). Who can identify with certainty where each idea in a paper
or book originally developed? In fact, Pennycook often notes at the beginning of his writings that
the ideas included in his own work are the result of conversations with many colleagues, and
cannot be solely attributed to any one person. Second, issues of plagiarism and other forms of

37

academic dishonesty should be approached thoughtfully by educators. Certainly students,
whether domestic or international, must learn to successfully and ethically navigate the
American higher education system, should this be where they choose to learn. However, as this
chapter has established, the exact definition of plagiarism is often vague and open to
interpretation. As Pennycook (1996) states, 

International Perspectives on Academic Integrity
This section covers the academic integrity research that has been conducted outside of the

United States, including the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Turkey, Iran, China and Hong
Kong, Poland, the Ukraine, and Sweden, and concludes with academic integrity research related
to international students. Some of the research covered here is cross-cultural in nature,
comparing students in the U.S. with students in another country.

United Arab Emirates. There is little published research in English on

academic integrity among student populations in the Middle East and North Africa. Of the few
articles that do exist, most utilize weak methodology and provide little insight. Elzubeir and Rizk
(2003), however, conducted an interesting study of medical students at United Arab Emirates
University in Al Ain. They found that students are genuinely confused about plagiarism and are
reluctant to report colleagues for academic misconduct. The students viewed unethical practices
such as marking an absent classmate pres

makes this the only research to discuss Islam at all (p. 594). It should be noted, though, that this
approach to academic integrity is not unique to students in the Middle East and North Africa.
Students surveyed in North America have also indicated that they do not believe it is the
responsibility of the student body to monitor unethical behavior (Hendershott, Drinan, & Cross,
2000).

Results showed that students did not have a clear understanding of academic writing

narrowly on avoiding plagiarism instead of responding creatively and critically to the ideas they

plagiarism, presented the usual issues: unfamiliarity with what plagiarism actually entails,
difficulty with English-language writing, and overwhelming number of assignments, and a lack
of time.
In a case study of Indian postgraduate students studying in Australia, Handa and Power
(2005) found that neither English-language difficulties nor lack of academic integrity were
causes of plagiarism. Participants demonstrated understanding of academic integrity and
plagiarism in their own cultural contexts (i.e., undergraduate programs in India), but struggled
with applying this in the Australian higher education context. For example, one student lost
points on an assignment because he included a reference list but not in-text citations. The

Foundations of Cross-Cultural Adaptation
The research on cross-cultural adaptation has grown from the research on acculturation

and culture shock. Scholarly interest in acculturation can be traced back to the 1930s. Three
anthropologists were charged by the Social Science Research Council to explore the concept, and
they developed the following definition:
Acculturation comprehends those phenomena which result when groups of individuals
having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact with subsequent changes
in the original culture patterns of either or both groups (Redfield, Linton, & Herskovits,
1936, p. 149).

acculturation. His acculturation framework defines three different processes:
The term culture change refers to the process that results in population-level changes that
are due to dynamic internal phenomena such as innovation, discovery or major ecological
disaster. The term acculturation refers to the process that results in population-level
changes that are due to contact with other cultures. Finally, the term psychological
acculturation refers to the process by which individuals change, both by being influenced
by contact with another culture and by being participants in the general acculturative
changes underway in their own culture (Berry, 1990, pp. 234-235).
For example, the invention of the cotton gin prompted a culture change in the American South.
The arrival of Europeans in the Americas caused both the native peoples and the Europeans to
undergo acculturation. Berry points out that initially the Europeans learned a great deal from
the native people, but eventually this process shifted and the native people began to adopt more

46

aspects of the European culture. This study focuses on psychological acculturation, looking at
the individual adaptation experiences of international students studying in the United States.
Berry also identifies four varieties of acculturation: integration, assimilation, separation,
and marginalization. Each of these terms is defined in Table 3. In Figure 1, these acculturation
types are illustrated in relation to two major acculturation issues: maintenance of heritage
culture and identity and relationships sought among other groups.

There are a variety of factors associated with the relationship between acculturation and stress:

$

nature of the larger society

$

type of acculturating group

$

modes of acculturation

$

demographic and social characteristics of individual

$

psychological characteristics of individual (Berry, 1990, p. 248).

For example, the following may reduce acculturative stress for an individual: a multicultural
host society, perceived higher status of the individual (e.g., by ethnicity or profession), and the
open-mindedness and confidence of the individual.

that the sojourner is somehow defective upon arrival in an unfamiliar culture and requires
adjustment or adaptation. In addition, the culture-learning model avoids the ethnocentric idea
that the sojourner must abandon her own culture for the host culture. Instead, she is simply in
need of new skills and knowledge, which can be added to her already existing cultural
knowledge base. Bochner (1986) identified two core constructs of the model:
First, it regards the coping process as the acquisition of second-culture social skills, or in
its broader formulation, as culture learning. Second, it regards the goal of culture learning

AUM theory includes 47 axioms that can be combined to build theorems. The axioms are
organized by category, including self-concept, motivation to interact, reactions to hosts, social
categorization of hosts, situational processes, connections with hosts, ethical interactions, and
conditions in host culture. This schema is illustrated in Figure 2.

moved into a different and unfamiliar culture (or subculture).
2. The strangers are at least minimally dependent on the host environment for meeting
their personal and social needs.

3. The strangers are regularly engaged in firsthand communication experiences with that
environment (Kim, 2001, p. 34).
In addition, the theory is founded on the following assumptions:
1. Humans have an innate self-organizing drive and a capacity to adapt to environmental
changes.
2. Adaptation of an individual to a given cultural environment occurs in and through
communication.
3. Adaptation is a complex and dynamic process that brings about a qualitative
transformation of the individual (Kim, 2001, p. 89).

This idea is particularly relevant here, as communication is an essential component of an
international student success, both inside and outside of the classroom. The student must
communicate effectively with his roommate in order to maintain harmony at home, with his
classmates in order to produce a high quality group project, with his professor to receive a good
grade on a research paper. Verbal, non-verbal, and written communication are all critical in his
successful adaptation to American culture generally and American higher education specifically.

learning in the American environment, she is fully comfortable making contributions in class.
Perhaps she has internalized this style of teaching and learning, and is able to reconcile it with
the style to which she was accustomed prior to arriving in the U.S., recognizing the value of
both. This growth may not be obvious ' to an observer or even to the student ' but that does not
mean it has not occurred, as a result of the stress and her adaptation.
The relationship between stress, adaptation, and growth is considered to be dynamic,
because it is not a linear process. A person undergoing cross-cultural adaptation does not move
along a line with one phase leading clearly to the next. The relationship between stress,
adaptation, and growth is cyclical and recurrent. Kim ((

Cross-cultural adaptation research.

 -cultural adaptation theory

has not been used in library and information science research, but has provided a theoretical
foundation for research in communication, tourism, and education. The theory has been used to
explore a variety of populations, including Nigerian organization leaders in the U.S. (Adeniyi,
2013), Korean and American mission travelers in Cambodia and Thailand (Lee, 2011), and
Japanese and American workers in a plant in the American Midwest (Tankei, 2009). Most of the
research in this section, however, will focus on the cross-cultural adaptation of international
students.
In a 1995 study, Zimmermann explored the relationship between intercultural
communication competence and international student adaptation. Interviews were conducted
with 101 international students, with questions designed to measure the affective and behavioral

and their adjustment to American life  (p. 328). Zimmermann calls for universities to facilitate
interactions between international and domestic students through both formal (e.g., counseling
services outreach) and informational (e.g., pairing international and American students in a
buddy system) means.
Chen (2000) conducted a multiple method study of international students in the American

In a study of Chinese students studying in the U.S., Wang and Sun (2009) investigated
how loneliness influenced Internet use and cross-cultural adaptation. They found that although
loneliness did not predict higher Internet use, it did negatively affect cross-cultural adaptation.
In addition, non-lonely Chinese students were more likely to use the Internet for acculturation.

explore an issue in the real world, as opposed to a controlled setting like a laboratory, by
analyzing one or more of the following: group or individual experiences, interactions and
communications, and documents (Flick, 2007, p. x). This study focuses on the experiences of
individuals, although textual artifacts are considered as well (e.g., a course syllabus, a completed
written assignments) " not as a unit of analysis, but as a tool used in interviewing. Critical
incident technique (CIT) guided the study design.
This study uses semi-structured interviews in conjunction with critical incident technique
(CIT) to explore how international graduate students complete their academic work and think
about issues of academic integrity. This section outlines all aspects of the research design,
including method, CIT, data analysis and interpretation, and issues of trustworthiness.

Research Questions

RQ1: How do international graduate students studying in the United States conduct their
academic research and writing?
What steps do they take in the process of completing an academic assignment?
How do they conduct research and use the library and other resources in this process?
How do they integrate these sources during the writing stage of an academic
assignment?
RQ2: How do international graduate students studying in the United States perceive, engage
with, and negotiate issues of academic integrity?
What and how did they learn about academic integrity prior to entering graduate
school in the United States?
How do they think about academic integrity during the research and writing process?

The technique is a good fit for this study because findings are often used to inform practical
outcomes (Hughes, 2007), in this case the ways that academic librarians provide information
literacy training and academic integrity support to international students. There are five major
steps or stages in CIT:
1.

Ascertain the general aims of the activity to be studied.

2.

Make plans and set specifications.

3.

Collect the data.

4.

Analyze the data.

5.

Interpret the data and report the results (Borgen, Amundson, & Butterfield, 2008).

CIT is often used in service industry (Gremler, 2004; Grove & Fisk, 1997) and health care
(Arora, Johnson, Lovinger, Humphrey, & Meltzer, 2005; Bradley, 1992) research. In LIS
research, CIT has been used to study information seeking behaviors (Auster & Choo, 1994; Zach,
2005), reference encounters (Radford, 1996), research anxiety (Kracker & Wang, 2002), and the
use of scholarly journals by medical faculty (Tenopir, King, & Bush, 2004). Bianchi (2013) used
the technique to identify satisfiers and dissatisfiers for international students studying in
Australia. She identified four incident categories: international student performance,
educational service performance, socialization performance, and living environment
performance. In her doctoral thesis research, Hughes (2010) used an expanded critical incident
approach, collecting data via interviews and participant observation, to explore international

library more often than they had in their home countries, but some misconceptions remained.
For example, some participants thought that the resources provided by the library were all
produced by the library, and others avoided using library resources and services because they
expected to be charged for doing so. Hughes (2007) notes that she selected CIT for the following
reasons, all of which apply to this study as well:
it supports a straightforward qualitative approach;
it offers well proven, clearly defined guidelines for data collection and analysis;
it focuses on real-life human experiences;
it enables the development of practical outcomes;
it is relatively flexible; and
it has successfully supported other LIS and education studies (p. 52).
CIT guided the design of the proposed study, including data collection  question
development in particular  and data analysis. In this study, the incident to be identified and
explored was the completion of a graduate-level academic written assignment that required
research, with the additional goal of discovering how issues of academic integrity were involved
in the process. These assignments could be research papers, or any other type of academic work
that met the criteria outlined in the Establishing Plans and Specifications subsection (5.3.2). CIT
was used to learn about this particular human activity and the significance to the people who
were engaged in it (Hughes, 2007). The five steps of CIT are illustrated in Figure 5, and
described in relation to the proposed study in the following subsections.

Study participants were recruited through international student support offices at the

(Duke), and Office of International Services (NCSU). During January and February of 2015, I
met with the directors of each of these offices in order to explain my research and request

assistance with recruitment. All the directors were willing and able to help with disseminating
recruitment materials (see Appendices B and C) via international student email lists.
5.3.2.2 Situation: Sample. Purposive sampling, which is common in qualitative
research, was used in this study. As Palys (2008) writes,
Research participants are not always created equal one well-placed articulate informant
will often advance the research far better than any randomly chosen sample of 50 and
researchers need to take this into account in choosing a sample (p. 698).
Criterion sampling, a type of purposive sampling, requires that each study participant meet a
certain criterion (Palys, 2008)

 and in this case, participants had to meet several. Simply being

classified as an international student was not the only requirement. All participants met the
following criteria: they were international students who were

program, 2) non-native speakers of English, and 3) completing a degree program in the United
States for the first time. Current data shows that the top five countries of origin for international
students studying in the United States are China, India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Canada 5
(IIE, 2015a), and the numbers for North Carolina are similar. While it was anticipated that
students from these countries would be heavily represented in the sample, participants from any
country could be included as long as they met the stated criteria.
Flanagan (1954) acknowledges that there is no simple way to determine the necessary
number of critical incidents (and thus number of participants). He recommends concurrent data
collection and analysis, to continue until no new critical behaviors are evident in the data. Table

of the population (Government of Canada, 2011).

54). I took the same approach in this study. The criteria and context were explained clearly to
the participants before and during the interviews, thus it was unlikely that an incident of little
significance would be shared.
5.3.2.5 Observers. The final consideration for plans and specifications according to
Flanagan (1954) is the selection and training of observers (p. 339). In this study, I am the sole
researcher and so there is no need to train additional observers. I worked for three years as an
academic librarian in Cairo, working mostly with undergraduate and graduate non-native
speakers of English. I also led a multi-campus ethnographic study on how students conduct
their academic research, so I have familiarity with both international student populations and
studying the research process. As a result of these experiences (as well as the training I have
received in my doctoral program), I possess the skills and expertise to carry out this study.

not changed a great deal in the past 50 years, perspectives on research have. Flanagan was not
conducting research and writing from a constructivist viewpoint, as I am. For this reason, the
design of the study occasionally departs from his recommendations. The goal of this study was
to explore how participants construct meaning and understand the world through their
historical and social perspectives, and thus the interview method is the best fit. Kvale and

5.3.3.1 Recruitment. Participants were recruited on a volunteer basis, between June
and October 2015, through the international student email lists at UNC-CH, Duke, and NCSU.
The text of the recruitment email can be found in Appendix B. The recruitment email included a
link to an online questionnaire designed to determine eligibility. Interested students had to meet
the following criteria in order to participate in the study:

The content of the online screening questionnaire can be found in Appendix C. Between
June 24th and October 11th of 2015, 169 potential participants responded to the recruitment
email and completed the screening questionnaire. Of these 169, just more than half (96) met all
the study criteria. The majority of those who expressed interest and qualified to participate in
the study were NCSU students (64). Twenty-four UNC-CH students and only 8 Duke students
expressed interest in participating and met the criteria. The recruitment emails for NCSU and
UNC-CH students were distributed through official channels, from International Student and
Scholar Services (UNC-CH) and the Office of International Services (NCSU) listservs. Moreover,
anyone who wanted to send a message on the Duke International House listserv could do so by
joining the list. Thus, this is a high-traffic listserv with many messages about finding housing
and selling household goods. I suspect that my recruitment message was simply lost in the flood
of emails on this listserv, and few recipients noticed it.
I contacted 46 of the interested and qualified students by email to schedule a phone
conversation about the study. Since so few Duke students responded to the recruitment email, I
contacted all of them. I emailed most of the UNC students, but only about a third of the NCSU
students, using purposive sampling to identify students from a range of disciplines and
countries. Fourteen of the potential participants either did not meet the criteria for the study or
did not respond to my email request for a phone conversation. During these phone
conversations I reviewed their responses to the eligibility questionnaire, provided details about
the study, and answered any questions. The most important aspect of this conversation was
ensuring that the student had completed a recent assignment that required both research and

that potential participants did not meet study criteria following this phone conversation was the
lack of this type of assignment. I scheduled interviews with 32 of the 46 contacted students.
5.3.3.2 Interview protocol and procedure. Interviews were scheduled during the
telephone conversation, for times and locations which the participant deemed comfortable and
convenient. Each was scheduled for one and a half hours, although most lasted between 35
minutes and one hour. Almost all of the interviews took place in study or meeting rooms in
libraries and other campus buildings. Prior to beginning the interview, the participant reviewed
and signed the consent form (see Appendix E), and I answered any questions.
The interview protocol was developed using CIT, and thus was organized around the
participant describing a specific incident. However, the critical incident is not the main focus of

to feel comfortable.

77

e. Tell me about arriving to [UNC-CH, Duke, NCSU]. Did you receive an
orientation? What topics were covered? Was there anything in the orientation
that was new to you? Anything that surprised you?
The next questions focused on the critical incident, asking the participant to describe in
detail the process of completing a recent class assignment.
2. Think about a time that you had to complete a major written assignment that required
research for your coursework.
a. Describe the assignment.
b. Describe how you completed it. What was your first step?
c. Which tools and resources did you use?
d. Did you use the library to complete the assignment? How?
e. What was the most important resource that you used?
f.

How did you go about the writing part of this process?

g. What were some of the challenges in completing this assignment? Why?
h. What did you enjoy about completing this assignment? Why?
The next question introduces the concept of academic integrity. The student in the pilot
interview could not define it, and so this question was expanded to provide a definition of the
phrase after the participant answered.

types of academic misconduct, they do not give a clear definition of academic integrity. The
following definition, adapted from the Wikipedia (2015) definition, was used as an interview
prompt:
Academic integrity is the moral code of academia. Under this code, scholars must avoid
cheating and plagiarism, adhere to academic standards, and be honest in their research
and writing.
I read this definition to all participants after they had given their own definitions of academic
integrity. Once this concept and the critical incident had been fully discussed, I asked specific
questions about academic integrity throughout the research process.

The full interview guide can be found in Appendix F.
After the pilot interview, the student noted that it was difficult to recall each step taken in
the process of completing an assignment. For this reason, I gave details of what we would
discuss prior to the interview and invited students to bring along any helpful artifacts such as
syllabi, research notes, and/or the final product of the assignment. These documents were not
used as data sources, but as interview prompts.
5.3.4

Analyzing the data. Data analysis using CIT involves identifying and

classifying critical incidents and identifying critical behaviors related to them (Hughes, 2007).
This analysis was conducted primarily through coding, a process that SaldaÃ±a (2013)
recommends begin as data is collected and formatted (p. 20). Interviews were audio-recorded
and transcribed, and these transcriptions were coded. In addition, I wrote memos throughout
the analysis process relating to code choices, emerging patterns and themes, potential
relationships between codes, questions about the data, and my personal feelings about the
study.
5.3.4.1 Coding. I used the qualitative analysis software package Atlas.ti for data
management and analysis, allowing me to maintain interview transcriptions, codes, quotes, and
memos in one location.  

strategies for coding interview transcripts guided my

process. The first cycle of analysis included attribute and structural coding. Attribute coding is

were arranged by research question, so it was simple to apply structural codes to the participant
responses. These codes allow

     

Flanagan (1954) recommends that categories should not be identified ahead of time, but allowed
to emerge from the data. While this is possible (and desirable) at some levels of analysis, the
theoretical framework of cross-cultural adaptation provided guidance for data analysis,
including some codes. For example, 

stress,

adaptation, and growth. Each of these terms was added to the code book prior to beginning any
analysis. Additional codes, however, were allowed to emerge from the data.
After the first cycle of coding was complete, I revisited the codebook. Some codes were
combined, renamed, or removed all together. The second coding cycle is an important step in
analysis for several reasons, according to SaldaÃ±a (2013):

The second round of coding involved re-reading all transcripts and applying the updated coding
scheme. This was particularly useful because several months passed between the first and last
interviews were conducted. Larger themes and connections became clearer once I had read and
analyzed all participant responses. The final codebook was divided into four major categories of
codes, those relating to:
)

Cross-cultural adaptation theory (e.g., stress, adaptation, growth)

)

Cultural issues (e.g., language issues, life in the U.S.)

)

Academic work (e.g., learning something new, research difficulties)

assumptions of constructivism discussed in Chapter One guided my interpretation of findings:
1. Human beings construct meaning as they engage with the world they are interpreting.
2. Humans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their historical and
social perspectives & we are all born into a world of meaning bestowed upon us by our
culture.
3. The basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of interaction with
a human community (Creswell, 2014, p. 9).
The ways that an international student approaches her academic work and perceives issues
of academic integrity are shaped by her worldview. Thus, as I looked for relationships and
patterns in my data and thought about their meanings, I identified 

was essential for me to present differing perspectives on research processes and academic

particular value for librarians (and other faculty and staff) who wish to better understand how

relevance of this research is addressed in Chapter One: Study Overview, in the Study
Significance section (1.2), and the strategies for ensuring quality in the following section,
Trustworthiness. Birch, Miller, Mauthner, and Jessop (2002) point out that interview research

While I expected the assignment as a critical incident to be an innocuous topic of
conversation, I acknowledged that aspects of this conversation could be sensitive for the
participant

especially issues related to feedback, grading, or communications with the

professor. Academic integrity, as a question of ethics, was more likely to be a sensitive subject. I
thought that perhaps participants would be hesitant to discuss a concept that they know to be
important but may not completely understand, or to admit to violating honor policy. However, I
was surprised to discover that the participants were happy to speak frankly about these issues. It
was clear that the opportunity to discuss academic integrity was the primary reason several
students had volunteered for the study.
In order to ensure the comfort of participants and encourage them to share their
experiences, it was critical for me, as the investigator, to develop a rapport and relationship of

participants some information about my own worldview, by disclosing my international
experience and explaining my interest in this research topic. In addition, emphasizing my status
as graduate student potentially helped to reduce perceived power imbalance and emphasize the
similarities between myself and the participants. See Appendix F for the details of this
disclosure. More importantly, I took exceptional care to maintain the confidentiality of the
collected data, and report findings in a manner that protects participants.

Trustworthiness
The concepts of validity, reliability, and generalizability (or external validity) are generally

considered to be indicators of research quality. Gibbs (2007) explains that results are:

#

Valid if the explanations are really true or accurate and correctly capture what is
actually happening.

84

Reliable if the results are consistent across repeated investigations in different
circumstances with different investigators.
Generalizable if they are true for a wide (but specified) range of circumstances beyond
those studied in the particular research (p. 91).
These concepts as they have been traditionally defined and utilized by quantitative researchers
are not entirely suitable for qualitative research, such as CIT studies. Lincoln and Guba (1985)

concepts including credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability.

(Miller, 2008b, p. 909). The concept of credibility corresponds to internal validity, which is the
extent to which a study accurately reflects a causal relationship between variables. Jensen

corresponding to external validity, but can be considered transferable. The key to transferability
is providing a transparent guide to the research, including information about method, process
and context so that another researcher may determine whether or not the results are
appropriate for another environment that he or she wishes to study. As Lincoln and Guba (1985)
stipulate, the researcher is responsible for making available a transparent research process, so
that others are able to determine whether findings might be transferable to another population.
A variety of strategies can be used to increase the credibility and transferability of a study.
Creswell (2014) suggests the following: member checking, the use of thick, rich description,
clarification of researcher biases, inclusion of discrepant information, prolonged time in the
field, and peer debriefing (pp. 201-202). Borgen, Amundson, and Butterfield (2008) describe
85

credibility checks that can be used to determine the trustworthiness of a CIT study specifically,
including:
Interviews audio- or video-recorded, ensuring accuracy
Exhaustiveness (or saturation) to identify when new categories no longer emerge
Participant cross-checking

consistency, and/or repeatability of a study (Miller, 2008a, p. 754). It corresponds to two related
concepts included under the umbrella of trustworthiness: dependability and confirmability.
Dependability means that findings would be repeated if the study was replicated, and
confirmability indicates that findings are determined by the participants and not by researcher
bias. Because it is not possible to erase the effects of the researcher on the findings, these effects

supported through the use of inquiry audit, in which a knowledgeable outside auditor closely
examines the inquiry process (to establish dependability) and the results of the inquiry (to
establish confirmability) (Lincoln and Guba, 1985, p. 318). In the case of this dissertation
research, my advisor and committee members act as both inquiry and results auditors. In order
for this practice to be effective, the researcher must ensure that the research process is
transparent by documenting it meticulously through notes and perhaps a reflexive journal. In

86

addition, guarding against mistakes in transcription and code drift support reliability (Creswell,
2014, p. 203). See Table 9 for specific actions taken to increase the trustworthiness of the study.

Positionality
I want to make clear my own position, as this will certainly influence the proposed study.

Indeed, my own perceptions are constructed by my cultural background. As an American, I do
see the world through a Western lens. But as someone with personal and professional
international experience, I believe that I have a reasonable understanding of non-Western
perspectives. I expected and acknowledged that this study would uncover as many worldviews as
there were participants. Throughout this research, I reflected on my own position and strive for
objectivity, with the understanding that true objectivity is not attainable.

have occurred some time ago (p. 67). In fact, the student who participated in the pilot interview
stated that it had been difficult to recall the details of completing her assignment. However, my
ultimate goal was to explore participant perspectives on graduate level scholarship and
academic integrity through a conversation about an assignment. I am less interested in the
minute details of each step of the process; CIT is a tool to uncover perceptions of a broader
issue.
I made a particular effort to recruit participants from each of the three universities and a
variety of disciplines, and was successful to some extent. Yet even with the ideal sample
population, findings cannot be considered generalizable to international students studying in
the United States, or even international students at these three North Carolina universities.
Although not generalizable, this study was designed to be exploratory and potentially
transferable ( and sufficient detail has been provided for LIS researchers and practitioners
interested in applying the findings to practice or conducting similar research.

CHAPTER 6: FINDINGS
Findings are reported in this chapter and are organized by research question. Within each
research question section, results are organized by sub-topics related to the question. The
chapter begins with a description of study participants, including English-language background,
and participant perspectives on living and learning in the United States. The next section
discusses the findings related to Research Question One, including the critical incident
assignments, and participant research and writing processes. The chapter ends with the findings
related to Research Question Two. This section covers participant definitions of academic
integrity, how the students learned about the concept, and how they perceive it in the context of
their graduate level work.

Perspectives

Thirty-one international graduate students participated in this study6. All were non-native
speakers of English and enrolled in a degree program outside of their home countries for the
first time. Participants were all students at one of three North Carolina universities: North
Carolina State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or Duke University. They
were enrolled in graduate level programs in a variety of disciplines, including engineering,
health sciences, business, math/sciences, professional, humanities, and social sciences. Table 10
shows the number of participants that fall into each of these categories, as well as examples of

specific programs included in each. The 2015 Open Doors Report identifies the following as the
most popular fields of study for international students in the United States: business and
management (20.2%), engineering (20.2%), math and computer science (11.6%), social sciences
(7.8%), physical and life sciences (7.6%). However, these categories do not quite match those
used in this study. For example, communications/journalism and education are separate
categories in the Open Doors Report, but in this study both are categorized as social sciences.
The small sample size called for broader categories; in some cases there was only one student
from a particular program.

The majority of the 31 participants (58%) hailed from India or China. The remaining
students identified eleven different home countries. See Table 11 for more information about
countries of origin. According to the Institute of International Education (2015a), the number of
students from China studying in the U.S. increased by 10.8% between the 2013-2014 and 20142015 academic years, and students from India increased by a remarkable 29.4%. Of all the

States: South Korea (3rd), Vietnam (9th), Iran (11th), France (17th), Indonesia (18th), and

In order to protect the identities of the participants, they will be referred to by self-selected
pseudonyms. In some cases, additional steps are necessary to ensure anonymity. For example,
one student mentioned that when he arrived to his departmental orientation, he was surprised
to discover that he was the only Indian student in the room. If this student were identified by
university, program of study, and home country, he might be easily identified. Thus, when
information about a specific student is discussed, a combination of pseudonym, nationality, and
general discipline will be used

not university or program affiliation. Table 13 lists each

participant by pseudonym, gender, country of origin, and English language background.

English language background. As Table 13 shows, most of the participants

had studied English in school for years, starting in primary, middle, or high school. Only two
participants had begun studying English after completing their undergraduate degrees. Both
were from countries in which a second language other than English was common: Pushta spoke
Russian in addition to Kazakh, and Robert spoke French as well as several local languages
including Swahili. Half of the Indian students had attended schools in which English was the
language of instruction. The Chinese students had taken years of English classes, but generally
did not have much experience immersed in the language:
"I started to take English class since elementary school, but what we learnt at school were
not really practical in daily life. Then when I started to prepare for my TOEFL and GRE

Eight participants stated that their graduate programs in the U.S. required a great deal of
writing. They had little experience with writing assignments in their home countries:

assignments like research paper, or paper at all. It's mostly stuff that you have to learn and

This lack of writing experience will be covered more thoroughly in the Writing Difficulties
subsection (6.2.3.2) under the findings for Research Question One.
Differences between home country and American classroom expectations were apparent,
as well. Chinese students found it to be less formal in the United States. Paprika pointed out that

Eight of the participants mentioned the library and its available resources. Marisa, Daisy,

prior to beginning their graduate programs in the United States. Although the Chinese students
tended to use libraries as undergraduates, they used them in a different way. Mary observed that

Living and learning in the United States. Early in the interviews,

participants were asked about their arrival in the U.S. and any orientations they had attended.
To close the interviews, participants were asked about their perspective on living and studying

101

in the United States. Each described both the best and most challenging aspect of their
experience.
6.1.4.1 Orientations. All 31 participants had attended at least one orientation session
upon arriving in the U.S., and some had attended three. In some cases, students attended an
international student orientation, a graduate school orientation, and a school or departmental
orientation. Graduate school and departmental orientations tended to focus on administrative
information like coursework and requirements, and adjusting to graduate school in general. The
international student orientations provided an introduction to life in America including sessions
on cultural differences, vocabulary, campus resources (e.g., library instruction workshops,
writing centers), and logistical issues (e.  

accompanying sense of accomplishment as the best part of their experiences in the United

responses to this question. Students named a variety of things they liked about American higher
education in general and their universities in particular, including:


the expectation that students will express themselves in class



the opportunity to teach



university resources (e.g., library, writing center, student health services)



the ability to choose classes, and take classes in many departments



extracurricular activities (e.g., working on the school newspaper)



the opportunity to specialize, develop a scholarly focus



collaborating with classmates on project-based work

The Chinese students were less likely to give academic examples as the best part about
living in the United States. Five of the twelve spoke about the chance to live independently, or
the opportunities to travel around the country.

104

6.1.4.3 Most challenging aspect of the experience. When asked to describe the
most challenging aspect of living and studying in the U.S., responses fell into two major
categories: cultural challenges and academic challenges. In addition, twelve participants named
language issues as the hardest part of their experience:
The challenge would be the language barrier, because I need to express myself in English
which is kind of hard. I still remember that before, for the first couple of months, I need to
think really hard beforehand I can speak out. Sometimes I need to translate Chinese into

Students described a variety of cultural issues they found to be challenging. Estiatoras
disliked the wastefulness he witnessed in the United States. Two Chinese students, Rita and
Sabrina, mentioned the difficulty of b           

friends with you, but our language is not too good, we cannot really understand what you're
talking about. And when you talk about football or basketball, we don't really know about that,
we don't share the same topics." Sabrina also mentioned this lack of a shared cultural knowledge
base, and Ryan described learning which topics of conversation were acceptable to Americans.
Robert struggled to share his experience with professors and classmates he perceived to have a
narrow view of the world. Two students found learning to live away from their families to be the
most difficult. Michael explained that he had to learn to do things that his family used to do for
him, like preparing meals.
Academic issues were also challenging for participants. Several students mentioned heavy
workloads, challenging assignments, and deadlines. Shanaya explained the difference between
her educational experiences in India and the United States:

105

Like in India, we never had regular weekly assignments. We used to just study, we used to
have a lot of classes throughout the week and then in the end we just had a final exam. So
the way things worked for us was, we used to sit like one week before the exam, study like,
anything, study day and night, and then attempt the exam. And here, it's very systematic.
You are in a way forced to study every week because of the assignments. You're much more
organized, you do everything weekly instead of accumulating it in the end. 
Four students specifically named writing as the biggest challenge they had faced,
particularly since they had not had to do very much writing in their undergraduate programs.
Other classroom difficulties came up as well: giving presentations, contributing to the class
discussion, and learning when to ask questions. Clara described her experience in the American
classroom:
 

   s culture difference, if I have question I usually save it until

the end of the class to ask the professor. First it gives me some time to think and I don't
disturb the whole class. Here sometimes it's because of the language or I didn't make some
notes or it's because of the knowledge itself I can't understand. I found if I save it to the
end of class it's very hard to solve it later because the TA is only there for their office hours
and professor is always busy after the class time an  

     

Only two students identified financial issues as the most challenging aspect of living and
studying in the United States. However, five other students acknowledged the high cost of their
education during different points in the interview. One student selected his program because it
was the only one that provided loans to international students. Another explained that it is
better to study in the U.S. for graduate school than undergraduate, because two years is more
affordable than four.
6.1.5

Experiences and perspectives: Summary of findings. Most participants

chose American graduate programs because they believe that the U.S. offers a very high level of
106

education. Some also spoke of their desires to see more of the world, and experience personal
growth as a result. All students attended at least one orientation upon arriving in the United
States. Some were overwhelmed by the flood of information, but most appreciated these
orientations and viewed them as a sign that the universities prioritized student support.
When asked about the best part of living and studying in the U.S., three major themes
included the people (e.g., professors and classmates), the opportunity to learn and grow, and
various aspects of the educational environment (e.g., class discussions, collaborative
assignments). Language difficulties, cultural issues (e.g., lack of a shared cultural knowledge
base), and academic hardships (e.g., heavy workloads, writing assignments) were often named

that this assignment should have required research and writing. This assignment was the critical
incident. Participants were told that they could bring any materials that might help them
remember the details of the assignment. Some brought the course syllabus, finished paper, or
presentation slides. None of these materials were collected or analyzed, but simply used as tools
to aid in recall.
Despite this conversation, four participants arrived at the interview prepared to talk about
an assignment that did not exactly meet these criteria. In these cases, I asked the students to
describe the process of completing the assignment they had in mind but also encouraged them
to talk about any recent research and writing experiences.

Research processes. Several Chinese students mentioned starting this process

with figuring out an appropriate topic, usually through a discussion with the professor. Sabrina
remembered going to her professor for help with selecting a paper topic:

The other participants tended to jump right into the actions they took in describing their
research processes. The most common research process involved first identifying the major

Ok, and so I first determined what I will learn, will write in this paper, and I search a lot
of resources Wendy).
The next step was reading the documents  or at least the abstracts  and determining whether
they would be of value or not. This filtering process was clearly a skill to be developed  some
students found it to be challenging, and others had developed techniques for the process. Santi
explained:
Because when you do a literature review, you don't actually have to read the whole paper,
just read the abstract, and you scan and skim over papers and try to just visualize the
whole picture. So I learned that process of trying to get rid of things that you don't really
know. So say I start with thirty research papers, and then I started like, filtering, so it
narrowed down the topics and tried to be very specific depending on what I was going to

110

study. So I learned that process, and I think that's what research is all about. You start with
this much information and then, like, narrow it down and get to the point.
Next, most students would cut and paste either links to websites that they would return to later
for content, or quotes from resources that they deemed to be useful, and categorize them under
these headings:
"then I just copy and paste some, you know, information from the articles to the
document, and try to find, to kind of do a little bit of structure. So I knew that this
information I can use in my introduction, this information can be a part of this literature

At this point, the research and writing processes converged, and thus is discussed further in the
Writing section (6.2.3) below. Bordonaro (2008) found that the international students in her
study on writing and information literacy used a similar process. She describes a writing stage in

A few participants  especially those with work experience and a disciplinary knowledge

to support what they had already written:

Nine students identified Google Scholar as integral to their research, and 13 named Google. A
student who was assigned to write a memo to a CEO stated that he has a strong preference for
using Google to find information, and tends not to use the library:

one reason why I don't rely on the library is, library gets you a little bit outdated
information. When you're writing a memo to a business leader, you need to be very
updated. You need to know what happened yesterday, that could impact a decision in

sometimes the only copies are already checked out.
Only seven participants mentioned using books, and these were often textbooks or
volumes recommended by their professors. Students from Indonesia, Kazakhstan and China
sought out materials written in their native languages, because their research was focused on
their home countries and the most useful resources were likely to be published in these
languages.

112

A few students had developed more advanced research skills. Sabrina, Peter and Karl had
learned to use citation chasing, in which they searched the bibliographies of useful books and
articles to find additional resources:
I think my professor give me like several paper, articles to read first, and then she said
you can go to the, the reference part, and you can see if there is any other articles that
related to your thoughtAnd I read them over, and I forgot if I actually find some useful

not access articles they found on Google Scholar because they were behind a paywall, but that
these articles were often available through the library. Victor, Rita, and Santi learned to use
Google Scholar in conjunction with the library website for their research:
So Google at least gives you the titles of the papers, and then you have [university] library
resources where most of the papers are free. So you just go on the [university] library and

After describing their research processes, participants were asked to name the most

Google Scholar, while others named specific resources (e.g., a particular book checked out from
the library). Students that conducted original research usually identified the data they had
collected as the most important. All of the most important resources are listed in Table 15; note
that not all participants provided a clear answer to this question.

6.2.2.2 Research difficulties. When asked about the most challenging part of
completing the assignment, 18 of the 31 participants described an aspect of the research process.
They experienced these stressors throughout the research process, from selecting a topic in the
very beginning, to understanding the sources that they select to support their own work. Some

And what I remember from the first classes, they kept telling us we need to do something

Many students found finding and assessing potential resources to be difficult. Marisa
explained that there were doctoral students in some of her classes, and they already knew how to
do research. For her, the search was difficult because she had little experience finding sources.
Other participants were comfortable using search engines and the library website to find
resources, but then felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information that had to be assessed
for usefulness:
It's not easy to find exactly what you want. Sometimes you input the keywords and just a

Some participants found that the most challenging aspect of the research process came
after they had found and selected appropriate sources. For students like Barry and Sam, reading
and comprehending the materials proved difficult. Ryan explained that learning about an

6.2.2.3 Library instruction. Almost half of the participants referred to library
instruction in one form or another. Most provided little detail, and only seemed to have a vague
recollection of the content. Eight recalled that there had been a library tour or session during
orientation, but three of them noted that they had missed it

and showed little concern:

Three participants in three different disciplines

indicated that a professor had showed the class how to find resources in the

library. In each of these cases, the student was completing a different type of assignment, a
research proposal, a research paper, and an original research project. Daniel said that his
professor demonstrated a variety of discipline-

and the lengthiness of the writing process.
6.2.3.1 Writing process. As discussed in the Research Processes section (6.2.2) of this
chapter, many of the participants created an outline in a Word document to organize their
research and begin their writing process. Generally, notes or quotes from resources, or
sometimes links to websites, were pasted into the outline by topic. Often students were vague
about how exactly they created an original document, but in some cases more detail was
provided:

I could collect I would say 5 pages of information, and then I took every paragraph. I try

China all spoke of their lack of experience with writing during their prior education:

The length of time it took to complete a writing assignment was also problematic for many
students. Peter pointed out that a 15-page paper is overwhelming when it took him so much time

this does not include the research part of the process " just the writing. Spending so much time
wrangling with vocabulary slowed down the writing process for Barry. He always had a

Perspectives on the assignments. While participants tended to describe the

most difficult aspects of the assignments as specific tasks (e.g., finding useful resources), they
explained what they liked about the assignments in more general terms. One common theme
was the pleasure of learning something new. In particular, students enjoyed learning about and
integrating new perspectives from the literature into their own work:
So because it's a new field and when you do research you get to learn so many points,
diverse viewpoints. The interesting point, the same point can be put into perspective in
different ways by multiple writers. So it could be Academic Times, it could be Business
Wire, it could be The Economist  it's the same news, but said in different ways in two

completing the assignment, and many mentioned the positive feedback they had received from

requiring research and writing.
6.2.5

RQ1: Summary of findings. When asked about the process of completing

their assignments, the research and writing steps tended to be interwoven. Often, participants
created an outline for the assignment, searched for resources on each topic, and added useful
notes, quotes, or links to the outline document. The majority of students mentioned using

123

Google and/or Google Scholar, but two-thirds used library resources in their research. Overlap
obviously existed between these two groups. Participants struggled with big-picture research
issues (e.g., coming up with a good idea, finding a gap in the literature), as well as specific
details (e.   

sort of library instruction, usually during orientation. A few had received instruction in specific
classes, either from the professor or an invited librarian. In order to address research
difficulties, students sought out assistance from professors and campus resources such as the
library and learning center.
Writing also presented a challenge for many participants. Students from many different
countries explained that they had little experience with writing assignments during their
undergraduate programs. Learning to write in the American academic style, using an
appropriate scholarly tone, and the length of time required to write a paper were all common
difficulties. Participants adapted by using online tools and getting feedback from native English
speakers. When asked about what they enjoyed about completing these assignments, most cited
the opportunity to learn something new or the sense of accomplishment felt upon completion. A
handful, however, had nothing positive to say about the experience.
6.3

RQ2: How do international graduate students studying in the United States

perceive, engage with, and negotiate issues of academic integrity?
A number of the interview questions related to academic integrity with the goal of
exploring how international students learn about this concept, how they think about it, and how
it affects them as they complete assignments for their graduate coursework.
6.3.1

Defining academic integrity. To introduce the topic of academic integrity, I

asked participants to define the concept. Plagiarism and cheating were mentioned frequently in
these definitions: plagiarism by 11 students and cheating by nine. Ten participants included the

124

idea of giving credit in their definitions. This was expressed in different ways, usually related
directly to citing sources:

The concept of authorized collaboration was new for many of the participants. Often,
discussing homework with classmates was common practice in their home countries, and not
considered problematic. Some students had learned to be very cautious in their collaborations,
always checking with professors to see if discussion with classmates was allowed for specific
assignments. A Chinese student explained that he does discuss assignments with his roommate,
but only after they have each completed their own work. He viewed this as an important and
helpful process, because they learn from one another. Leo said that once an assignment had
been given, someone in the class would  

Of the 31 participants, three could not provide a definition of academic integrity at all and
one gave a definition that was simply incorrect. This student seemed to be thinking broadly
about academia when asked to provide her definition:
What are the challenges maybe, to dealing with everything, staff, professors. And
managing time, like everything about the academic environment."

As I did with each participant, I shared this definition with her after she had given her own:
Academic integrity is the moral code of academia. Under this code, scholars must avoid
cheating and plagiarism, adhere to academic standards, and be honest in their research
and writing.

After hearing this definition, this student demonstrated that she was acquainted with academic
integrity, saying that she was always careful to paraphrase when necessary. For two of the three

Learning about academic integrity. When asked where they learned about

the concept of academic integrity, participant responses fell into three categories. Fourteen
students stated that they had first heard of academic integrity upon arriving in the U.S., and
eight specifically named the orientations they had attended. Six had first come across this idea
in other settings  during a previous study abroad experience, in an intensive English course, or
from a professor in a particular course. Daisy had specifically sought out information on

an online research ethics training module for one of her courses.
Fourteen students from China, Benin, Russia, Colombia, the DRC, Vietnam, and India
described learning about academic integrity in their home countries, usually at different points
in their academic careers. Seven recalled learning about it between elementary and high school,
usually from teachers and in the context of cheating on exams. One student said that her mother
impressed upon her the importance of integrity:

127

So my mom taught me, actually. She says if you got a test and you got an F, you come back
home and I would not blame you. But if you come home and tell me you got an A but you
cheated during the exam  that is unforgivable Rita).
Six of these students had first learned about academic integrity during their undergraduate
programs. They usually spoke about it in terms of a writing assignment, perhaps an essay or
undergraduate thesis. In these cases, a professor taught the student about academic integrity,
often by explaining the necessity of references and citation.
It is important to note, however, that the expectations regarding citations seemed to be
different in some countries than what is expected in the American style of academic writing.
Citation styles were described as less rigid, which is perhaps one reason some of these
international students struggled with learning and adhering closely to APA or MLA. Marisa

they just put a bunch of literature that they didn't read at all, just to make it more sources.  
when students started their graduate programs familiar with academic integrity, they learned
that the rules and expectations are often different in the United States:

Academic integrity in graduate school. All but one of the participants

When asked if their classmates in the U.S. normally talk about issues of academic
integrity, 12 of the 31 participants indicated no. They gave a variety of reasons for this: because
they are worried about getting in trouble, because the rules are so obvious that it is not worth
discussing. One participant who mentioned the fear of getting into trouble explained that these
topics are not discussed because students are nervous about sharing work with one another. A

Eleven of the students observed that their classmates do talk about this topic. Two
common themes were apparent. The first was that academic integrity was discussed amongst
the international students because they worry about committing an infraction:

The second theme in these responses related to specific incidents that the students had
observed or been directly involved in. A social sciences student recalled that someone had been
caught copying from another student in one of her classes. A math/sciences student had found

131

himself in trouble with a professor over improper citation. These types of incidents were topics
of conversation among participants and their classmates, both American and international.
Once defining and learning about academic integrity had been covered, I asked the
participants if they thought about these issues while they completed their critical incident
assignment, described in section 6.2.1. Almost all (27 of 31) of the students said that they had.
They most commonly thought about academic integrity in terms of avoiding plagiarism. In fact,
three of them had a previous experience in which they had been reproached by a professor for
inadvertently plagiarizing. They learned to be very careful with their words, quotes, and

importance of proper citation. In a few cases, they seemed to consider proper citation as the key
defense against academic dishonesty. Sometimes students who said they were thinking about
academic integrity during their assignment were actually worrying about it:
"Yes, I was definitely worried about it because she was going to put it up online, and if a lot
of people see it and are like, 'Oh, this is mine,' then even legally I might be in trouble. I also
know that in America the legal thing is really big deal and you should never get involved in
it. So apart from the academic integrity I was also really worried about that. These two
things in mind, I was being extremely careful" (Shanaya).

Academic integrity violations. During some interviews, participants

several cases, students shared stories about their own brushes with academic integrity violations

discussion on inadvertent plagiarism in two different papers. In both cases he had neglected to
include quotation marks when needed. An engineering student shared his experience: He always

detect similarities in student work, he was concerned that one of these students had copied from
the other. None of these cases went further than a conversation with the professor, but each
student was shaken by the experience and came away with a deeper understanding of academic
integrity expectations. In a few cases, students gave examples of academic dishonesty that they
had witnessed. A social sciences student learned that her classmate copied an essay from the
Internet for an extra credit assignment. A business student heard that second year students will
sometimes pass their old work down to first year students.
Some students gave general descriptions of academic dishonesty in their own countries.
Students from India and China spoke of classmates cheating on exams, through simple copying
or more advanced techniques. One Chinese student described an answer service accessed by a
chip placed in the ear of the test-taker.

RQ2: Summary of findings. All but four of the participants were able to give a

definition of academic integrity, usually including concepts like plagiarism, cheating, and
properly crediting sources. When asked about where they learned about academic integrity,
fourteen students named their home countries, at some point between elementary school and
their undergraduate programs. One-third said that the professors in their home countries talked
about issues of academic integrity, usually in the context of exams. This was not a normal topic
of conversation among students in their home countries, according to the majority of
participants. Fourteen students indicated they had learned about it after arriving in the U.S.,
often during orientation. Participants noted that professors in the U.S. do tend to talk about
academic integrity, and these conversations often take place at the beginning of the semester as
part of the introduction to the course syllabus. For those students who stated that their
classmates in the U.S. do talk about these issues, these conversations fell into two major
categories: specific incidents that they had observed or been involved in, and the particular
worries of international students related to academic integrity.
Most participants did think about academic integrity while completing the assignment
they described to me, most frequently in terms of citing properly and avoiding plagiarism. Twothirds of them explained that they think about these issues differently after at spending at least a
year in their graduate programs. They believe that academic integrity is important because

However, most came to better understand expectations and developed techniques to help with

CHAPTER 7: DISCUSSION
This chapter offers further discussion of the study findings, with a particular focus on

  

-cultural adaptation and issues of academic integrity. The chapter closes

with implications for practice in academic libraries, and suggestions for future research.

Cross-Cultural Adaptation

 -cultural adaptation theory is based on the following boundary conditions,
which clearly apply to the international student participants in this study:
1. The strangers have had a primary socialization in one cultural (or subculture) and have
moved into a different and unfamiliar culture (or subculture).
2. The strangers are at least minimally dependent on the host environment for meeting
their personal and social needs.
3. The strangers are regularly engaged in firsthand communication experiences with that
environment (Kim, 2001, p. 34).

Cross-cultural adaptation theory is comprised of the stress-adaptation-growth dynamic
process model and the structural model, which includes dimensions (e.g., individual
predisposition) and related factors (e.g., preparedness, personal traits, ethnic proximity). This
section elaborates on the study findings through the lens of the process and structural models.

The participant quotes in Table 16 illustrate each aspect of the stress-adaptation-growth
dynamic. Paprika described the stress of learning to live in the U.S.; several other participants
made similar comments. Often, they lived with their families until the moved to the U.S., and
did not have to manage paying bills or even cooking meals. However, over the course of a year,
Paprika developed new knowledge and habits. She learned

the ability to handle her own problems instead of depending on others. Marisa described the
stress of trying to do academic research, and how she adapted by learning techniques from her
classmates. Once she better understood how to do academic research, her perspective changed
and she began to enjoy the process. After a classmate copied his work, Victor learned that his
previous view on academic integrity was not appropriate for the American context. All three of
these students learned to handle problems, and demonstrated that their perspectives had
changed and become more complex.

 d growth related to life in the U.S. was described in the

previous section (7.1.1). Robert also found himself to be overwhelmed by things like grocery
shopping and paying bills. He lamented that living in America made him feel like a kid, because
he sometimes did not know how to do things for himself. His adaptation was contingent upon
the knowledge of his roommate, another international student who had been in the country for
longer and possessed a better understanding of life in the United States.
Early in her time in North Carolina, Sabrina struggled with frequently being the only
Chinese student in her classes, and feeling unfamiliar with the American culture and history. A
year into the experience, though, she was confident in her ability to function in this

  

   Sabrina adapted by involving herself with domestic

students and university extracurricular activities, and experienced personal growth as a result.
She had developed into a person who was comfortable with meeting her social needs in the host
culture.
The literature often identifies finances as a major stressor for international students (Hull,
1978; Robertson et al., 2000; Sherry et al., 2010), however, this came up rarely in the interviews.
Homesickness and loneliness are also common themes (Hechanova-Alampay et al., 2002;
Pedersen, 1991; Rajapaska & Dundes, 2002; Robertson et al., 2000). But only two participants
made references to these topics when asked about the most difficult aspect of living and
studying in the United States. Victor spoke about this hardship:



Participants named a variety of cultural challenges they faced, such as the lack of a shared
knowledge base and the difficulty of befriending American students. The literature is clear on
this point: Interaction with domestic students is a crucial aspect of adaptation (HechanovaAlampay et al., 2002; Hendrickson et al., 2011; Hull, 1978; Klineberg & Hull, 1979; Selltiz et al.,
1963; Shram & Lauver, 1988; Zimmerman, 1995), and this was something that participants in
my study spoke about regularly. Some described how they depended on their domestic friends
and classmates for support, and others

often Chinese students

observed that it was difficult

to develop relationships with American classmates.
Other stressors were academic in nature. The examples given here are related to the
classroom and general learning environment. Students also described stressors related
specifically to research, writing, and academic integrity and these are discussed in the following
sections. During her first year in her graduate program, Shanaya wrote a white paper for a club
in which she was involved. She realized immediately that no one would be asking her for regular
updates on this project:

I had to be accountable for myself, so that was a tough part. Because, I don't know, maybe
the culture I come from in India we are used to kind of spoon feeding. Like there was a lot
of say, follow-ups that used to happen. And here there are not many follow-ups because
people expect you to be accountable for yourself. 
She responded to this realization by dividing the work into ten sections, and completing
one every week during a scheduled block of time on Friday afternoons. Her plan for this paper
was indicative of a broader adaptation. She explained  ight now I'm really organized, and I
organize my things weekly and have become really efficient. So that was challenging but I have
overcome it, over a period of one year.  During her first year in the graduate program, Shanaya
developed into an organized and efficient student, demonstrating personal growth.

143

After the first few days of the semester, Robert determined that he was not properly
prepared for class. He expected to passively listen to a professor lecture for the entire class
period, but his classmates were asking informed questions and contributing to discussion.
Robert sought out advice from his advisor, who explained that he needed to be checking the
syllabus, doing assigned readings, and coming to class prepared to contribute. It took him less
than a month to adapt to and feel comfortable with this new learning environment.
There is a great deal of literature on international students and the challenges of adapting
to a new and different education system (Badke, 2002; Bultheis, 1986; Ladd & Ruby, 1999;
Robertson et al., 2000). Common issues include rote memorization (Bultheis, 1986; Ladd &
Ruby, 1999; Lipson, 2008) and passive learning (Andrade, 2006b; Robertson et al., 2000).
Participants in my study did not have much to say about rote memorization, but class
participation was a concern. Andrade (2006b) found that Asian and Polynesian international
students struggled with participating in class, and this perception was echoed by students
Asian and otherwise

both

in my study. However, participants seemed to be very aware of the

differences between the education systems in their home countries and in the United States.
They often articulated these differences and acknowledged that they had to make behavioral
changes in order to adapt.
Language issues are a particular stressor in the classroom. Daniel sometimes struggled to
follow lectures, so he started recording them to review later. He said that he was growing

Botasky was nervous about giving a presentation in

class, having never done so in English. He planned his content carefully
understanding of the topic and carefully choosing examples

developing a thorough

and practiced his talk many times.

These students demonstrate how learning to do their academic work and meet expectations that
may be unfamiliar supports to the cultural adaptation process and personal growth.

144

Practically every study of international students addresses language issues in one way or
another. For non-native English speaking students, higher levels of language proficiency help
with adaptation (Heikinheimo & Shute, 1986; Senyshyn et al., 2000; Yeh & Inose, 2003). My
study was not designed to measure adaptation or English-language proficiency, so I cannot
speculate on the relationship between the two. However, my findings confirm that language is a
common source of stress for international students. Twelve named language as the biggest
challenge they had faced during their time in the U.S., but twenty-three of them spoke at length
about this issue at least once in their interviews. Schneider and Fujishima (1995) propose that

overlooked in the research (p. 3). The participants in my study certainly referenced university
and departmental cultures, but the frequency with which they discussed language indicates that
it was the more pressing issue for them.
7.1.1.2 Stress-adaptation-growth in research. As is evident from the Research
Difficulties section (6.2.2.2), research was a source of stress for many participants. In some
instances, however, students described both the stress and the adaptation, demonstrating how
the research process can contribute to cross-cultural adaptation.
As noted previously, Rita did not understand how to reconcile the differing opinions that
she discovered during her research. She said that she would write a paragraph based on what
she had read, and then come across another resource arguing the opposite. Professors were a
crucial source of information for the participants, especially when it came to learning how to
handle academic stressors. Rita   

found in his research; he estimated 15 to 20 hours a week spent on reading scholarly texts. He

The literature on the research processes of international students is sparse. A systematic
review of the LIS literature on international students and academic libraries showed that almost
half of the total publications focused on library instruction and/or information literacy (Click,
Wiley, & Houlihan, 2016). However, these publications tend to look at the library experiences of
international students (e.g., Hughes, 2010; Morrissey & Given, 2006) and not their actual
research processes. Some studies explore information seeking, but this is often narrowly defined
146

as online searching (Hughes, 2005; Mehra & Bilal, 2007). The research shows that international
students prefer to conduct their research using search engines like Google (Liao et al., 2007;
Morrissey & Given, 2006). Participants in this study certainly used search engines for their
academic work

sources for their research, but the internet access and search engines were not ubiquitous in the
mid-1990s so this is to be expected. Knight, Hight and Polfer (2010) discovered that
international students in their study preferred friends and professors as sources of information,
and my findings align with theirs. Many participants in this study often depended on classmates
for help with research and writing, and some also placed high value on materials recommended
by their professors.
7.1.1.3 Stress-adaptation-growth and writing. Writing was clearly a stressor for
many participants. They developed a variety of techniques to improve their writing, or simply to
ease the burden. These techniques demonstrate how the international students learn to write
both in English and in the expected American academic style, which is part of the cross-cultural
adaptation process. Some of their techniques are very simple: Leo explained that he uses lots of
tables in his writing assignment

synonyms, so that she does not repeat the same words again and again in her paper. Others use
online tools, like Grammarly to check grammar, Google Scholar to help with building citations,
and websites that detect plagiarism. Because she was not yet comfortable with this style of
academic writing, Elizabeth would find a similar paper to use an example. She paid special
attention to the vocabulary and sentence structures used by the author(s) of the example paper.
Feedback is of particular importance, from a variety of sources:

In my study, participants struggled the most with writing in the American style and using an
appropriate academic tone. These issues, like vocabulary, seem to fall into a category somewhere
between global and local skills.

7.1.1.4 Stress-adaptation-growth and academic integrity. Understanding and
learning to abide by American academic integrity standards was a confusing and stressful
process for many participants. This section illustrates how some students adapted to these often
unfamiliar expectations.
A social sciences student described writing her first academic paper in the graduate
program. For the literature review, she used the same technique that she had used during her
undergraduate program in China, building the text by pulling sentences directly from other

opportunity to correct the situation, the student rewrote the paper as she was instructed. During

A math/sciences student who worried about inadvertently committing plagiarism had learned to

Participants often spoke of fear when talking about academic integrity, indicating that it is
a source of stress (emphasis mine):
And I was really also surprised that in each orientation, they really talked about academic

integrity, and I was super scared about this, because I didn't know the rules and when
they referred students to some documents about academic integrity on the website, I went
there. But it was so huge, and I was really afraid that I don't know something, I can do

In a study of international undergraduate students, Shi (2006) found that the participants
viewed plagiarism as both a language and cultural problem. For example, it is a language issue
because the students struggled with English-language vocabulary, and a cultural problem
because the concept of plagiarism was simply different and/or taken less seriously in their home

phase of the stress-adaptation-growth dynamic, including learning to use available tools and
resources, and seeking help from different people on campus. Participants learned to use a
variety of tools, particularly when facing stressors related to writing and academic integrity. Leo
used a website called Grammarly to check his grammar. Mary used Google Scholar to build
citations. Several students mentioned using a thesaurus while writing. They were also motivated
to seek out resources, both from their universities and elsewhere. Ryan was delighted to discover
academic writing and presentation skills courses offered through the writing center. Santi often
searched for YouTube tutorials when he needed to know more about strategies for writing a
literature review. Hughes (2013) found that the international students in her study on using

pressure simply goes without saying for them; they are studying in a new culture and education
system and understand that they are expected to conform to academic, language, behavioral,
and other expectations. However, I would contend that when participants spoke about their
adaptive responses, they also acknowledged different types of host conformity pressure. When a
student describes a technique for writing a literature review or avoiding plagiarism, she is
implicitly recognizing the academic expectations she must meet  and these expectations are the
result of host conformity pressure. When Robert discovered that he needed to read the assigned
materials in order to prepare for class, or when Pushta learned to write her research papers in
the American scholarly style, they changed their behaviors in order to adhere to academic
cultural norms. When Ryan realized that Americans were often uncomfortable discussing
personal matters, unlike Indonesians, he changed his behavior to follow expected social norms.
The participants adapted in direct or indirect response to host conformity pressure.

His interactions with Americans at his university provided feedback on whether his behavior
was appropriate or not. Another student learned a lot about the university culture through his
communication with domestic students:

As was addressed in the Environment subsection (7.1.2.2) above, participants had little to
say about interactions with co-nationals. Thus, ethnic interpersonal communication was not a
topic of discussion during the interviews.
7.1.3

Cross-cultural adaptation, LIS literature, and the big picture. The

cross-cultural adaptation literature tends to focus on specific aspects of the structural model,
and often on intercultural communications competence. For example, Zimmerman (1995)
studied international student perceptions of international communication competence and
adaptation, and found that interactions with American students was the most important factor
affecting both. This type of research typically depends on quantitative measurement of factors

161

like adaptation, which was not the goal of my study. There is not a great deal of research using

many are difficult to measure. Most of what exists  see Chapter Four: Cross-Cultural
Adaptation, Cross-cultural Adaptation Research (4.6.3)  did not produce findings related to my
own. My study demonstrates that the theory can be used as a lens through which to conduct
qualitative research with practical implications.

students.    

librarians better understand this student population. However, the use of critical incident
technique allowed me to explore the specific steps participants take in completing an
assignment, including research and writing. My findings provide information about how exactly
international students struggle with these processes, perhaps providing useful information to
those who are tasked with supporting these students, such as academic librarians and writing
center staff. In addition, there are aspects of academic life and expectations in the U.S. that often
remain implicit and thus unclear to students from other cultures. For example, a professor
might assign a literature review without explaining what exactly this is or how a scholar writes
one. My research sheds some light on what has been effectively communicated to new
international students, perhaps through orientation sessions, and what has not been.
7.2

Academic Integrity
While students referred to cheating on exams when they spoke about issues of academic

integrity in their home countries, they tended to focus on plagiarism when discussing academic
integrity in the American context. As the study findings established, they generally had few
writing assignments prior to starting their graduate programs in the U.S., so it makes sense that
they would be more focused on plagiarism in a setting in which they were expected to do a great
162

deal more writing. This section explores further student perspectives on plagiarism, with a focus
on patchwriting, paraphrasing, and citing sources.
7.2.1

Patchwriting and paraphrasing. Although students were keenly aware of

the concept of plagiarism, and sought to avoid it, some of their writing processes would
technically be considered plagiarism by most institutional definitions. I would consider their
techniques in most cases to be patchwriting. Howard (1992), who coined the term more than 20
years ago

 



and then deleting some words,

altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-for-  

    

In

some cases, when participants described their research and writing processes, they seemed to be
describing patchwriting:


I knew what I wanted from that paragraph, so I try to have those words and rephrase the

sentences around from each of those and then combine them in the end. That's how I write
it."


Sometimes I will try to write my own sentence but that's a little bit difficult for me

because I don't have that much knowledge about these kind of public health things. So I
will try to do a lot of paraphrase. I try to paraphrase a lot, either change, change the whole
sentence structure and try to substitute a lot of words, because I feel like plagiarism is
really emphasized here


So generally, I will go through the paper, and if I find it useful I will copy the title of this

 

and Google can create the citing for me. And I just copy that in Google Scholar in

case I need a reference. And to see which, which paragraph or which part I want to cite.
And then try to rephrase it a little bit
Usually these students view their actions as paraphrasing. In fact, twelve of them spoke
specifically of paraphrasing, and have evidently learned that this is an essential technique for

163

avoiding plagiarism. The Chinese graduate students in Qian and Krugly-  

Common causes of patchwriting include lack of reading comprehension, unfamiliarity with
the discourse in a particular discipline or with an academic writing style, and limited language

Raymond and Parks (2002) studied Chinese students enrolled in an MBA program at a
Canadian university. Their participants were also overwhelmed by the amount of reading that
they were expected to complete, and developed a variety of coping mechanisms such as
prioritizing a particular subject over another or reading only certain parts of an article.
Felix wrote a paper in which he conducted original research, but had to frame his work
using a particular leadership theory. He struggled with this aspect of the assignment, because he
was still learning the discourse in the field:
So after I finish the whole essay, I went, went through my whole paper, I was still
concerning that whether this theory were suitable for this context in an organization.

the same conclusion about most of the participants in my study.
Pecorari (2008) identifies two types of textual plagiarism: prototypical plagiarism, which
requires the presence of deceptive intentions (e.g., turning in the same paper that a friend wrote
and submitted in a previous semester, copy and pasting full paragraphs from a paper found
online), and patchwriting, in which the intention to deceive is absent (p. 5). Despite the
prevalence of patchwriting, participants were generally doing their best to avoid plagiarism and
adhere to expected academic integrity standards. Only one student described his writing process
in a way that would be considered prototypical plagiarism. He explained his method for writing
a literature review:

Although this may be considered a case of prototypical plagiarism, I do not believe this student
was intending to deceive. His course of action was a response to the stress of trying to complete
an academic writing assignment without the necessary English-language skills. In the eyes of an

Citing sources. Two-thirds of the participants spoke specifically about the

importance of citing sources. Some view citations as the primary solution in avoiding
plagiarism. When asked if she worried about academic integrity violations while completing her

found them to be illogical. Leo wondered why it is necessary to paraphrase and cite:
he source is being explicitly stated, why should I take the pain and paraphrase it? I don't

Some participants acknowledge that citation is important, but that it does not usually
apply to the academic work that they do. Felix clarified that in the assignment he was describing,

These unfamiliar citation styles presented challenges for several participants. None had
encountered citation styles like APA, MLA, or Chicago prior to starting graduate school in the
U.S., even those who had some experience with citing sources in their undergraduate programs.
Librarians Chen and Van Ullen (2011) designed workshops on the research process and
plagiarism specifically for the international students at their university. They also found that the
participants struggled with citation requirements because they vary widely between cultures.

Overall, participants understand the importance of proper citation, but some find adhering
to the extensive guidelines to be challenging. As Wendy observed, even when she has guidance
about the rules of the required format, the process is still not always simple. She explained that
sometimes she cannot find the information she needs (e.g., an edition number) or details about
how to cite a specific type of resource (e.g., an e-book).
7.2.3

Academic integrity, international students, and the big picture. My

study does not fit neatly into the literature on academic integrity, which tends to focus on
student perceptions of or self-reported engagement in specific dishonest behaviors. I am less
interested in discovering the percentage of international students who admit to plagiarizing '
particularly since many do not seem to really understand whether they are doing so or not ' and
more interested in understanding how they negotiate these issues as they complete their
academic work. This study was designed to provide practical information and to inform practice,
and this is covered in the following section.
7.3

Implications for Academic Librarians
The findings of this study, particularly those related to research and academic integrity,

can offer some insight to academic librarians wishing to develop or improve support for
international student populations. This section outlines recommendations for library
orientations, information literacy instruction, outreach, and academic integrity support.

169

7.3.1

Library orientations. Despite experiencing some information overload,

participants seemed to learn a lot about university services and support during their orientation
sessions. Twenty years ago, Heikinheimo and Shute (1986) found that students tended to rely
primarily on informal information networks to find this sort of information. In 2006, Morrissey
and Givens reported that library orientation sessions held at the beginning of the semester were
not particularly helpful for international students who are still learning to function in an
exclusively English environment. It certainly makes sense that this would not be the ideal time
to delve deeply into the details of database searching or obscure library services. Several
students were clearly overwhelmed by the amount of information provided during orientations.
But participants did remember general topics that were covered and described the experience in

t was pretty intensive and it was good 

experiences would indicate that orientation does not necessarily to need to provide all the
answers, but to make sure that student know where to find the answers they need. Based on the
literature and these findings, librarians might make the most of their time at international
student orientations by 1) clarifying their roles as research support, 2) sharing contact details
and encouraging students to get in touch for assistance, 3) describing a few library resources
that are likely to appeal to the audience (e.g., study spaces, inter-library loan, English language
support), 4) promoting library instruction workshops.

demonstrate that there is opportunity for librarians to provide instruction support for a variety
of topics. While many students indicated that their orientation sessions introduced them to the
American higher education environment, they still struggled to adapt. University faculty and
staff may make assumptions about these students that are unfounded  they know how to do
academic research, they know how to write a research paper, they know how to use a certain
citation style. Libraries might consider hosting a series of workshops designed to introduce
170

international students to these big academic issues and also teach the skills needed to succeed in
American higher education. For example, the library, writing center, and disciplinary faculty

process of finding, assessing, and synthesizing information. When describing her process, Riya
emphasized that synthesis is the most important aspect of writing a literature review, making
connections between the different papers and research findings. This is the sort of skill that may

information overload and assessing the value of resources are clearly research tasks with which

Librarians should also think about considering and incorporating different cultural
perspectives when they design information literacy instruction. The language of the Framework
encourages this



for example, calling for learners to:

develop and maintain an open mind when encountering varied and sometimes
conflicting perspectives (ACRL, 2016, Authority Is Constructed and Contextual)



question traditional notions of granting authority and recognize the value of diverse
ideas and worldviews (ACRL, 2016, Authority Is Constructed and Contextual)



understand that intellectual property is a legal and social construct that varies by
culture (ACRL, 2016, Information Has Value)



understand how and why some individuals or groups of individuals may be
underrepresented or systematically marginalized within the systems that produce and
disseminate information (ACRL, 2016, Information Has Value)



recognize issues of access or lack of access to information sources (ACRL, 2016,
Information Has Value)



recognize that systems privilege authorities and that not having a fluency in the
language and process of a discipline disempowers their ability to participate and
engage (ACRL, 2016, Scholarship as Conversation)

Academic librarians must keep in mind that when they provide library instruction, there are as
many perspectives in the classroom as there are students. Ideas about information and research
are socially constructed, and thus differ from culture to culture.
The LIS literature contends that library instruction efforts are particularly well-received by
international students (Battle, 2004; Detlor et al., 2011; Song, 2004). However, participants in
this study did not speak with a great deal of enthusiasm regarding the library instruction they
received. In most cases, they did not respond negatively, but simply gave the impression that
these sessions were not especially memorable. Perhaps designing library instruction based on
176

evidence

such as research like this in which international student are given the opportunity to

express their research needs and perspectives in their own words

would result in more

effective and appreciated instruction.
7.3.3

Outreach. Study participants often spoke of the support and assistance they

receive from their classmates. This finding aligns with the research showing that international
students value and benefit from contact with domestic students (Hechanova-Alampay et al.,
2002; Hendrickson et al., 2011; Hull, 1978; Klineberg & Hull, 1979; Selltiz et al., 1963;

and properly citing sources. Lisa and Sabrina both depend on American friends to give feedback

students sometimes altered their information seeking behaviors, particularly those related to
finding and citing sources, after observing the behaviors of their domestic peers.
It is plain that most of these participants valued their interactions with domestic students
and these interactions encourage cross-cultural adaptation. Librarians might keep this in mind
when planning outreach initiatives for international students. Particularly at universities that
have limited English-language support, libraries might offer English discussion groups led by
American student volunteers. A series of panel or small group discussions about life and higher
education in the U.S. could also be an excellent opportunity for American and international
students to interact, developing intercultural competency skills for both groups.
7.3.4

Academic integrity support. Although teaching skills like paraphrasing and

summarizing may seem to fall under the purview of writing and composition faculty, I would
argue that librarians have a responsibility to promote academic integrity on campus. The

It is not enough for librarians to teach

students how to find information, it is also necessary to teach them to use this information 
and use it in a responsible way.
Participants undoubtedly understood the importance of paraphrasing and citing sources,
but still required support in developing these skills. They are confident in their abilities to
paraphrase, but are often engaged in patchwriting instead. They are citing their sources, but
sometimes struggle with the complex guidelines. On top of all this, they are fearful of
committing a violation in an academic integrity system that they only partially understand.
Again, designing instruction that provides both larger context and specific skills would be of
particular value for international students. Librarians can help them to understand the
American academic integrity framework, as well as why specific behaviors are problematic in
this system. Students appreciate citation style-specific assistance (e.g., a workshop on MLA), but
can also benefit from understanding why proper citation is important and not just a tedious
chore. This recommendation is supported by  

Implications for Faculty and Writing Center Staff
The findings of this study show that international students value their relationships with

professors and are willing to go to them for guidance. Faculty can provide support by being
patient and open-minded, and remembering that these students are adjusting to a new
educational environment and represent different worldviews. It is also important to avoid the
assumption that students are familiar with both general academic concepts and discipline
specific vocabulary. For example, it is obvious to the professor that an original research paper
178

should include an introduction, literature review, and methods, findings and discussion sections
but this may not be at all clear to a first year graduate student from Saudi Arabia. Findings
also demonstrate that students want to make necessary changes and learn new skills to succeed
in their graduate programs. They also respect their professors and value their advice. Faculty
can direct international students to campus resources like the writing center and library
instruction workshops. Some college and university libraries have librarians who focus
specifically on supporting international students. Faculty can collaborate with these librarians to
learn how to better support this population, especially when it comes to the development of
research and information literacy skills.
Many participants in this study used the resources available through the writing center,
with varying degrees of satisfaction. In order to better serve international students, writing
center staff should also understand that these students come from a variety of cultural and
educational backgrounds, and avoid making assumptions about their knowledge as related to
American higher education and writing expectations. Building relationships with these students
and providing holistic writing feedback

covering grammar, vocabulary, style, and content

will likely lead to improved support and student satisfaction. Participants used a variety of tools
in their writing processes, so it would be helpful for writing center staff to introduce resources
such as the Purdue OWL and writing tutorials on YouTube. Resources can be recommended in
face-to-face sessions, and also collected on the writing center website.
7.5

Future Research
During the design phase of this study, there was some concern about the abilities of

participants to express themselves effectively in spoken English. With only a couple of
exceptions, these participants demonstrated excellent language skills and provided rich data
through the interviews. I recommend that future research on international students be designed
in a way that allows participants to express themselves using their own words, in their own
179

voices. In 2002, Brai      

(p. 65). He was writing as a non-native

speaker and prior international student, but for researchers who do not fit in either of these
categories (like me), the voices of participants are particularly important. In addition, studies
designed to take a longer view of the adaptation process would be valuable. A longitudinal study
following a cohort of international students over the course of their educational sojourn would

Academic integrity research often focuses on exploring which specific behaviors students
perceive as dishonest (e.g., Elzubeir & Rizk 2003; Song-Turner, 2008) and/or determining
exactly how often students engage in these behaviors (e.g., KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼ktepe 2014; McCabe et al.,
2008; Trost, 2009). While this research provides useful information how students perceive
these issues, I believe that tying the academic integrity discussion to a specific assignment is of
particular value. The findings of this study can help faculty understand how the work they assign
helps students develop necessary academic skills but may also cause them to develop some lessthan-ideal habits. In addition, the findings could help librarians better teach students about the
ethical use of information. Further research into how students actually research and negotiate
academic integrity  not just what they think about these issues in the abstract  could provide
actionable findings with clearer implications for faculty and staff in higher education.
This study has shown that there is a clear connection between the information and
research needs of international students and the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy
for Higher Education. While previous research (e.g., Detlor et al., 2011) on international
students has used the old ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education, which were approved in 2000, future research could explore the information literacy
skills and training of international students using the new Framework.

180

International students in the U.S. must adapt to the America higher education system in
order to succeed academically and earn the credentials they have chosen to pursue. However,
the expectation of intercultural competence should not be expected solely of them, but also of

diversity in and of itself is of little value unless we can enhance communications among
diverse individuals and groups (p. 202).
The mere presence of international students in the classroom and on campus is not enough, if
their classmates and professors are not benefiting from their perspectives and experiences. A
2007 study found that international LIS doctoral students were frustrated by the narrow
perspectives of their American classmates and professors. The authors argued for purposeful

my study clearly appreciated the support they received from their classmates related to research,
writing, and academic integrity. Future research might explore the connection between the
adaptation of international students and their interactions with domestic students, with a
particular focus on the intercultural competency development of both groups of students. As
most of the research focuses on the necessity of adaptation for international students, a study
looking at the cross-cultural adaptation of all students (and perhaps faculty, too) would be a
valuable addition to the literature.

181

CHAPTER 8: CONCLUSION
This qualitative study investigated how international students enrolled in graduate
programs at three North Carolina universities conducted their academic research and writing,
and negotiated issues of academic integrity in the process. I used critical incident technique and
semi-structured interviews to explore the processes participants employed to complete graduate
level assignments.   

           -

cultural adaptation theory, particularly the stress-adaptation-growth dynamic.
Participants demonstrated impressive levels of English-language competency, but still
spoke frequently about the challenges of reading, writing, speaking, and learning in an Englishlanguage environment. They struggled with research and writing for a variety of reasons (e.g.,
finding useful resources, writing in the American scholarly style), but developed techniques to
combat these problems. Participants understood the importance of academic integrity and
worked hard to adhere to the rules  although their efforts were not always effective. Most
indicated that issues like plagiarism are emphasized in the U.S., but this was not the case in
their home countries. The study findings have implications for faculty and staff who provide
support and services for international students, and particularly for academic librarians in the
areas of library/information literacy instruction, outreach, and academic integrity support.
My study contributes to the research on library support for international students by
looking specifically at their research processes  much of the LIS research focuses on this
populations library experiences, and sometimes on their everyday information seeking. My
findings, however, illustrate the relationship between how these students conduct their research
and the knowledge practices and dispositions of a learner developing information literacy
182

capabilities described in the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education.
In addition, much of the research on academic integrity focuses on rates of self-reported
cheating behaviors or the reasons that international students commit academic integrity
violations. My study contributes to this literature by demonstrating that international students
are often aware of the importance of adhering to academic integrity policies and of the
differences between expectations in their home countries and the United States. In addition, I
have argued for the role of academic librarians in promoting academic integrity as a part of
information literacy instruction.
It is unlikely that the number of international students studying in the U.S. will begin to
decline any time soon. This study was designed to provide guidance for those who wish to
provide better support for international students in the library, classroom, and all over campus.
The internationalization of higher education continues, and the importance of intercultural
competence for everyone

students, faculty and staff

grows. As international students are

better supported at U.S. colleges and universities, the better they are able to adapt and interact
successfully with their classmates, faculty, and others they encounter. In a world in which the

Library Science at UNC Chapel Hill. Before I entered the PhD program, I was an academic
librarian at the American University in Cairo. I loved living and working in Egypt, and during
my time there I became very interested in the ways that my Egyptian students approached their

research, and understood issues of academic integrity. I also thought a lot about how different
cultural perspectives change the way that people approach education, research, and academic
integrity  
