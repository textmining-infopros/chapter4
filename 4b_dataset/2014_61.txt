ABSTRACT
Laura Sheble: Diffusion of Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review, and Related Research Synthesis Methods:
Patterns, Contexts, and Impact
(Under the direction of Diane Kelly)

Like collaboration and interdisciplinary scholarship, research synthesis methods are used to
integrate science knowledge. Unlike collaboration and interdisciplinary scholarship, research
synthesis is a scientific method researchers apply to systematically and explicitly integrate knowledge
from primary research studies to estimate the best answer to a specific question based on
accumulated research findings. This study investigates the diffusion and impact of research synthesis
methods at the macro- and meso-levels. At the macro-level, diffusion from 1972-2011 is described using
bibliometric methods. Relatively modest engagement with the methods in the 1970s and 1980s was
followed by increased engagement across a greater diversity of fields in the 1990s. Engagement with
the methods continued to increase and spread across fields through the first decade of the 2000s.
Engagement with research synthesis methods was strongly correlated with engagement with
evidence-based practice (ρ=0.893, p < 0.001) and the number of years a field engaged with the
methods (ρ = 0.706, p < 0.001), moderately correlated with engagement with past research (ρ = 0.403,
p < 0.001); and modestly correlated with Biglan class (ρ = 0.279, p = 0.011). Five fields, Evolutionary
Biology, Conservation Biology, Social Work, Women’s Studies, and Information and Library Science
were selected for investigation at the meso-level. Content analysis, topic modeling, and qualitative
summaries of literature at the intersections of these fields and research synthesis contextualize the

iii

diffusion process and reveal differences and similarities across field contexts. Bibliometric evaluation
indicates that adoption of research synthesis contributes to changes in collaboration patterns: a
greater number of authors contribute to research syntheses than research reviews in fields where
collaboration on research reviews is low. This study provides some evidence that use of the methods
has refined rather than replaced roles of traditional research reviews in Social Work; and illustrates
interactions between innovations and use contexts. Innovations and their contexts are modified
through adaptations influenced by historical contexts, values, and goals that intersect with the
innovation use context.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I am grateful to all of you who have, knowingly and not, contributed to my dissertation
experience. This work would not have been possible, and there would not have been joy in doing it,
without you.
Diane Kelly, thank you for being an ideal mentor. I discovered my dissertation topic through
conversation with you, and this project benefitted greatly under your guidance in all the days that
followed. Thank you again.
Brad Hemminger, Joanne Gard Marshall, Lokman Meho, and Barbara Wildemuth, together,
you have been an ideal committee for this research. Your guidance and feedback have improved my
research and stretched my perspectives on the impact of open science practices, evidence-based
practice, bibliometrics and information resources, and research methods and practices.
The opportunity to work at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) while
working on this project has enriched how I think about synthesis. I am especially grateful to Craig
McClain, who made contemporary Evolutionary Biology research more accessible to me; and Kate
Hertwick, with whom I have enjoyed conversations about synthesis, and to whom I am indebted for
coding. Similarly, the opportunity to be a part of the Advancing Theory and Research on Scientific
Synthesis working group, supported by NESCent and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
Synthesis (NCEAS) has enriched my view of the role of synthesis in science. Thank you, John Parker
and Edward Hackett, for extending the invitation to join; and working group members, for sharing

vi

your knowledge and engaging discussions.
Ismael Rafols, thank you for sharing your expertise on diversity and bibliometric mapping.
Thank you, Joanne Marshall, for providing me the opportunity to attend graduate school with
the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) Fellowship. Thanks also to Thomas Wall, and
colleagues at the Duke University Libraries and involved in the TRLN Fellows program, you were
generous hosts. Gary Marchionini and Helen Tibbo, thank you for the opportunity to work on the
VidArch Project, and Todd Vision, for continued support at NESCent.
I would like to thank my students: I have been inspired by your enthusiasm and the diversity
of experiences and perspectives you shared in class. Thank you for your feedback and reflections on
my work, and especially on your experience with the abbreviated systematic review assignments.
My friends and colleagues in the SILS Doctoral program, thank you. Carolyn Hank, Songphan
Choemprayong, and Sanghee Oh, it has been some time, but our early projects were most enjoyable.
Annie Chen, it has been terrific to work with you. Thank you for your contributions to coding for this
project. Kathy Brennan, Yan Zhang, Dana Hanson-Baldauf, Amber Cushing, Rachael Clemens, and
many others whom I have failed to name, you have been terrific comrades in this experience. It has
been a delight and honor to learn from you.
To my long-time friends, Penny, Vernay, Rick, and Shannon: Thank you for always being there.
Penny, thank you for drawing on your expertise for coding!
Finally, thank you to my family: Mom, Dad, Barry, Yvette, Jason, Abbey, and Kiyan. You have
been my constants throughout this experience. I would not be here without you.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
Like collaboration and interdisciplinary scholarship, research synthesis methods are used to
integrate science knowledge. Unlike collaboration and interdisciplinary scholarship, research
synthesis is a scientific method researchers apply to systematically and explicitly integrate knowledge
from primary research studies to estimate the best answer to a specific question based on the
accumulation of scientific findings. Additionally, research synthesis methods are often used with the
intention of translating research-based knowledge for use in professional practice and policy contexts.
Following the development of contemporary procedures of research synthesis methods in the
1970s by psychology and education researchers, the methods, under the labels “systematic review” and
“meta-analysis” became an integral component of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement that
revolutionized how research is done in the health and medical sciences. In psychology, research
synthesis is credited with providing empirical procedures that enable cumulation of knowledge
(Hedges, 1987). Diffusion of the methods has been driven in part by the EBP movement, and in part by
beliefs in the benefits of the accumulation of scientific knowledge and consensus formation.
Receptivity across science fields has varied.
Skeptics suggest limitations in how research synthesis is applied; restrictions related to the
characteristics of studies that can be synthesized; and exclusion of experiential knowledge and
professional expertise limit the integrative capacity of the methods. In fields in which research
synthesis is the preferred method of research review, it may be argued that knowledge, evidence, and

1

understandings gained through methods or processes that are not congruent with prevalent forms of
research synthesis are at best, ignored; at worst, delegitimized.
The politics of knowledge notwithstanding, research synthesis has changed approaches to
research integration within and at the boundaries of many fields of science. This is consequential for
Information and Library Science because use of the method requires intensive use of information
systems by researchers; and changes in research practices associated with the method may affect
bibliometric patterns.
Past research has focused on adoption and use of research synthesis in specific fields,
generally by members of those fields. Some researchers advocate use of research synthesis methods
(e.g., Ankem, 2005; Garrett & Thomas, 2006; Madden & Paul, 2011; Rosenberg & Donald, 1995;
Saunders, McDowall, & Rojon, 2011; Sutherland, Pullin, Dolman, & Knight, 2004; Urquhart, 2010;
Whiston & Li, 2011), critique how research synthesis is implemented (e.g., da Silva, Santos, Soares,
Franca, & Monteiro, 2010; Gates, 2002; Stewart, 2010; Tirilis, Husson, DeCorby, & Dobbins, 2011), and
examine specific elements of the use of research synthesis, such as search and literature retrieval
(Glanville, Lefebvre, Miles, & Camosso-Stefinovic, 2006; Krieger, Richter, & Austin, 2008; Whiting et
al., 2011; Yoshii, Plaut, McGraw, Anderson, & Wellik, 2009) or implementation of meta-analytic
techniques (e.g., Vetter, Rücker, & Storch, 2013). In the social sciences, there has been an ongoing
effort to develop or adapt methods to enable researchers to synthesize findings of studies across
diverse research traditions (Sandelowski, Voils, & Barroso, 2006; Strike & Posner, 1983; Suri & Clarke,
2009). Initiatives related to translational science focus on developing research synthesis methods to
fit needs in practice and policy contexts.

2

In work focused on the impact of research synthesis, Murphy (2003) and DeGeest and
Schmidt (2010) examined developments in the field of industrial and organizational psychology
following adoption of psychometric validity generalization meta-analysis beginning in the late 1970s1;
Miller and Pollock (1994a) analyzed the challenges and potential benefits of meta-analysis as an
innovation in social psychology; and Boyle (2012) examined the transformation of research methods
and research culture in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) during the period in which
the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM)2 and funding for complementary and alternative medicine
were initiated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Cadotte, Mehrkens, and Menge (2012) found
that in ecology, the number of papers, datasets, species, and range of publication dates has increased
in meta-analytic studies over time; and that meta-analyses, when compared to papers in the same
issue of the same journal, are written by larger groups of authors. About 15% of these authors were
associated with a synthesis center (e.g., the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis,
NCEAS).
Recently, a few comparative studies have been performed: Researchers in criminal justice
(Wells, 2009) and social work (Lundahl & Yaffe, 2007) examined trends in the use of meta-analysis in
their own fields versus that of others. Wells found adoption of meta-analysis in criminal justice was
lagging that in psychology and sociology; and Lundahl and Yaffe found production and commentary
on meta-analyses in social work lagged that of psychiatry, psychology, and nursing; but was similar to

family studies. Meanwhile, in the medical and health sciences, systematic reviews of systematic
reviews (umbrella reviews or overviews) (Smith, Devane, Begley, & Clarke, 2011) have arrived (Moore
& Jull, 2006), though there continue to be questions about the scalability of the systematic review
approach as it is currently implemented (Bastian, Glasziou, & Chalmers, 2010), as well as whether
different types of reviews and research syntheses are better for different purposes (Card, 2012; Dijkers,
2009; Gurevitch, Curtis, & Jones, 2001).
Purpose, Objectives, and Research Questions
The intent of this study is to describe the diffusion of research synthesis across science;
examine and compare contextual factors within and across science fields that may influence adoption
and lead to methodological adaptations; and investigate whether and how research synthesis has
affected research practices as reflected in collaboration and citation patterns. This study was
conducted in three stages, briefly outlined below.
Stage I: Diffusion of Research Synthesis Methods
While researchers have studied the use of research synthesis from the perspective of a number
of fields at different times, how these pieces can coherently be placed within the broader context of
the science system is unclear. Additionally, while past studies provide information about positive
cases, those in which research synthesis is used; negative cases, fields that have not engaged with
research synthesis, generally have been outside the scope of these studies. Therefore, in order to
develop a broad overview of the diffusion of research synthesis, contextualize past research, and set
the stage for more granular investigations, historical and developing trends in use of research
synthesis methods across science are described and mapped at the macro level. This first stage is
4

guided by the following research question:
RQ 1: When and to what extent has research synthesis diffused across fields of science?
Stage II: Contexts of Diffusion and Adaptation
Though we often describe patterns of diffusion at the macro level, the decisions to adopt and
adapt innovations occur in specific contexts. In Stage II of this research, I investigate the intersection
of a select number of fields and research synthesis in more depth. Goals of this stage are to refine
estimates of diffusion and develop an understanding of the contexts of research fields as they relate to
the extent and nature of diffusion and adaptation within the fields. Selection of fields for this mesolevel examination of diffusion of research synthesis methods is informed by observations at the macro
level. The four selected fields are paired within the biological and social sciences; and based on the
extent to which research is typically more “pure” or “applied”. A fifth field, Information and Library
Science (ILS), was selected in advance because key research problems in ILS align with procedures
essential to performing research synthesis, including literature search and retrieval and information
organization and management. Three questions guide Stage II:
RQ2.1. To what extent has research synthesis diffused within the selected fields?
RQ2.2. How do field contexts influence adoption and use of research synthesis?
RQ2.3. What trends emerge when adoption and use are examined across science fields?
Stage III: Impact of Research Synthesis Methods
The intent of the third stage of this project is to assess the impact – or shifts in practice –
associated with use of research synthesis methods. Two elements of scholarly communications are
examined: collaboration patterns associated with producing reviews and syntheses; and use of
5

published reviews and syntheses as reflected in citation patterns. Stage III research was guided by the
following research questions:
RQ 3.1: How do research syntheses and traditional literature reviews differ in terms of the
number of collaborating authors?
RQ 3.2: How do research syntheses and traditional literature reviews differ in terms of the
extent to which they are used by researchers?
RQ 3.3 What do findings of RQ3.1 and RQ3.2 reveal when compared across science fields?
Significance
From an information and library science perspective, whether researchers in a given field use
research synthesis methods and the contexts of their use are important for a number of reasons. Like
traditional literature reviews, research syntheses often draw on and are intended to integrate past
research. Research syntheses differ, however, in that research synthesis methods proscribe how
researchers should approach “communing with the literature” (White, 1994, p. 43). While it is generally
assumed that studies reviewed in traditional research reviews are selected based on researcher
expertise and experience, research synthesis methods texts (e.g., Cooper & Hedges, 1994; Littell,
2008b) and guidelines (Sander & Kitcher, 2006) generally advocate systematic and transparent
methods of (a) research literature search and retrieval and (b) research study selection. These
differences have implications for information organization and management and are likely to affect
researcher needs and expectations related to information resources and services. The importance of
information infrastructures that support centralized access to literature (Bastian, et al., 2010; Eady,
Wilczynski, & Haynes, 2008; Lukasik, 2000; Toews, 2011), and to a lesser extent, use of bibliometric

6

approaches to facilitate literature retrieval (Harris, Beatty, Lecy, Cyr, & Shpiro, 2011) for the purposes
of review and research synthesis has been recognized by researchers in their own fields. These topics
have received some direct attention in ILS research (Chen & Chen, 2005; Dang et al., 2009; Hood &
Wilson, 2001; Porter, Kongthon, & Lui, 2002; Small, 1986), and are strongly related to broader research
interests in specialties that focus on information retrieval, scholarly communications, bibliometrics,
and science literature visualization. ILS skills and research are relevant to the practice and continued
development of the methods research synthesis. In the health sciences and medicine, ILS
practitioners play key roles as consultants to and members of research teams that perform research
syntheses (Beverley, Booth, & Bath, 2003; Harris, 2005; Knight & Brice, 2006; McKibbon, 2006; Shell,
Hofstetter, Carlock, & Amani, 2006; Swinkels, Briddon, & Hall, 2006).
Increased use of research synthesis may affect construction, perceptions, and use of research
reviews. To date, reviews have generally been treated as a relatively homogeneous type of publication
in science literature studies, though this does not necessarily reflect perspectives across science fields.
Traditional narrative reviews may be replaced by research syntheses; or writers of traditional reviews
may selectively adopt characteristics of research synthesis. Finally, in some fields, researchers have
suggested that secondary analysis of data collected in the context of multiple studies should be
considered a type of research synthesis (e.g., individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis, Cooper
& Patall, 2009; Riley, Lambert, & bo-Zaid, 2010; Mengersen, Gurevitch, & Schmid, 2013), which
suggests links with data archiving and curation research.
From another perspective, it is important for informetricians to know about use of research
synthesis because widespread use of the methods may contribute to changes observed in patterns in

7

the citation system (Persson, Glänzel, & Danell, 2004; Wallace, Larivière, & Gingras, 2009), including
trends towards increasing levels of co-authorship (Cronin, 2001; Leahey & Reikowsky, 2008; Morris &
Goldstein, 2007; Persson, et al., 2004) and shifts in how research is used and evaluated. In some fields,
collaboration is considered beneficial to literature review and synthesis activities because (a) it
enables triangulation between researcher evaluations of the relevance and quality of research, (b) the
large scale of some research synthesis projects, and (c) needs for multiple types of expertise as it
relates to topic-based knowledge and role differentiation associated with instrumental
specializations. Review practiced as a collaborative research study differs substantially from the
traditional notion of reviews as a genre dominated by expert researchers using the sole authorship
model to share perspective as well as research-informed expertise (Peters & van Raan, 1994; c.f.,
Cooper, 1986) to “shape the literature of a field into a story in order to enlist the support of readers to
continue that story” (Myers, 1991, p. 45).
Beliefs related to hierarchies of evidence that are based on research design, and expectations
regarding the most appropriate types of research to reference may influence how researchers select
papers to reference; and how those selections are evaluated by others. Examination of a set of
National Institutes of Health funded grant proposals led Greenberg (2009) to suggest that researchers
use citations to mobilize knowledge in support of proposal applications; and neglect or distort
research findings contrary to proposed research. Greenberg found that through citation bias, some
research may garner unfounded authority, which may distort understandings of what has been found
through research. Additionally, changes in publication guidelines and standards made in part to
accommodate the needs of researchers who perform syntheses (e.g., APA Publications &

8

Communications Board Working Group, 2008) or based on beliefs related to hierarchies of evidence,
which often place systematic reviews at or near the top (see, e.g., Merlin, Weston, & Tooher, 2009),
suggest that research synthesis may indirectly impact citation patterns (Bhandari et al., 2004;
Montori, Wilczynski, Morgan, Haynes, & the Hedges Team, 2003; Patsopoulos, Analatos, & Ioannidis,
2005).
This study has the potential to contribute to diffusion research within ILS. There have been a
few studies of diffusion processes across science at a broad level (e.g., Kiss, Broom, Craze, & Rafols,
2010), that focus on research methods (Tonta & Darvish, 2010) or topics related to research evaluation
(e.g., Zhang, Thijs, & Glänzel, 2011), and that incorporate a comparative approach (e.g., Martens, 2011).
This research seeks to focus these approaches on a topic that has had broad implications for research
in a number of fields. By examining the impact – or outcomes of the use of research synthesis,
conceptualized as shifts in practice when compared to reviews as measured by citations, I corroborate
whether, to what extent, and how use of research synthesis methods is important from the
perspective of the audience of research authors. Similarly, through examination of collaboration
patterns, this study will provide evidence on whether and to what extent collaborative practices have
shifted with the adoption of the methods. Focus on variation and outcomes in a comparative context
provides the opportunity to examine how disciplinary cultures and practices moderate use and
acceptance of research synthesis, and perhaps enables us to theorize how contextual factors limit and
facilitate acceptance of this complex type of innovation.
Outside of ILS, a study of the diffusion of research synthesis methods is likely of interest to
researchers and others who have engaged with use and development of the methods, those involved

9

with the evaluation and publication of reviews, and researchers interested in scientific integration
and synthesis more broadly. There has been relatively little research related to the diffusion of
research methods and practices in general. The current research has the potential to add to this
literature and further our knowledge of how methods diffuse, which may be of interest to
methodologists more generally, as well as researchers in cognate fields engaged in complementary
lines of research such as the sociology of social research (Leahey, 2008) and metaknowledge research
(Evans & Foster, 2011).

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The literature reviewed below provides an overview of research synthesis, the diffusion of
innovations, the conceptual framework that guides this inquiry, and the functions of research
synthesis and traditional literature review in scholarly communications. Literature on research
synthesis and diffusions is vast, and therefore I have selected research most relevant to my study. I
have included a somewhat extended discussion of the historical development of research synthesis –
which centers primarily on psychology and medical and health sciences, fields that contributed
heavily to the early development of research synthesis – to contextualize the diffusion process and
suggest important factors related to the diffusion of this family of methods.
Research synthesis
Research synthesis is a document-based empirical research method in which primary
research reports are analyzed with the goal of generating new knowledge or interpretations. Research
synthesis involves formulating a research problem, retrieving relevant literature, evaluating,
analyzing, and synthesizing data, and interpreting the results. The importance of presenting and
disseminating findings is often emphasized in research synthesis, and therefore reporting findings is
considered the concluding step in the process of a synthesis. Generally, researchers engaging in
research synthesis strive to adhere to transparent and systematic procedures (c.f., Noblit & Hare, 1988;
Pawson, 2006). As with other research methods, study characteristics vary with the nature of the
research questions, the goal of the study, and the epistemological and ontological orientations of

11

those conducting the study. As a documentary method in which reports of previous research studies
form the basis of evidence, the characteristics of a synthesis will be determined in part by the nature
and extent of previous studies; and the availability and documentation of these studies in reports.
The “synthesist” (Cooper & Hedges, 2009) uses recorded research reports as surrogates for
direct observation (Alvarez-Dardet & Ruiz, 1993). In a sense, documents serve as a bridge that affords
the researcher access to the primary study, mediated by the researcher, documentary genre
conventions, and systems that enable access to reports (Platt, 2006). Oxman (1994) likens the process
of research synthesis to a survey: “In a review a question must be posed, a target population of
information sources identified and accessed, appropriate information obtained from that population
in an unbiased fashion, and conclusions derived” (¶13). Oxman’s description highlights the similarity
of the process of research synthesis to that of other methods of empirical research. A close
examination will also reveal that research synthesis, like other methods, offers the researcher
opportunities for creativity, and necessitates potentially difficult decisions.
Research syntheses are conducted for a variety of reasons. For example, research synthesis
methods may be chosen for studies intended to build or examine theory based on existing evidence;
map out research previously performed in an area in preparation for future research; support policy or
professional practice development; or resolve questions related to ambiguous or conflicting findings
across primary research studies. Studies that use research synthesis methods may be narrow and
focused, or broad and exploratory in nature. A narrow, focused study might be performed to estimate
a specific parameter of interest as accurately as possible based on existing evidence. A broader study
might be conducted to explore variation in research findings, test competing hypotheses

12

(Chamberlin, 1890; Pawson, 2006), or develop theory (Lajeunesse, 2010; Miller & Pollock, 1994b;
Pawson, 2006). Researchers have augmented syntheses with novel primary data collection. For
example, in a study designed to compare three models purported to explain the relationship between
negative mood and helping behaviors, Carlson and Miller (1987) incorporated assessments made by
expert judges to examine the degree to which theoretical variables presented in models received
empirical support in experimental contexts as documented in research reports.
Methods of research synthesis: Diversity and processes
In the case of research synthesis, epistemic and ontic beliefs are revealed by how the method
is used, from criteria used to select primary studies, study evaluation or appraisal, analysis, synthesis
(or interpretation), and presentation (or representation) of findings. Research syntheses that can
broadly be described as post-positivist are prevalent in research fields such as medicine and
psychology, which are also the most prolific producers of research syntheses. This tradition generally
focuses on synthesizing quantitative evidence from primary research, though some studies
incorporate qualitative research either through quantitative analysis of qualitative data, or by using
qualitative findings to inform or structure the synthesis. Research synthesis methods developed for an
interpretive perspective include Noblit and Hare (1988; Thorne, Jensen, Kearney, Noblit, &
Sandelowski, 2004). Realist synthesis can be considered a third category. Realism is sometimes
discussed as a “middle road” between post-positivist naturalism and relativism (e.g., interpretivism),
perhaps because both quantitative and qualitative data are compatible with a realist perspective –
though this is a simplistic view of realism (see, e.g., Elster, 2007; Hedström & Swedberg, 1998).
As these different types of research synthesis suggest, the method is continuing to be

13

developed such that it may be more accurate to refer to research synthesis as a family of methods that
a researcher may adopt in the context of research in which s/he believes analysis of data from reports
of prior studies is likely to culminate in new knowledge or understandings of central interest to a
question or problem. Across different types of synthetic studies, researchers generally strive for
transparency; and develop an inquiry such that it may be described procedurally. Different
approaches diverge in how procedural components are implemented, the nature and timing of steps,
and other factors such as the degree to which the steps may be iterative. Table 1 presents research
synthesis as presented by Cooper and Hedges (1994) from a post-positivist orientation; and Noblit and
Hare (1988) from a meta-ethnographic interpretivist orientation. This presentation is intended to
illustrate the processes of two select but diverse approaches to research synthesis in summary form.
Similarity between (I) Cooper and Hedges (1994, 2009) and (II) Noblit and Hare (1988) may be traced
in part to the influence of Cooper and Hedges on Noblit and Hare (Thorne et al., 2005). However,
similarities in processes across research synthesis methods are noted in methodological writings by
several authors (e.g., Gough, 2004).

Historical overview of research synthesis
Historical accounts identify the 1960s and 1970s as critical to the development of research
synthesis (e.g., Glass, McGaw & Smith, 1981). A turning point was reached when Gene Glass described
the statistical analysis of findings from a large number of independent studies in a presidential
address to the American Educational Research Association (Kulik & Kulik, 1988) and subsequently
published two landmark papers. In the first, Glass (1976) discussed the difference between primary
data analysis, secondary data analysis, and “meta-analysis”, a term he coined to describe the use of
statistical methods to examine the results of multiple compatible primary studies in combination and
synthesize the data. The second paper, by Smith and Glass (1977), used meta-analytic techniques to
adjudicate between conflicting opinions expressed in reviews about the relative efficacy of drug
treatments alone versus drug treatments with psychotherapy for psychological disorders. In
combination, these publications served to heighten awareness of meta-analysis (Kulik & Kulik, 1988).
While Glass notes (Glass, McGaw & Smith, 1981) that others, including Robert Rosenthal and Light
and Smith (1971), had been working with similar methods at the time, most prior work might be
described as the “pre-history” of research synthesis though this might be due more to a lack of
continuity, connection, and widespread awareness of other work rather than large conceptual
differences between meta-analytic approaches and prior statistical analyses of primary research
reports (see, e.g., Cochran, 1937; Leitch, 1958).
Two important types of early (pre-history) works that are frequently identified in histories of

15

research synthesis include methodological advances – especially from statistics – and early reviews
that used systematic approaches to literature review and integration. More recently, Bastian,
Glasziou, and Chalmers (2010) provided a broader perspective of the history of “the development of
trials and the science of reviewing trials” (p. 2) in medicine, which includes the development of
information indexes and systems (e.g., Index Medicus, MEDLINE, trial registries), organizations (e.g.,
the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare
Research Quality Evidence-based Practice Centers (AHRQ - EPC)), regulations (e.g., Food and Drug
Administration Amendments Act of 2007), and guidelines such as evidence hierarchies, practice
guidelines, publication guidelines (e.g., MARS3, JARS4, MAER-Net5), and reporting standards (e.g.,
PRISMA6, MOOSE7, QUORUM8), in addition to landmark studies and publications.
Within science, diffusion of enabling technologies and techniques (Altman, 2000; Altman &
Goodman, 1994) and reconciliation of epistemic beliefs with approaches to synthesis (Strike & Posner,
1983) influence the nature of research syntheses, and likely both the extent to which research
synthesis methods are used and the importance of synthesis publications across fields. A secondary

thread in the history of research synthesis is the impact these methods and the structures that support
them do or ought to have on science practice. This is clearest in the context of publication guidelines.
For example, one goal of the recent revisions to the American Psychological Association research
reporting guidelines was to accommodate secondary analyses of aggregate findings documented in
research reports (APA Publications & Communications Board Working Group, 2008). It has been
suggested that wide-spread use of evidence hierarchies that identify meta-analyses and randomized
control trials as the “highest” level of evidence (based on internal validity) influence citation patterns
directly and through influence on article submission guidelines (Dijkers, 2009). Finally, Clarke,
Chalmers, and others have repeatedly called for guidelines necessitating pre- and post-study
systematic reviews to assess the contributions of each study (Chalmers & Altman, 1999; Clarke, 2004;
Clarke, Alderson & Chalmers, 2002; Clarke & Chalmers, 1998; Clarke, Hopewell, & Chalmers, 2007,
2010).
Research synthesis is framed as having been developed in response to the failings of
traditional literature reviews, and in some cases, rather than as an extension of them (c.f., Dickersin &
Chalmers, 2010; Dijkers, 2009; Garfield, 1987; Mulrow, 1987). At least three themes recur in discussions
of the emergence of systematic approaches to reviewing literature: (1) Pressures associated with
increasing numbers of primary research publications (Chalmers, Hedges & Cooper, 2002; Glass,
McGaw & Smith, 1981); (2) the roles of reputation and prestige (or “experience and expertise,” Huth,
2009) versus more egalitarian or “fair” evaluations of research findings; and (3) episodic and systemic
failures to achieve unbiased estimates of consensus, including for the purpose of communicating “the
state of science” to inform policy and practice decisions (Chalmers, Hedges & Cooper, 2002; Glass,

17

McGaw & Smith, 1981; Light & Pillemer, 1984; Light & Smith, 1971; Schulze, 2004).
A number of influential works were published in the 1980s (e.g., Hedges & Olkin, 1985;
Rosenthal, 1984; "Statistics in Medicine," 1987; Yusuf, Peto, Lewis, Collins, & Sleight, 1985). Jointly,
these publications contributed to the stature of quantitative research synthesis among statisticians
(Chalmers, Hedges, & Cooper, 2002). Interest in use of research synthesis for policy decisions
continued during the 1980s as well. In 1982, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) published a
report that discussed the potential uses of meta-analysis and systematic reviews in assessments of
health technologies. In 1983, the National Institute of Education published a collection of
commissioned essays that explored the potential of secondary research studies to contribute to
knowledge in education research, policy, and practice (Ward & Reed, 1983). A notable difference
between Ward and Reed (1983) and the 1982 OTA publication is the stronger emphasis on the
implications of diverse epistemologies and approaches to research in the context of integrative
syntheses of primary studies and also a more integrated discussion of meta-analysis and research
synthesis in education. Issues related to divergent research orientations would become important to
the diffusion of research synthesis in other fields such as nursing and complementary and alternative
medicine (Boyle, 2012).
Through the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, important developments occurred in the medical
and health sciences that culminated in what was to become known as the evidence-based practice
(EBP) movement. Archibald (“Archie”) Cochrane is recognized for providing a vision for EBP

18

inseparable from the methods used in medical research, first with his emphasis on RCTs,9 and second,
on systematic review of RCT findings10 (Alvarez-Dardet & Ruiz, 1993; Chalmers, 2006). Just prior to the
establishment of the Cochrane Collaboration, and the declaration of the evidence-based practice (and
later, policy) movement (Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group, 1992), publications from two
important high-profile lines of research were released, the Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth
(ECPC)11 project (Fox, 2011; Mosteller, 1993) and a study on treatments for myocardial infarction
(Antman, Lau, Kupelnick, Mosteller, & Chalmers, 1992). ECPC effectively advocated for and
demonstrated the benefit of a systematic approach to review. The ECPC project, which was led by Iain
Chalmers at Oxford, resulted in the two volume work, Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth
(1989), which contained “syntheses provided by scores of meta-analyses of randomized and quasirandomized trials…” (Mosteller, 1993 p. 524); a companion guide to practice recommendations, and
the Oxford Data Base of Perinatal Trials. In the myocardial infarction study, the authors were able to
demonstrate the need for research syntheses through a comparison of textbook advice on treatment
for myocardial infarction with results from systematic research syntheses (Chalmers et al., 2002). This
research showed that “valid advice on some lifesaving treatments had been delayed for more than a
decade, and other forms of care had been promoted long after they had been shown to be harmful”

and valid syntheses was premature death.
EBP catalyzed the diffusion of research synthesis methods. As observed by Lee, Bausell, and
Berman (2001), the rapid increase in use of research synthesis in most medical and health sciences is
readily apparent from a simple review of search results retrieved by queries for meta-analyses and
systematic reviews in databases such as PubMed and the Web of Science. The high visibility and
apparent success of EBP12 fostered the development of evidence-based movements in other practice
disciplines, including nursing, social work, and librarianship (Trinder & Reynolds, 2000). More than
two decades later, it appears that the message of EBP still engenders initiatives in a widening
spectrum of fields.
Publications that introduced research synthesis to wider audiences began to appear more
frequently beginning in the 1990s. These included Lipsey and Wilson’s (1993) critical assessment of
over 300 quantitative syntheses on the efficacy of psychological, educational, and behavioral
treatments; and Cooper and Hedges’s (1994) Handbook of Research Synthesis. Meta-Ethnography by
Noblit and Hare (1988) is generally recognized as the work that translated the concept of synthetic
research methods to an approach congruent with an interpretive perspective.
Despite the apparent success of early studies, reports of research synthesis studies were not
12

The “apparent success” of evidence-based medicine refers especially to the intersection of EBM research and
research funding, policy, and interests of health insurers; as well as adherence to EBM principles by segments of
researchers, which started from researchers associated with clinical epidemiology. Pope (2003) notes internal
(within the world of research) and external power struggles rose with EBM approaches. Use of EBM knowledge
in everyday medical work has met more resistance, in part due to tension related to the type of evidence EBM
produces – findings with high internal (rather than external) validity at the group (rather than individual) level;
but also because the “art” of medical practice is delegitimized.

20

immediately recognized as important research contributions on par with primary research. In 2002,
Chalmers, Hedges, and Cooper described the acceptance of research synthesis in academia as follows:

Over recent decades, research synthesis has been widely seen within academia as
second class, scientifically derivative work, unworthy of mention in reports and
documents intended to confirm the scientific credentials of individuals and
institutions. Indeed, systematic reviews are sometimes characterized as “parasitic
recycling” of the work of those engaged in the real business of science... (pp. 21-22)
Recent studies suggest that this is no longer the case in at least some medical and health
science fields (Bastian, Glasziou & Chalmers, 2010; Dijkers, 2009). Acceptance and use of research
synthesis in other fields appears to vary greatly, though may be greater in practice-oriented fields due
to the association between research synthesis and EBP (Trinder & Reynolds, 2000) and the efforts of
influential individuals and highly visible boundary organizations13 (Cash, 2001; Guston, 1999,2001) that
have been pivotal to the evidence-based movement. Other factors that may contribute to the growing
number of studies that use research synthesis include the perception that syntheses can integrate
relatively large or diverse bodies of knowledge; the identification of approaches that can be used to
synthesize research across and within groups of studies aligned with different philosophical
perspectives; and publications that examine or promote the potential of research synthesis methods
within various disciplinary contexts (e.g., Dyba, Kitchenham, & Jorgensen, 2005 in software
engineering; Okoli & Schabram, 2010, in information systems; Osenberg, Sarnelle, & Goldberg, 1999, in
ecology; Rousseau, Manning, & Denyer, 2008 in management and organization science).

13

Such boundary organizations include the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations and the EPPI-Centre in the
UK and health science programs in Australia, Canada, and more recently, the United States (Fox, 2011).

Functions of reviews and research syntheses
Generally, research synthesis is regarded as a relatively new form and method for literature
review. Noguchi (2006) suggests that review articles serve as bridges between different audiences.14
This metaphor is especially relevant in the case of reviews and research syntheses since they may be
used to integrate previously unconnected lines of research (Leitch, 1958); aggregate and summarize
prior findings (Leitch, 1958; Cooper, 1994; Major & Savin-Baden, 2010); translate ideas across
disciplinary boundaries (Altman & Goodman, 1994; Noguchi, 2006), across language barriers (Gordon
& Santman, 1981), between generalists and specialists (Cooper, 1986; Noguchi, 2006), across time
(Price, 1963), into interdisciplinary contexts (Dijkers, 2009) and for new comers to a field (Luck, 1981).15
Garfield, who often wrote about reviews and their functions, emphasized the role of reviews in
literature discovery: “…every time an author makes a reference he is in effect indexing that work from
his point of view. This is especially true of review articles…” (Garfield, 1955, p. 470).
It is important to consider how use of research synthesis may be contributing to changes in
how reviews are written and used more broadly. While it has long been recognized that reviews serve
many purposes, it is possible that the development of research synthesis, in effect, represents the
emergence of the codification of different types of reviews and their associated functions – at least in
some fields that have made extensive use of research synthesis. Discussion in research synthesis

14

The bridge metaphor is conceptually similar to that of boundary objects (Star & Griesemer, 1989), though
perhaps more specific with respect to how bridging documents are used: One would expect fewer differences in
how a bridging document is used by different audiences compared to how a boundary document is used by
different communities – based on the description of boundary objects Star and Griesemer (1989).

Luck was central to the establishment of the Annual Reviews publishing organization.

22

methods texts (Card, 2012; Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009; Petticrew & Roberts, 2006;
Sandelowski & Barroso, 2007) and on the roles and uses of traditional literature reviews and research
syntheses (e.g., Dijkers, 2009; Hammersley, 2002; Sherman, 2009; Squires, 1989), suggests that this
process, though underway in the medical and health sciences, has yet to stabilize. In these fields, this
may be especially true in relation to reestablishing the legitimacy of some functions of traditional
literature reviews. In other fields, it is less clear whether the distinctions between different types of
research synthesis and reviews will be seen as helpful to achieving the goals of research and of
research as it relates to practice and policy.
Recent citation analyses in several health and medical science fields seem to support the
notion of different functions for different types of research syntheses and reviews. Though past
research has shown that review articles tend to be more highly cited than other types of articles
(Aksnes, 2003; Ketcham & Crawford, 2007; Moed & van Leeuwen, 1995; Moed, van Leeuwen, &
Reedijk, 1996; Peters & van Raan, 1994), studies of health/medical literature indicate that systematic
reviews (including meta-analyses) (Bhandari, et al., 2004; Montori, et al., 2003), and meta-analyses
(Patsopoulos, et al., 2005) are more highly cited than other types of review. While this may be a
reflection of (a) publishing recommendations for authors made available by journals or (b) beliefs
about evidence hierarchies, differences do seem to exist.
Relationship between research synthesis methods and the diffusion and integration of research
Literature reviews research syntheses may serve different functions within science fields. One
of the primary intentions of authors who write reviews (Cooper, 1988) and research synthesis (Cooper,
Hedges, & Valentine, 2009) is to integrate ideas and findings of primary research studies. Integration

23

is the process of bringing together a relatively disperse set of ideas and findings. In some ways, this
can be viewed as analogous to other practices that bring together diffuse ideas, such as collaboration
and interdisciplinary research. This observation is in accord with that of Rafols and Meyer (2010) as it
relates to interdisciplinarity and integration; and Liu, Rafols and Rousseau (2012) on the relationship
between diffusion and integration. Accordingly, in order to indicate the extent to which diffuse ideas
are integrated in a review or synthesis, it seems appropriate to draw on measures designed to assess
interdisciplinarity and outcomes of collaboration.
Diffusion of Innovations
Research in the tradition of the diffusion of innovations is focused on how innovations, which
may be ideas, technologies, methods, convention, behaviors, or other definable entities, are
communicated and spread from person to person across social systems over time. The diffusion
paradigm is generally broadly construed, and may consider the spread of innovations across
populations, in social networks, or at more granular levels such as across specific boundaries. As
might be expected given the broad range of levels of interest, researchers affiliated with a range of
disciplines engage in diffusion research. Rogers (2003) traces the emergence of diffusion research to
Tarde’s 1903 book, The Laws of Imitation, though many recognize the work of Ryan and Gross (1943) on
the adoption of hybrid corn among Iowa farmers as the beginning of contemporary diffusion research.
Following the work of Ryan and Gross, diffusion research itself was widely adopted in a number of
fields, including rural sociology and epidemiology during the 1940s and 1950s. Greenhalgh, Robert,
Bate, MacFarlane, and Kyriakidou (2005) credit the rapid diffusion of diffusion research to post-World
War II beliefs in technology as a means to solve problems. Reviews of diffusion research by Rogers and

24

Greenhalgh and colleagues (Greenhalgh, Robert, Bate, et al., 2005; Greenhalgh, Robert, Macfarlane, et
al., 2005) suggest that diffusion research may have been a case of ‘multiple discovery’ (Merton, 1996),
which were brought together under the umbrella of the diffusion of innovations by Katz and Rogers in
the 1960s (Rogers, 2003; Ruttan, 1996). Though Chatman, in 1986, wrote that diffusion research was
“relatively new to the field of library and information science” (p. 377), by 2006, Case (2007) noted
that the “diffusion paradigm” was one of the more prevalent frames in ILS research.
Examples of topics in studies of scientific fields from ILS and cognate fields that draw on the
diffusion of innovations include communication practices among scientists (Crane, 1969; Garvey &
Griffith, 1971), the development of research fields (Estabrooks et al., 2008; Valente & Rogers, 1995), use
of research methods (Tonta & Darvish, 2010), resources (Chen, 2004; Shachak, 2006), and the spread
of technologies and ideas in the science system (Chen & Hicks, 2004; Leydesdorff & Rafols,
2011a,2011b; Tonta & Darvish, 2010). In addition to these studies that explicitly draw on diffusion, it is
possible to interpret many studies from ILS and cognate fields that focus on the spread of ideas and
change within populations over time within the framework of diffusion. Such studies are especially
prevalent in research that focuses on change represented in the scientific literature.
In document-centric work that focuses on the diffusion of ideas across populations, inferences
about the relationship between people and ideas may be made based on observations of changes in
how ideas are represented in documents. For example, McCain (2011) studied obliteration by
incorporation (Garfield, 1975; Merton, 1988) in the context of the Nash Equilibrium. In this study,
overall trends in the presence or absence of a reference for the Nash Equilibrium concept varied over
time and by field, though an overall trend towards omitting a reference for the concept was not

25

observed. Hilgartner (1990) examined changes in how a broad estimate of the relationship between
diet/nutrition and cancer presented in the highly publicized review Causes of Cancer16 was
represented in popular, scientific, and professional media. Across these contexts, there was the
tendency to simplify the estimate such that it was represented as more certain and precise than was
indicated in the original report. Littell (2008a) observed similar patterns in how results of a trial
intervention were reported in reviews. Small (1978) discusses the use of highly cited Chemistry articles
to symbolize concepts by the group of authors who cite them, a process that may emerge through
convergence on meaning after an article is referenced many times (Elkiss et al., 2008) – or may result
from other related factors or features of the articles studied.
Defining diffusion
Rogers (2003) defines diffusion as “the process in which an innovation is communicated
through certain channels over time among members of a social system” (p. 5). The four main elements
of interest to classic diffusion researchers are, as indicated in the above definition: (1) the innovation;
(2) communication (over certain channels); (3) time (and diffusion decisions and processes); and (4)
individuals in a social system. In diffusion studies, researchers typically investigate a subset of these
elements. Another way to frame diffusion research is through the specification of dimensions of
difference in relation to social, cognitive (or psychological), spatial, temporal, cultural-institutional,
and organizational space (Boschma, 2005; see, e.g., Leydesdorff & Rafols, 2011c for an application of
this approach in information science). This frame may be especially valuable to studies concerned

United States today. Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 66(6), 1192-1308.

26

with the diffusion of innovations across populations. The discussion below draws on a combination of
these frames of reference.
Innovations
Rogers (2003) identifies six innovation attributes that contribute to increased rates of
adoption: (1) relative advantage, (2) compatibility, (3) complexity, (4) trialability, (5) observability,
and (6) reinvention potential. According to Rogers (1995, in Rogers, 2003), the first five of these
attributes account for 49% to 87% of the variance in rates of adoption. Of these, relative advantage,
compatibility, reinvention potential, and by extension, complexity are most central to my interests.

Relative advantage
Relative advantage is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it
supersedes. The ultimate relative advantage of an innovation is the potentially complex set of
attributes that relate to the relative costs and benefits of adoption and use of an innovation. Relative
advantage may be considered according to the extent to which an innovation is (a) perceived as
better than its precursor; and (b) perceived as useful for a given purpose (Moore & Benbasat, 1991).
Additionally, an innovation may be considered better because it is perceived to be more economic or
efficient or because it is believed to contribute positively to social image or prestige (Strang & Soule,
1998; Yuan & Woodman, 2010). Low initial investment requirements and immediacy of rewards may
further contribute to the likelihood of adoption.
As an innovation, research synthesis has received mixed reviews with respect to its relative
advantages over traditional literature reviews. Proponents generally emphasize the relative

27

advantages of the outcomes of research synthesis: findings are believed to be more objective,
transparent, and representative of the work of a field related to a stated problem or question (e.g.,
Mulrow, 1994). Other advantages include that researchers are directed to focus on what researchers
actually did – through close engagement with the findings of research – rather than what researchers
say they did, as one might if focusing on conclusions or discussions (Cooper & Rosenthal, 1980).
Potential advantages include the ability to account for publication bias (Ferguson & Brannick, 2011;
Rothstein, Sutton, & Borenstein, 2005), and providing a framework for study inclusion criteria. The
latter may be especially important for interdisciplinary reviews (White, 1996). Distinct disadvantages
generally accorded to research synthesis include the time and resources necessary to conduct them
and the length of time required to establish confidence in findings through the accumulation of
studies and their subsequent analysis (Kissin, 2010). Syntheses that include meta-analyses are often
perceived as technically complex and therefore challenging for both readers and researchers.
Compatibility, complexity, and reinvention potential
Compatibility, complexity, and reinvention potential comprise three closely related
characteristics of innovations. Compatibility is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as
being consistent with existing values, norms, beliefs, past experiences, and perceived needs of
potential adopters (Rogers, 2003). Complexity, the degree to which an innovation is perceived as
difficult to understand and use (Rogers, 2003), may be considered on multiple dimensions, including
(a) cohesiveness or divisibility, (b) the heterogeneity and number of users or groups of users involved
in adoption; (c) the sophistication or level of intellectual difficulty associated with the innovation; and
(d) radicalness, or the extent of change or difference introduced by an innovation (Pelz, 1985). The

28

extent to which the components of an innovation are cohesive, or how easily they are separated may
influence how completely an innovation is adopted, or the extent to which it is changed during the
implementation process (Pelz, 1985). Denis, Hébert, Langley, Lozeau, and Trottier (2002) argue
innovations are complex packages composed of an irreducible hard core of essential elements plus
multiple layers of technologies and knowledge. The boundaries of the innovation are fuzzy, and
feature a ‘soft periphery’ of supporting structures and systems at the interface between the innovation
and its use context. In a given context, the essential elements of the innovation are kept intact, and
others translated (Latour & Woolgar, 1986) and edited (Shalin & Wedlin, 2008) to fit the needs of the
use context. Carlile (2004) differentiates between transfer, translation, and transformation based on
the degree of difference, dependence, and novelty associated with an innovation as it crosses a
boundary from one use context to another. These concepts related to how an innovation or idea is
changed present a different perspective of reinvention, which Rogers (2003) defines as change or
modification by a user in the process of adoption and implementation; or the degree to which an
individual’s use of a new idea departs from the core or main version of an innovation (i.e., “fidelity”).
The term “adaptation” may also be used in studies that emphasize the heuristic process of negotiating
and distributing changes between the use context and the innovation. Ansari, Fiss, and Zajac (2010)
suggest technical, cultural, and political factors influence the adaptation of practice in organizational
settings.
Communication
Communication is the second element of diffusion emphasized by Rogers (2003). Researchers
may look at the content, channels, and other attributes of communication that are thought to be of

29

importance in a particular diffusion process. Communication may be considered in terms of mass
media versus interpersonal communication, or communications that are external or internal to a
social group (for an overview of mathematical diffusion models focused on internal and external
communication, see, e.g., Sultan, Farley, & Lehmann, 1990). On another level, the affordances of
different modes of communication might be considered (Schramm, 1973). From a strong
informational perspective, communication could be interpreted as an individual’s attendance to,
acquisition, and interpretation of any of diverse types of information within an environment (e.g.,
Brookes, 1980; Yu, 2011).
In studies of science, it is common to distinguish between formal and informal
communications; and between communication and collaboration networks. Informal structures can
be thought of in terms of interpersonal communication networks. Formal communications, however,
are generally operationalized in terms of citation patterns. It should be noted, however, that
references are generally made for a variety of reasons (e.g., Bornmann & Daniel, 2008; White & Wang,
1997), and should therefore be considered rather coarse indications of relationships. Additionally,
scientists interested in the same topic may approach the topic from a different perspective, or be
associated with different disciplines, and may not cite each other’s work.
Genuis (2005) suggests that a publication can be considered a vehicle for the formation of
weak ties between scientists; and others (e.g., Tonta & Darvish, 2010) have considered co-authorships
signs of relatively strong ties. While it is common practice to discuss relationships – or ties – between
individuals categorically as strong or weak, this dichotomous characterization is a simplification of
continua of observed states. In some cases, the strength of a tie is represented using weighted edges in

30

a network, which may provide a more descriptive assessment of the frequency or importance of
communication and information exchange. The position of a paper within the network of citations
may also be associated with the reception of ideas presented in the paper.
Diffusion of ideas over multiple dimensions of distance: Diffusion across populations
Degrees of distance between individuals moderate the accessibility and effectiveness of
communication. Broadly, differences along distance dimensions can be collapsed into the concepts of
homogeneity and heterogeneity, both of which are integral to a given diffusion process. To an extent,
homogeneity ensures effective communication (Rogers, 2003; Weenig, 1993), but heterogeneity or
distance is important to the introduction of ideas (Granovetter, 1973,1983), to overcome deficit
thinking (Medin, Bennis, & Chandler, 2010), and is necessary for the development of novel
combinations of ideas (e.g., Swanson, 1986; Upham, Rosenkopf, & Ungar, 2010). Ideas of individuals
who bridge heterogeneous groups may be especially well received (Burt, 2004). At a more granular
level, distance may be defined based on a number of interrelated (Trope & Liberman, 2010)
dimensions, including spatial, cultural, organizational, social, cognitive or psychological, and
temporal dimensions.
Spatial distance
Spatial distances, often discussed in terms of geographical distances, have been found to be an
important factor related to the rate and extent of diffusion (Frenken, Hardeman, & Hoekman, 2009).
Spatial proximity based on immediate (e.g., Cronin, 2008; Cronin & Shaw, 2007; Hillier & Penn, 1991),
local (e.g., Jaffe, Trajtenberg, & Henderson, 1993), national (e.g., Börner, Penumarthy, Meiss, & Ke,
2006), and international (e.g., Leydesdorff & Rafols, 2011c) scales moderates the diffusion of ideas. In

31

some cases, the effects of spatial distance appear to be diminishing (e.g., with respect to collaboration
relationships (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008; Yan & Sugimoto, 2011).
Cultural distance and institutions
Cultural distances, defined here as including institutional distances (the inverse of Boschma,
2005, who included cultural distances in institutional distances), relate to political geographies
(Lancho Barrantes, Guerrero Bote, Rodríguez, & de Moya Anegón, 2012), language (Liu, 1997), trends
in use of research published in different languages (Manten, 1970), political (or power) differences
(Bourdieu, 1988; Evans, 2005; Frickel & Gross, 2005; Leahey, 2002); and also behavioral norms that
may compel compliance or engender assimilation based on cultural- (e.g., Wouters, 1999) and rolebased identification (March, 1999). An example of the latter might include the assumption of different
authorial roles, which leads to variations in writing and referencing practices (White & Wang, 1997).
Organizational distance and organizations
It can be useful to conceptualize science fields as loosely coordinated organizing structures; or
as consisting of actors with multiple organizational affiliations (Chubin, 1976) such as memberships or
affiliations with publishing bodies, professional associations, employing institutions, funding bodies,
practice constituencies, and so on. The extent to which these organizational units are formalized
varies. It may be helpful to consider organizations as structures that at least to an extent, persist such
that they may be recognized as units independent of specific individuals. Using this definition,
organizations may or may not be legally defined as such, but are at least recognized by members and
non-members as cohesive bodies with defined functions and modes of operation. The notion of
organizational distance can be conceptualized as distances between organizational units, which may

32

be indicated categorically or through measures of other distances centered on the organization.
DiMaggio and Powell (1983) argued that diffusion often occurs through mimesis, with
organizations adopting new ideas based on observations of prior adoption decisions of others with
whom they identify or seek to emulate. This may be referred to as a contagion effect. Processes related
to mimicry can be understood as either non-rational bases of decision-making, or decisions based on
a different logic of rationalization. Abrahamson (1991) noted that in the business environment,
adoption of management innovations does not necessarily reflect the efficacy of the adopted
approach. It is possible for innovations that would be effective to fail; and for innovations that are not
especially effective to be widely adopted. Abrahamson suggests that these behaviors can be explained
based on mimicry (“fads”) and also through limits on available options imposed by third parties
(“fashions”). Though contagion effects and rational decisions made based on the “goodness” or
suitability of an innovation to a context are often presented as contrasting mechanisms through
which adoption occurs, in at least some cases, these may work in concert as innovations diffuse
(Strang & Macy, 2001).
Social distance
Social distance is most often operationalized in terms of social structure or networks. Social
relationships might be considered in terms of acquaintanceships, friendships, advice networks, and so
on. In studies of science, measures may include reports of social proximity and relationships based on
co-author and contribution relations (e.g., Cronin, Shaw, & Barre, 2004; Pepe, 2011). Pepe (2011) found
that there is a strong overlap between author collaborations and acquaintanceships. Boschma (2005)
emphasizes social embeddedness, which underscores the interrelated nature of spatial (Collins, 1974;

33

Duguid, 2005; Leahey, 2006; Polanyi, 1966), cultural (Emirbayer & Goodwin, 1994; Pachucki & Breiger,
2010), and social distance dimensions.
Cognitive distance
Conceptually, it is possible to distinguish between social relationships and cognitive interestbased affiliations in a social network. Topical focus is a type of intellectual affiliation, or alignment
with a research field; and collaboration a working group-based social affiliation. Individuals who are
connected via collaboration-based affiliations may or may not have the same intellectual interests.
The extent to which they do is likely related to the extent of role differentiation and specialization in a
collaborative group. Cognitive similarity is often assessed using measures of conceptual similarity,
deduced, for example by co-occurrence of terms or sets of terms in documents (Callon, Courtial,
Turner, & Bauin, 1983; He, 1999).
Interrelationship of social distance and referencing behaviors
The relationship between social relationships and referencing behaviors evident via citation
analysis is somewhat unclear. White, Wellman, and Nazer (2004) found that referencing behaviors
and social relationships differed in an analysis of an interdisciplinary group of scholars; while a study
of referencing patterns associated with three information scientists offers some evidence of an
association between social relationships and reference behaviors, strongest at a dichotomous level
(having met someone versus not having met someone, (Johnson & Oppenheim, 2007). A study of
bibliometricians found subtle positive correlations between social closeness and positive assessments
of an author, work quality and publication venue; and negative correlations with low assessments of
work quality, contradictory perspective, and use of old methods (Case & Miller, 2011). The extent and

34

direction (i.e., whether positive assessments of work lead authors to seek out social ties, or whether
social ties lead to increased rates of citation) of the association between social closeness and
referencing behaviors is unclear (Case & Miller, 2011).
Temporal distance
Temporal distance is a primary interest in diffusion studies. Many early diffusion studies were
performed with the intention of learning how to increase the speed of adoption of innovations
(Rogers, 2003). Time may also be observed in terms of lags in the diffusion process, from awareness of
(or exposure to) an innovation to adoption or rejection. Temporal distance also has a unique role in
the context of document-based studies. Recorded communications are preserved over time, which
extends the life of messages encoded in documents, though interpretations and use (Larivière,
Archambault, & Gingras, 2008) of these messages may vary over time, and other factors.
Preservation of access to recorded information over time is, of course a central function of
libraries, archives, and other types of repositories (e.g., Furman & Stern, 2011); and in fact, one that
may be viewed as rising in importance compared to functions of these organizations in bridging
access over spatial distances (Neavill, 1984). In this capacity, information service organizations
function as boundary organizations (Cash, 2001; Furman & Stern, 2011; Guston, 1999,2001). Boundary
organizations facilitate disclosure and access (Murray & O'Mahony, 2007) to information across
distances, dimensions, and scale (Cash, 2001; Cash et al., 2006), and thereby contribute to the
coordination of individual and group interactions with information resources, enabling use, and also
contributions to knowledge production (Cash, et al., 2006; Furman & Stern, 2011) and accumulation
(Murray & O'Mahony, 2007).

35

Innovation decisions
Rogers (2003) identifies five stages in the innovation-decision process that an individual may
go through from the time s/he becomes aware of an innovation to eventual adoption or rejection: (1)
knowledge; (2) persuasion; (3) decision; (4) implementation; and (5) confirmation. Additionally, a
sixth step (6) discontinuance may be observed after an innovation has been adopted. The innovationdecision process model may be more appropriate to adoption of simple innovations by individuals
and does not neatly transfer to other contexts such as with complex innovations and organizations.
Based on cumulative evidence from a number of studies, Greenhalgh, Robert, Bate, et al. (2005)
contend that innovation adoption, at least in organizational settings, should not be thought of as a
linear process, but as a process of assimilation that consists of ‘key observations’ (e.g., initiation,
development, and implementation or termination) that are not necessarily sequential, coordinated
across the organization, or unidirectional. There may be triggers that propel or stall sets of decisions
and action sub-processes. In the case of science, intellectual turning points (Chen, 2004; Kuhn, 1970)
are triggers that propel research in new directions. Sherman (2009) draws on historical cases (e.g.,
James Lind’s scurvy research) to suggest that research syntheses may be used to aggregate and
preserve accumulated research knowledge for use, such that integrated findings are available once the
social context is amenable to the application of this knowledge. While it is likely that in some cases,
social, technological, and other types of change undermine this potential function of syntheses,
Sherman’s observations suggest research syntheses may support nonlinear innovation.
Consequences of innovation diffusion
Consequences of innovations are considered to be the changes that occur to an individual or a

36

social system as a result of the adoption or rejection of an innovation (Rogers, 2003; Wejnert, 2002).
Consequences may be the result of the complex and often unpredictable interactions between
innovations and individuals embedded in a social and cultural context. Consequences can be framed
in terms of effects within an innovation-diffusion process, for example, the consequences of
additional adoptions of an innovation on other innovation adoption decisions; or in terms of how the
adoption of an innovation affects use of other innovations or changes other aspects of interacting
systems. Concepts related to the former include information cascades, tipping points, critical mass,
the Matthew effect (Merton, 1968). In the context of research synthesis, displacement of use of
traditional literature reviews or differentiation of functions and roles based on different genres of
review may be a consequence of diffusion.
Epidemiological analogies for the spread of ideas
Goffman and Newill’s (1964) application of an epidemic model to the spread of ideas is
sometimes categorized as belonging to the larger body of diffusion research (Glänzel, 2003;
Greenhalgh, Robert, Bate, et al., 2005) and sometimes as an independent set of ideas (Tabah, 1999).
Goffman and Newill (1964) argued that ideas might be likened to infectious agents that are harbored
in infected hosts, and therefore amenable to analysis using compartmental epidemiological S-I-R
(susceptible – infected – removal) type models (see, e.g., Diekmann & Heesterbeek, 2000). Though
Goffman and Newill proposed that their approach might be applicable in diverse circumstances (e.g.,
the spread of ideas generally, social problems, accidents, etc.), the discussion here is limited to the
spread of ideas in science communities, which was the main focus of their paper. In the proposed
analogy, infected hosts (authors) harbor ideas (the infectious material), which are transmitted via

37

vectors, such as journal articles. As others in the specified population are exposed to the idea, some
would be susceptible, and after a period of latency, might become infectious agents themselves.
Others would be resistant to the virulent idea. Goffman and Newill refer to these as “removals”. Of
special interest to Goffman and Newill is the spread of the idea over time, and the ability to describe,
predict, and promote (via information retrieval systems) epidemics. Epidemics, in this case, were
thought to be a positive outcome for ideas. Recent applications of epidemic models to information
diffusion include Bettencourt, Kaiser, Kaur, Castillo-Chavez, and Wojick (2008); Gurley and Johnson
(2011); and Kiss, et al. (2010). In recent years, epidemiologic models have increased in complexity
(Colizza, Barthelemy, Barrat, & Vespignani, 2007). Parameters to estimate the impact of heterogeneity
in populations and across subpopulations, as well as to estimate behavioral responses (Funk, Salathe,
& Jansen, 2010) are becoming more frequent (c.f., Ferguson, 2007).
Import and export of ideas: An economic analogy
Cronin and Davenport (1989) and Cronin and Pearson (1990) applied the idea of import and
export from economics to characterize the extent of independence and dependence of a discipline on
– or from – other disciplines. The authors argue that disciplinary robustness is reflected in the ratio of
imports to exports, such that disciplines that import more ideas than they export are more
dependent, and therefore more vulnerable. Disciplines that export more than they import, on the
other hand, are characterized as more independent and robust. The import-export analogy has been
used to describe disciplinary relationships in a number of studies, which have used authors (e.g.,
Cronin & Davenport, 1989; Cronin & Pearson, 1990) or journal sets (e.g., Cronin & Meho, 2008;
Sugimoto, Pratt, & Hauser, 2008) as the basis of data selection and journal titles as the basis of

38

disciplinary classification.
The import-export analogy emphasizes the importance of communication among disciplines,
and therefore whether ideas spread across field boundaries. A ratio of intra-disciplinary citations to
citation imports would seem to more closely reflect the idea of autonomy, which has been stressed as
important to the establishment of disciplines (Bourdieu, 1988; Whitley, 2000). The export of ideas
might indirectly be related to autonomy if, for example, the export of ideas contributes to disciplinary
prestige and therefore has an impact on the ability of members of a discipline to secure resources.
Cronin and Meho (2008) caution that interpretation of import-export ratios is not straight forward,
and that the context of a field should be considered. Other interpretations of the importance of the
export of ideas have included centrality with respect to a topical area (Grover, Ayyagari, Gokhale, Lim,
& Coffey, 2006) and impact or influence of one discipline on another (Sugimoto, et al., 2008).
The import-export analogy could be expanded to develop a greater understanding of the
division of labor within science. The notion of complementarity (Bonaccorsi, 2010) between fields
suggests that the types of research contributions one field makes to another – for example, whether it
exports instrumental, technical, theoretical, or other work, and how the importing and exporting
fields benefit from this interaction is potentially an important consideration (Strathman, 1992). This
type of influence would not be captured by a between-fields citation analysis alone, but work by
Grover et al. (2006) and Strathman (1992) demonstrate that content analysis can contribute to such an
understanding.
Scientific and Intellectual Movements (SIMs Theory)
Social movements in the context of science have been tied to diffusion theory by Scientific /

39

Intellectual Movements (SIMs) theory (Frickel & Grosse, 2005). SIMs are “collective efforts to pursue
research programs or projects for thought in the face of resistance from others in the scientific or
intellectual community” (Frickel & Gross, 2005, p. 207). SIMs theory seeks to explain the emergence of
new forms of knowledge production. Such knowledge production is seen as contentious, political, and
dependent on the availability of resources and collective action. Participation of high-status
intellectual leaders, structural conditions that provide access to key resources, and access to micromobilization contexts may facilitate SIMs. Success is dependent on the ability of participants to frame
ideas “in ways that resonate with the concerns of those who inhabit an intellectual field or fields” (p.
207). The theory focuses on the ephemeral process of emergence and early stages of diffusion.
The SIMs theory is notable in that unlike Bourdieu (1998) and Collins (1974) who emphasized
the need for scientists to seek recognition over intellectual interests, Frickel and Gross (2005) identify
intellectual interests as the primary motivation for early proponents to engage in the development of
a SIM. Strategic interests may also play a part, but at least in some cases, reward seeking does not
sufficiently motivate a scientist to align with an uncertain idea given the risks. Similarly, though
research is characterized as socially contingent (Barnes, 1974; Bloor, 1991), SIMs theory explicitly
recognizes the importance of intellectual content.
SIMs enriches diffusion concepts in the context of science through emphasis on the special
context of science and knowledge production contexts; recognition of the agentive capacity of
individuals and collectives; and through theoretical explanation of why observed patterns occur. In
past research, Information and Library Science researchers have drawn on SIMs theory (e.g., Nolin &
Åström, 2010). More broadly, SIMs theory has been used to explain how science communications may

40

contribute to the dynamics of research fields (e.g., Meyer & Schroeder, 2009; Reinhardt, Hofer, Arenz,
& Stucki, 2007; Vanderstraeten, 2011).

CHAPTER 3. STAGE I: DIFFUSION OF RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS
The primary goal of the first stage of this study was to identify and describe when and to what
extent research synthesis methods (RSM) have been used in and across science fields. Research at this
stage was guided by the first research question:
RQ1: When, and to what extent has research synthesis diffused across fields of science?
A secondary goal of the first research stage is to inform selection of fields for study at a more
granular level through examination of factors related to the extent and nature of research synthesis
use within fields. These factors include:
•

the extent to which resources are dedicated to literature review;

•

the extent to which a field engages with EBP;

•

the diversity of research synthesis methods used; and

•

whether a field is more “pure” or “applied” in nature.

Definitions
Science fields are dynamic culture-bound socio-cognitive spaces (Whitley, 2000) held together
by cohesive forces reflected in values, norms, beliefs, and practices (Bourdieu, 1988,2004). Multiple,
overlapping field boundaries can be identified at different scales based on field interactions and
attributes, such as those associated with collaboration and competition for resources, publication,
and job markets; institutionalized training units (Chubin, 1976); and communications (Hyland, 2004;
Swales, 2004).
42

In order to operationalize the concept of science fields, it is helpful to consider that research
synthesis, like traditional literature review, may have multiple functions and may be written for a
variety of audiences, including generalists and specialists, practitioners, students, policy makers, and
the general public (Bruce, 1994; Cooper, 1988; Grant & Booth, 2009; Khoo, Na, & Jaidka, 2011; Noguchi,
2006; White, 1992). Based on these observations and the quantity of data required for this study, two
category systems developed for Thomson’s Web of Science / Knowledge (WOS) products were used to
operationalize science fields. The broader Research Areas (SU) were used to aggregate data for the
majority of analyses. For analysis of the diversity of fields that have engaged with research synthesis
over time, the narrower Web of Science Categories (WC) were used in order to make use of existing
tools and data sets.
The Science and Social Science Citation Indexes (S/SCI) Web of Science Categories (WC) divide
science into overlapping categories based on journal title. The classifications are indicated in
individual publication records in the S/SCI, and in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The WCs have
been used extensively in bibliometric research, and provide access to socially meaningful divisions
amenable to larger scale representations (e.g., Rafols, Porter, & Leydesdorff, 2010).
The newer Research Area classification system appears to draw substantially from the Web of
Science Categories. There are just under two-thirds as many Research Areas as Web of Science
Categories, and therefore data visualization and description requires fewer elements, though there is
some loss of granularity. Appendix A presents a comparison of the two systems. In some cases, it was
helpful to aggregate Research Areas into larger ‘field groups,’ which was done in consultation with
Thomson-Reuters Essential Science Indicators and Research Area support information available via

43

the Thomson Reuters website.
Research synthesis methods are research methods in which primary research findings are
analyzed in a transparent and, generally, systematic manner, with the goal of generating new
knowledge or interpretations. This study focuses on document-based research synthesis methods (c.f.,
Sidlauskas et al., 2010). A number of terms are used to indicate research synthesis methods “subtypes”. Systematic review, integrative research review, qualitative research synthesis (Major & SavinBaden, 2010); meta-ethnography (Noblit & Hare, 1988); systematic research synthesis (Gough, 2004);
best evidence synthesis (BES) (Slavin, 1995); and realist synthesis (Pawson, 2006) are examples of subtypes of research synthesis. In the literature, “meta-analysis” has often been used to denote the
composite process of a research synthesis. Conceptually, I define meta-analysis more narrowly as the
statistical methods used to combine quantitative data across studies, an analytic technique that may
be used within a research synthesis. This usage follows the original definition of meta-analysis
proposed by Glass (1976).
Research synthesis was operationalized via a set of query phrases (Appendix B) and seed
publications (Appendix C) used to search the Science and Social Science Citation Indexes (S/SCI). The
query phrases were used to search the topic index, which includes title, abstract, author keywords,
and “Keywords Plus™”17 fields. The cited reference search feature in the Web of Science was used to
search for records of publications that reference the selected seed publications. Appendix D provides
details on the development of the search strategies. Search results identified with the keyword and

17

“Keywords plus™” are keywords identified through text processing of the titles of referenced publications
(Garfield & Sher, 1993).

44

cited reference search strategies were examined empirically to understand the relative effectiveness
of the strategies within and across science fields.
Diffusion, in the tradition of the diffusion of innovations, is focused on how innovations,
which may be ideas, technologies, methods, conventions, behaviors, or other definable concepts, are
communicated and spread from person to person across social systems over time (Rogers, 2003). In
some respects, diffusion can be viewed as the inverse of integration. Innovations diffuse along
cognitive, organizational, social, institutional, and geographical dimensions (Boschma, 2005).
Diffusion is described by identifying when and to what extent science fields have used
research synthesis using visual and quantitative techniques. Two measures describe when research
synthesis methods (RSM) engagement began; and two the extent of research synthesis methods
engagement:
1.

When RSM engagement began
a. Year of earliest RSM publication within each Research Area18
b. Year in which continuous RSM publication began in a field (i.e., at least one RSM
publication appeared in each subsequent year).

2. Extent of RSM engagement
a. Total number of RSM-related publications
b. Proportion of RSM-related publications to all publications from (1972) to 2011.
Additionally, the diversity of fields that engaged with RSM over time was examined. Diversity
18

In order to minimize the influence of early false positives, including from cross-classification, for the “first”
publication to be counted, one additional publication needed to be published within two years of the first. If
this was not the case, the first publication year for which this is true was counted.

45

was operationalized using three measures described by Rafols and Meyer (2010). These measures
depict three aspects of diversity: variety, balance, and similarity (Stirling, 2007). Variety refers to the
number of science fields (WC’s); balance, the distribution of publications across fields; and similarity,
the extent to which fields are cognitively similar. Accordingly, counts of the number of fields were
used to indicate variety; Shannon evenness was used to indicate balance, and a cosine-normalized
citation index derived from the 2010 Journal Citation Reports (JCR) (Leydesdorff, Carley, & Rafols,
2013) was used to calculate average cognitive dissimilarity across the network. Time was aggregated
into five-year periods. Web of Science Categories rather than Research Areas were used to distinguish
fields in order to make use of existing analysis techniques (Chavarro, 2011; Rafols & Meyer, 2010).
Review publications critically assess prior research in a given area. Reviews vary in the extent
to which they are comprehensive, explicitly or implicitly include expert opinion, and breadth and
depth of coverage. Reviewed literature may be selected based on expert judgment, through sampling
procedures, and systematic collection using defined search strategies (e.g., as suggested by Bates,
1992). Reviews include research syntheses such as systematic reviews and other types of reviews such
as narrative reviews, historical reviews, and so on.
Publications with records that include “Review” in the S/SCI Document Type field are
considered reviews. At this stage, no attempt was made to disambiguate reviews and research
syntheses. Research syntheses may or may not be classified as reviews in S/SCI. In the S/SCI,
publications are classified as the document type review “if they are either published in a review
journal or include 100 or more references along with some indicator that the article is a review, such
as the word “Review” or “overview” in the table of contents or in the article itself” (Thomson Reuters,

46

2009, p. 7). The definition operationalized by Thomson Reuters differs somewhat from others (e.g.,
MeSH) and as conceptualized by, for example, journal editors (Ketcham & Crawford, 2007), but seems
to be generally in agreement with these discussions of review papers (Cooper, 1988; Ketcham &
Crawford, 2007). If, in some fields, a great number of publications are categorized as document type
‘Review’ based only on the number of references, it might be more correct to interpret this measure as
the extent to which the field engages with past research rather than a measure of the prevalence of
reviews. The number of publications indexed in the Web of Science for each Research Field was used
to normalize the review measure. Therefore, this measure reflects the proportion of publications
indexed in the SCI/SSCI from 1972 to 2011 that are reviews.
The evidence based practice and policy (EBP) movement (Pope, 2003) is a scientific-intellectual
movement (Frickel & Gross, 2005) with research, practice, political, social, and other dimensions, but
which is primarily focused on mobilizing resources to translate and transform research-based
knowledge to inform practice. Individuals who identify with the EBP scientific/intellectual movement
often hold experimental research methods and research synthesis methods in high esteem.
EBP engagement is operationalized through a topic index search in S/SCI with the query
phrase, “(“evidence based”) NOT (“evidence based on”) NOT (“evidence based upon”)”. Results are
limited to publication years 199219 through 2011. Experimentation and iterative scanning and
comparison of search results suggests that this search phrase is on topic and relatively robust. With
this search, the intention was to capture counts of publications across fields as evenly as possible
since I am interested in the relative level of engagement with the evidence-based movement.
19

The Evidence-Based Medicine Group (1992) effectively named this movement in a 1992 JAMA publication.

47

Prevalence of EBP within a field is measured by the quantity of publications returned as a proportion
of all publications (1992-2011).
Diversity of research synthesis methods is conceptualized as engagement with a wide range of
research synthesis methods within a field. Diverse forms of research synthesis include those that
incorporate qualitative research, and also those that approach research synthesis from an
interpretivist or realist stance.
Diversity of research synthesis methods within fields was operationalized with a subset of the
searches used to identify research synthesis methods publications. Search strategies drew on a
combination of seed publications and query terms associated with interpretive, qualitative, realist,
and other variants of research synthesis. Keyword-based searches were performed on the topic index
of the S/SCI, limited to the years 1976-2011. Records of publications that reference seed publications
were taken directly from the subset of records identified in the RSM cited reference searches. Specific
query terms associated with diverse approaches to RSM are indicated in Appendix B; and seed
publications are identified in Table C1, Appendix C.
Pure and applied research fields: Scholars within a research field may view that field as more
pure or applied based on its relationship to practical problems (Biglan, 1973a). Applied fields focus
more on research that can be of more direct and immediate use outside of the research context. Prior
studies that categorized science fields on Biglan’s three-dimensional20 taxonomy (Biglan, 1973b;
Malaney, 1986; Stoecker, 1993) were compared with scope definitions in Web of Science support
20

The other two dimensions of the taxonomy are hard versus soft, which indicates faculty perceptions of the
degree of paradigm consensus in fields; and life or non-life systems, which indicates whether a field is
concerned with living organisms.

48

resources to match fields previously studied with S/SCI categories. Once matched, findings on the
pure-applied dimension of Biglan’s scale were recorded at the categorical level (pure or applied).
Data collection
Bibliometric data were used as indicators of research field-level engagement with research
synthesis methods (RSM), and, more coarsely, evidence-based practice (EBP), engagement with
diverse forms of RSM, and relative prevalence of review publications by field and year. Data were
collected from the S/SCI via the Web of Science platform in July and through August 3, 2012. The Arts
and Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) was not included because preliminary research indicated that
methods of synthesis and terms used to describe these methods are different for most A&HCI fields.
RSM engagement and diversity data consist of bibliographic records identified via a combination of
keyword and cited reference search; EBP, review prevalence, and norming data were collected via the
“Analyze” feature available via the Web of Science / Web of Knowledge platform (version 5). Data
collected with the Analyze feature were collected by category and year, and across the indexes as
needed.
Normalization data: Overall counts of publications by year and category were collected to
calculate the relative proportions of research synthesis publications, EBP publications, and reviews.
Diverse RSM publications were considered relative to the overall number of research synthesis
publications. Normalization data was subsetted for each document set: field “Adoption Year” to 2011
for research synthesis engagement; 1972-2011 for reviews, and 1992-2011 for EBP. These date ranges
correspond with those of the normalized data sets.

49

Data analysis
Data were organized by year of publication and SCI/SSCI Subject Category to determine,
report, and present basic frequency data by year and fields. A variety of visualization techniques were
used to enhance the description, including use of functional data analysis, and network overlay maps.
Overlap analysis of items retrieved by query terms versus citing methods texts was performed to
examine the effectiveness of each of these approaches overall and by field.
Descriptive functional data analysis (FDA) was used to describe the increase in use of research
synthesis in fields over time. Functional data analysis is similar to discrete data analysis except that
series of data points are transformed into functions, which are treated as data objects. FDA was
chosen in order to visualize the rates of change in use of research synthesis methods over time, and
also to calculate the first and second derivatives of the data objects. The first derivative represents the
velocity of use of research synthesis over time; and the second derivative the acceleration in use of
research synthesis over time. The analysis was performed following Ramsay and Silverman (2005)
using the R package fda (Ramsay, Wickham, Graves, & Hooker, 2012): b-splines were fitted to
normalized longitudinal RSM publication count data arranged by research field and year to create
functional data objects. Counts of the total number of publications by Research Area and publication
year were normalized based on the total number of documents by Research Area and year. The first
and second derivatives of these functional objects were then identified, and each set of objects
plotted.
The diversity of fields that engaged with research synthesis methods over time was examined
using the variety, balance, and similarity measures previously discussed. Results over time are

50

visualized with line graphs to illustrate the change in diversity over time and with overlay maps. The
overlay maps were created in Pajek (Batagelj & Mrvar, 2012) following Rafols, Porter, and Leydesdorff
(2010), and using the cosine similarity matrix previously used to measure the cognitive similarity of
fields that engaged with research synthesis. This matrix is the basis of the network that connects
category counts in the visualizations. The overlay maps are based on ten-year rather than five-year
time slices in order to conserve space.
Descriptive statistical analyses and correlations were calculated using SPSS v. 20 (IBM Corp.,
2011) and R v. 2.15.1 (R Core Team, 2012) using RStudio v. 0.97 (2009-2012). Spearman rank correlation
statistics were selected to analyze correlations between ordinal data.
Results: Diffusion of research synthesis methods across science fields
The extent of engagement with research synthesis methods has increased following the
development of contemporary forms of the methods in the 1970s in education and psychology.
Beginning in the 1990s, a greater number of fields engaged with the methods. Prior to examining
diffusion patterns in more depth, data collection and contributions of keyword versus cited reference
search strategies are reviewed. Known issues with the consistency of the data source, the Science and
Social Science Citation Indexes are considered in relation to search strategies and query results.
Query sets: Summary of results and comparison of research strategies
Plain text files downloaded from the Web of Science included 36,157 records of publications
that cited the selected seed publications. These records were loaded into Sci2 1.0 (Sci2 Team, 2009) to
parse and deduplicate the records. Sci2 uses the Web of Science accession number (UT field) as a
unique identifier to distinguish records. Through this process, 22,899 unique records were identified.
51

Subsequently, the iPython interactive programing environment (Perez & Granger, 2007) python
package PANDAS 0.7 (Pandas Development Team, 2012) and NumPy (Jones, Oliphant, & Peterson,
2001) were used to filter records to include only items published through the end of 2011, resulting in a
total of 21,757 records. An example of the python scripts used in this and subsequent processes is
included in Appendix E.
The 116,677 records retrieved with keyword queries were similarly parsed and deduplicated,
resulting in 116,613 unique records. The 64 duplicate records may have been retrieved because of
updates to the S/SCI databases during the data collection period. Keyword results set records were
also filtered by publication year in PANDAS. As would be expected based on the original Web of
Science search parameters, which limited results to those published through 2011, all records retrieved
with keyword queries were found to be associated with items published through the end of 2011.
The two record sets, the citing reference query records and keyword query records, were then
loaded into PANDAS. Web of Science accession numbers were used to calculate the intersection and
union of the sets, the number of unique records in the union set, and the number of records uniquely
identified by each search strategy. In the union set, there were 138,370 records, of which 123,881 were
unique. The overlap of 14,489 between records retrieved with keyword and cited reference searches is
about 12.418 percent of the keyword query set and 66.595 percent of the cited reference query records.
Figure 1 shows the proportion of items retrieved over time with the cited reference search, the
keyword search, and also the intersection (items retrieved by both search strategies) and union (items
retrieved by either of the search strategies). Keyword search results were limited to those published
between 1976 and 2011 to limit false positive results, and therefore no records were retrieved with the

52

keyword search prior to 1976. Keyword search results prior to 1976 were excluded because the term
“meta-analysis” was not coined until 1976, and it does not appear that other standard terms were used
to describe research synthesis prior to this date based on historical accounts of the development of
research synthesis (e.g., Glass, Smith, & McGraw, 1981). The first seed item used for the cited reference
search was published in 1971, and therefore results prior to 1971 would not be expected. Table 2

While seed publications and keyword queries were identified based on a review of the
literature and interactive scanning, the final search strategy used to identify publication records is a
compromise between precision and recall. Selective inclusion of journals in the S/SCI necessarily
limits the extent to which search results are comprehensive in light of the goal of this research. Two
recently established journals devoted to research synthesis, Research Synthesis Methods and
Systematic Reviews, were not indexed in the S/SCI at the time of data collection.21 Some classic articles
related to research synthesis are also excluded. For example, the Educational Research Review, a
journal in which at least two seminal research synthesis articles were published in the 1970s (Glass,
1976; Smith & Glass, 1977), was not indexed in the SSCI until the 1990s. There were, however, a
number of seminal research synthesis articles from these journals indexed in a manner similar to
books indexed in the S/SCI, so it was possible to include these in the citing reference searches.
As indicated in Figure 1 and Tables F1 and F2 in Appendix F, an increase in records retrieved
with keyword queries occurred between 1990 and 1991. Prior to the early 1990’s, S/SCI records
generally do not include abstracts, which is likely to contribute substantially to the difference in the
number and proportion of items retrieved via keywords. The increase in cited reference query results
would be expected to increase in part due to the increase in the number of citable items.
Qualitatively, it appears that keyword and cited reference search strategies complemented each other.
The lack of obvious anomalies in a plot of the second derivative of the polynomic curve

Research Synthesis Methods (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%291759-2887) the
journal of the Society for Research Synthesis Methodology, began publication in January 2010; and Systematic
Reviews in February 2012. Systematic Review (http://www.systematicreviewsjournal.com/) articles would have
fallen outside the collection scope for this study based on date of publication as well.

54

functions of the set of field-year publication count time series (Figure 2) provides further support for
the complementary nature of the combination of the keyword and cited work search strategies. The
second derivative of the field-year publication count function can be considered a representation of
the acceleration in publication rate. Had there been a large jump in the number of records retrieved in
the early 1990s when indexed abstracts first begin to appear, this graph would indicate a substantial

Publication Count

acceleration in publication rate at that time.

Year

Note: The second derivative depicts ‘acceleration’ in publication counts over time.

Comparison of the relative proportion of records retrieved via the two search strategies by the
larger field group aggregates revealed differences in the apparent relative effectiveness of the search
strategies across (Figure 3) and within (Table G1, Appendix G) field groups. Keyword queries resulted
in a greater proportion of results in Clinical Medicine and Other Health & Medical Sciences. Citation
searching yielded a relatively high proportion of results in the Social Sciences generally, as well as

55

some Life Science and Technology fields. Fields in the Technology group appear to be most variable in
terms of the relative proportions of results identified with keyword versus citing reference searches.
Differences in the effectiveness of keyword queries versus cited reference queries likely result from a
combination of factors. Four potentially important factors include (a) differences in referencing
practices; (b) inclusion of the Keywords Plus™ field in the topic index of the Web of Science; (c) the
keyword query terms and seed publications selected for this study; and (d) the extent to which fields
produce and use their own methods publications. Subsequent stages of this study will, to an extent,
provide information about differences in referencing practices as they relate to use of research
synthesis methods for those fields that are studied in more depth. It would be possible to examine the
extent to which terms included in the Keywords Plus™ field and not other fields contribute to the
number of items retrieved by testing the queries on individual record fields. However, it would also be
necessary to examine whether these items represent engagement with research synthesis to
determine the extent to which inclusion of this field inflates RSM engagement counts. Preliminary
searches and examination of results and extensive review of the literature were performed prior to
finalizing the list of query terms and keyword publications in order to optimize the search strategy.
The final factor, variation in the nature of research methods materials produced and used in fields is
outside of the scope of this study. Again, subsequent stages of this research may provide some indirect
evidence regarding this factor.

Diffusion of research synthesis methods
Across all years (1972-2011), 123,881 records that provide evidence of engagement with research
synthesis were found using a combination of keyword queries and cited reference searching the S/SCI.
The number of publications has increased over time and varies across research field. Detail on search
results and a comparison of yield by search strategy is presented in Appendix A.
First years of research synthesis methods engagement
The first record of research synthesis methods in this dataset belongs to an
Education/Education Research paper published in 1972. As of 2011, only the field of Microscopy
included no research synthesis publications. Seven other fields (Crystallography, Mineralogy, Mining

58

Mineral Processing, Remote Sensing, Robotics, Telecommunications, and Thermodynamics) did not
meet the “first year” criteria, which requires that, for the “first year” publication to be counted, one
additional publication must have been published within two years after the initial publication. The
intention of this requirement was to reduce the impact of false positives and noise in the data due to
issues such as language use and WOS document cross-categorization. Of the eight fields that did not
meet the criteria, four were in Technology (Microscopy, Remote Sensing, Robotics, and
Telecommunications) and four in Physical Science and Math (Crystallography, Mineralogy, Mining
Mineral Processing, and Thermodynamics). All fields in other field groups (Social Sciences, Clinical
Medicine, Other Health Sciences, and Agriculture) met the first year criteria.
For those fields that met the first year criteria, the average first year was about 1990 (s.d. = 7.74
years), the median first year, 1989, and range 1972 to 2010. The distribution is positively skewed (0.607)
and kurtosis is positive (0.108) (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Year of first RSM publications across research fields.

First year distributions differ viewed from the perspective of field groups (Table 3 and Figure

59

5). The Social Sciences field group has the earliest first year of RSM publication based on the median
(1985, mean = 1987.35), and also the greatest variation (s.d. = 10.46 years) and observations of both the
earliest (1972) and latest (2010) years in the data set. First years of Clinical Medicine (mean = 1986.84,
median = 1987) and Other Health and Medicine (mean = 1986.47, median = 1986) fields are earliest
based on the mean. Clinical Medicine contains the least variation (s.d. = 3.01 years, range = 1980 to
1994).
Technology and Physical Science and Math fields that do not yet have a first year were treated
as missing values. Nonetheless, these two fields, along with Agriculture, include the most recent first
years of RSM publication (Technology: mean = 1994.71, s.d. = 7.92 years, median = 1994; Physical
Sciences and Math: mean = 1997.46, s.d. = 8.18 years, median = 1996; Agriculture: mean = 1994.33, s.d. =
3.14, median = 1994.5).

Continuity of RSM engagement
In addition to the “first year”, the year in which research synthesis publications began to
appear without interruption is also recorded (first year continuous use). This measure, which is more
exclusive, was developed in order to understand when RSM began to appear regularly, and to avoid
inclusion of false positives, especially for normalization of the intensity of RSM engagement. One
limitation of this measure is that it was assumed that once fields began to engage with research
synthesis methods with some regularity, use of the methods would continue. While this is true
generally, the field of International Relations appears to be an exception.
61

The distribution of the first year of continuous RSM publication across all fields is slightly less
skewed (0.407) and with a kurtosis of -0.434. As expected, measures of central tendency are slightly
later (mean = 1992.31, s.d. = 8.01, median = 1990). Observed values range from 1975 to 2010. Figure 6
presents the distribution of first years of continuous use across fields, and Table 3 summary statistics
for all fields as well as field groups. In this study, the first year of continuous use has been used as an
indicator of when a field adopted RSM.

Figure 6. First year of continuous RSM publication across research fields ranges 1975-2010
Fields that may have begun continuous use in 2011 are excluded based on measure criteria. See Figure
8 below for an overview of when specific fields adopted RSM.

Again, Education and Education Research holds the earliest position: at least one RS work was
published each year from 1975 through the present in this field. Two other social sciences, Psychology
(1976) and Business and Economics (1979) follow shortly after. In the early eighties, several other
62

fields, including the first in the health sciences (Geriatrics and Gerontology; Rehabilitation; and Sports
Sciences, all in 1980), and the general social science category (Social Sciences Other Topics, 1980)
began to engage regularly with research synthesis methods. Similar to the first years of RSM
publications above, while the social science fields were the earliest to use research synthesis, the
social sciences are also the most variable in terms of when continuous use of RSM began. Field groups
with the least variability include clinical medicine, the relatively small agriculture set (N = six fields),
and the life sciences (Table 4 and Figure 7). Researchers engaged with research synthesis later in the
Physical Sciences and Math and Technology field groups.

In addition to fields in the Technology and Physical Sciences and Math field groups, RSM
publications did not appear regularly in two fields in the Social Sciences, Archaeology and
International Relations. Though a string of RSM publications were observed from 2008 to 2010 in
International Relations, and sporadically as early as 1994, the observed counts met the “first year” but
not the continuous RSM publication criteria. Based on these observations, the first year of continuous
RSM publication was assigned “NA” for this field. Table 3 and Figures 6 and 7 summarize the first year
of continuous research synthesis publications overall and by research field groups. Figure 8 illustrates
when continuous use of research synthesis began by field and within fields groups.

Extent of research synthesis engagement
The number of research synthesis methods publications retrieved by field ranges from 0
publications in Microscopy to 15,521 publications in General Internal Medicine (Psychology is a close
second at 15,044). Generally, the Clinical Medicine field group has the greatest number of RSM
publications. The top twenty fields ranked by the number of RSM publications (2,204 to 15,521
publications per field, Table 5) includes thirteen Clinical Medicine fields; three Other Health and
Medicine fields, three Social Sciences and one Life Science.
In contrast, the twenty fields with the fewest number of RSM publications includes nine fields
from the Physical Sciences & Math group (Crystallography, Mining Mineral Processing, Mineralogy,
Thermodynamics, Polymer Science, Geochemistry Geophysics, Electrochemistry, Optics, and
Astronomy Astrophysics); nine from Technology (Microscopy, Remote Sensing, Robotics,
Telecommunications, Imaging Science Photo Technology, Mechanics, Spectroscopy, Metallurgy
Metallurgical Engineering, and Automation Control Systems); and two from Social Sciences
(Archaeology and Area Studies). Information Science Library Science (ISLS) ranks 64th based on the
number of publications, and 75th normalized over the number of documents published.

RSM Ct Rank prop

Note. “Rank RSM” is number of RSM publications in a field compared to other fields. General Internal
Medicine, ranked “1”, has the greatest number of RSM publications. “RSM Ct” is the number of RSM
publications. “Group” refers to field groups. Field groups abbreviations are: CM = Clinical Medicine, SS
= Social Sciences, HMO = Health & Medical Sciences, LS = Life Sciences. “Rank Prop” is based on the
proportional number of research synthesis publications, normalized over all publications. “RS began”
is the year continuous RSM use began. Size rank indicates the overall size of the field based on the
number of documents in the Research Area, 1972-2011.
Across all fields, the mean number of publications is 1,295.06 (s.d. = 2,530) and median, 342.5.
The distribution is positively skewed (3.519) and with a kurtosis of 14.327. Figure 9 presents the
distribution of counts by fields on a log scale, and Table 6 summary statistics across all fields and by
field groups.

Figure 9. Count of RSM publications across fields

When viewed from the perspective of field groups, Clinical Medicine fields include the
greatest number of RSM publications (mean = 3,616.3, s.d. = 3,637.8, median = 2,380), followed by
Other Health and Medicine (mean = 2,101.7, s.d. = 222.1, median = 1,772) and Social Sciences (mean =
2,530.75, s.d. = 2,530.75, median = 342.5). The Life Sciences and Agriculture fall in the middle, and have
less variation than the Social Sciences. Technology and Physical Science Math fields have the fewest
number of research synthesis publications.

The number of research synthesis publications was normalized based on the total number of
documents published in each field from the year continuous RSM publications began to appear
(Table 7). This normalization accounts for field size and the length of time researchers have engaged
with RSM. The normalized counts bring out the comparative similarity among the “Other Health and
Medical Science” fields; and diversity in Clinical Medicine. The Social and Life Sciences engaged with
RSM to a lesser extent. Variation in the Social Sciences is much lower compared to measures based on
raw counts.

Count data normalized based on the number of publications published between 1972 and 2011
in each field were scaled to identify the number of RSM publications per 10,000 publications overall
and then transformed to create functional objects and construct spaghetti plots to illustrate the
relative growth patterns across fields. The functions present a complex but dynamic view of
increasing engagement with research synthesis over time. In Figure 10, the functional data plot, the
slopes and shapes of the publication rate functions depict a range of growth trajectories, from steeply
increasing to long gentle slopes. Also note the dense matt in the right corner, which includes fields
that have only recently begun to show a modicum of interest in research synthesis methods.
Dramatic differences are evident in the plot of the first derivative of the functional slopes
(Figure 11). The first derivative corresponds with research synthesis engagement as a function of the
“velocity” of publication over time. It would be necessary to examine fields in more detail to
determine whether or to what extent the pronounced fluctuations in velocity are an artifact of the
data set. The data do suggest that engagement with research synthesis has fluctuated to differing
extents across fields. It is possible that some fields are more affected by “fads” and “fashions” in
research practices (Abrahamson, 1991; Baskerville & Myers, 2009), which may be induced externally
(fashions), such as by funding agencies, or internally (fads) as a result of group dynamics. There is also
the possibility that in addition to overall trends in research, there may be a periodicity in publication
trends; or that in addition to increasing engagement overall, events such as conferences, special
issues, or controversies may trigger increased engagements for limited periods.

71

Diffusion over time: Diversity of fields that engage with RSM
Another important aspect of diffusion is the diversity of fields that engage with an innovation.
As indicated in Table 8, the variety and cognitive dissimilarity of fields that have engaged with
research synthesis over time has increased, though at fluctuating rates. As the number of categories
has neared the maximum, 223 WCs, the rate at which variety has increased has slowed. The largest
increase occurred in the first half of the 1990s, which corresponds with other evidence and with the
rise of the evidence-based practice and policy movements. Figure 12 depicts the number of fields,
category nodes, that have engaged with research synthesis methods over time. Dissimilarity also
increased over time, which indicates that the set of fields that have engaged with research synthesis
methods has become increasingly diverse cognitively based on overall citation patterns across
science. The increase in dissimilarity is evident in the overlay maps (Figure 12): more cognitively
dissimilar fields are spatially distant and connected by fewer links in the maps.

Note. The three aspects of diversity, based on representations of engagement with research synthesis
at the field level, are variety, balance (Shannon evenness), and (cognitive) dissimilarity.

72

Shannon evenness was used to measure balance, the proportional distribution of RSM
publications in WCs. Both raw count data and normalized count data were used to calculate balance.
Balance, based on raw count data indicates that there is an increasing difference in the proportions of
research synthesis publications across fields: though the number of fields that engage with research
synthesis at all has increased (variety), the number of publications in each field has grown
increasingly disparate. The normalized count data, compared to the raw count data, depicts greater
balance across fields: When the size of a field is taken into account, the proportion of research
synthesis publications to all publications in fields where it occurs is more even. In part, the greater
evenness may be explained by the smaller variance associated with normalization. This view adds
another dimension to diversity, however, because the range in the size of fields that engage with RSM
and the increasing numbers of publications produced by some large fields in later years in a sense
skews field-level comparisons.
In addition to the magnitude of difference in balance, the trends differ when balance is
calculated with raw versus normalized count data, especially in view of the last two time periods
(2001-2006 and 2007-2011), when balance in the proportional engagement of fields increases though
balance decreases based on the number of publications. The maps in Figure 12 are based on absolute
counts of RSM publications. In these maps, the proportional size of nodes indicates balance.

Characteristics associated with research synthesis methods diffusion
The secondary goal of this research stage was to inform selection of fields for closer
examination in subsequent phases of this study. Four factors were selected for closer examination: the
proportion of reviews in research fields; the extent to which authors have engaged with evidencebased practice and policy (EBP); the extent of interest in diverse approaches to research synthesis;
and whether a field is more pure or applied. Bivariate Spearman’s rho (ρ) correlation (one tailed) was
performed to examine associations between these factors and measures of the extent and history of
engagement with research synthesis and size of research fields (Table 9). Correlations were analyzed
with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient because it is an appropriate nonparametric measure of
association for variables measured on at least an ordinal scale.
While sixteen of twenty-one correlations were significant, only associations between three
variables were strongly correlated. Strong correlations were observed in all bivariate analyses between
(a) the number of years RSM have been used in a field, (b) the proportion of RSM publications
compared to all publications within fields, and (c) the extent of engagement with EBP.
The relationship between the number of years RSM publications were produced and the
proportion of RSM publications (ρ = 0.706, p< 0.001) is not surprising given that it takes time for
publications on any topic to accumulate, but also suggests continuity of engagement with the
methods. The strong correlations between EBP and both the proportion of RSM publications (ρ =
0.893, p< 0.001, see Figure 13) and the number of years RSM use (ρ = 0.712, p< 0.001) underscore the
historical relationship between EBP and RSM.

Note. Diffusion characteristic correlations are in the upper left quadrant; additional characteristics in
the lower right, and between variables in these groups, the upper right and lower left. “RSM/all pubs,”
the proportion of RSM publications, was calculated from the year continuous RSM use began to 2011.
“Yrs RSM used” is the number of years of continuous RSM use. “Field Size” is the number of
publications, 1992-2011. “Reviews/all pubs” is the proportion of reviews to all documents, 1972 to 2011.
“EBP/all pubs” is the proportion of EBP to all documents, 1992 to 2011. “Diverse/all RS” is the
proportion of diverse RSM to all RSM. “Biglan Class” was treated at the ordinal level, with 1=”Pure”,
2=”Mixed”, and 3=”Applied.” “Mixed” fields were identified as both pure and applied in prior studies.

Figure 13. Relationship between proportions of EBP- and RSM-related publications
Note: EBP proportions include publications from 1992 to 2011, and RSM from 1972-2011. All proportions
are per 10,000 documents.

Correlations between diffusion variables and the additional characteristics were generally
small to moderate. Moderate correlations were observed between the proportion of reviews and
proportion of RSM (ρ = 0.403, p< 0.0001); and between Biglan class and years of RSM use (ρ = 0.331, p=
0.003). Within the group of additional characteristics selected for examination, the strongest
correlations were observed between the proportion of EBP and Biglan class (ρ = 0.424, p< 0.001), and
reviews and EBP (ρ = 0.351, p< 0.001). Small negative correlations were observed between the
proportion of reviews and diverse RSM (ρ = -0.258, p< 0.001), and Biglan class (ρ = -0.213, p= 0.042).
EBP engagement
The extent to which a field engages with evidence-based practice and policy may be an
indicator of a greater interest in research synthesis methods, especially as these methods might be

78

used to translate and transform research-based knowledge to inform professional practices. A number
of prolific high-profile researchers (e.g., Sandelowski, Cooper, Glass, and Light) have worked at the
nexus of research synthesis methods and EBP. The quintessential effort in this area comes from
medicine and the health sciences: the Cochrane Collaboration.
Given that the EBP measure used in this study is relatively coarse, it is possible that the
relationship between EBP and RSM is underestimated. At an anecdotal level, evidence of interest in
using RSM to inform practice and policy decisions predates known usage of the phrase “evidencebased practice” by at least twenty years. For example, Light and Smith (1971) quote then-Senator
Walter Mondale’s address to the American Educational Research Association (AERA) as a motivating
example of the need for the “cluster approach,… a means of combining the data of studies from which
conflicting conclusions have been drawn” (p. (1)). Mondale, discussing the relationship between
research and school integration policy states:

What I have not learned is what we should do about these problems. I had hoped to
find research to support or to conclusively oppose my belief that quality integrated
education is the most promising approach. But I have found very little conclusive
evidence. For every study, statistical or theoretical, that contains a proposed solution
or recommendation, there is always another, equally well documented, challenging
the assumptions or conclusions of the first. No one seems to agree with anyone else’s
approach. But more distressing: no one seems to know what works. As a result I must
confess, I stand with my colleagues confused and often disheartened (Mondale, in
Light & Smith, 1971, p. (2)).
While the strategy used to collect EBP data was not appropriate for collecting early EBP-like
publications, it is also possible that recent publications have been missed. For example, there is some
evidence that in some contexts, “evidence-based” phrases may be used less frequently as other
phrases such as “research-informed practice” or the more broad and encompassing “translation

79

science” become more prevalent. Hjørland (2011), for example, argues that “research-based practice” is
preferable to EBP because it “is open to more fruitful epistemologies and provides a broader
understanding of evidence” (p. 1301).
The level of engagement with EBP varies across and within fields (Figure 14). Fields in the
Health & Medical Sciences group have engaged with EBP to the greatest extent. Fields in Clinical
Medicine and Social Science, and a few other fields have also engaged with EBP to an extent. The
relatively high proportion of EBP publications identified in some fields, such as Computer Science;
and relative lack of EBP in others, such as the Veterinary Sciences is surprising. It would be necessary
to collect more evidence to understand the relationship between EBP and these fields.

80

Physical Geography, 134 = Water Resources; Social Sciences: 118 = Social Work, 41 = Family Studies;
Technology: 23 = Computer Science, 58 = Information Science Library Science, 128 = Transportation.

Reviews: Resources dedicated to past research
Traditional literature reviews are one way that researchers bring past research to bear on
contemporary problems. Researchers in fields that devote a greater proportion of resources to reviews
may be interested in novel approaches to research integration. Conversely, if traditional review
practices are viewed as a good fit for the field, researchers may be more reticent to adopt novel
approaches, especially those as resource-intensive as systematic research synthesis methods. Low
levels of review could also be better predictors of adoption of research synthesis methods in either
direction. For example, some researchers might devote few resources to review activities because
approaches of traditional reviews are seen as unhelpful – though past research is viewed as relevant.
More likely, low levels of review in a field may indicate that researchers in a field do not value formal
integration of past research compared to alternative initiatives.
Review prevalence: exploration and findings.
There has been a great deal of variation in the number of review papers published across
fields and within fields over time. Figure 15 presents longitudinal count data for each field, normalized
by annual counts of total publications. By field groups, there appears to be a general upward trend in
the proportion of reviews – with the possible exception of the Social Sciences in recent years. The
recent decrease in the proportion of reviews in a number of Social Science fields begins in 2010 after
relative highs from around 2000 and just before through about 2009. Whether this reflects a change in

81

publication practices, a change in the citation indexes, or something else is unclear.

Figure 15. Proportion of reviews by field and field group
Note: Cubic interpolation lines were fit to each group to bring out field group-level trends. Proportion
of review papers are expressed as a percent of documents of all types.
Field-level observations
Microscopy, a Technology field, had the greatest proportion of reviews in the Technology field
group, and also the highest proportion of reviews for a single annual period (19.49%, in 2008). This
observation is interesting not only because of the great number of Microscopy reviews in recent years,
82

but also because Microscopy was the one field for which no RSM publications were found. The
pronounced year-on-year differences in Microscopy may be related to size. Based on total number of
publications (1972-2011), only 12 of 136 fields were smaller. A high proportion of reviews were also
observed in Pharmacy and Pharmacology, a Clinical Medicine field, beginning in the early 1990s; and
Anthropology, a Social Science, in the mid- to late 1990s.
With the exception of the Social Science fields “Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences,”
and “Social Issues,” and Forestry in Agriculture, only the Physical Sciences & Math and Technology
groups include fields with an average proportion of reviews of less than one percent across all years
(1972-2011). The average annual proportion of reviews for fourteen of twenty-one technology fields
was less than one percent, and the average for six more was between one and two percent. In this field
group, only Microscopy had a substantial average annual proportion of reviews, approximately 5.79%.
The average annual percent of reviews in Information Science Library Science was just over one
percent (1.03%). Physical Sciences & Math devoted a slightly larger proportion of resources to reviews.
The average annual proportion of reviews was less than one percent for five of eighteen fields, and
between one and two percent for eight others. Only five were greater than two percent. Within this
group, Telecommunications had the highest average annual proportion of reviews (3.94%).
Correlations with diffusion and field characteristics
Review prevalence was moderately correlated with RSM engagement (ρ = 0.403, p < 0.001,
see Figure 16) and EBP engagement (ρ=0.351, p < 0.001), but only modestly correlated with other
factors, including years of RSM use (ρ = 0.289, p < 0.001), field size (ρ = 0.187, p = 0.015), proportion of
Diverse RSM (ρ = -0.258, p = 0.001), and Biglan Class (ρ = -0.213, p = 0.042). These associations suggest

83

that the relationship between reviewing practices and RSM engagement is not direct. Given the
changes in the proportion of reviews over time within fields, it is also possible that measurement of
reviews en masse from 1972 through 2011 has masked the relationship between reviews, RSM
engagement, and other associated factors. The negative correlations between Biglan Class and EBP
suggest that it may be beneficial to look more closely at the association between review prevalence
and RSM in the context of more pure fields and also those that engage with EBP.

Figure 16. Scatter plot of review prevalence and engagement with RSM
Note: RSM engagement was plotted on a log scale.
Diversity of research synthesis methods
Diverse approaches to research synthesis could influence whether and to what extent
researchers in a field adopt the methods. A diverse form could be imported from another field, or
developed by researchers in the field. If the field was receptive to the diverse, adapted form of RSM,
this might facilitate adoption of RSM. Though this is possible, data collected in the first stage of this

84

study suggests that engagement with diverse forms of research synthesis was negligible in most fields
during the time studied. Only 3,136 instances of a diverse RSM publication were found, and five or
more ‘diverse’ publications were discovered in just over half the fields (76 of 136). Table 10 lists fields
in which at least three percent of RSM publications were considered diverse.

Fields that included more than one hundred diverse RSM publications were: Psychology (302
publications), Public Environmental and Occupational Health (264 publications), Health Care
Sciences Services (217 publications), Nursing (204 publications), General Internal Medicine (189
publications), Education and Education Research (172 publications), and Business Economics (105
publications).
In the Spearman’s rho (ρ) correlation analyses, the proportion of Diverse RSM was found to
correlate with the number of years of RSM use (ρ = 0.166, p = 0.027), field size (ρ = -0.164, p = 0.029),
proportion of reviews (ρ = -0.258, p = 0.001), and EBP engagement (ρ = 0.144, p= 0.048). The
magnitudes of the correlations were modest, and no association was found between the proportion of
Diverse RSM and the overall proportion of RSM.
These preliminary findings may be influenced by how diverse RSM were defined and the
search strategy used to identify diverse forms of research synthesis. Conceptually, diverse forms of
research synthesis were defined based on the overall process of synthesis. As a result, incremental
introductions of novelty that contribute to the development of diverse approaches were excluded.
Second, only records that either cited a seed publication or retrieved through a keyword judged to be
diverse were categorized as diverse. While these terms and seed publications might be appropriate for
some fields, they may not be applicable more widely. It is also possible that diverse forms of research
synthesis draw on the more traditional and widely used terms. For example, in Evolutionary biology,
the development of phylogenetic meta-analysis was important. Whether this should qualify as a
diverse form of RSM would need to be examined. This example is intended to suggest that the search
strategy used made assumptions about the language researchers would use to describe methods.

86

Other possibilities include that Diverse RSM contribute indirectly to diffusion of RSM overall, or that
it is only important in niche communities.
Biglan Classifications
Data from prior studies consulted to classify fields as more pure or applied were matched with
only sixty-seven of the one hundred thirty-six fields. Thirty-two fields were identified as applied,
thirty-three as pure, and two, which were classified differently across studies, as “Mixed.” Though, as
Biglan (1973a) emphasizes, the pure-applied dimension is continuous and fields fall at different
locations, the data indicate there was an association between Biglan class and other variables.
Moderate correlations were observed between Biglan class and EBP engagement (ρ = 0.424, p
< 0.001) and years of RSM use (ρ = 0.331, p = 0.003). More modest correlations were found between
Biglan class and RSM engagement (ρ = 0.279, p = 0.011) and review prevalence (ρ = -0.213, p = 0.042).
The association between Biglan class and EBP supports the idea that EBP is more relevant to more
applied fields. As previously noted, the association between Biglan class and both years of RSM use
and RSM engagement are likely explained in part by the historical relationship between the EBP
movement and diffusion of RSM. The negative association between Biglan class and review
prevalence suggests that more pure fields are likely to devote more resources to review activities. In
literature related to research synthesis (e.g., Cooper & Hedges, 1994; Light & Smith, 1971) it has been
suggested that RSM are important because they can contribute to the cumulative nature of researchbased knowledge. It would be interesting to learn whether the nature of fields, pure or applied,
moderates the relationship between review prevalence and RSM engagement; and also whether
researchers in more pure fields cite the accumulation of knowledge as a reason RSM should be used.

87

It should be noted that though, technically, it was appropriate to use Spearman’s rank
correlation statistics as an indicator of association with Biglan class data since data were ordered to
indicate whether a field was less applied (i.e., more “pure”) to more applied in nature. However, there
were only three levels. A more fine-grained understanding of the relationship between Biglan class
and other dimensions of research fields in the context of research synthesis could be obtained with
data that (a) represents where fields occur on the continuum between “pure” and “applied” at more
fine-grained levels; (b) are indexed by date or time period of collection; (c) include judgments from
researchers across fields more broadly; and (d) include judgments for a greater number of research
fields.
Transition from Stage I to Stages II and III
The transition from Stage I to Stages II and II involved selection of fields for examination and
transition from Web of Science categories to science fields in order to support contextualized fieldlevel interpretations of data. A discussion of these components of the transition phase follows.
Selection of fields for more in-depth examination
Stage I observations, considered in light of my professional and educational background and
factors associated with study feasibility, informed selection of fields to examine in Stages II and III.
From the Life Sciences field group, Evolutionary Biology and Conservation Biology were selected; and
from the Social Sciences field group, Social Work and Women’s Studies. One field, the “metadiscipline” (Bates, 1999) Information and Library Science (ILS), was selected in advance. Selection of
ILS offered the opportunity to investigate how ILS intersects with diffusion of research synthesis
methods internally and in relation to other fields.
88

Field selection criteria
In order to select fields, a summary data table that included data on each factor examined in
Stage I was consulted. First, to ensure project feasibility, fields with more than 1000 or less than 150
research synthesis-related publications were eliminated. The remaining 46 candidate fields were then
examined. Within this set of fields, two overarching subject categories, “Science Technology Other
Topics” and “Life Sciences Biomedicine Other Topics”; fields with low incident rates of research
synthesis-related publications; and Clinical Medicine fields, which have been relatively well studied,
were eliminated. Additionally, “Integrative & Complementary Medicine”, which Boyle (2012)
examined in a study that complements this project, was eliminated.
The remaining 32 candidate fields included 3 fields from the Agriculture field group, 4 from
Health and Medical Sciences, 13 from Life Sciences, 11 from Social Sciences, and 1 from Technology.
These fields were examined to identify sets that would be diverse yet complementary. Criteria
considered include the extent of engagement with research synthesis methods, when a field began to
engage with the methods, whether a field was considered more “pure” or “applied”, the level of
engagement with evidence-based practice, the extent of engagement with past research, and overall
field size. Preference was also given to fields associated with field groups that have received less
attention with respect to research synthesis. This preference was cautionary in that I wanted to limit
the potential for overlap with prior or on-going studies; and forward-looking since data or results from
complementary studies might one day be synthesized with those of this study. For analytical
purposes, fields that included essentially the same content across Web of Science Categories and
Subject Areas were also preferred.

89

Unique field characteristics and accessibility of fields to me as a researcher were also
considered. For example, Stage I results suggested that Women’s Studies researchers engaged with
research synthesis methods to a considerable extent, though with relatively few publications using
‘diverse’ forms of research synthesis. This was surprising given that Women’s Studies research is
generally considered to favor qualitative, interpretive, or critical approaches. Therefore, Women’s
Studies was selected in part because this field seemed to present an anomaly. Information Science
Library Science was selected in advance because I consider it my ‘home’ field; and Evolutionary
Biology was selected in part because of my Research Assistantship at the National Evolutionary
Synthesis Center (NESCent), my undergraduate training in botany, and basic work experience in
botany and ecology. The latter two experiences also influenced selection of Biodiversity /
Conservation. Finally, in my studies in Information and Library Science, I have become familiar with
some research and theory in the Social Sciences, which makes these fields more accessible to me.
It is necessary to be cautious about retrospective discussion of personal factors that
influenced field selection – even though these personal factors were considered prospectively. More
specifically, I might have selected other fields based on other experiences. For example, in addition to
botany, I took classes and worked in horticulture; and, in my Information and Library Science
training, work experience, and literature review for this study, I have been exposed to research and
literature resources associated with the health sciences. I might have drawn on these experiences to
support selection of fields from Agriculture or the Health and Medical Sciences. Fields that I seriously
considered but did not select include: Veterinary Sciences from the Agriculture field group;
Biomedical Social Sciences and Substance Abuse from the Health and Medical Sciences field group;

90

Criminology/Penology, Linguistics, Mathematical Methods in Social Sciences, Public Administration,
and Sociology from the Social Sciences field Group; and Transportation from the Technology field
group.
Summary of Stage I observations for selected fields
The selected fields from the Life and Social Sciences field groups, Evolutionary Biology,
Biodiversity / Conservation, Social Work, and Women’s Studies complement each other based on
relationships with larger field groups identified in this study; and in that two are generally considered
more applied and two more pure in orientation (Figure 17). ISLS complements the selected fields as a
‘meta-discipline’ that is concerned with the informational characteristics of the selected fields.

Figure 17. Complementary characteristics of selected fields

Biglan studies categorized Evolutionary Biology as a more pure science. Though Social Work is
generally thought of as an applied field, prior Biglan Studies resulted in a “Mixed” pure/applied
categorization. Prior Biglan studies did not examine Biodiversity/Conservation (or Conservation
Biology), ISLS, or Women’s Studies. Generally, Conservation Biology and ISLS are thought of as more
applied, and Women’s Studies may be thought of as ‘mixed’ or more pure. The selected fields also
differ in the proportion of field resources devoted to reviews: The two life sciences have engaged more
with past research, as gauged by the number and proportion of reviews identified based on the Web of
Science ‘Document Type’ field. Lower levels of engagement with past research were observed in Social
Work and ISLS, and almost none in Women’s Studies (Table 11).

Engagement with research synthesis varied across the selected fields during the time period
examined– the number of documents associated with RSM ranged from less than twenty (ISLS) to
over 300 (Evolutionary Biology) per 10,000 publications. The Life Science fields were later adopters of
RSM: first use and continuous use began in the 1990s for both fields. The Social Science fields adopted
RSM in the 1980s. EBP has been very important in the field of Social Work, and to a much lesser extent
in Women’s Studies, Information Science Library Science, and the Life Science fields.
Translation: From Web of Science categories to science fields
In order to understand diffusion and use of research synthesis methods within science fields,

92

it is necessary to develop an understanding of the historical development and context of research
within each field. Therefore, fields have been interpreted in light of field descriptions identified by
researchers in the literature and Web of Science category scope notes and journal title coverage. Web of
Science category scope notes for the five selected fields are presented in Table 12 and journal titles as
indicated in the 2012 Journal Citation Reports, downloaded in September 2013 are identified in
Appendix H. The Web of Science Categories (WCs) and Research Areas (SUs) aggregated equivalently
in fields analyzed in Stages II and III (Appendix A, Table A1).

Summary: Stage I Results
Research synthesis methods have diffused broadly across science. Relatively modest
engagement with the methods in the 1970s and 1980s was followed by expansion in both the extent of
engagement and diversity of fields that engaged with the methods in the 1990s. Engagement with the
methods continued to increase and spread to a greater diversity of fields through the first decade of
the 2000s.
Measures of association between the extent of engagement with research synthesis methods
within science fields indicate engagement with EBP (ρ = 0.893, p < 0.001) and the number of years a
field has engaged with the methods (ρ = 0.706, p < 0.001) are strongly related. A relatively weak
association between engagement with the methods and whether a field is more “pure” or “applied” in
nature based on prior studies (ρ = 0.279, p = 0.011) presents an interesting contrast to the level of
association with EBP. The difference in levels of association may in part be explained by a lack of
engagement with the methods in technology-focused fields. However, limitations associated with the
Biglan class data, which include the age of studies used to identify whether a field was more pure or
applied and gaps in coverage of fields within studies, may have contributed to the difference in
magnitudes of association between EBP and RSM engagement versus Biglan class and RSM
engagement.
An association between the extent to which fields engage with past research and engagement
with research synthesis methods was found, though the strength of that association was only
moderate (ρ = 0.403, p < 0.001). To an extent, this finding supports commentary that suggests the
methods are used to cope with vast quantities of research information in some fields.

94

Patterns observed in Stage I analyses informed selection of two Life Science fields,
Evolutionary Biology and Conservation Biology, and two Social Science fields, Social Work and
Women’s Studies, for more in-depth analysis in Stages II and III. A fifth field, Information and Library
Science, was selected in advance.

CHAPTER 4. STAGES II AND III: FIELD-LEVEL DIFFUSION CONTEXTS AND IMPACTS
The goal of the second stage of this research was to examine the diffusion of research
synthesis methods at a more granular level in the contexts of five diverse fields: Conservation Biology,
Evolutionary Biology, Social Work, Women’s Studies, and Information and Library Science. The third
stage focused on the impact of the methods in each field through a comparison of the use of research
synthesis methods publications versus traditional literature reviews; and collaboration patterns
associated with the production of research syntheses versus literature reviews. Findings across Stages
II and III are presented together in the context of each field, and then discussed in a comparative
context across fields. Data cleaning processes and coding reliability are discussed prior to field-level
presentations. Research at Stage II was guided by the research questions:
RQ2.1. To what extent has research synthesis diffused within the selected fields?
RQ2.2. How do field contexts influence adoption and use of research synthesis?
RQ2.3. What trends emerge when adoption and use are examined across science fields?
In order to understand field engagement with research synthesis methods at a more granular
level, the following attributes of research synthesis use and discussion were examined:
•

How each field has engaged with research synthesis (e.g., use method, development of
tools for those who perform research synthesis, modifications or development of novel
methods or techniques, evaluations of use).

•

Support for studies that use research synthesis methods (funding and establishment of

96

centers / institutions);
•

The knowledge base that informs syntheses.

•

Topical content of publications related to research synthesis

How each field has engaged with research synthesis, or modes of engagement was examined
to determine the extent to which researchers in the field actually used the methods; and to identify
publications that related to the methods in other important ways. For example, if researchers are
motivated to use research synthesis but available methods are not compatible with research in the
field, we would expect some members to contribute work to adapt the methods to the field. Similarly,
since the availability of previous research and methods of primary study identification and selection
are essential to conducting research syntheses, researchers might be expected to discuss literature
resources. Given the example of the Cochrane Collaboration in the health and medical sciences, it is
possible that organizational resources would be an important theme. Resource availability was also
examined through review of reported funding sources. The knowledge base was examined as an
indicator of the origin of resources that contribute to research synthesis publications; and topical
content as an indicator of the content of research synthesis publications.
Across the research fields examined in Stages II and III, research practices have changed to an
extent by virtue of the fact that some researchers in the fields use research synthesis methods. Stage
III of this study is intended to examine shifts in how research is practiced as it relates to collaboration
patterns and use of research synthesis studies.
Research synthesis is generally regarded as a relatively new form of review. Unlike traditional
reviews, authors who perform a research synthesis follow a method and conduct the synthesis as a

97

research study. In doing so, it is often necessary to incorporate judgments made by multiple
researchers to assess study attributes such as relevance and whether a study meets study appraisal
criteria. Therefore, if a field adopts research synthesis methods, it is possible that shifts in practice
would be observed in terms of resources (number of authors) required to perform a research synthesis
versus a review and greater use of research syntheses versus reviews. Therefore, whether collaboration
patterns and use of research syntheses and traditional literature reviews differs was examined.
Research at Stage III was guided by the research questions:
RQ 3.1: How do research syntheses and traditional literature reviews differ in terms of the
number of collaborating authors?
RQ 3.2: How do research syntheses and traditional literature reviews differ in terms of the
extent to which they are used by researchers?
RQ 3.3 What do findings of RQ3.1 and RQ3.2 reveal when compared across science fields?
Stage II: Data Collection
Research synthesis publications were examined across Web of Science categories for each field
selected for more in-depth analysis at Stages II and III. Web of Science records collected during Stage I
of this research comprised the primary data of analysis. Web of Science records were supplemented
with material from full text versions of publications as noted in the analysis section. Novel data was
generated through content analysis of publication metadata.
Coding
Since the publications in the data set were expected to relate to research synthesis in a
number of ways, article titles, abstracts, and author keywords were analyzed to define their
98

relationship with research synthesis. In addition to articles that implement research synthesis
methods and those that comment on use of the method, articles that relate to research synthesis in
other ways were also of interest. To the extent possible, metadata from Web of Science records
corresponding with this information was used. In cases where no abstract was available in the Web of
Science record, article full text was sought via the University of North Carolina Library Services. If an
abstract was available through the libraries, it was added to the Web of Science records. For
publications that did not have abstracts, the introduction was used. If publications did not have a
clear introduction, full text of the item, minus article meta-data and references, was summarized
using smmry.com, a text summarization web service, and the summary was included in lieu of an
abstract. Preliminary testing indicated use of PDF files as a full text source had some limitations
because repeated page headers (e.g., journal titles) were sometimes included in summaries. Therefore,
in cases where another format, such as text or html, was available, the non-PDF format was used.
Coding categories were established to identify whether publications related to research
synthesis methods directly, indirectly, not at all. For publications that related to research synthesis
methods directly, how the item related to research synthesis was determined using a non-exclusive
category system. Categories available included: (1) reports a research synthesis study; (2) develops
research synthesis methods; (3) develops resources for research synthesis; (4) study or evaluation of
research synthesis methods; (5) discusses research synthesis; (6) introduces research synthesis
methods; and (7) relates to research synthesis in other ways (Table 13). Publications were assigned
codes based on abstracts. In cases where additional information was needed to determine one or
more categories, a question or note describing information needed to make a determination was

99

recorded. Full texts of articles were then searched for the answer to the question, and the article was
coded accordingly. Second coders were asked only to describe what information would be needed to
code an article if it was not apparent from the title, abstract, and author keywords.

Methods

Development of methods may refer to the development of new methods for research
synthesis overall, or an incremental innovation in how research synthesis is performed.
Development of a new way to perform any of the steps within a research synthesis study,
including search, retrieval, assessing studies for relevance, study appraisal, judgment and
extraction of relevant information, combination of results, summarization,
dissemination/ public presentation and so on, would be considered development of RS
methods.

Develop RS
Resources

RSM resources development includes development of resources such as databases,
software, study appraisal tools, and human skills specifically for use in subsequent
research synthesis studies. Publications that review or evaluate resources for research
synthesis studies coded in this category.

Study/evaluate RS
Methods

Publication reports a study or evaluation of RSM use, methods, resources, and so on.

Discuss RS

Discussion may be about use of research synthesis methods, issues or opinions related to
using research synthesis methods, and so on. The discussion may focus on research
synthesis methods generally, or a specific research synthesis study or publication. Book
reviews that discuss a publication related to research synthesis methods coded as
“Discuss RS”.

Introduce RSM

Introduces research synthesis methods to a field or community: The language in the
abstract, title, and/or keywords suggests the publication is introducing research synthesis
methods to a community.

Other

Paper directly related to research synthesis in a way other than those indicated by other
coding categories. “Other” relationships briefly noted.

Reliability
To determine the extent to which coding was reliable, a field-stratified random sample of
records was identified for coding by additional coders. Fields were randomly sampled to include at
least 10% or forty items, whichever was greater (Table 14). Combined, the number of items to be
coded exceeded the minimum of at least 10% or fifty items recommended by Lombard, Snyder-Duch
and Campanella Bracken (2002). Items for coding by second coders were kept to a minimum because
full text of items other than false positives was to be examined in subsequent stages of this research;
and because of a lack of resources for coder compensation. One person was recruited to code the
random sample of records for each field. When recruiting coders, preference was given to individuals
with subject-area expertise, familiarity with research synthesis methods, or both. Inter-rater reliability
is reported with percent agreement and Cohen’s kappa for each coding category across fields.

Descriptive publication data
In addition to content analysis, selected elements from Web of Science records associated with
publications determined to have a relationship with research synthesis methods based on coding
were analyzed to determine the publication years of records, journals of publications, and whether

101

authors indicated financial support. Though financial support data is available in Web of Science
records for a limited number of years (2008-2011 at the time this data was collected), it was examined
as an indicator of resource availability.22 Cited references were processed and visualized with
bibliometric mapping to understand the knowledge base that informs research synthesis-related
publications. Publication titles, abstracts, and keywords were processed and visualized using topic
models to develop overviews of content related to research synthesis methods. Table 15 indicates
fields from which data was extracted directly from Web of Science records for the analyses.

Stage II: Data summarization, analysis, and visualization
Publication year, journal title, funding, and author data from Web of Science records were used
to present tabulated results and trends. The Gini coefficient, a measure of balance (Stirling, 2007), is
used to report proportional distribution of publications across JCR journal titles for each field. This
measure was chosen because of its association with the Lorenz curve, an inverted version of which is
used to visualize publication distributions. In the context of the Lorenz curve, the Gini coefficient

22

More comprehensive funding data could be collected from publication acknowledgments, a step which
would have required greater resources than those available for this study.

102

describes the area between a curve that describes the observed cumulative distribution (of
publications) across units (journals) and a diagonal reference line (x (%) = y (%)) that describes what
an equal distribution of resources across units would look like. Therefore, a Gini coefficient closer to
zero describes a more even distribution of resources.
To communicate the content of publications related to research synthesis in each field, a
thematic summary of publications that did not report research syntheses, but directly related to the
methods in other ways, was performed based on the full text of publications. These publications
provide insight into topics of concern related to the methods, and communication between authors
surrounding the methods. Additionally, subjects – or topics of publications directly or indirectly
related to research synthesis – were visualized with topic modeling.
Topic models
Topic models were developed to summarize RSM-related publications using a variational
Bayes implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Asuncion, Welling, Smyth, & Teh, 2009;
Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003; Ramage & Rosen, 2011). Publications were represented by word cooccurrences in titles, author keywords, and abstracts using a ‘bag of words’ approach. Text
preprocessing included removing labels from structured abstracts, applying the Porter stemmer, and
identifying stop words and frequently occurring words. The number of topics selected was informed
by perplexity scores for 5 to 30 topics (Ramage & Rosen, 2011), such that local perplexity minima were
preferred. Topic labels for the four topic-oriented fields consist of word stems most frequently
associated with each topic. Topic labels were assigned for Information and Library Science
publications through examination of frequent topic words and documents for which more than eighty

103

percent of the content was associated with the topic under consideration. If there were no documents
meeting the eighty percent threshold corresponding to a given topic, the three publications with the
highest proportion of content related to the given category were examined for common themes that
corresponded with topic words. ILS was treated differently given my greater familiarity with research
in the field. When interpreting topic maps in all fields, both topic words and documents primarily
associated with the given topic were considered.
The document-topic matrix, which describes topic distributions across documents, was
visualized in Gephi (Bastian, Heymann & Jacomy, 2009) as a bimodal network. Network partitions
were identified by the Louvain algorithm (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008) and are
represented by color. Topic nodes were sized in proportion to the sum of associated document
proportions, and edge thresholds were applied to reduce visual complexity. Overall, this approach can
be described as a quantitatively guided qualitative overview of publication content.
Bibliometric knowledge base maps
Publications referenced by research synthesis publications in each field were overlaid on a
global map of science to identify the knowledge base contributing to research in each field. Cosinenormalized citation patterns across science reported in the 2010 Journal Citation Reports (JCR),
aggregated by Web of Science categories, are the basis of the global science network (Rafols, Porter, &
Leydesdorff, 2010). Citation patterns represent cognitive or socio-cognitive similarity between science
fields, for which the categories are considered a proxy. The base map was visualized in Pajek (Batagelj
& Mrvar, 2010) and overlaid with counts of references identified from the Cited Reference (CR) field
of Web of Science records. In order to attribute references to Web of Science categories, the CR field was

104

parsed to identify journals of publication. For each CR entry with a journal included in the JCR, the
given entry was mapped to Web of Science categories to which the journal was assigned in the 2010
JCR using a journal title-category thesaurus, and the number of mappings counted. In the bibliometric
knowledge base maps, nodes represent fields, and are sized in proportion to the number of references
observed. Though the number and distribution of references varies widely across fields, equivalent
size proportions were used across the five fields to facilitate cross-field comparisons. Shannon
evenness and Rao-Stirling diversity (Stirling, 2007; Rafols & Meyer, 2010) describe the distribution of
references across science fields. Shannon evenness is a ratio of Shannon entropy, which measures
abundance and evenness of entities across categories, to the maximum entropy possible. Rao-Stirling
diversity accounts for distribution across fields, and the degree to which fields differ. Difference
between fields is estimated with the citation matrix used to construct the global map of science.
Stage III: Data Collection23
Stage III data was comprised of the Web of Science records identified in Stage II and Web of
Science ‘Review’ records published between 2006 and 2008. At the inception of this research, it was
planned to use Web of Science ‘Document Type’ fields to identify reviews. On download of records
classified as Document Type ‘Review’, it became apparent that many records were not associated with
review publications. A recent study of meta-analysis in psychology suggests similar findings (Barrios,

23

Preliminary results from a repeatable approach to data collection using Web of Science and Scopus are
included Appendix K. Data collected following this method tended to miss earlier items published by Springer,
dropped a few titles due to differences in Web of Science and Scopus indexes, and dropped at least one volume
of a title (ARIST, 2008) due to missing DOIs in Web of Science. Only two publications with malformed DOIs
were noted, both in the British Journal of Social Work (due to substitution between an “l” and a “1”).

105

Guilera, & Gomez-Benito, 2013). Rather than use a proxy believed to be extremely inaccurate, I made
the decision to systematically categorize publications as research reviews, original research, other, or
research syntheses (Table 16). In addition to the broad information provided by Web of Science, Scopus
document classifications, publication headings, and researcher claims in publications were taken into
account. Additionally, where needed, journal scope notes and author guidelines that specify the types
of items published were consulted.

* 2007 only
**At least one study in the ‘review’ download and identified as a research synthesis should have been
found with the initial search used in Stage I but was not: “meta-analysis” was included in the title of
this study. The paper may have been added retrospectively.
Assignment to research reviews versus original research versus research synthesis versus
‘other’ types of publication incorporated triangulation: The Web of Science ‘document type’ set the
outermost perimeter of publications to be examined, and the remaining sources refined this
classification. Scopus document categorizations were examined, as were the title, full text, and
supplement files.
Publications that reported methods that involved collection of novel data, including studies
presented as content analyses of research, popular media, and other text documents were considered
106

original research articles. Items tagged as “Book Reviews” on the publication site were categorized as
“other”. Only reviews of research were categorized as “research reviews”. Other types of reviews,
including reviews of policy, flora, fauna, and the geographic extent of species were categorized as
either “Original Study” or “Other”, depending on methods and data collection presentation. Social
Science papers that focused on theory or model building, though often drawing extensively from
literature review, were categorized as “Other”. Journals typically identified towards the Management
Information Science side of the Information Science Library Science category spectrum tended to
publish theory papers. Publications were identified as a research synthesis if the paper presented a
meta-analysis of findings or data across two or more publications; or if the author met four of seven
criteria: Any of the six criteria specified by Cooper and Hedges (1994) and labeling or description of
publication that is a close synonym of the search phrases used to define research synthesis in Stage I
of this project (e.g., “synthesis of research”).
DOI’s, where available in Web of Science records, were used to search Scopus for corresponding
records, which were then downloaded and matched to Web of Science records using the DOI fields.
Book reviews and other forms of secondary works identified by WOS as reviews are not indexed by
Scopus, and therefore it was easy to systematically verify assigned categorizations. Generally, while
Web of Science tended to include a large number of items that are not reviews, Scopus tended to
exclude items that were. For example, items indicated as a literature review in the title but not on the
publisher’s site were not identified as literature reviews in Scopus. Due to the need to access the text
of documents, items which were not available from the University of North Carolina Libraries, Duke
University Libraries, or otherwise accessible online were excluded; as were items written in languages

107

other than English.
At the inception of this research, it was anticipated that comparison of reviews versus
research syntheses would first be considered for one year, the most recent year for which five years of
citation data was available (2008), and prior years would be examined only if a difference between
reviews and syntheses was discovered. However, limiting analysis to one year generally would have
included a small number of studies in the comparison. Therefore, three publication years (2006-2008)
were included in comparisons for all fields except Evolutionary Biology. Data analysis, described
below, was augmented to account for inclusion of multiple publication years.
Only one year (2007) of Evolutionary Biology publications was included because it was not
feasible to categorize reviews for all three years. While 382, 136, 101, and 337 publications of document
type “review” were published 2006-2008 in Conservation Biology, Social Work, Women’s Studies, and
Information and Library Science, respectively, 1226 Evolutionary Biology publications were identified.
In addition to the number of publications, Evolutionary Biology publications were more likely to
include supplements, which were necessary to review for methods details. Even with a modest
estimate of fifteen minutes per item, it would have taken over 300 hours to categorize Evolutionary
Biology “reviews” published 2006-2008.
Citation and collaboration data
Citation data records for publications categorized as research reviews or research synthesis
were downloaded from Web of Science on 10 February 2014. All records were identified through Web of
Science record identifier (UT) field searches to ensure the correct records were downloaded.

108

Variables
The dependent variables in this stage are the extent of use of research syntheses versus
reviews; and the number of authors contributing to each type of publication. The number of citations
that have accumulated five years after publication was used as an indicator of the extent of use. The
independent variable was the type of publication (traditional literature review, or research synthesis).
Stage III: Data analysis
Number of collaborating authors and extent of use of publications were described and then
tested. First, Wilcoxon rank sum tests were chosen to test for differences between publication types
due to the non-normal distribution of data. Following this basic test for difference, the van Elteren
(1960) test was applied using SAS software (SAS Institute, 2012) to account for differences in
distributions across publication years. The van Elteren test is a non-parametric test for differences
between two groups, controlling for another factor:

Where wj is the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic for testing the null hypothesis of no difference in
the jth year, and n1j + n2j is the total number of papers in the jth year across groups 1 (RS) and 2
(Reviews).
Data cleaning
Coding performed for Stage II analyses was used to clean data. Publications that, based on the
abstract, titles, and author keywords, were apparently not related to research synthesis methods were

109

not considered in Stage II and III analyses. Publications judged to have a secondary or weak
relationship to research synthesis were retained for some analyses because though not directly
related, these articles provide information about contexts of use.
Life science (Evolutionary Biology and Conservation Biology) publications retrieved with the
search query were more likely to be related to research synthesis than were those of the social
sciences (Social Work and Women’s Studies) and Information and Library Science (Table 17 and
Figure 18). Over eighty percent of the life science publications have a primary or secondary
relationship with research synthesis, and the majority, a primary relationship. In the social sciences,
about two-thirds of Social Work publications retrieved for this study, and just over a third of Women’s
Studies publications, are related to research synthesis methods. The proportion of items with a
secondary relationship with research synthesis, while still small, is substantially larger than what was
observed in the life sciences. Almost three-quarters of the items in the Information and Library
Science set were judged to have a primary or secondary relationship to research synthesis. A larger
proportion of ILS items were judged to have a secondary relationship with RSM (10.84% of the overall
set retrieved, or 15.02% of items related to RSM at any level).

These findings indicate that there was a high level of variance in the precision of the query
used for this study. Recall that the search strategy was developed to maximize recall and ecological
validity of findings at the macro-level. It should be noted that one reason Women’s Studies was
chosen for closer examination was because it was surprising to see Stage I results suggested a
relatively high level of engagement with research synthesis in this field. One compromise in
developing the search strategy was inclusion of the S/SCI Keywords Plus™ index, which includes
keywords identified through algorithmic analysis of titles referenced by a given publication. As
previously noted, since researchers in some fields are encouraged to identify whether a study is a
research synthesis (e.g., a systematic review or meta-analysis) in the title of a publication there is the
possibility that this increased recall of unrelated publications. Cited reference searching might have
111

identified false positives, in part because papers may cite work for many reasons.
Reliability
Coder reliability measured with Cohen’s kappa was found to range from very good to quite
poor (Table 18). Agreement was good to very good on decisions about whether or not a publication
was a false positive (“No apparent relation”, κ = 0.812), those about whether the publication was
directly related (κ =0.761), and those about whether a publication reported a research synthesis study
(κ = 0.758). Though the number of agreements and disagreements appear relatively favorable across
other categories, Cohen’s kappa values are low to very low. Even when all direct relations other than
“reports a research synthesis” are combined, such that identification of any item is taken as a positive
case and no items as a negative case, kappa value is only 0.439.
Hallgren (2012) notes that Cohen’s kappa measures are generally unrepresentatively low when
the distributions of observations fall under one category at a high rate compared to another category.
Such a ‘prevalence problem’ may be an artifact of the coding system, the tendency of coders to assign
one category rather than another, or because the category of interest occurs at a lower rate. In this
study, the coding system was designed to capture events that were expected to be relatively rare (e.g.,
introductions to research synthesis methods) as well as those expected to occur relatively frequently
(e.g., Reports of studies that use research synthesis methods). Given the aims of the coding scheme
and the low number of items identified in several categories, it is likely that the prevalence problem
influenced Cohen’s kappa measures of inter-rater reliability. Further analysis should examine
prevalence, and perform suitable analyses such as prevalence-adjusted kappa (Byrt, Bishop, & Carlin,
1993). Since differences between whether a publication is related to research synthesis, has a

112

secondary relationship, or is not related at all implies a hierarchical relationship, ratings at this level
might also be examined with a weighted approach.
Across all fields, Information and Library Science ratings were the least congruent. These
ratings should be examined more closely. There was less follow-up with the ILS coder, but follow-up
procedures did not change code decisions, but was merely a chance to discuss observations. It is
possible that in some other way the coding process was different in this case. Other possibilities
include that the heterogeneity of the field was greater and more difficult; that the multiple relations
between ILS and research synthesis might have added a layer of complexity to coding; or the diversity
of coders, both of whom are associated with the Information and Library Science field, though in
different subfields, was too homogeneous. The latter factor might contribute to a “home-field
disadvantage” (Medin, Bennis, & Chandler, 2010) due to more highly nuanced interpretations of
content, and therefore less agreement on item categorizations.
Overall, based on reliability findings, analyses that rely on whether or not a publication is
related to research synthesis can be interpreted with confidence, as can those that rely on ratings of
whether a research synthesis is reported. Analyses that rely on other ratings, especially if additional
steps are not taken to verify relationships, should be interpreted with caution.

Evolutionary Biology
Evolutionary thought is recognized as emerging with the work of Charles Darwin and
publication of The Origin of Species in 1859, famously hastened by competing work of Alfred
Russel Wallace. Until the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s, “a wide-ranging
consensus about the nature and dynamics of evolutionary change” (Gissis & Jablonka, 2011) did not
exist: the Modern Synthesis solidified the impact of Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution through
conceptual integration across paleontology, systematics, and genetics; and rejection of antiDarwinian paradigms (Mayr, 1993, 1999; Mayr & Provine, 1980; Amundson, 1998). While geological
data and observations has informed work by Darwin and others throughout the development of
evolutionary biology, greater consideration of geological knowledge followed development of the
theory of plate tectonics in the geological sciences and a process of integrating both theory and its
implications into evolutionary thought (de Queiroz, 2014). In 2014, about fifty years after wide spread
agreement on plate tectonics, explicit empirical integration of abiotic physical data remains a
challenge to evolutionary biology research whether for lack of tools or due to competing interests. The
field continues patterns of development, with new branches arising, sometimes diverging, relocating
nearer distant fields. Through syntheses and departures, theory, resources, data, applications, insight,
and tools co-influence directions and beliefs amidst the collegial milieu embedded in practices that
unfold each day as researchers open lab doors, step into the field, and power on notebooks to
investigate the “grand patterns and great processes of life” (Simpson, 1944) that are the core of
Evolutionary Biology.
Funding for Evolutionary Biology research has benefitted from a combination of government

115

and foundation support in the United States. In the early twentieth century, the Carnegie Institution,
which invested in big science projects at the time, provided support for the Carnegie Station for
Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, New York. In 1918, the Station was
joined by a Eugenics Record Office to form the Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics, “whose
research quality was as high in plant genetics as it was poor in human heredity” (Kevles, 1992, p.197).
Following World War II, funding for biology research broadly, including evolutionary biology has
increased, leading to an increase in specialization.
Data of evolutionary biology spans vast, if uncertain timescales; and diverse life forms
scattered across the Earth. Data objects may undergo transformations and be subject to subsequent
sampling. The broad conceptualization of synthesis (Sidlauskas et al., 2010) to include integration
across concepts, methods, data, results, and research fields reflects the context of evolutionary biology
research. This conceptualization is echoed in work supported by the NSF-sponsored National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent).
While some research supported by NESCent has focused on research synthesis methods, and
meta-analysis in particular, including by researchers such as Mark Lajeunesse, Jessica Gurevitch, and
Jason Hoekstra, a much broader spectrum of research is supported. Other efforts include those
focused on development of information infrastructures and research methods and tools to bridge
language barriers and synthesize phylogenetic trees; examination of controversial questions, and
promotion of research across disciplines and specialties (National Evolutionary Synthesis Center,
NESCent). A number of these initiatives also concern issues that have become central to methodsfocused research synthesis, including transparency, repeatability, and open access to research and the

116

tools used to conduct research. Additionally, evolutionary biology is generally permeable to Ecology
research. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), also sponsored by the
NSF, played a prominent role in the development and diffusion of meta-analysis in ecology (Cadotte,
Mehrkens, & Menge, 2012), and methods texts suggest similarities between approaches to research
synthesis methods in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and related biological fields, though specific
emphases may differ (e.g., Koricheva, Gurevitch, & Mengersen, 2013).
Findings: Research synthesis in the context of Evolutionary Biology
Just over half (26) of all journal titles (47) listed in the Evolutionary Biology category in the
2012 Journal Citation Report (JCR) include at least one publication related to research synthesis (Table
19). Further analysis suggests the distribution approximates the 80/20 rule, with 82.0 percent of
publications appearing in 21.3 percent of titles (Figure 19, Gini coefficient = 0.767). Journals that
publish the greatest number of research synthesis publications are diverse, and include titles that
publish across scales and focus on a variety of organism types. Review publications (e.g., Trends in
Ecology & Evolution, TREE) and those devoted to study reports are represented.

Figure 19. Evolutionary Biology: Distribution of publications across journals
Financial support: 2008 to 2011
Based on review of financial support data, available for papers published 2008-2011, there is at
least some support for work related to research synthesis. Authors acknowledged at least one, but
often multiple, sources of funding in sixty-six (61.68%) of 107 items published in this period. Table 18
identifies the number of publications that received financial support in journals where research
synthesis was most common. Appendix I includes a full list of publication venues and years of
publication of supported studies (Table I1), and funding organizations and years in which associated
papers were published (Table I2).
Forty-seven of the sixty-six publications with funding reported a research synthesis but did
not relate to research synthesis in other ways. One reported a research synthesis and discussed the
118

methods. One reported a research synthesis, and studied and discussed research synthesis (Journal of
Evolutionary Biology, 2011). One paper only discussed research synthesis methods (Trends in Ecology &
Evolution, 2011). Three discussed and developed the methods (American Naturalist, 2009; BMC
Evolutionary Biology, 2011, Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 2011). One paper reported a study of,
discussed, and developed research synthesis methods (Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 2010). Two
papers were judged to have a secondary relationship to research synthesis methods.
Knowledge base
The knowledge base of a set of papers is revealed through examination of referenced
publications. The ecological sciences (darker green nodes in upper section of graph) broadly
constitute the primary knowledge base of the set of 255 Evolutionary Biology papers with a primary or
secondary relation to research synthesis (Figure 20). Other fields that are drawn on include the
psychological and agricultural sciences. Overall, the reference network is fairly concentrated: 11,983
reference-category counts were attributed to 107 fields. Distribution across fields (Table 20) is
relatively uneven (Shannon evenness = 0.606), though fields from which these publications draw are
somewhat similar (Rao-Stirling diversity = 0.525).

Modes of engagement
Since publication of the first study related to research synthesis in 1991 (Marchant & McGrew),
almost three-fourths of all Evolutionary Biology papers related to research synthesis report a research
synthesis study. Authors also frequently discuss research synthesis methods (18.03% of papers related
to research synthesis). A number of papers (16, 6.56%) focus on development of methods, but fewer

120

focus on resources or investigate the methods through research studies (Table 21, Figure 21).

Introductions
Research synthesis was introduced in three different ways in three articles in the study set.
The first, Gurevitch and Collins (1994) introduced the methods in the context of a discussion of field
experiments. The second, Arnqvist and Wooster (1995), focused on research synthesis exclusively; and
the third, van Zandt and Mopper (1998) provided detailed discussion of how the method was applied
in the context of a study report. Across the papers, research synthesis is framed as “meta-analysis”,
though the description of meta-analysis changes over time: First, Gurevitch and Collins identify metaanalysis as a set of statistical techniques. Second, Arnqvist and Wooster described it as a “statistical

121

framework” (p. 236) and contrast quantitative meta-analytic reviews with narrative reviews; and third,
Van Zandt and Mopper provide a detailed discussion of their multi-step application of the method,
following the framework of Cooper and Hedges (1994), in the context of a study report. Though there
was some use of research synthesis before the third introductory article24, meta-analysis is identified
as a technique “now becoming recognized in the fields of ecology and evolution” (van Zandt &
Mopper, 1998, p. 595). All three publications highlight the social sciences, and Larry V. Hedges in
particular, as important to the introduction of research synthesis in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
Further, a clear line of communication is apparent in the collaborations between Hedges and
Gurevitch. Though Gurevitch might be characterized as an ecologist more than an evolutionary
biologist, the fields overlap and share some publication venues such as Trends in Ecology & Evolution.
Some (e.g., Cadotte, Mehrkens, & Menge, 2012) have highlighted the centrality of synthesis centers
such as NCEAS and NESCent in the development and use of meta-analysis in ecology and related
fields. Additionally, locations of introductory articles (TREE, American Naturalist) suggest that
researchers who work, publish, and communicate across ecology and evolution and the overlapping
boundaries of the fields were important to the spread of research synthesis from ecology to evolution.
Methods
Methods development has focused almost exclusively on development and importation of
meta-analytic techniques. Methods development focused on effect-size, such as in “factorial meta-

24

Twenty-six publications directly related to research synthesis published prior to the third introduction by van
Zandt and Mopper (1998) were identified in this study, including six in the American Naturalist, the journal in
which van Zandt and Mopper was published.

122

analysis” (Gurevitch, Morrison, & Hedges, 2000), correlations (Fitzpatrick & Turelli, 2006) and
weighted z-tests (Whitlock, 2005; Chen, 2011; Zaykin, 2011). Phylogenetic meta-analysis, or
quantitatively accounting for the relatedness of species in a meta-analysis, has been a major focus
(Hickerson, Stahl, & Lessios, 2006; Adams, 2008; Lajeunesse, 2009; Silvestro, Schnitzler, & Zizka, 2011).
Genetics research was identified as a source from which methods to account for species similarities
could be imported (Hadfield & Nakagawa, 2010). Accounting for the extent of difference is important
because, as noted by Lajeunesse, Rosenberg, and Jennions (2013), the “apples and oranges problem” is
literal in evolutionary biology and ecology.
Other papers introduced approaches to examine whether publication bias impacts a synthesis
(Palmer, 1999; Rosenberg, 2005), whether study design features impact study findings and use of
funnel plots to visualize and identify such occurrences (Palmer, 2002), and selection of effect size
measures to support ecological inference (Osenberg, Sarnelle, & Cooper, 1997). One study (Dera, Eble,
Neige, & David, 2008) presented a “meta-analytic” approach to synthesize theoretical morphological
models.
The overlapping boundaries of biological science fields are reflected in discussion surrounding
development of meta-analytic methods in Evolutionary Biology. For example, in 2008, Adams
proposed an approach to meta-analysis that accounts for the degree to which evolutionary history is
shared across taxa in synthesized studies; or, as Adams writes, “I derive a model for phylogenetic
meta-analysis, so that data across studies may be summarized with evolutionary history explicitly
incorporated” (p. 567). In 2010, Hadfield and Nakagawa moderate the contribution of Adams and
others who contributed to the development of phylogenetic meta-analysis. The authors write,

123

“Although many of the statistical techniques used in comparative biology were originally developed in
quantitative genetics, subsequent development of comparative techniques has progressed in relative
isolation. Consequently, many of the new and planned developments in comparative analysis already
have well-tested solutions in quantitative genetics. In this paper, we take three recent publications
that develop phylogenetic meta-analysis, either implicitly or explicitly, and show how they can be
considered as quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed
solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions” (p.
494).
Consequently, what Adams identified as an original contribution derived from combination of
prior art, Hadfield and Nakagawa recognize as available from another field. Thus, priority claims may
be constrained by mechanisms that isolate and bridge communities at different times. While this may
negatively impact Adams’s priority claim, potential benefits for comparative (evolutionary) biology
include the ability to import theory and tools from a neighboring field to tailor implementation of
meta-analysis to perceived needs – provided, as Hadfield and Nakagawa claim, the methods actually
are equivalent, or better for the intended purposes. This potential highlights not only the overlapping
nature of fields methodologically, but also the importance of cross-field communication, which, in
biology broadly, has been characterized as increasingly difficult due to the pace of scientific activity
and sizes of constituent communities (Soulé, 1985).
Resources
Two papers presented resources the authors suggested were related to meta-analysis. One, a
report following a biologging conference, discussed developments in biologging instruments, data

124

management, visualization, integration, and analysis (Rutz & Hayes, 2009). The second paper
introduced PlutoF, a web service intermediary for access, retrieval, and deposit of datasets from the
International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD) and other resources (Abarenkov et al., 2010).
The workbench provides annotation, sequence analysis, and other functions.
Studies and evaluations
Publication bias garnered the most attention in papers that studied or evaluated research
synthesis. Palmer (2000) suggested selective publication of results is influenced by factors such as
statistical significance of results, findings that are consistent with preferred hypotheses, consistency
with theory, and editorial guidelines that emphasize originality and novelty. Suggested remedies
included mechanisms to support publication of true rather than quasi-replication studies and
increased use of funnel plots to graphically present publication bias. Building on research that
indicates a tendency for the magnitude of effect sizes to decrease as publications on a topic
accumulate, Leimu and Koricheva (2004) introduced cumulative meta-analysis as a method to assess
fluctuations in these trends. Cassey, Ewen, Blackburn, and Möller (2004) examined the frequency
with which effect sizes are reported and relationships between effect size reporting and publication
bias. One study examined measurement practices in relation to findings (Palmer, 2002).
Discussions
Of the forty-three publications that discuss research synthesis, all but fourteen relate to the
methods in multiple ways. Here, the focus is primarily on those that discuss research synthesis and
related issues but do not relate to the methods in other ways. Of these fourteen publications, nine
concern specific meta-analytic studies. A notable set in this group includes four “invited expert
125

commentaries” (Houle, 1997; Leamy, 1997; Markow & Clarke, 1997; Whitlock & Fowler, 1997) solicited
in response to a “Target Review”, a meta-analysis of fluctuating asymmetry studies by Möller and
Thornhill (1997). The editor’s note that precedes the review and commentaries weakly describes the
vitriolic tone of the invited commentaries: “Earlier I announced the plan to publish mini-reviews on
controversial topics followed by invited expert commentaries… ‘controversial’ seems a weak
description of the differences in opinion on this subject…” (Hoekstra, 1997). The current study
identified four of seven invited commentaries and the target article, but missed the author’s reply to
commentaries. Borrell (2007) provides background and commentary on the Möller and Thornhill
(1997) paper and commentaries solicitation.
Other discussion publications also comment on specific studies by Möller and others (Amos,
2009; Clarke, 1998; Templeton, 1996) and reply to comments (Falck, Bjornstad, & Stenseth, 1995;
Möller & Cuervo, 2009). Comments and replies may identify flaws, include re-analysis of data, or
present re-analysis of an augmented data set. In other papers, authors discuss areas that would benefit
from greater use of meta-analytic approaches (Noor & Coyne, 2006; Prach & Walker, 2011), review
publication bias issues (Möller & Jennions, 2001), and discuss the need for mechanisms to support
study replications (Palmer, 2000).
In a letter in TREE, Kueffer and colleagues (2011) argued that the current publication system
does not properly enable producers of primary research to receive credit for their work. Synthesis
studies, including meta-analyses, are seen to contribute to problems with credit distribution because
references to primary studies are often presented in materials not indexed by citation databases, such
as supplementary material. Increasing development and use of large databases of primary study

126

findings are another cause of concern in the context of credit distribution. Based on these
observations, the authors advocate inclusion of meta-analyzed studies in locations that are indexed,
inclusive co-authorship practices, and development of mechanisms to allocate credit for use of data
deposited in databases.
Other relationships to research synthesis
The majority of publications (18) that related to research synthesis directly, but not in ways
captured by the coding system used for this study used meta-analytic techniques within a study to
compare magnitudes of effect across experimental conditions or effect sizes across different species.
Other modes included use of meta-analyses to identify studies to use as data for meta-studies, and use
of meta-analyses as a baseline to compare study results. One study was a review of findings of metaanalytic studies.
Topics related to research synthesis
Topics reveal methods-related attributes that are most salient in Evolutionary Biology, and
lines of research prevalent in studies. Across the fifteen Evolutionary Biology topics, word stems
associated with meta-analysis occurred more frequently than any other methods-related terms,
including ‘review’, which occurred one type, and ‘systemat’, a stem for systematic, which did not occur
at all (Table J1, Appendix J and Figure 22).

127

Figure 22. Topics associated with research synthesis in Evolutionary Biology
128

Examination of topics for lines of research revealed that fluctuating asymmetry (“asymmetri
develop”) was the focus of multiple early syntheses. Studies related to mate selection, sex allocation,
and diversification rates were prevalent later (Figure 22). Controversies surrounding fluctuating
asymmetry studies, which were most prevalent in 1997 in the study data, contributed to the
proliferation of publications on the topic. It should be noted that the topic is controversial not only
because of issues related to individual scientists, but also because of aspects of the phenomenon and
how it is studied. Fluctuating asymmetry involves questions about bilateral symmetry and whether it
is heritable. A part of this research relies on measures of small differences. For example, lengths of
fingers on the left versus right hand in humans, or in length of tail feathers from each side in birds
might be used to determine levels of symmetry. Symmetry measures might then be studied in
combination with cross-generational genetic data.
Some topics are important to Ecology and Conservation Biology as well as Evolutionary
Biology. Since journals such as Trends in Evolution & Ecology, Evolutionary Ecology, and American
Naturalist span fields, this should be expected. Topics related to reproduction and mating may be
important across the three fields. For example, topics related to mating and reproduction such as sex
ratios (“sex femal ratio”) have ecological importance with respect to communities and evolutionary
implications with respect to survival of species over time. The same topic is important to
Conservation Biology, especially in the context of breeding programs for rare or endangered species.
Table J1 in Appendix J summarizes the most frequently occurring word stems in each of the fifteen
Evolutionary Biology topics.

129

Prolific authors and their organisms in the context research synthesis publications
Due to the emphasis on phylogenetic heterogeneity and discussions of taxonomic bias in
relation to research in Evolutionary Biology, an additional analysis was conducted to provide an
overview of the types of organisms associated with research synthesis publications. Organisms are
presented in the context of authors who study them and research topics with which those authors are
associated.
Over six hundred authors contributed to papers related to research synthesis in the field
(approximately 62325), though the majority (543) contributed to just one paper, and about 56 others,
two. This suggests that in many cases, researchers in the field engage with research synthesis on
specific occasions, but it is not their primary method of research. Thirteen people contributed to three
studies, and ten to four or more. The most prolific authors in this data set (Table 22) studied a variety
of topics and organisms, though topics such as fluctuating asymmetry, sexual selection, and related to
the methods themselves are prevalent. Taxa studied by prolific authors align with more “popular”
types of organisms, including birds, mammals, and two model organisms (Drosophila melanogaster
and Arabidopsis thaliana). Concentration of research on more popular organisms reflects taxonomic
biases observed in the field, potentially amplified by the need for a sufficient number of studies on a
subject to conduct a research synthesis study.

25

Author disambiguation steps included examination of full names where available, and initials. If necessary,
full text of publications was examined to determine that two name forms did refer to the same or different
individual(s). Further steps to disambiguate authors, such as connecting pre- and post-marriage names, were
not performed.

Impact: Shifts in practice
In the year analyzed, 2007, there were 143 reviews and 23 research syntheses, primarily metaanalyses, in Evolutionary Biology. The van Elteren test was not applied in analysis of Evolutionary
Biology papers because only one year was examined. Based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test, there was
no difference between collaboration or citation patterns associated with research syntheses versus
reviews (Table 23).
The lack of difference between reviews and research syntheses may be a function of the
number of studies evaluated or the year of publication. However, observations in the current study
suggest research synthesis methods have been adopted in part, but that narrative research reviews are
an important component of Evolutionary Biology literature. Notably, even so-called “narrative”
reviews may be highly structured and contain features such as tables that summarize studies and
results.

Though two of the three articles that introduced research synthesis methods to the field
linked meta-analysis, as the method was introduced, to the concept of reviewing, meta-analysis has
been used as a descriptor almost exclusively. Only occasionally do authors place meta-analysis in the
context of “research synthesis” (e.g., Palmer, 2000). The language, statistical focus, and use of metaanalysis to analyze single studies with multiple treatments or species suggests that meta-analysis, in

some contexts, appears to have been extracted from the composite process of research synthesis
methods. Meta-analysis may be more commonly perceived as a statistical technique used to integrate
selected results and traverse the tree of life.
Cadotte, Mehrkens, and Menge (2012) suggest a similar perspective in ecology. The authors
compared use of meta-analysis with “papers” rather than with reviews (meta-analyses typically are
written by larger teams26 and are more cited than other papers in the ecology studies surveyed). Given
that meta-analyses were referenced as often as reviews and exhibited similar collaboration patterns, a
multi-way comparison of reviews, meta-analyses, and other study designs could provide insight into
collaboration and use patterns. Additionally, use and collaboration should be examined
longitudinally.
Conservation Biology
Conservation Biology is to biology, what surgery is to physiology, and war to political science
(Soulé, 1985). The field began to coalesce in the late 1970s/1980s in part as a response to the
recognition of the crisis brought on by humankind’s domination and commodification of Earth’s
resources, which has had severe consequences for biological diversity, evolutionary potential, and
ecological systems. The field is characterized as mission- and crisis- driven, concerned with the
application of biological, social, and political knowledge to inform policy and management decisions
amid uncertainty (Meine, Soulé, & Noss, 2006). Conservation Biology differs from fields such as

26

Ecological meta-analyses retrieved from ISI Web of Science in September 2008 had an average of 3.64 authors
versus 3.17 for papers. Cadotte and colleagues (2012) also found a positive relationship between subsequent use
of papers and the number of publications, species, and years meta-analyzed.

wildlife management, fisheries, and forestry in that it is not focused on management of natural
resources or specific species for human use; is focused broadly on biological diversity and ecological
systems; and recognizes the intrinsic value of biodiversity in all its forms (Gibbons, 1992; Meine, Soulé,
& Noss, 2006; Soulé, 1985). Ethically and philosophically, the field identifies with Western and Eastern
naturalist beliefs that are echoed by Aldo Leopold’s Evolutionary-Ecological Land Ethic, which
“enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or
collectively: the land”; it “changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to
plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also for the community
as such” (Leopold, 1949, p. 204).
Important precursors to the development of Conservation Biology include two post-World
War II trends: growing economic pressures to sustain or increase commodity yields from natural
resources; and an accelerated pace of scientific development across the biological sciences, which led
to increased specialization and barriers to the use of science knowledge in practice and policy
contexts. Following widespread recognition of environmental crisis in the late 1960s and 1970s, a
series of US legislative acts and international agreements ensued, including the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. These and other policies
required scientific expertise for their implementation.
Micro-level mobilization centered around Michael Soulé and his colleagues who, over the
course of a decade (1978-1987), authored key texts, organized the first conferences, and established the
Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) and the Society journal, Conservation Biology (Meine, Soulé, &
Noss, 2006). The second decade saw the development of courses, academic programs, and, with

134

funding from the Pew Charitable Trusts, the establishment of graduate programs (Jacobson, 1990).
The MacArthur foundation and NSF special funds provided additional early funding (Gibbons, 1992).
Despite initial success, whether Conservation Biology would endure was, in the 1990s,
questioned. For example, Gibbons (1992) highlighted concerns about the methods, evidence-base,
cross-disciplinary data integration, and heavy reliance on theoretical models in the field as
characteristics that caused some concern. Initiatives to develop an evidence-based framework for
conservation biology and environmental conservation more broadly address some of these concerns
(Pullin & Knight, 2009). Guided by the framework of EBP in medicine and the Cochrane
Collaboration in particular, the UK-based Center for Evidence-Based Conservation (CEBC) was
established in 2003. The CEBC coordinates the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE), and
is the editorial home for the Environmental Evidence Journal27, which began publishing systematic
reviews, review protocols, and related publications in November, 2011 (Centre for Evidence-Based
Conservation, 2012). As of January 2014, fifty-nine systematic reviews had been completed and
published at the website, and thirty-one indicated as underway.
Findings: Research synthesis in the context of Conservation Biology
Half (20) of the forty journals identified in Biodiversity Conservation by the JCR include
publications related to research synthesis methods; though thirteen titles include only one or two
related publications. Most publications appear in Global Change Biology (46 publications),
Conservation Biology (44 publications), and Biological Conservation (31 publications) (Table 24).

27

As of January 2014, the Environmental Evidence Journal was not indexed in the S/SCI.

135

Publications are relatively concentrated in a few journals: 78.3 percent of all research syntheses are
published in 19.5% of the journal titles listed in the JCR (Gini coefficient = 0.775; Figure 23).

Financial support: 2008 to 2011.
Of the 101 publications judged to have a primary or secondary relationship with research
synthesis methods, sixty-eight (67.3%) indicated some form of financial support (Appendix I, Table
I3). Among publications for which financial support was recognized, an average of about 2.5
supporting organizations (range 1 – 12) per publication was indicated. Appendix I, Table I4 presents
funding organizations and years in which associated papers were published.
Of the sixty-eight publications associated with financial support, fifty-one reported a research
synthesis but did not relate to research synthesis in other ways. Nine reported a research synthesis
and related to research synthesis in other ways. Five of these publications reported a research
synthesis and discussed the methods. One reported a research synthesis, and studied and discussed
research synthesis (Global Change Biology, 2009). One reported a research synthesis and developed
resources (Conservation Letters, 2009). One reported a research synthesis, developed resources, and
discussed methods (Oryx, 2010). One reported and developed methods for research synthesis (Journal
for Nature Conservation, 2010).
Two papers published in Conservation Biology (2008, 2009) developed resources for and
discussed research synthesis methods. A third, published in Conservation Letters in 2009, focused on
resource development for research synthesis methods.
Four publications had “other” relationships with research synthesis methods. Three of these
papers, published in Western North American Naturalist (2011), Conservation Biology (2010), and Avian
Conservation and Ecology (2008), used meta-analytic techniques within the reported studies. The
fourth introduced a new journal section for systematic reviews (Biological Conservation, 2009). Two

137

publications had a secondary relationship with research synthesis. These were published in Natureza
& Conservacao (2011) and Conservation Biology (2011).
Knowledge base
Conservation biology draws primarily from biological, biomedical, environmental, and
agricultural sciences (Figure 24). Though conceived as a field that would integrate social science
approaches, only limited use of social science research is visible. Medicine and the health sciences are
framed as fields to emulate with respect to the development of evidence-based practice, but few
journal publications appear to be referenced from these fields. Diversity patterns were similar to those
observed for Evolutionary Biology: The 194 Conservation Biology publications referenced slightly
fewer fields (100 versus 107, Table 25). Distribution of references across fields is slightly more even
(Shannon evenness = 0.637, versus 0.606); and the knowledge base integrated, slightly more disparate
based on referencing patterns observed in science overall (Rao-Stirling diversity = 0.543 versus 0.524).

Modes of Engagement
The primary mode of engagement with research synthesis methods in Conservation Biology
was application of the methods in research studies (85.71%, Table 26; Figure 25). Following
application of the method, Discussion of the methods generally and as implemented in specific cases
was common (16.93%). A number of papers focused on resources and methods development (10
papers each), but few studied the methods and their use. Eight publications reported use of meta-

139

analytic techniques within a research study but did not relate to research synthesis in other ways.

Introductions
Fernandez-Duque and Valeggia (1994) introduced meta-analysis as “not a statistical method
per se, but rather an orientation toward synthesizing research using many of the available techniques
of measurement and data analysis. It is a scientific review in which the emphasis is placed on
providing a quantitative synthesis of data” (p. 556). To introduce research synthesis, the authors draw
on literature from both the health (epidemiology) and social sciences to discuss issues related to the
methods, such as study selection, moderator analysis, publication bias, selection of outcome metrics,
and disagreements about the “conceptual basis” of meta-analysis. Complexity of systems of interest is

140

introduced as a special challenge for the field; and the potential to inform policy makers through
quantitative rather than narrative research reviews is emphasized as a potential benefit of RSM.
Fernandez-Duque and Valeggia (1994) argue that meta-analysis may be valuable to the field
because of the large number of inconclusive studies; and because of consequences of Type II errors
(failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false) in studies designed to assess the magnitude of a
negative effect of human activity. If studies are to be used to inform decision making, it is argued, it is
better to be conservative because such errors could lead to decisions to take irreversible actions. The
authors illustrate potential benefits of meta-analysis with a worked example that combines evidence
from studies with conflicting results to find that bird density is lower in forests subjected to selective
logging than undisturbed forests. This example demonstrates the potential danger of basing decisions
on partial evidence, and implications related to Type II errors. If, for example, a decision to selectively
log were made based on findings from a study that failed to find associated negative impacts, it would
not be possible to later undo damage sustained from this decision.
The authors note that comprehensive literature search could be challenging because
potentially relevant studies might be distributed across journals, doctoral theses, national reports,
organizational reports, and so on. Additionally, “in [conservation biology], much research is carried
out in underdeveloped countries, where access to major scientific journals is severely limited”
(Fernandez-Duque & Valeggia, 1994, p. 558).
Methods
Six methodological papers published in Human and Ecological Risk Assessment (HERA) from
2002-2006 focused on a diverse but interrelated set of concerns related to surrogate or comparative

141

data, risk, uncertainty, and maximization of findings from primary studies and survey data. HERA
differs from other journals in the category in that it emphasizes risk assessment in the context of
human and ecological health. This focus overlaps with primary issues of Biological Conservation such
as biological diversity, but from a different perspective. Despite differences, some challenges to
research synthesis presented in HERA reflect those of studies more centrally located in the field of
Biological Conservation, including dealing with uncertainty, the need to work within the constraints
of available data and studies, and time constraints in contexts of decisions that have potentially wideranging and irreversible consequences.
Methods articles in HERA include Goodman (2002), a discussion of managing uncertainty in
risk assessments through attribution of uncertainty to random and predictor components. Goodman
further proposed incorporation of comparative data, for example, data related to species or toxins not
specific to the case of interest. This approach, argues Goodman, enables one to maximize available
data, and estimate potential contributions of specific types of future studies, both of which are
important when working with sparse evidence and resources. A later paper (Etterson & Bennet, 2006)
discussed problems associated with using surrogate data from published literature to model species
demographics and methods to mitigate these risks using Bayesian and meta-analytic methods and life
history theory.
A framework for combining diverse lines of evidence, such as toxin concentration data and
community (species or organism) surveys when there are differences in important aspects of
reference and test sites (e.g., spatial and temporal factors) is presented in two related papers (Bailer,
Hughes, See, Noble, & Schaefer, 2002; Reynoldson, Smith, & Bailer, 2002). Like others, the authors are

142

concerned with maximizing use of available data from primary studies. The authors demonstrate the
proposed approach through a study of Great Lakes contaminant impacts. The remaining two HERA
papers examine epidemiological exposure-response and concentration-response scenarios in metaanalytic contexts (Schwartz, 2002; Roosli, Kunzli, Schindler, & Braun-Fahrlander, 2003). Roosli and
colleagues argue an excess rate approach rather than relative risk approach may mitigate issues
related to the “apples and oranges” problem when combining findings from studies with different
population contexts.
The remaining methods papers appeared in Biological Invasions, Conservation Biology, and the
Journal for Nature Conservation between 2004 and 2010. The first of these papers, Kimberling (2004)
examines associations between life history and success in the context of intentional introductions of
non-native insect species for control of pests. Kimberling uses logistic meta-regression based on
‘historical’ data extracted from publications into a database to develop guidelines to support the US
National Invasive Species Management Plan (2001) for intentional insect introductions.
Researchers from the Centre for Evidence-Based Conservation at Bangor University
(Gwynedd, UK) and their collaborators contributed three publications between 2006 and 2010. Pullin
and Stewart (2006) broadened the discussion of methods in the field from one primarily concerned
with meta-analysis to include research synthesis methods more broadly with their article, “Guidelines
for systematic review in conservation and environmental management”. Pullin and colleagues draw
on evidence-based frameworks from other fields, especially medicine, but identify important
considerations in their home field of Conservation Biology. Newton, Stewart, Diaz, Golicher, and
Pullin (2007) introduce use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) as a tool for evidence-based

143

conservation management through explanation and brief demonstration in four case studies. In the
case studies, findings from systematic reviews, studies that did not meet inclusion criteria for
systematic reviews, and expert opinion are combined to develop BBN, which are similar to conceptual
models and can be tested. The method enables synthesis across different types of knowledge and
identifies differences in these knowledge bases. For example, the case presentation on control of
Rhododendron ponticum clearly demonstrated differences in control methods investigated in research
studies versus control methods used by conservation managers. Many research studies focused on a
control method rarely used in practice (application of an herbicide, Imazapyr), and few studies
focused on control methods used in practice (e.g., weeding and cutting back rhododendrons).
In the final methods paper, Gusset, Stewart, Bowler, and Pullin (2010) present a systematic
review with meta-analysis as a means of cross validating, or using multiple evaluation methods, to
assess intervention outcomes. The authors identified factors that contributed to success of
reintroductions of the endangered wild dog of South Africa. The relatively expensive pre-release
socialization program components were found to positively contribute to post-release survival rates
more than many less expensive program components.
Resources
A diverse set of resources was identified for research synthesis in the context of developing a
knowledge base for Conservation Biology. Discussion and development of resources spanned
literature resources such as literature databases, and political, technical, and organizational resources.
Advocacy appears to have been relatively important, perhaps due to the coordination efforts and
allocations needed to develop larger scale resources.

144

A publication focused on more traditional research synthesis resources, databases, highlights
special concerns in the context of Conservation Biology. Bajomi, Pullin, Stewart, and TakacsSantainclude (2010) described distribution of reintroduction literature and programs across
publication venues and taxonomic groups. The authors found that about a third of publications were
available from a set of primary Conservation Biology titles. Distribution of programs was biased
towards mammal, then bird reintroductions, with very few invertebrate reintroduction programs.
This bias is amplified in the literature, with about half of all publications focusing on mammals, 27%
on birds, and 3% on invertebrates. Peer reviewed journals and book publications exhibited less
taxonomic bias than grey literature. The search across eight “databases and catalogues” was intended
to be specific – resource names and a base search string were identified – but somewhat unclear. For
example, the Web of Knowledge and ISI Proceedings were listed, which would seem to be redundant;
and specific Web of Knowledge database units were not indicated. Given that review of methods
described in several systematic reviews performed in association with the CEE did not reveal similar
listings though similar resources were listed, the discrepancy may be an oversight or the result of
journal space considerations.
Resources identified by authors as needed in the field include marine protected zones,
repeated measures, and data from long-term monitoring (Green, Balmford, Crane, Mace, Reynolds, &
Turner, 2005; Lepetz, Massot, Schmeller & Clobert, 2009; Henry et al., 2008). Such resources require
financial and political commitments and coordination of research resources, but are seen as necessary
to research synthesis efforts because through continued study and integration of knowledge,
community and generational effects of interventions as well as associations between rates of change

145

over time (e.g., with climate change) can be better understood. Researchers directly linked research to
political mandates (e.g., The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the World Summit on
Sustainable Development (WSSD) in e.g., Green et al., 2005); and databases kept to support some
mandates are a source of data for subsequent syntheses that, in turn, can be used for guideline
development and refinement (e.g., Clark, Hoekstra, Boersma, & Kareiva, 2002).
The Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE), established in 2003 and modeled on
the Cochrane Collaboration (Pullin et al., 2006), features prominently in the study data. Though the
CEE established a journal to publish systematic reviews, review protocols, and related materials (not
indexed by the SCI), it is significant that in 2009 a new ‘Systematic Review’ section of Conservation
Biology, an established, mainstream journal, was announced. The announcement was made by Pullin
and Knight (2009) of the Centre for Evidence-Based Conservation, who again stressed the need to
support evidence-based decision-making and referenced the health sciences.
In HERA, Crump (2001) discussed the need to accumulate data on a potentially widelyprevalent condition, “hormesis”, or favorable biological response to low-level toxin exposure, for
which a method of study was not known. Such a database would enable analysis after data
accumulation and methods were developed. HERA also reprinted an article from the European Journal
of Oncology that investigated characteristics of studies with non-positive results, arguing that such
studies should be made available for meta-analysis (Axelson, 2005).
Studies and Evaluations of Research Synthesis
Literature studies focus on topics generally associated with research synthesis, such as
publication bias as it relates to null hypothesis statistical tests, but also in biological terms. In addition

146

to publications reported in other sections, several studies of systematic reviews and their use were
identified. These studies evaluated the extent to which research versus experiential knowledge is used
to inform practice decisions (Pullin, Knight, Stone, & Charman, 2004; Pullin & Knight, 2005);
compared reviews in the field to those in medicine based on Cochrane guidelines (Roberts, Stewart, &
Pullin, 2006); evaluated early use of a systematic review framework (Stewart, Coles, & Pullin, 2005);
and examined divergent results from meta-analyses related to effects of rising atmospheric CO2
(Hungate et al., 2009).
Discussion
In introducing Conservation Biology, Soulé (1985) described the field’s mission in pragmatic
terms: “to modify significantly the rate at which biotic diversity is destroyed,” increase survival odds
for species at risk, and mitigate negative human impacts. Throughout the Conservation Biology
literature, there is emphasis on scarce resources and overwhelming need to make optimal decisions to
allocate these resources for maximum effect. In addition to topics mentioned elsewhere, discussion
articles are used to demonstrate the translation of research-based knowledge to practice, discuss
current levels and potential roles for research synthesis, discuss application contexts, and comment
on specific studies.
Some discussion publications in Conservation Biology are similar to those in Evolutionary
Biology in that they discuss different approaches to research synthesis, critique specific syntheses,
focus on issues such as publication and taxonomic bias, and identify potential uses for the methods in
the field – among other topics. The four items identified as “discussions” of research synthesis but
which did not relate to the methods in other ways (van Buskirk, & Willi, 2005; Trontelj & Fiser, 2009;

147

Paillet et al., 2010; and Halme, Toivanen, Honkanen, Kotiaho, Monkkonen, & Timonen, 2010)
commented on or replied to comments on specific studies. Issues of contention included techniques
used to synthesize data, the extent of generalization of findings, interpretation, and data selection.
Topics of research syntheses
Research syntheses themselves span a variety of topics and environments (Figure 26). Both
marine (“biodivers marin protect”) and terrestrial (“forest rich biodivers abund bird”) habitats are a
focus, as are meta-analyses of CO2 experiments (“elev co2 increas plant”) and climate change research
more generally (“chang climat respons”). Diversity is considered at multiple levels, including genetic
(“invas popul genet”), population (“popul distanc spatial”), species, and habitat diversity. Studies
likewise range across biotic and abiotic (e.g., “soil chang carbon”) factors. Decision-making by
professionals (“conserve review manage evid systemat”) first appeared in 2001, and became more
prevalent after 2003. Systematic reviews were associated with this topic. Table J2 in Appendix J
summarizes the most frequently occurring word stems in the fifteen Conservation Biology topics.

149

Impact: Shifts in practice
Though the years studied, 2006-2008, fall early on the adoption curve, analysis suggests that
the research audience is receptive to research synthesis methods. Across all years, 84 syntheses and
117 reviews were identified (Table 27). While there was an increase in the number of research
syntheses, there does not appear to have been a drop in the number of reviews produced. The
Wilcoxon and van Elteren tests detected a difference in receptivity to reviews versus syntheses from
the perspective of citations (Table 28). Examination of a broader span of years could verify whether
subsequent use of research syntheses was growing during the time span sampled. No difference was
detected in the level of collaboration in reviews versus syntheses.

Diffusion of research synthesis methods in Conservation Biology is distinct from Evolutionary
Biology given the focus on practice. Authors draw from precedents set in the medical and health
sciences, and reference standards from the field for comparisons. Given the number of reviews

150

identified through the CEE alone, it is evident that the dataset understates production of research
syntheses in the field. Subsequent use – based on citations during the period examined – exceeded
that of reviews, indicating research syntheses are of use to researchers. The prevalence of publications
from authors associated with the CEE indicates the Center has become a strong proponent of
systematic review, as well as home to researchers who implement the methods.
The extent to which research synthesis is used to support practice and policy decisions is
unclear, though research suggests efforts to establish translational conservation biology have only
begun. In a survey of conservation management plans written 1996-2002 compiled by conservation
organizations in the U.K., Pullin, Knight, Stone, and Charman (2004) found that 11% referenced
primary scientific literature, and 16% secondary reviews of literature. More often, habitat
management handbooks (29%), biodiversity action plans (29%), and accounts of traditional
management (71%) were used to justify proposed action plans. A recent examination of forty-three
systematic reviews of conservation interventions found that the majority of interventions were
relevant to policy decisions, and only about 35% considered those relevant to management decisions
(Cook, Possingham, & Fuller, 2013). From the perspective of using systematic reviews to inform policy,
Pullin, Knight, and Watkinson (2009) draw on the health sciences to argue that evidence-based
environmental policy requires a substantial evidence base because any one policy question will
require evidence from several systematic reviews, each assessing a potential intervention.
Social Work
Training programs to prepare professionals for social work practice first emerged in 1898
under the auspices of the New York Charity Organization Society (Abbott, 1995), and more formal

151

credentialing practices were adopted in the 1930s after the formation of the American Association of
Schools of Social Work in 1921 (Austin, 1983). During the same period, Social Work and Sociology
diverged, though privileged ties between the fields were evident through about 1940 (Chapoulie,
1987). The Social Work Research Group (SWRG) formed in 1949 to support communication practices
of social work researchers; and began abstracting relevant research (Greenwood, 1957), developing an
early precursor to Social Work Abstracts, now published by the National Association of Social Workers
(NASW). In 1955, the SWRG and six other organizations came together to form the NASW (McRoy,
Flanzer, Zlotnik, 2012).
Though educational standards began to take shape relatively early, the relationship between
practice and research is at the center of ongoing inquiry (Herie & Martin, 2002). Engagement with the
evidence based practice movement has become an important extension of the ongoing debate (e.g.,
Herie & Martin, 2002). Similarly, tools associated with EBP, and research synthesis methods in
particular, have focused the debate into a quest for empirical analyses amenable to the diverse
research designs that constitute research in the field; and to demonstrate the relevance of research
and practice to each other (Webb, 2001). Early research in Social Work, supported by organizations
such as the Russell Sage Foundation, focused on community needs and the work of social workers
(Zlotnick, 2008). Research funding has been a challenge for the field, though a supportive relationship
with the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) beginning in the late 1980s has provided
direction and resources that contribute to an increased research capacity (McRoy et al., 2012). In the
context of research synthesis and EBP, organizations such as the Campbell Collaboration, and
resources such as Social Work Abstracts have developed into important capacity building and

152

knowledge sharing tools.
The underlying social justice mission of Social Work is occasionally discussed in professional
and research literature (Galambos, 2008). This mission, which ties Social Work researchers and Social
Workers to marginalized groups in society compounds status issues associated with being a
traditionally female-dominated field (Abbott, 1995) and politicizes the activities of workers and
researchers in the field (e.g., Galambos, 2008). The political nature of the field is also reflected in an
active scholarly focus on social policy.
Findings: Research synthesis in the context of Social Work
Nearly all social work publications listed in the JCR have published one or more items related
to research synthesis. Four titles were not matched to RSM papers. Two were foreign language
publications, and the others regional publications (Australian Social Work, and the Asia Pacific Journal
of Social Work). Though nearly a quarter of all publications were located in one journal title, Research
on Social Work Practice, 80% of research synthesis publications are distributed across approximately
44 percent of JCR journal titles (Table 29; Figure 27), a distribution that is reflected in a relatively low
Gini coefficient (0.555).

Coordinator, Calgary Health Region, for a paper that reported a research synthesis in Child & Family
Social Work.
Knowledge base
Social Work references a large number of fields, but mostly concentrated within Social Work
and cognate fields, especially in the Psychological Sciences. Extensive use of literature associated with
the Psychological Sciences reflects use of research related to mental health, an area to which Social
Work researchers also contribute (Abbott, 1995). Lower Rao-Stirling diversity (Table 30) and the
proximity of larger nodes to Social Work (Figure 28, yellow node with red ring) reflect these
differences. Social Work mobilizes research in Social Work and cognitively similar fields for the
benefit of the field broadly.

Modes of Engagement in Social Work
Like other fields, reports of studies were the most prevalent mode of engagement with
research synthesis methods, though only 65.84 percent of publications reported a study (Table 31;
Figure 29). Nearly half as many discussed research synthesis (33.10%). A number of publications
focused on methods (18 items, 6.34%), resources (17 items, 5.99%), and studied or evaluated research
synthesis (18 items, 6.34%).

Introductions
Research synthesis methods were introduced multiple times in Social Work between 1982 and
2011, in several different contexts. The first two articles, published in Family Relations, provide
instruction (Nye, 1982) and demonstration (Ganong & Coleman, 1984) of integrative review. In both
cases, the need to fit integrative review methods to Social Work research was emphasized. Soon after,
a “meta-analysis” was demonstrated in the American Journal of Community Psychology (Medway &
Updyke, 1985), where it was introduced again six years later by Durlak and Lipsey (1991). Publication
of a collaboration between Lipsey and David B. Wilson (1993) two years later in the American
Psychologist has been interpreted as contributing to increased interest in research synthesis methods
in a broader spectrum of social sciences. Subsequent introductions are made in the British Journal of
Social Work, Children and Youth Services Review, Research on Social Work, and lastly, in 2011, in the
Clinical Social Work Journal, stressing the role of the Campbell Collaboration.

Methods
Methods works, published between 1985 and 2011, included contributions to specific
components of the systematic review process, and overall approaches to research synthesis. Some
methods papers identified difficulties related to conducting research synthesis in the field; others
aimed to advance techniques and concepts related to established procedures.
In an examination of databases and search filters, Shlonsky, Baker, and Fuller-Thomson (2011)
introduced the “Avalanche Index” (AI), a measure used to evaluate the efficiency of searches. The
Avalanche Index is a measure of “the number of hits one would need to read through in order to find
one of the desired studies” (i.e., a study included in a systematic review end-product). More
specifically, AI is the total number of hits divided by the number of studies included in a review found
with a given search. The authors suggest AI is a better tool to gage search effectiveness because,
whereas specificity and sensitivity “describe predictive capacity of a strategy as it relates to previous
searches”, AI measures overall effectiveness.
Focusing on search in the context of the social sciences and social policy, Curran, Burchardt,
Knapp, McDaid, and Li (2007) developed a “novel literature-sampling technique to facilitate a
pragmatic approach to mapping” literature, demonstrated with a worked example. The authors were
not able to meet their objective, but developed maps based on samples of the literature to
characterize research in the areas examined. This study, intended to develop methods, identified a
large number of barriers to study identification.
A multidimensional approach to primary study quality appraisal was explored by Taylor,
Dempster, and Donnelly (2007). The authors advocated inclusion of a wider selection of studies in

158

research syntheses, including those that focus on process, but identified common appraisal tools as
desirable. In a review embedded at the intersection of meta-analysis and experimental research,
Shadish (2011) discussed his ongoing examination of non-randomized experiments. The topic is
presented in the context of meta-analysis: Shadish reflects on prior meta-analyses he performed to
assess impact of study design on findings across studies, and interprets his findings in part based on
the potential for meta-analyses to include a wider variety of research designs. One type of nonrandomized design, regression discontinuity design (RDD), is evaluated favorably in comparison with
randomized designs.
In research reminiscent of single subject design studies, Holden, Bearison, Rode, FishmanKapiloff, Rosenberg, and Onghena, (2003) presented an approach that combined single system design
studies (SSD) with meta-analysis. Methods for more traditional quantitative meta-analysis were also
extended. Nugent (2009) developed the concept of “standardized mean difference effect size
invariance,” which is concerned with the context of measurement. In order for effect sizes to be
comparable and combinable, argues Nugent, facets of the measurement must be comparable.
A few methods articles extended more traditional systematic review frameworks or included
systematic reviews as a component of more encompassing methodological frameworks. For example,
Lee and Aos (2011) present an approach to cost-benefit analysis in which systematic review is the first
step, followed by cost, benefit, linked outcome, and risk analyses. The approach is advocated for use in
some policy contexts. In an approach developed for practice settings, Petr and Walter (2005) present
a method they call “best practices inquiry,” which incorporates research, consumer, and professional
knowledge in seven steps: (1) question formulation, (2-4) identification of “multidimensional sources

159

of knowledge” (quantitative and qualitative studies, “consumer wisdom”, and “professional wisdom”),
(5) summarization, comparison, and contrast of findings across sources, (6) source quality appraisal,
and (7) application of findings to improve practice. In an effort to develop understanding about
“continuity of care”, Parker, Corden, and Heaton (2011) adapted critical inquiry synthesis and narrative
synthesis methods to evaluate interim results from a research program. The syntheses were
triangulated against the scoping study that set parameters for the research program.
Resources
Publications related to resources for research synthesis methods in Social Work focus on tools
to facilitate use and evaluation of research synthesis studies; evaluation of literature and data sources;
skills development; and the Campbell Collaboration. Resources intended to facilitate use of research
synthesis methods include forms to evaluate primary studies (Gibbs, 1989; Taylor, Dempster, &
Donnelly, 2007). Methodological search filters, common in the health sciences, are introduced to aid
retrieval of study reports from databases (Shlonsky, Baker, & Fuller-Thomson, 2011).
Holden, Barker, and colleagues (2008, 2009) studied the adequacy of Social Work Abstracts
and PsycINFO as resources for systematic reviews. Both databases provided less than optimal
coverage of social work journals, and SWA performed significantly worse than PsycINFO. Similarly,
review of seven literature databases led Taylor, Dempster, and Donnelly (2007) to conclude that
information management skills were imperative for Social Work, and that the profession would
benefit greatly from a dedicated international database on par with resources in other fields, such as
MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. In a departure from the focus on literature databases, JohnsonReid and Drake (2008) discuss the use, associated issues, and potential of multi-agency datasets to

160

bolster evidence for EBP, and to provide information about what is being done and what agencies
need evidence on. A review of four evidence-based clearinghouses by Soydan, Mullen, Alexandra,
Rehnman, and Li (2010) is similarly positioned in the context of evidence-based practice. The authors
identified the types of evidence available and how it is produced. Health and medical science
resources, which provide some evidence on topics integral to social workers, are used as comparisons
(e.g., the Cochrane Library) and to develop resources in some clearing houses (e.g., PRISMA is used in
development of systematic reviews at the Swedish clearinghouse MetodGuiden).
Publications that focus on developing human resources discuss systematic reviews and
evidence based practice in the context of student training (Ganong & Coleman, 1993; Howard,
McMillen, & Pollio, 2003; Corcoran, 2007) and in social work practice (Crisp, 2004). Skills
development is also an important facet of publications about Campbell Collaboration resources
(Johnson & Austin, 2006; Hannes, Claes, & the Belgian Campbell Group, 2007).
The Campbell Collaboration, established in February 2000, is the subject of or presented as an
important resource in several publications. Schuerman, Soydan, McDonald, Forslund, de Moya and
Boruch (2002) discuss “the development, organization, and operation of the Campbell Collaboration,
an international network of academics and practitioners who prepare, maintain, and make accessible
authoritative systematic reviews of the effectiveness of interventions in the fields of social welfare,
education, and criminal justice” (p. 309). As previously mentioned, systematic reviews and other
resources (e.g., training) made available by the Campbell Collaboration, and how these intersect with
needs of practitioners, policy makers, and researchers, are promoted as well.

161

Studies and Evaluations of Research Synthesis
A number of papers studied or evaluated research synthesis methods in Social Work. An early
study, likely inspired by a prior study by Harris Cooper and Robert Rosenthal (1980), compared
systematic or integrative coding and other methods as the basis to evaluate research (Ganong &
Coleman, 1993). Several studies evaluated research syntheses compared to each other and other
approaches (Cowen, 1997; Miller, 2000; Cwikel, Behar, and Rabson-Hare, 2000; Hillberg, HamiltonGiachritsis, & Dixon, 2011); compared evidence available from qualitative versus quantitative primary
studies (Graham & McDermot, 2006); and examined the ability to use syntheses to inform decisionmaking (Boaz & Pawson, 2005; Braye & Preston-Shoot, 2007).
Littell (2008) evaluated reviews based on systematic review evaluation criteria (using the
structure of systematic review as a guide rather than a checklist. In the same study, Littell traced study
references through secondary reports of studies, finding a tendency towards “confirmation bias” or
simplification of complex studies, lack of attention to non-significant findings, and overstatement of
positive results. These findings largely agree with those of Hilgartner (1990), though there is no
evidence that Littell was aware of Hilgartner’s work. Boaz and Pawson (2005) obtain similar findings
through comparison of five approaches to synthesis to inform policy.
The issue of incorporating findings from qualitative studies in systematic reviews and to
inform practice and policy decisions was a central concern of two studies (Graham & McDermott,
2006; Taylor, Dempster, & Donnelly, 2007). Mullen and Shuluk (2011) examined reviews of social work
interventions, finding that “two-thirds of clients served by social workers benefit in measurable ways”
(p. 49), suggesting that “theoretical orientation does not account for differential outcomes” though

162

substantive issues such as interventions examined and populations targeted did lead to different
implications. The authors suggest increased emphasis on comparative effectiveness with different
populations in different contexts would be helpful.
A comparative meta-study (Lundahl & Yaffe, 2007) compared trends in the publication of
meta-analysis in Social Work and four ‘allied disciplines’: family studies, nursing, psychology, and
psychiatry. The authors examined whether articles reported meta-analyses, were methodologically
oriented, or discussed previous meta-analyses. Production of meta-analyses was found to lag behind
production in psychiatry, psychology, and nursing, but was slightly greater than the multi-disciplinary
field of family studies.
Littell and Shlonsky (2010), in a discussion of the role of research in policy contexts, disparage
many sources of evidence used in program evaluation, concluding, “much of what passes for empirical
knowledge about the effects of child welfare programs is not based on sound principles of research
synthesis. Instead, most sources of information on ‘programs that work’ are derived from
unsystematic, partial, and potentially biased summaries of research evidence” (p. 724). The authors go
on to compare evidence provided by Campbell and Cochrane reviews, before concluding with a
discussion of “evidence-informed decisions,” and the limitations of research to inform decisionmaking.
Discussion
Discussion of research synthesis was extensive. Discussion publications included book
reviews, introductions to special issues, comments and replies to comments on specific studies, and a
number of issues related to use of research synthesis methods in the field. Eight of forty-five studies

163

that discussed research synthesis but did not relate to the methods in other ways. These publications
reviewed monographs on the subject, including books on how to perform syntheses published by
Hunter (1982), the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (1998), Littell (2008), and Cooper
(2009); controversial issues associated with EBP in Mental Health;28 and the historical development of
family therapy practice, research, and research integration.29 Book reviews indicate monographic
content has been important to the development and diffusion of research synthesis methods in Social
Work; the variety of fields from which methods may have been imported (Organizational Studies,
Health Sciences, and Psychology); and that Social Work itself has contributed to the development of
methods texts (Littell, 2008b).
Three special issues related to research synthesis were introduced, first in the American
Journal of Community Psychology (1997) on meta-analysis of primary prevention programs for children
and adolescents; second, in the same journal, but focusing on a framework developed to integrate
work of researchers, practitioners, and funders (see Emshoff, 2008); and third, in the Clinical Social
Work Journal (2011) on EBP in clinical social work. While only the first of these focused specifically on
research synthesis, the methods were identified as an essential tool in the latter two. Research
synthesis in the context of EBP was discussed otherwise, including in editorials (Gambrill, 2003), and
in pedagogical (Gambrill, 2001; Howard, McMillen, & Pollio, 2003; Rubin & Parrish, 2007; Corcoran,
2007), policy (Gambrill, 2006), and practice (Hudson, 2009; Thyer & Myers, 2011) decision-making

2008), limitations of EBP (Aisenberg, 2008) and writing the history of evidence-based practice was
also discussed (Corcoran, 2007).
Discussion articles also comment on specific research syntheses (Cowen, 1997; Price, 1997;
Trickett, 1997; Weissberg & Bell, 1997; Kolbe, 1997; Hogarty, 1989; Miller, 2006; Drisko, 2011), including
on controversial subjects such as sexual reorientation therapy and DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance
Education) (West, 2000; Gorey & Leslie, 2001; Littell, 2006; Van den Noortgate, Geeraert, Grietens, &
Onghena, 2006; Pignotti & Mercer, 2007). Use of research synthesis across broad areas of application
was the focus of other discussion items (Rosenberg & Holden, 1999; Cowen 2000; Drisko, 2004).
Issues central to performing tasks integral to research synthesis were discussed broadly.
Mullen (2006) focused on selection of outcome measures. Lundahl and Yaffe (2008) discussed
methods and reporting practices associated with primary studies; and Soydan (2008), the need to
focus research efforts on interventions. Commentary on databases from which to retrieve studies for
syntheses emphasized the insufficiency of Social Work Abstracts and the need to search across
multiple databases (Holden & Barker, 1990; Gambrill, 2001).
Topics associated with research synthesis
Topics associated with research synthesis publications suggest broad engagement with
research synthesis across Social Work. Evidence-based practice, methodologies, and intervention
research are salient issues in Social Work. In Figure 30 these issues are represented by the topics
“practice evidence-bas”, “meta-analysis design result method”, “effect size meta-analysis”, “systematic
search database”, and “intervent treatment effect”. The prevalence of topics associated with practice

165

and EBP reflects the practice orientation of Social Work research (Anastas, 2000). EBP and RSM are
central to discussions about research-practice divides; and have been cast in opposition to
traditionally prevalent research approaches such as qualitative case studies (Herie & Martin, 2002),
which are difficult to systematically synthesize.

Figure 30. Topics associated with research synthesis in Social Work

Since the late 1990s, interest in intervention research, which is prototypically amenable to
synthesis methods, has emerged. Preventative programs (“program prevent”) and client services
(“service inform what client process”), which are linked to EBP, are also focal interests. Social work

166

topics subject to research synthesis include investigations of factors associated with un/successful
foster care experience (“child factor family”), child abuse (“abus sexual child”), issues related to family
structures (“children parent family”), and mental health (“health mental”). Preventative programs
(“program prevent”) and client services (“service inform what client process”), which is linked to EBP,
are also focal interests. Table J3 in Appendix J summarizes the most frequently occurring word stems
in each of the thirteen Social Work topics.
Impact: Shifts in practice
Though the first publications related to research synthesis methods in social work appeared
relatively early, in Clinical Social Work in 1977 and Family Coordinator in 1979, sustained engagement
did not occur until about twenty years later. The years initially examined to identify whether there
have been shifts in practice associated with the diffusion of research synthesis, 2006-2008, are well
beyond this period. A modest number of reviews and syntheses make up the dataset: 30 reviews and
45 research syntheses were found across all three years (Table 32.). The Wilcoxon and van Elteren
tests detected a difference in collaboration patterns associated with reviews versus syntheses, but not
a difference in receptivity based on citation patterns (Table 33).

Given the small number of reviews and research syntheses published in Social Work from
2006 to 2008, the observed difference in collaboration but not citation patterns, and that it was
feasible to collect and categorize reviews and syntheses published in 2009 and 2010, analysis of Social
Work papers was extended. A substantial number of research syntheses were identified for 2009 and
2010: Fifty-eight were added for a total of 103 syntheses across five years. Only 18 additional reviews
were added, for a total of 48 reviews across five years. The primary goals of an extended analysis were
to (1) learn whether the patterns observed for 2006 to 2008 would be observed through more recent
years; and (2) examine whether there was a trend in the number of reviews versus research syntheses
that were published across years. With continued diffusion of research synthesis, it would be expected
that more research syntheses would be published in later years. If research synthesis methods, in at
least some contexts, were used in lieu of traditional narrative review methods, we would expect the
relative number of reviews to decrease as the number of research syntheses increased.
These tests confirmed that collaboration patterns observed in 2006 to 2008 continued

168

through 2010. Testing with the Wilcoxon rank sum test, it was found that research syntheses were
more likely to be published in later years (W=3036, p = 0.0105), suggesting a trend towards increased
use of research synthesis methods and decreased use of traditional review methods in later years.
Taken together, the data indicate there has been a change in the practice of synthesizing research in
Social Work overall. In some contexts, researchers are more likely to use research synthesis methods
rather than traditional narrative reviews. Research synthesis is also likely to be a more collaborative
process. Though there has been a reduction in the number of narrative reviews over time, narrative
reviews, from the perspective of the audience of researchers who reference them, have not become
obsolete.
While Conservation Biology presented the case of a field relatively new to the evidence-based
movement, Social Work has engaged with the movement since at least 1989 (Hogarty, 1989).
Subsequent discussions of evidence-based practice (EBP) identify the potential, benefits, and
limitations of EBP – and of research syntheses as a basis for EBP. In some cases, authors are critical of
not only research synthesis studies, but also the primary studies that are synthesized. Critiques range
in tone, some suggesting the need for more research because, for example, the syntheses lack studies
across cultures and political geographies, while some criticize use of the research methods and
interpretations of synthesized research. More recently, exclusion of qualitative research from research
syntheses intended to influence practice and policy decisions has become a topic of discussion. For
example, Graham and McDermott (2006) write, “Qualitative research is ambiguously placed as a
source of evidence for policy. It provides a way of accessing the experiences and perspectives of those
targeted by welfare interventions, yet it is routinely excluded from the evidence reviews undertaken

169

to inform these interventions…” (p. 21). Researchers were interested in more than just the ability to
include findings from qualitative and process-oriented research: It was important to develop methods
to do so, tools to facilitate repeatability, and a level of agreement on use of these methods and tools.
Women’s studies
The interdisciplinary field of Women’s Studies emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s with
the feminist movement (Brooks & Hesse-Biber, 2007; Reynolds, Shagle, & Venkataraman, 2007), and
has retained an activist orientation (Arthur, 2009). Women’s Studies grew from a handful of courses in
the late 1969 to hundreds in 1971 (Stimpson, 1973). Integrated programs similarly expanded rapidly in
the United States, from the first in 1970 (San Diego State University, followed by Cornell University) to
150 by 1975 and nearly 650 by 2007 (Boxer, 2002; Reynolds, Shagle, & Venkataraman, 2007).
Institutionalization was aided through early establishment of journals, including the Women’s Studies
Quarterly in 1972 and Signs in 1975, and through philanthropical contributions, notably from the Ford
Foundation, which provided substantial funding for fellowships, research centers, and projects
beginning in 1972 (Hill, 1990), and the Rockefeller Foundation (Stimpson, 1973). In 1977, the National
Women’s Studies Association (NWSA) was created, providing an identity and institutional structure
for informal networks and communication practices (Arthur, 2009; Boxer, 1982; Toth, 1977).
As a field, Women’s Studies is concerned with race, gender, sexual orientation, class, and
other dimensions of identity and social relations, in the context of human experience.
Intersectionalities, or focus on experience at the intersection of multiple interrelating dimensions of
social identity has developed into an important focus since introduced in the 1990s (Shields, 2008).
The initial focus of courses on history, literature, and sociology expanded first to the other humanities

and social sciences; and more recently to science and technology fields (McFadden, 2005). The
phrase, “add women and stir,” has frequently emerged in discussion of new areas of scholarship,
though, as noted by Klein (1996), this countertop metaphor belies the complexities of scholarship
intended to transform established knowledge structures.
Women’s Studies scholars often have dual affiliation, with Women’s Studies and another
discipline both intellectually and in organizational structures (Boxer, 1982; Klein, 1996; Reynolds,
Shagle, & Venkataraman, 2007). A by-product of the multiple locations of Women’s Studies scholars is
a fragmented literature more suited to multiple classifications (Searing, 1992). Themes such as gender,
oppression, and the political nature of knowledge work unify the field. The greatest differences among
Women’s Studies scholars are expressed in the methods used. Research approaches span empirical,
critical, and interpretive approaches (Leckenby, 2007) and include methods such as survey research,
ethnography, in-depth interviewing, focus groups, and oral history (Hesse-Biber, 2007). Due to the
diversity of methods and approaches, “even when focused on the same topic, research results may be
disparate and incommensurable” (Klein, 1996, p. 121).
Findings: Research synthesis in the context of Women’s Studies
Of the thirty-eight journal titles listed in Women’s Studies in the 2012 Journal Citation Report
(JCR, Appendix H, Tables H3 and H4), only thirteen published at least one article related to research
synthesis methods. Approximately eighty percent of all publications are concentrated in just four
titles or 13 percent of all titles (Table 34). The relatively high Gini coefficient (0.869, Figure 31) reflects
an uneven distribution.

Figure 31. Women’s Studies: Distribution of publications across journals

Financial support was recognized by fifteen of 47 Women’s Studies publications judged to
have a primary or secondary relationship with research synthesis (31.91%). All of these papers were
published in the Journal of Women’s Health between 2009 and 2011. Thirteen reported a research

172

synthesis; one studied, developed methods, and developed resources related to research synthesis
methods; and one was judged to have a secondary relationship to research synthesis methods.
Knowledge Base
Women’s Studies references are relatively evenly distributed across fields, as indicated by
higher Shannon evenness (0.732, Table 35) and nodes that are more similar in size (Figure 32).
Women’s Studies seldom references work published in Women’s Studies journals (Figure 32, yellow
node with red ring). The juxtaposition of a concentration of research synthesis publications within a
few Women’s Studies journals with broad referencing patterns suggests Women’s Studies scholars
engage with content of other fields through research synthesis. The pattern echoes observations that
Women’s Studies scholars tend to have dual allegiances: to Women’s Studies and another field; and
the description of feminist scholarship as one that “simultaneously challenges and is shaped by
disciplinary inquiry” (Klein, 1996, p. 121).

Introduction
Hyde (1994) introduced meta-analysis through description of the process, review of metaanalytic studies of gender differences in psychology, and advocated use of quantitative methods such
as meta-analysis as well as qualitative methods to make “feminist transformations” in psychology.
Methods and Resources
Nowell and Hedges (1998) exploit procedures used to examine between study variance in
meta-analysis, and assess extreme scores to identify changes in gender differences over time reflected
in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) long term trend data. The authors frame their
discussion of meta-analysis and research on gender differences in the context of Women’s Studies
(especially research published in Sex Roles) and psychology and educational psychology more
broadly. Doull, Runnels, Tudiver, and Boscoe (2010) step towards integration of Sex and Gender-Based
Analysis (SGBA) in systematic reviews through application of the method via their newly developed
Sex and Gender Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews (SGAT-SR) to a sample of reviews on
175

interventions for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) from the Cochrane Library.
Studies and Evaluations of Research Synthesis
In addition to Doull and colleagues (2010), two studies evaluated whether gender differences
were considered in previous systematic reviews focused on cardiovascular disease. Johnson,
Karvonen, Phelps, Nader, and Sanborn (2003) examined systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library
for inclusion of women and gender-based data analyses. The authors found scant data available for
analysis. For systematic reviews in which gender-based data was available, about one third performed
analyses to examine gender differences. Also in 2003, Whitlock and Williams examined U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the Task Force on Community Preventive Services
(CTF) recommendations and the underlying systematic evidence reviews to assess the applicability of
the recommendations to women.
Discussion
Two early book reviews highlight methodological diversity within the field. Reviews of The
worth of women's work: A qualitative synthesis (Statham, Miller, & Mauksch, 1988, in Sokoloff, 1988 and
Royster & Allgeier, 1989) and The psychology of gender advances through meta-analysis (Hyde & Linn,
1986, in Falbo, 1988) were published in Sex Roles and the Psychology of Women Quarterly. Diversity is
further highlighted through discussions of the feminist critique as it relates to economics and
psychometric evaluations (Flynn, 1999); and constructive criticism of the Cochrane Library. In a 2003
review of cardiovascular disease, for example, Johnson and colleagues (2003) advise, “the Cochrane
Library would be a more useful tool for the evidence-based healthcare of women if the systematic
reviews used all available gender-specific information in their analyses” (p. 449).
176

Twenge (2011) discussed research she and her colleagues performed, beginning with work
from her time as a graduate student (Twenge, 1997a) and the method of “Cross-Temporal MetaAnalysis” (CTMA). Though in prior work included in the sample for this study (Twenge, 1997a;
Twenge, 1997b), the author did not highlight her carefully explicated methods as “new,” the discussion
article, written fourteen years later, does. Twenge writes, “Unlike a traditional meta-analysis, which
examines differences among groups across many scales, CTMA analyzes scores on only one scale at a
time” to examine generational differences (p. 194).
Other discussions focused on the role of meta-analysis in gender role research (Hyde, 1990;
Lewin & Wild, 1991; Eagly, 1994), and used meta-analytic studies to establish a baseline of what is
known (Rojahn & Willemsen, 1994; Cahan & Ganor, 1995). The importance of meta-analytical
research to gender-difference studies is highlighted by Hyde (1990) and Lewin and Wild (1991). Eagly
(1994), in a discussion of sex- and gender-difference research, identifies meta-analysis as an opportune
method to be used to examine and theorize why differences are observed between sexes/genders.
A news item, published in the Journal of Women’s Health in 1997 (Anonymous, 1998)
proclaimed, “Meta-analysis confirms relationship of alcohol to breast cancer,” reflecting the tendency
of publications removed from original research reports to simplify results such that they are
represented as more certain and precise (Hilgartner, 1990).
Topics associated with research synthesis in Women’s Studies
The limited range of topics and uneven distributions of content across topics provide
evidence of selective engagement with research synthesis in Women’s Studies. Research synthesis
publications are centered on research related to gender differences in psychology and related fields;

177

women’s health; and methodological issues (Figure 34). Psychology topics include work and
leadership (“work role leadership”), gender differences and stereotypes, and abilities linked with sex
such as spatial navigation (“differ sex abil”). Women’s health issues include breast cancer,
mammography, reproductive issues, and conditions not specific to females. Topics that link healthoriented and psychological gender-oriented research include those focused on literature and
synthesis (“research literature review”, “health review articl systemat guidelin”), and methods (e.g.,
“function sampl”), though topic locations reveal emphases on different methods topics in health
versus psychology fields. For example, “test hypothesi measure” is embedded in psychology topics;
and interventions and guidelines are associated with health topics. In aggregate, topics emphasize the
diversity of literature included in “Women’s Studies,” though this apparent diversity is constrained to
primarily health and psychology – the much broader field of Women’s Studies is not represented.
Table J4 in Appendix J summarizes the most frequently occurring word stems in each of the seventeen
Women’s Studies topics.

Impact: Shifts in practice
In Women’s Studies, the first publication related to research synthesis appeared in 1985 in the
psychology literature, and 1998 in the health sciences. Engagement with the methods remained
modest, but became more prevalent in 2003 and expanded again in 2009. The years examined to
identify shifts in practice associated with use of research synthesis methods fall between these two
periods of expansion. From 2006 to 2008, 23 research syntheses and 23 research reviews were
identified (Table 37).

179

No difference in collaboration patterns was detected in reviews versus research synthesis
(Table 38). Both the Wilcoxon and van Elteren tests detected a difference in subsequent use of
research syntheses versus reviews: Research syntheses are more cited than reviews.

Few studies in Women’s Studies used research synthesis methods. Those that did drew on
forms prevalent in intersecting fields (psychology and health) to synthesize research from these fields
using methods prevalent in the fields. The Women’s Studies syntheses take an activist stance and
demonstrate how a feminist perspective has or can contribute to research in these fields (e.g.,
psychology); or, alternatively, to emphasize that there is a need for greater attention to gender
differences when systematically reviewing and synthesizing past studies (e.g., in health sciences). This
approach reflects the nature of Women’s Studies, which is a relatively young field without a deep
archive of data or literature of its own to synthesize; identified as having an activist approach (Boxer,
1982; Klein, 1996); and in which scholars work at the intersection of Women’s Studies topics and

180

another field. The activist stance is exemplified by engagement with research of intersecting fields to
communicate the value of the alternative lens Women’s Studies; and to comment on prior research
not compatible with addressing interests of diverse populations. Modest use of research synthesis
methods may derive from preferences for qualitative, interpretive, and critical research methods in
Women’s Studies more broadly.
Information and Library Science
Information and Library Science (ILS) is alternatively described as two disciplines,
Information Science and Library Science (Saracevic, 1992), one discipline, Library and Information
Science with subfields (Åström, 2010), or one discipline, Information Science, with applied
dimensions that include Library Science (e.g., Ingwersen, 1992). A third strand, Documentation,
traditionally has been neglected in the United States but is recognized for close association with
science information (Buckland, 1996); and a fourth, Archival Science, traditionally has been located
between the constellation of information, library, and documentation fields, and history. Important
developments in the field, or conglomeration of subfields (Baccini & Barabesi, 2011) include the
institutionalization of Library Science as a research field through the establishment of the Graduate
Library School (GLS) at the University of Chicago in 1928 with funding from the Carnegie Corporation
(Anderson, 1963; Buckland, 1996; Burke, 2007); the rise of information science, especially in the postWorld War II era, which diversified both resources available and research application contexts (Burke,
2007; Bonaccorsi, 2010); and the growth of interest in and recognition of technology as an integral
component of professional and research problems (Bowles, 1989).
Though library training predates its presence in the academy (Heim, 1986), as is the case with

181

many professions, professional training of librarians has been an important component of the
academic presence of ILS programs even before the GLS was established (Martin, 1994; Heim, 1986;
Lynch, 2008). Despite early similarities in the development of training programs for Social Work and
Librarianship, including uneasy relationships between research and practice (Heim, 1986; Webb,
2001), subsequent developments in the fields and their social and political contexts have led to vastly
different outcomes. The primacy of librarian training has waned with increasing emphasis on
‘information’ in society and increasingly diverse information professions, ILS faculty, students, and
programs (see, e.g., Abbott, 1998; Bobinski, 1986; Marchionini & Moran, 2012; Lynch, 2008).
Areas of research in information and library science have proliferated, but broadly focus on
access to information across time, space, and other barriers; information organization and
representation; social and organizational contexts; human interactions with information; political
and economic aspects of information; and development, design, and use of information services and
technologies in these contexts. ILS research has at times been data-driven (Ingwersen, 1998), and
generally viewed as not having a deep field-specific theoretical tradition (Fisher, Erdelez, &
McKechnie, 2005; Kumasi, Charbonneau, & Walster, 2013; Pettigrew & McKechnie, 2001). Like other
fields surveyed here, approaches, methods, and measures in ILS research are diverse (e.g., Jarvelin, &
Vakkari, 1990; Eldredge, 2004; Ford, 2000); and preferred approaches tend to vary with specialism.
Though the contributions of information and library scientists to the conduct of research
syntheses is recognized frequently outside the field, research synthesis has been neglected in ILS
literatures (Hjørland 2001, 2002). Exceptions include ILS communities associated with health and
medical information, and the evidence based librarianship (EBL) movement (e.g., Evidence Based

182

Library and Information Practice). White, a contributor to a handbook for research synthesis (1994,
2009), which he describes as one of his most-cited works (2002), observed that the apparent lack of
attention to RSM may be due to the publication venues authors select. ILS authors may be more likely
to publish research synthesis-related work in venues read by those who use RSM in other fields.
Findings: Research synthesis in the context of Information and Library Science
Publications related to research synthesis methods were found in 46 of the 84 titles listed in
the JCR ISLS category in 2012. Early publications were found scattered throughout a number of
journals (e.g., College & Research Libraries, 1985; Behavioral & Social Sciences Librarian, 1988, and
Journal of Documentation, 1989). The journals that publish the greatest number of publications are
associated with the health and medical sciences. Scientometrics and Management titles have several
publications. The distribution of publications across journal titles approximates the 80/20 rule: About
80 percent of all RSM publications were found in 18% of ILS titles (Gini coefficient = 0.796; Figure 35).
Journal titles with the greatest number of publications are listed in Table 39.

Financial support was recognized in fourteen of the 111 Information and Library Science
publications (12.61%). Of these, ten reported a research synthesis (eight in the Journal of the American

research synthesis (two in JAMIA, and one in Social Science Computer Review); and one, which was
judged to have a secondary relationship to research synthesis was published in Aslib Proceedings.
Funding for these papers was provided by multiple organizations in Australia, Canada, the United
Kingdom, the United States; and also by organizations in Colombia, Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan, and
an Ibero-American association. The full list of funding organizations is presented in Appendix I, Table
I6.
Knowledge Base
The 293 Information and Library Science papers judged to have a primary or secondary
relationship with research synthesis methods collectively reference journal publications that were
associated with 5175 counts across S/SCI categories (Table 40). ILS publications reference publications
in the field (Figure 36, pink node with red ring) and draw extensively from other fields. Publications
from a large number of fields (136) are referenced, including from Clinical Medicine and Business and
Management fields. The distribution of references across fields is relatively uneven (Shannon
evenness = 0.678), and fields referenced are relatively dissimilar (Rao-Stirling diversity = 0.752).

Modes of engagement with research synthesis in ILS
Publications in ISLS demonstrate that researchers engage with research synthesis in a variety
of ways (Table 41; Figure 37). More than anything, researchers apply research synthesis methods (135
records, or 54.2%). Following use, publications that discuss the methods (80 items, or 32.1%) and
those that contribute to methods development were most common (37 studies, or 14.9%).

Introductions
The first items related to research synthesis within the ISLS category appeared in 1985, only
nine years after Glass’s (1976) article that introduced “meta-analysis” to a wide audience. Of these
articles, one (Schell & Rathe, 1992) introduced readers of the Bulletin of the Medical Library Association
to meta-analysis and predicted that medical librarians would play a significant role in the future
application of this “tool for medical and scientific discoveries” (p. 219). Trahan (1993), drawing on past
commentary to disparage library research as “often repetitive descriptive studies with little
cumulation” (p. 73), presents meta-analysis as a method that might address these shortcomings, and
also provide the opportunity to conduct research relevant to library practice. The introduction
includes a description of ‘meta-analysis’ and describes implementation of a ‘pilot study’ published
elsewhere. A third introduction (Tsuda & Muranushi, 1994), published in Japanese but for which an
English abstract is available, examines three recently published reviews on the information needs and

187

information seeking behavior of clinicians according to standards for systematic reviews. Mead and
Richards (1995) and Smith (1996) introduce research synthesis as a collaborative research endeavor for
which librarians may occupy a critical role in the context of interdisciplinary research teams. Hwang
(1996) describes meta-analysis and its limitations in the context of MIS research, approximately four
years after the first application of meta-analysis in MIS captured in this study (Alavi & Joachimsthaler,
1992), on psychological factors associated with decision support system (DSS) implementation
success.
Alavi and Joachimsthaler (1992) published a meta-analysis in MIS Quarterly, which found that
user-situational variables were more important than psychological factors to decision support system
(DSS) implementation success. Alavi and Joachimsthaler drew on research synthesis methods from
education and psychology, primarily from the early 1980s (1980-1985), including those by researchers
considered RSM pioneers such as Gene Glass, Harris Cooper, Robert Rosenthal, and Donald Rubin.
The authors included an extended discussion of meta-analytic techniques both within the paper and
in an appendix. Bibliographic information for the thirty-three studies that were summarized in the
meta-analysis was included in an appendix rather than the list of references. Nearly a decade later,
Ankem (2005) and Saxton (2006) introduced the methods again, stressing the special context of
research in Information and Library Science. Finally, Urquhart (2011) reported endeavors in
Information and Library Science sub-fields related to research synthesis, and introduced and
demonstrated use of two meta-synthesis methods suitable for syntheses of more heterogeneous
primary research studies.

188

Methods
Publications that contributed to methods ranged from those that adapted the method, such as
in the case of the development of a meta-evaluation method (Edler, Ebersberger, & Lo, 2008); to a
great number of articles that focused on developing data collection strategies (i.e., search strategies
and tools) and data evaluation (e.g., text classification methods).
Research reported in ILS literature contributed to development of methods to synthesize
research in other fields via scientometric approaches, search, and machine learning. Search strategies
and methods (Boynton, Glanville, McDaid, and Lefebvre, 1998; Helmer, Savoie, Green, and Kazanjian,
2001; Wong, Wilczynski, & Haynes, 2006; Sampson, McGowan, Cogo, & Horsley, 2006; Booth, 2006;
Glanville, Lefebvre, Miles, & Camosso-Stefinovic, 2006; Golder, Mcintosh, Duffy, & Glanville, 2006;
Eisinga, Siegfried, & Clarke, 2007; Golder, Mason, & Spilsbury, 2008; Chapman, Morgan, & Gartlehner,
2010), including search filter development (Ritchie, Glanville, & Lefebvre, 2007; McKibbon,
Wilczynski, Haynes & Hedges, 2009; Pienaar, Grobler, Busgeeth, Eisinga, & Siegfried, 2011) and
application of search filters in new contexts (Hoogendam, Robbe, Stalenhoef, & Overbeke, 2009)
constitute topics of frequent inquiry in the context of medical and health science and services
research. From a related perspective, Golder and Loke (2009) evaluated relative availability of
information on adverse effects from a variety of information resources. In work that contributes to
methods and resources, Booth (2006) studied search methods and developed an approach, STARLITE
(sampling strategy, type of study, approaches, range of years, limits, inclusion and exclusions, terms
used, electronic sources) for qualitative systematic reviews. One study (Papaioannou, Sutton, Carroll,
Booth, & Wong, 2010) focused on search across several fields, including the social sciences,

189

information and library science, education, and health.
From a machine learning approach, studies focused on developing automatic classification
methods to reduce workloads associated with initial evaluation of primary research (Cohen, Hersh,
Peterson, and Yen, 2006; Matwin, Kouznetsov, Inkpen, Frunza, & O'Blenis, 2010; Cohen, 2011; Matwin,
Kouznetsov, Inkpen, Frunza, & O'Blenis, 2011) and prioritize studies (Cohen, Ambert, & McDonach,
2009) for evaluation in the context of systematic reviews. Ananiadou, Rea, Okazaki, Procter, and
Thomas (2009) described the application of text mining approaches to aid search, screening,
mapping, and synthesis processes in systematic reviews.
Rivas et al. (1998) developed and tested Information Synthesis and Validity Analysis (ISVA),
which integrates meta-analysis with education and communications theories and literature
management technologies. ISVA was intended to synthesize knowledge and facilitate development of
research questions in the context of interdisciplinary problem-focused research. Also from a
scientometrics perspective, Porter, Kongthon, and Lui (2002) describe “research profiling” to perform
broad literature scans to discover topical relationships, research trends, and complementary
approaches and technologies to contextualize research synthesis, an approach extended and more
explicitly tied to systematic review processes in Porter, Schoeneck, Roessner and Garner (2010).
Methods developed for ILS include meta-evaluation approaches in the context of policy
interventions (Edler, Ebersberger, & Lo, 2008; Hyvärinen, 2011); research focused on modification of
hierarchies of evidence as applied in the medical and health sciences for library and information
science research (Law, 2005; Booth, 2010); and an approach to evaluate primary studies (Williams,
Nicholas, & Rowlands, 2010). MIS researchers developed meta-analytic techniques to assess

190

contribution of study methods to differences observed between studies in syntheses of correlation
research (Sharma, Yetton, & Crawford, 2009) and a framework for syntheses intended for
interdisciplinary contexts when a broad selection of research is potentially of interest (Jahangirian et
al., 2011). In an innovative application of methods, Brown (2008) combined systematic review of
research and review and content analysis of news content to reveal that though the “freshman fifteen”
is a popular topic in the media, research shows it is an exaggeration. McGrath (1996) argued that
terminology and definition of units of analysis in scientometrics research was inconsistent and should
be attended to more carefully by researchers in order to facilitate synthesis of research.
Resources
In addition to search filters, ILS researchers have developed a variety of resources to support
conduct of systematic reviews. McKibbon, Wilczynski, Hayward, Walkerdilks, and Haynes (1995)
review resources developed by the Health Information Research Unit of McMaster University Faculty
of Health Sciences to facilitate EBP, including user guides, search tools, and abstract guidelines. Other
resources developed include data extraction tools (Balas, Stockham, Mitchell, Austin, West, &
Ewigman, 1996); a checklist to help design and evaluate search filters (Glanville et al., 2008); a critical
appraisal instrument to aid selection of search filters (Bak, Mierzwinski-Urban, Fitzsimmons,
Morrison, & Maden-Jenkins, 2009); a data registry (Balas et al., 1995); a preliminary tool and design
principles to support collaborative information synthesis (Blake & Pratt, 2002; Blake & Pratt, 2006b);
and conceptual frameworks to translate research-based knowledge for use in decision-making
(Haynes, Hayward, & Lomas, 1995). Based on examination of moderator analysis in past research,
Hwang and Schmidt (2011) developed guidelines for Information Systems researchers conducting

191

moderator analyses in meta-analytic studies.
Research focused on data sources included one study that examined electronic database and
grey literature sources for systematic reviews intended to inform pharmaceutical policy (Greyson,
2010); and sources of evidence available for evidence-based librarianship were examined by Sampson,
Daniel, Cogo, & Dingwall, (2008). Web applications to interface with PubMed and facilitate search,
organization, and preliminary analysis of results were reviewed by Michan-Aguirre, Calderon-Rojas,
Nitxin-Castaneda-Sortibran, and Rodriguez-Arnaiz (2011). Focus on information resources for health
and biomedicine included evaluation of regional (Abhijnhan, Surcheva, Wright, & Adams, 2007;
Waffenschmidt, Hausner, Kaiser, 2010) and other databases (Brettle & Long, 2001; Alpi, 2005; Falzon
& Trudeau, 2007) for use in systematic reviews. Professional search skills for public health (Alpi, 2005)
and development of medical students for finding and interpreting systematic reviews and metaanalyses also received attention (Wolf, Miller, Gruppen, & Ensminger, 1997; Ojasoo, Maisonneuve, &
Dore, 2001).
Studies and Evaluations of Research Synthesis
In addition to studies performed primarily to develop methods and resources for research
synthesis, studies focused on research synthesis in the health and biomedical sciences, information
and library science, and the social sciences. The earliest study (Hjørland, 1988) examined information
retrieval methods used in a Swedish dissertation in psychology as a case study, with the goal of
“promoting the necessary change in the perception of information retrieval and literature work in
psychology” (p. 40).
Subsequent studies focused on search and retrieval include several in the health sciences:

192

Wright and McDaid (2011) examined the visibility of article retractions in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
CENTRAL. An audit of study retrieval strategies reported in a sample of meta-analyses published 19962002 and indexed in MEDLINE were examined to determine the extent to which search strategies and
their effectiveness were reported, finding that three fourths reported search strategies, but only 6.7
percent strategy effectiveness. In response to a similar question, Yoshii, Plaut, McGraw, Anderson, and
Wellik (2009) examined the extent to which Cochrane Reviews adhered to search and retrieval
reporting guidelines specified in the Cochrane Handbook. Use of systematic review versus a
previously proposed abbreviated method reliant on literature search and expert opinion to update
clinical guidelines was examined, finding the latter approach acceptable when the research process
was refined by involvement of librarians (Voisin, de la Varre, Whitener, Gartlehner, 2008). Golder and
Loke (2009) performed a systematic review of studies of searches for adverse effects data for
systematic reviews.
Use of appraisal instruments was considered by Booth (2007). The extent of use of research
synthesis in health journals was examined in 2001 (McKibbon, Wilczynski, & Haynes, 2001); and the
role of librarians in health science systematic review research was examined in case studies (Harris,
2005; Swinkels, Briddon, & Hall, 2006). Blake and Pratt (2006a), through situated observation of and
interviews with participants in a collaborative research synthesis of biomedical studies, developed the
Collaborative Information Synthesis model. Grant and Booth (2009) developed a typology of reviews
through a review of information and library science reviews; and Khoo, Na, and Jaidka (2011)
investigated the structure of literature reviews, with the goal of developing automatic summarization
techniques to work towards automatic production of literature reviews.

193

Discussion
Publications that discussed research synthesis methods but did not relate to the methods in
other ways included four book reviews. In 1985, Light and Pillemer’s Summing up: The science of
reviewing research was reviewed in College & Research Libraries. Other reviews featured books on
meta-analysis (Rosenthal, 1991) in the Library Quarterly (1993), and literature reviews (Fink, 2005;
Fink, 2010) in Information Research (2005) and Library & Information Science Research (2010).
Editorials highlighted news related to research synthesis in medicine, including on a breakthrough
related to risk factors for vascular disease achieved through meta-analysis in the Scientist (1997) and a
comment about a report in BMJ on the value of librarians for Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses.
In 2007, MIS Quarterly announced the establishment of the MISQ Theory and Review
Department, indicating that comprehensive syntheses of previously published research with strong
theoretical implications were welcomed (Markus & Saunders, 2007). Evidence provided via a
systematic literature review was used to perform a meta-study on a popular topic associated with
collaboration in the European Journal of Information Systems (2010); and a guest editorial in Library &
Information Science Research discussed the “scientification” of the literature review, arguing that art
should also contribute (Dilevko, 2007).
Letters discussed publication bias and clinical trial registries (Adams, 1998); and the
relationship between Information and Library Science research and research synthesis methods
(Hjørland, 2001; White, 2002; Hjørland, 2002). The extent to which Information and Library Science
research can and does contribute to research synthesis methods, and the visibility of publications in
the field versus in the literature of other fields were prominent topics in the exchange between

194

Hjørland and White. In the medical librarianship literature, Santesso (2004) wrote to respond to a
critique of documentation of a Cochrane review search strategy – agreeing that documentation is
appropriate, but critique of the given review was not.
Topics in publications
Information and Library Science topics reflect contributions of the field to use of the methods
in other fields, especially medicine and the health sciences, and indicate a few lines of research that
have been the subject of research syntheses (Figure 38). Topics such as “Search Eval & Filters”,
“Databases, Search & Retrieval”, and “Text Classification” align with papers that investigate, evaluate,
and discuss search and retrieval for research synthesis studies and literature resources. Similarly, the
“Text classification” topic includes papers that report machine learning and text analysis techniques
developed to reduce the workload associated with research synthesis methods.
The topic “EBM/EBP” intersects publications associated with evidence-based medicine and
evidence-based librarianship. Associations with medical and health research are reflected in the
topics “Clinics & Patient Care”, “Patient Care”, and “Med Lit”. Medical topics are associated with
research synthesis studies on topics such as physician preferences for information sources and health
information systems in addition to literature on development of methods and resources for
application of research synthesis in the medical and health science fields.

195

Figure 38. Topics associated with research synthesis in Information and Library Science

196

The “Librar* & Services” topic is associated with studies designed to integrate library service
studies. “Diffusion” is dominated by health campaign studies; and “Meta-Research” includes
bibliometric research and self-studies in journals associated with MIS. “Theories & Models” likewise
intersects LIS and MIS publications, and includes models of information behavior and the Technology
Acceptance Model. “Systems and Technologies” is related to systems and technologies associated with
performing research synthesis; and system and technology-related interests that research synthesis is
used to study. Table J5 in Appendix J summarizes the most frequently occurring word stems in each of
the fifteen Information and Library Science topics.
Impact: Shifts in practice
Information and Library Science researchers first became aware of research synthesis
methods in the 1980s and 1990s, long before the years examined to identify shifts in collaboration and
reviewing practices. Given the emphasis on work intended to facilitate use of research synthesis
methods in the health and medical sciences and concentration of publications in health science
journals, however, it would be difficult to describe the methods as having been broadly adopted in the
field.
Between 2006 and 2008, 54 research syntheses and 92 reviews were identified (Table 42).
Research reviews in ILS appear to adhere closely to the traditional model of single-author reviews
(Table 43). Slightly larger groups collaborated in research synthesis studies. Based on citations,
subsequent use of research synthesis studies was substantially lower compared to reviews. These
findings suggest that research synthesis publications were not as integral to the field as a whole when
compared to traditional reviews, though some research synthesis publications are relatively highly

197

cited. This finding suggests that some sectors of ILS may share Dilevko’s (2007) perspective, that art is
a valuable component of literature review. Alternatively, given that reviews are generally performed
by one or two authors, experience or prestige may play a role in reviewer selection or self-selection;
and, given the small number of review publications in the field’s journal literature, broader, less
specific traditional research reviews may offer a more pragmatic approach to collocating and
interpreting past research.

Though the majority of publications in ILS were applications of research synthesis, the uneven
distribution of research synthesis publications overall suggests that subfields vary greatly with respect
to the extent the methods are used. Overall, research synthesis methods are not widely used; and, as a
field, ILS researchers tend to use reviews more than research syntheses. Given that research syntheses
are generally considered more laborious to perform compared to reviews, and that use of the methods
in ILS is associated with greater levels of collaboration, these patterns suggest that, when

198

benchmarked against traditional literature reviews, researchers are generally not highly rewarded for
research synthesis studies.
ILS engages with research synthesis methods in a variety of modes, which reflects the “metadisciplinary” nature of the field. The subset of ILS associated with health and medical information and
libraries has made substantial contributions to the practice of research synthesis in those fields,
especially in areas related to search and information resources. Additionally, use of text analysis and
machine learning techniques to support syntheses in the health and medical sciences has been
investigated. Research synthesis studies within the field are more prevalent in literatures related to
health, Management Information Systems (MIS), and more recently, Scientometrics.
Contexts of diffusion: Cross-field comparison
The fields examined in Stages II and III were diverse: Two life sciences, two social sciences,
and Information and Library Science. Comparison across fields provides the opportunity to examine
differences that may have influenced the extent to which each of the fields adopted research synthesis
methods; identify key field characteristics that may have modified diffusion; and identify
characteristics that may be associated with changes in research practices as reflected in collaboration
and citation patterns.
Examination at the field level suggested that Social Work has adopted research synthesis
methods, especially in the form of systematic reviews. In contrast to the dominant view in clinical
medicine, it appears that adoption of research synthesis methods in Social Work has refined rather
than replaced the role of traditional reviews. Conservation Biology appears to have been moving in
the direction of adoption during the period examined, 2006-2008. In Women’s Studies, researchers

199

selectively use research synthesis to comment on and critique research in the subfields of Women’s
Studies that intersect psychology and the health sciences.
Though the evidence contributed by this study is less clear, it appears that Evolutionary
Biology selectively uses meta-analysis as a tool to increase statistical power, analyze potential
moderators, and traverse phylogenetic heterogeneity. To an extent, subfields of Information and
Library Science associated with the health sciences and Management Information Science adopted
research synthesis methods. Other subfields, including applied librarianship and informetrics have
used the methods on occasion. Information and Library Science has engaged with the methods to a
greater extent to support use of the methods in other fields, primarily the health and medical
sciences. Traditional literature reviews were more integral to the field as a whole during the years in
which ‘impact’, or shifts in practice, was examined (2006-2008).
Modes of engagement with research synthesis methods
The proportions of publications that reflected engagement with research synthesis by modes
considered in this study varied across fields (Table 44; Figure 39). Across all fields, reports of studies in
which research synthesis methods were used was the most frequent mode of engagement. Considered
as a proportion of all publications with a primary relation to research synthesis, those that reported
research synthesis studies ranged from 54.22% in Information and Library Science to 85.71% in
Conservation Biology. Relative proportions of other modes of engagement varied by field, but were
generally most prevalent in Information and Library Science. Exceptions include “Other” publication
types in Evolutionary Biology, and discussions in Social Work.

Introductions
Research synthesis methods were introduced multiple times in Evolutionary Biology, Social
Work, and Information and Library Science. In Evolutionary Biology, introductions varied in form
from instance to instance. First, the methods were briefly introduced in the context of a discussion of
field experiments; second, the methods were the focus of an article; and third, the authors
demonstrated use of the methods when reporting results of a study. Some of the same variety was
observed in Social Work, but authors also focused on different forms of research synthesis methods,
and use of the methods in the practice context. Journals within the Social Work category reflect both
applied characteristics of the field, and differences in orientation and topics of interest across
researchers. While use of the methods immediately followed introductions in Evolutionary Biology, a
lag between first introductions and use was apparent in Social Work. This lag may be a reflection of
the lack of compatibility between the methods as first introduced, and Social Work research broadly.
It is possible that the time lag necessitated subsequent introductions because early introductions
were, in a sense, forgotten in the archives.
202

Introductions in Information and Library Science included the variety observed in Social
Work. Subfields such as Management Information Science and health and medical librarianship each
had their own introductions, and introductions were presented in the context of the applied nature of
the field. The potential for ILS researchers and practitioners to contribute to research synthesis
studies in health and medical sciences was of special interest. Additionally, different forms of research
synthesis were introduced to resistant subfields by researchers whose work overlaps with fields in
which the methods were prevalent (e.g., Ankem, 2005; Urquhart, 2011).
Introductions in Conservation Biology and Women’s Studies were rare. In the case of
Conservation Biology, it appears that communication with other fields and research interests that cut
across biological science fields may have provided familiarity with meta-analysis in particular. Pullin
and Stewart reframed and reintroduced research synthesis, as systematic review, in 2006. This
reintroduction cast the purpose of the methods directly in the context of evidence-based practice, and
framed practice in the health sciences as a model to emulate and adapt to Conservation Biology.
In Women’s Studies, it appears that researchers became familiar with the methods primarily
in the context of intersecting fields. The contrast in engagement with research synthesis by
researchers aligned with psychology and other social sciences and those in the health sciences reflects
this. Research synthesis appeared first in the psychological literature and was more closely related to
meta-analysis; while health science publications were more closely associated with systematic review.
Some researchers in the social science sectors of Women’s Studies wrote to legitimize use of
quantitative meta-analysis in the field. Such methods are sometimes interpreted as androcentric, and
therefore in need of critical examination.

203

Discussions
Following reports of research synthesis studies, discussion of research synthesis methods was
the second most frequent mode in which authors engaged with the methods (range: 14.73%-33.10%
across fields). Discussions ranged broadly. Evolutionary Biology, Conservation Biology, and Social
Work scholars engaged in discussions and debates about specific studies. These discussions were
most prevalent in Evolutionary Biology. Evolutionary Biologists’ discussion items often included
analysis or re-analysis of studies, sometimes with additional data. Such discussion likely reflects a
greater degree of field-level coherence and shared expectations compared to fields in which
discussions were not observed, including Women’s Studies and Information and Library Science.
Discussion in Evolutionary Biology also reflected selective use or emphasis on some elements of
research synthesis. Several comments centered on selection of data for syntheses, and presented reanalysis with additional data, leading to different conclusions.
Broader discussions of the methods were observed in Social Work, Information and Library
Science, and Conservation Biology. In Social Work, a number of authors discussed the fit of the
methods in the context of research in the field. Discussions of this type occurred in Information and
Library Science to a lesser extent, reflecting the overall lower engagement with the methods in ILS.
Social Work discussions also focused on selection of research for research synthesis studies that were
subsequently used to inform policy discourses. Discussion of this type emerged in Conservation
Biology in more recent years.
In Social Work, Information and Library Science, and Conservation Biology, discussions and
research focused on research synthesis in practice contexts was prevalent. In Information and Library

204

Science, two practice contexts were considered – practice in relation to contributing to systematic
reviews in the health sciences, and practice in the context of informing library decisions. The former,
perhaps more successful context of engagement with the methods, was more prevalent in the study
dataset. Difficulties associated with translating research into practice contexts occupied Social Work
researchers, and emerged in Conservation Biology. Researchers in both Social Work and Conservation
Biology investigated and discussed questions related to the lack of use of research in decision-making
and lack of research that can inform professional and policy decision-making. Drawing on general
findings to inform specific cases was identified as a difficulty in Social Work practice.
Other
“Other” modes of engagement with research synthesis methods noted include use of the metaanalysis within the context of single studies that included multiple experimental treatments or
species, and discussion of use of the methods in pedagogical contexts. Use of meta-analysis within
studies was most prevalent in Evolutionary Biology, but also observed in Conservation Biology and
promoted in the context of Single System Design studies in Social Work. Social Work authors were
interested in incorporating material about research synthesis as it relates to evidence based practice
in educational contexts, and in teaching use of the methods. In contrast, incorporation of metaanalysis in training of Evolutionary Biology and likely Conservation Biology students has been limited
(Koricheva, Gurevitch, & Mengersen, 2013). In Information and Library Science, articles focused on
teaching medical students to read and find studies, and librarians to search for primary studies for
systematic reviews conducted in other fields.

205

Extent of diffusion within research fields
Comparison of the relative distributions of research synthesis publications across journals, as
summarized by the Gini coefficient, and in the context of when research synthesis first appeared in
the fields underscores field-level differences (Table 45; Figure 40). Engagement with research
synthesis methods was most pervasive in Social Work, and most uneven in Women’s Studies.
Engagement with the methods in Evolutionary Biology, Conservation Biology, and Information and
Library Science is relatively unbalanced, and approximates the eighty-twenty rule. The more recent
appearance of the methods in the biological sciences and relatively consistent increases in use (Figure
41), suggests adoption of the methods has been relatively smooth in the biological sciences compared
to Women’s Studies and Information and Library Science.

Contrasts between fields become clearer when the relative timing of first engagement with
research synthesis methods is considered (Table 45). While the Social Sciences and Information and
Library Science first engaged with research synthesis methods in the 1970s and 1980s, the Life Sciences
did not engage with the methods until the 1990s. The timing suggests the diffusion process is at an
earlier stage in the biological sciences, and therefore we should expect less even distribution of
research synthesis publications across biological science journals. Gini coefficients should be
interpreted in light of these expectations. Comparison of the relative levels and modes of engagement
with research synthesis over time provides greater contrast (Figure 41).

Key: Modes of Engagement

Figure 41. Timing, extent, and modes of engagement with research synthesis methods
Publication Year

Use of the methods in Evolutionary Biology is marked by a relatively steady increase over the
years from the time it first appeared in the 1990s, though this use is somewhat overstated due to
ecological meta-analyses published in shared venues (e.g., TREE, American Naturalist). A number of
primary studies used meta-analytic techniques within the primary research studies (coded as “other”

208

mode of engagement in the chart). In Conservation Biology, engagement with the methods occurred
slightly after and at a pace similar to Evolutionary Biology, though the increase in use was steeper in
later years. A few studies in Conservation Biology used meta-analytic techniques within the context of
primary studies. Patterns in the Social Sciences are more diverse: Social Work engaged with the
methods to a much greater extent in all modes compared to Women’s Studies. Information and
Library Science became aware of the methods relatively early, but engaged to a greater extent only
after the advent of the evidence-based medicine movement in the 1990s. Use of the methods became
more prevalent in the mid-2000s.
Resources
Resources associated with the diffusion of research synthesis methods include research
funding, organizations that more directly support use and development of the methods, and
availability of information infrastructures such as databases that contain information about primary
studies to be synthesized (Table 46). When engagement with research synthesis methods first began
in the fields examined, none had a primary literature resource that was considered sufficient to
identify primary studies. Though Social Work Abstracts is a prominent (U.S.) resource for Social Work
literature, several studies indicated use of Social Work Abstracts alone was inadequate. Researchers in
Conservation Biology emphasized the diverse locations of materials that might be synthesized. In
addition to information in the research literature, conservation organizations, governmental bodies,
and biological institutions such as zoos and botanical gardens, might possess information that could
contribute to research syntheses.

In Social Work, the Campbell Collaboration, established in 2000, was an important resource.
High profile researchers, including Littell, advocated for use of Campbell Collaboration resources and
use of research synthesis methods in the form of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Additionally,
the Campbell Collaboration provided training and educational resources. The Center for
Environmental Evidence (CEE), established in 2003 and modeled after the Cochrane Collaboration,
similarly appears to be rising in importance in relation to the use of research synthesis methods in
Conservation Biology. Since establishment of CEE, there has been an increase in use of research
synthesis methods. While work before the establishment of CEE primarily discussed research
synthesis in terms of meta-analysis, terminology has shifted. Pullin and colleagues began advocating
for “systematic reviews”, shifting emphasis away from statistical techniques and towards concepts
related to evidence-based practice, including the search for all available evidence. Unlike the
Campbell Collaboration, CEE is not directly affiliated with the Cochrane Collaboration, and therefore
likely realizes benefits from this established example less directly.

210

The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) supports “synthetic” research in
Evolutionary Biology. Unlike the Campbell Collaboration and CEE, however, NESCent supports a
broader profile of research. The concept of synthesis has a rich history in the field, and directly
resulted in the emergence of Evolutionary Biology through the Modern Synthesis. Similarly, synthesis
in the field is interpreted as including not only integration across research, but also integration across
fields and specialties. Sidlauskas et al. (2010) defined synthesis as the integration of concepts,
research, methods, and data across and within fields. Projects supported by NESCent reflect this
broader conceptualization. Though NESCent is oriented towards synthesis more broadly, the Center
has supported projects led by prominent methodologists, including Jessica Gurevitch and Jason
Hoekstra. Mark Lajeunesse, a leader in phylogenetic meta-analysis, was a post-doctoral scholar at
NESCent.
Though neither Women’s Studies nor Information and Library Science are associated with
field-specific organizations that support production of research synthesis, The Cochrane
Collaboration is an important resource for areas of the fields that are concerned with health.
Researchers in Information and Library Science directly contribute to Cochrane Collaboration
resources through collaborative efforts with researchers in other fields; and practitioners and
researchers engage with Cochrane resources in a variety of modes, including, for example, study and
evaluation of search protocol reporting practices (Yoshii et al., 2009).
Data related to funding should be interpreted with caution because it is widely thought that
research sponsorship is under-reported. However, the presence of funding for work related to
research synthesis is clear in the case of the biological sciences examined, including for the

211

development of methods and their application. Across all research synthesis-related publications
(2008-2011), 61.68% of Evolutionary Biology and 67.33% of Conservation Biology items were
associated with grant-funded projects. Further, publications were often associated with multiple
grants (Tables I1-I4, Appendix I). Comparison with funding for other types of research could be
undertaken to understand the relative level of support for projects related to research synthesis versus
other research.
Social Work research, if SSCI data is accurate, was not supported. This finding likely reflects
research funding challenges in the field more broadly. Again, comparison with other types of studies
would clarify whether research synthesis studies are comparatively underfunded in the field. Only
research synthesis projects associated with health and medicine were funded in Women’s Studies and
Information and Library Science. Uneven funding in Women’s Studies may be explained in part by
the “intersectional” structure of the field – in some ways, Women’s Studies’ subfields extend research
of the fields with which they identify. In Women’s Studies, almost a third of all research synthesisrelated papers were associated with funded projects, and these were published exclusively in the
Journal of Women’s Health. Only 12.61% of all publications in Information and Library Science were
associated with grant funding. These publications appeared primarily in JAMIA. More recently,
research syntheses related to informetric studies have received funding. Whether this is a sign of
potential future support for research synthesis projects is unclear.
At a more granular level, journal resources in Social Work, Conservation Biology, Evolutionary
Biology, and Information and Library Science have been provided for research related to research
synthesis. In addition to general publications, at least three special issues have been devoted to topics

212

related to research synthesis in Social Work; and one to meta-analysis in Evolutionary Biology (though
in Evolutionary Ecology, and therefore shared with Ecology). More enduring resources, journal
sections, have been provided by MIS Quarterly, and Conservation Biology. The MIS Quarterly section
was established for theory papers, including those that use research synthesis methods. The
Conservation Biology section is devoted entirely to systematic reviews.
Relationship to evidence-based practice and other intellectual movements
Concurrent engagement with evidence-based practice and policy was a compelling driver for
engagement with research synthesis methods in Social Work and Conservation Biology (Table 47).
Though both fields have a more applied research orientation generally, conceptualization of this
orientation in terms of the evidence-based practice and policy (EBP) movements was strongly tied to
engagement with research synthesis methods. A shift towards EBP was clearly articulated in
Conservation Biology, and was concurrent with efforts associated with the establishment of the CEE.
Further, the example of the health sciences was often recognized explicitly and used as a model of
comparison.
Though Information and Library Science has a practice component, this does not appear to
have compelled researchers in the field broadly to use research synthesis methods. It is possible that
this is a function of literature indexed in the data source used for this study. Alternatively, this could
indicate a separation of research and practice; lack of methodological compatibility, or something
else. This study captured some discussion of evidence-based librarianship in association with research
synthesis methods, but EBP discussion often focused on evidence-based medicine.

In Women’s Studies, EBP was clearly an interest in research associated with the health
sciences, especially in publications in the Journal of Women’s Health. Following Arthur (2009),
Women’s Studies can be viewed as an intellectual or knowledge movement in itself. In this context,
research synthesis methods can be interpreted as a tool used by researchers to demonstrate how a
feminist perspective has or can contribute to research in these fields (e.g., psychology); or,
alternatively, to emphasize that there is a need for greater attention to gender differences when
systematically reviewing and synthesizing past studies (e.g., in health sciences).
Researchers across fields that concurrently engaged in evidence-based practice expressed
interest in diverse forms of knowledge. In Conservation Biology, Social Work, and to a lesser extent,
Information and Library Science, “professional wisdom” or experience-based knowledge was
discussed and/or studied. In Social Work, consumer or client knowledge was considered important. In
Women’s Studies, interest expressed related to diverse forms of knowledge primarily focused on
knowledge that is not androcentric.
214

Characteristics of research and research concerns in the context of research synthesis
In the context of research synthesis, researchers in each of the fields examined expressed
concerns about primary research studies and research synthesis (Table 48). In Women’s Studies,
research of intersecting fields rather than research in “Women’s Studies” was of primary interest. In
Information and Library Science, the process of research synthesis in other fields, especially health
and medicine, and research within the field was of interest.

Across all fields, only Evolutionary Biology had a large archive of past research. Though
Evolutionary Biology has a large research archive, the archive is small in comparison to the diversity
of life and subjects of interest. Some data of interest to the field is simply unavailable. For example,
the fossil record is uneven and incomplete, and historical dating is notoriously problematic. The fields
of interest to Women’s Studies scholars whose work intersects with research synthesis, psychology
and the health sciences, have large research archives. Similarly, though Conservation Biology does not
have a large archive of research specific to the field, in some cases, research from across the biological
and ecological sciences may inform research synthesis studies. Some Conservation Biology
researchers endeavored to overcome the lack of data through making inferences to a target topic
using data from related species or toxins.
Two commonalities across the research fields were observed in relation to reporting practices
and use of experimental research designs. Researchers in all fields complained about problematic
reporting practices associated with primary studies. Whether this changed over time was unclear. It
would be interesting to learn, for example, if the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) had a
positive effect on research reports in Psychology, which might be noted by Women’s Studies scholars.
Though the health sciences are well known for the proliferation of research reporting guidelines in
recent years – many are collocated on the Equator.net website – data of interest to Women’s Studies
scholars was often not reported in research syntheses examined by researchers.
Across fields, use of experimental research designs was generally the exception rather than
the rule. Again, in areas of Women’s Studies in which research synthesis was used, intersecting fields
were an exception. Experimental designs were more prevalent in specific lines of research in

216

Evolutionary Biology and Conservation Biology, but not more broadly. Meta-analysis was sometimes
used within studies in lines of research in which experimental designs were prevalent, including in
Drosophila and CO2 research. In Evolutionary Biology, meta-analysis was also used within the context
of primary studies to examine effects across species. In Social Work, there has been at least an interest
in shifting towards a focus on intervention research.
Though experimental research designs are more prevalent in some subfields of Information
and Library Science such as information retrieval, research in these subfields was not encountered in
association with research synthesis methods. Interest in evidence-based practice in Social Work
seems to have spurred interest in intervention-oriented research and systematic review methods,
following the model of the health sciences. Though Conservation Biology researchers who adopted
the evidence-based practice philosophy were interested in systematic review and this was discussed
with reference to the health sciences; there was relatively limited discussion about promoting
experimental or intervention research for the purpose of syntheses intended to inform decisionmaking. The lack of discussion might reflect a trend towards use of experimental designs when
possible generally, or the need to rely on natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons in the
case of subjects that are not amenable to experimental research (Jennions, Lortie, & Koricheva, 2013).
Evolutionary Biology and Women’s Studies both have strong theoretical orientations, which
focuses research questions and reduces the perceived complexity of research in the fields. In
Evolutionary Biology, specific issues were seen as complex: Taxonomic heterogeneity and prevalence
of small effects associated with biological phenomena such as fluxuating asymmetry. These
complexities were, at least in part, conceptualized and approached as measurement problems. This

217

conceptualization enabled researchers to approach and develop at least partial solutions to the
problems. Complexities of research in Conservation Biology and Social Work were often discussed. In
the case of Conservation Biology, perceived complexity of systems of interest and interactions within
these systems was a challenge. In Social Work, the uniqueness of individual cases and importance of
contexts in professional Social Work practice were considered a source of complexity. At some level,
measurement issues were a concern across fields.
Research synthesis first appeared in both of the biological sciences in the form of “metaanalysis”, a technique described as easy to perform by Arnqvist and Wooster (1995). Notably, in rating
effort required to perform each stage of a research synthesis in ecology and evolution, Côté and
Jennions (2013) annotated only the “full search” and “advanced issues” of model selection stages with
the maximum of four sweat drops. Effort required to locate studies may be a barrier to adoption of
some steps of research synthesis in the fields. Given the extent of discussion related to data included
in studies, and observations by Cadotte and colleagues (2012) in the neighboring field of ecology,
transition through an “easier” approach of meta-analysis, which focuses on statistical techniques, may
serve as a bridge to adoption of other steps of the methods more broadly.
Diverse research orientations were discussed in the Social Science fields and in Information
and Library Science. The extent of engagement with the issue varied across fields (Table 49). The
greatest level of engagement was observed in Social Work, driven by the concurrent and overriding
interest in translating research knowledge for use in practice and policy decisions. Social Work
scholars sought resolution to problems associated with diverse research orientations through
modification of research synthesis methods and of primary research practices. In the policy context,

218

modification of research synthesis methods predominated; modification of research practices in
primary studies were considered more in areas associated with Social Work practice. Discussions
about modification of research practices in primary studies were observed in Information and Library
Science, though to a lesser extent.

Researchers in all fields expressed concern about research and reporting practice biases. In
the biological sciences, concern about taxonomic bias and publication bias was prevalent. In
Evolutionary Biology, “research bias” was defined as the tendency for researchers to focus on
exceptional species in which biological phenomena present to a greater extent (Gurevitch, Morrison
& Hedges, 2000). Social Work (Littell, 2008) and Evolutionary Biology researchers expressed concerns
about confirmation bias, though it was described in terms of publication bias in Evolutionary Biology
(Palmer, 2000). In Social work, research sampling bias, or exclusion of some research based on
research design motivated researchers to develop and use novel approaches to research synthesis.
Though not specific to research synthesis studies, research biases associated with gender bias were
investigated in Women’s Studies. Publication bias was discussed widely across research fields. The

219

widespread discussion of bias associated with research practices indicates that engagement with
research synthesis methods provides researchers the opportunity for reflexivity and to confront metascience issues critically.
Impacts of research synthesis methods
Analysis of collaboration and citation data for items published 2006 through 2008 (but only in
2007 for Evolutionary Biology) indicated that changes in research practices associated with use of
research synthesis methods varied across fields.
Collaboration patterns
Data analyzed to compare the number of authors who contribute to reviews versus syntheses
indicated that one or two authors typically wrote reviews in Information and Library Science, one to
three in Social Work and Women’s Studies, two to three in Evolutionary Biology, and two to four in
Conservation Biology (Table 50). In two fields, Social Work and Information and Library Science,
more authors contributed to research syntheses than reviews. It should also be noted that the nonsignificant finding in Women’s Studies (U = 2.8137, df=1, p=0.0935) may be a reflection of the small
number of publications, 23 research reviews and 23 research syntheses, identified in the years
examined (2006-2008). Differences in the number of authors who contribute to research syntheses
versus reviews in Social Work and Information and Library Science suggests that adoption of research
synthesis methods in a field can contribute to changes in research practices, especially in the case of
fields in which few authors generally contribute to research reviews.

There are several reasons research synthesis studies may be associated with higher levels of
collaboration compared to traditional research reviews, and therefore contribute to changes in
collaboration patterns. First, methods texts generally advocate or specify that multiple people should
contribute to the selection of studies and data extraction. For example, the first key point highlighted
in the “Selecting studies and collecting data” chapter of the Cochrane Handbook specifies,
“Assessment of eligibility of studies, and extraction of data from study reports, should be done by at
least two people, independently” (Higgins & Green, 2011). Similarly, the Centre for Evidence-Based
Conservation recommends that at least a random sample of 25% of items identified be reviewed by a
second person when judging whether studies should be included and when extracting data from
study reports (2009). Second, identification of studies for inclusion in a research synthesis generally
involves filtering out hundreds or thousands of potentially relevant and usable studies (e.g., Côté,
Curtis, Rothstein, & Stewart, 2013). Third, research syntheses may require a broader set of skills or
specializations compared to traditional research reviews, for example to devise comprehensive search
strategies, construct databases for extracted data, or conduct advanced statistical analyses.

221

Citation patterns
Across fields, comparison of review versus research synthesis citations indicated that research
syntheses were used more than reviews in Conservation Biology and Women’s Studies (Table 51).
Further examination of Social Work indicated that though research syntheses and reviews were cited
at similar levels, production of reviews decreased and production of research syntheses increased
between 2006 and 2010. These trends suggest that traditional reviews have remained valuable to
Social Work researchers, though in an increasingly narrow range of contexts. At the same time,
research syntheses were becoming the predominant method of review, and were useful to researchers
across the contexts in which they were produced.

In contrast, traditional research reviews in Information and Library Science were produced
and used at a higher rate compared to research syntheses. Trends in the field suggest that research
reviews are a relatively rare but highly prized – or at least frequently used – resource (Table 52).
Though research syntheses generally have a greater number of authors, which we might expect to be
associated with higher levels of citation (Levitt & Thelwall, 2009), this was not the case. The small
222

number of review publications in the journal literature in the field and limited resources devoted to
reviewing activities may contribute to greater use of traditional research reviews, which tend to be
broader and less specific than research syntheses.

Though no difference between use of research syntheses and research reviews was observed
in Evolutionary Biology, examination at the field level indicated that research reviews might not be
the most appropriate type of comparator publication (Table 52). Research synthesis methods as
defined in this study appear to be used sometimes in the context of research review publications, but
more often in the context of studies that are labeled “original research”. This interpretation is
congruent with the general observations that research data is relatively frequently reused in
Evolutionary Biology studies, especially in molecular research; and that statistical meta-analytic
techniques appear to be the most salient aspect of research synthesis in Evolutionary Biology based
on examination of topics and full text documents of research synthesis-related publications. Content
analysis of specific procedural steps reported in research syntheses, or systematic collection of data
from researchers who perform research synthesis would provide stronger evidence to support this

223

view. If consistent, this might suggest that an alternative comparator, such as papers from the same
issue of the same journal, might be more appropriate to research in the field. Anecdotally, discussion
with a small group of researchers involved in the development of meta-analytic methods in the field
revealed that though the researchers recalled prior discussion of meta-analysis in the context of
reviews, such contexts were not considered primary for the application of meta-analytic techniques.
This observation is in contrast to other fields, in which research syntheses were compared to reviews.

224

CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSION
Research synthesis methods have contributed to changes in the practice of research in diverse
fields across science. Past studies have described increased use of research synthesis methods in
specific fields (e.g., Cadotte, Mehrkens, & Menge, 2012; Patsopoulos, Analatos & Ioannidis, 2005;
Barrios, Guilera, & Gomez-Benito, 2013); and methods books often illustrate increased prevalence of
research synthesis methods over time (e.g., Cooper, Hedges, & Valente, 2009; Koricheva, Gurevitch, &
Mengersen, 2013). The first stage of this study described the increasing extent and diversity of fields
that engaged with research synthesis methods over four decades across science broadly; the second
stage examined diffusion and diffusion contexts of five fields: Evolutionary Biology, Conservation
Biology, Social Work, Women’s Studies, and Information and Library Science. The third stage
established whether, during the latter half of the 2000s, research syntheses contributed to changes in
collaboration patterns and were used more or less than traditional research reviews. Findings across
fields were examined in Stages II and III to identify characteristics of research field contexts that may
have modified diffusion of research synthesis and to aid contextualized interpretation of results.
Relatively modest engagement with research synthesis methods in the 1970s and 1980s was
followed by expansion in both the extent of engagement and diversity of fields that engaged with the
methods in the 1990s. This period coincides with the popularization of the evidence-based practice
movement first, in medical and health science fields (Evidence Based Medicine Group, 1992), and
later, in an increasing number of fields (Trinder & Reynolds, 2000). Engagement with the methods

225

continued to increase and spread to a greater diversity of fields through the first decade of the 2000s.
Measures of association between the extent of engagement with research synthesis methods
within science fields indicate the number of years a field has engaged with the methods (ρ = 0.706, p <
0.001) and engagement with EBP (ρ = 0.893, p < 0.001) are strongly related to engagement with
research synthesis. Though a correlation between the number of years a field engaged with research
synthesis methods and the extent of use is not surprising, the strength of correlation suggests that
fields with publications related to research synthesis in early years were more likely to continue rather
than cease publishing material related to research synthesis. Whether this will be the case for fields
that did not have publications related to research synthesis until later years is unclear since there are
likely differences between fields that engaged with the methods earlier versus later.
The strength of association observed between engagement with EBP and engagement with
research synthesis is likely influenced by the great quantity of medical and health sciences research.
The extent to which the strength of association can be explained by research in these fields alone is
unclear from the findings of this study. Examination of fields at a more granular level suggested that
the use of systematic reviews in the health sciences has been emulated in other fields, including fields
with topical foci as different as Social Work and Conservation Biology.
A relatively weak association between engagement with the methods and whether a field is
more “pure” or “applied” in nature based on prior studies (ρ = 0.279, p = 0.011) presents an interesting
contrast to the strong correlation between engagement with EBP and research synthesis. The
difference in levels of association in part may be explained by a lack of engagement with the methods
in technology-focused fields. Fields in the technology field group engaged with research synthesis to a

226

lesser extent. One Technology field, Microscopy, was not found to engage with the methods at all.
An association between the extent to which fields engage with past research and engagement
with research synthesis methods was found, though the strength of that association was moderate (ρ
= 0.403, p < 0.001). To an extent, this finding supports commentary that suggests the methods are used
to cope with vast quantities of research information in some fields. Findings at the field level provide
insight into factors that might contribute to a moderate rather than high correlation between
engagement with research synthesis and engagement with past research. Some fields likely
conceptualize “synthesis” in terms that are partially congruent with research synthesis methods; and
others without large archives of past research may engage with EBP and, therefore, also with research
synthesis methods. Evolutionary Biology is an example of the former, and Social Work and
Conservation Biology the latter. In part, it is likely that engagement with research synthesis methods
in Evolutionary Biology was moderated by the concept and tradition of synthesis in the field.
Additionally, trends towards reuse of data and combination of different types of data in primary
studies may complicate interpretations of what it means to synthesize Evolutionary Biology research.
Social Work and Conservation Biology, on the other hand, prioritized research to support practice and
policy decision-makers. In both fields, the lack of primary research and data on which to draw was a
concern.
At the field level, presence of organizations to advocate and support use of research synthesis
methods; dismantling, adaptation, and re-construction of the methods; prevalence of EBP; and efforts
to reshape primary research and resources to fit research synthesis methods were observed at
different levels across fields. The presence of organizations and organizational affiliates was most

227

central in Social Work and Conservation Biology. In part, this is likely due to concurrent engagement
with EBP. Notably, organizational affiliates were vocal advocates for use of research synthesis
methods to translate research knowledge for use in practice and policy contexts. The visibility of
advocacy in the context of research methods diffusion suggests a political dimension to the diffusion
of research synthesis methods. In applied fields, and in fields with subfields that engage with health
and medical science research, the Cochrane Collaboration was a focal point. The Collaboration is
identified as an example, a center of resources, and a successful if improvable representation of how
research is done in the highly visible health and medical science fields. Women’s Studies researchers
commented on the lack of attention to gender variables in Cochrane Reviews; and ILS researchers
evaluated and contributed to data collection (i.e., search) and filtering methods.
In fields in which use of research synthesis is a priority, researchers endeavored to reshape
research practices to fit prevailing models of methods implementation, fit methods to the field, or a
combination. This finding extends observations by Platt (1996), made in the context of a study of
Sociology research methods between 1920 and 1960. Platt suggested that research methods diffused
easily when packaged and easily implementable. Other research has suggested that an innovation is a
complex package composed of an irreducible hard core of essential elements plus multiple layers of
technologies and knowledge, with soft boundaries of supporting structures and modifiable
components (Denis, Hébert, Langley, Lozeau, and Trottier, 2002; Adler & Kwon, 2012). In a given
context, the essential elements of an innovation are kept intact, and others translated (Latour &
Woolgar, 1986) and edited (Shalin & Wedlin, 2008) to fit the needs of the use context. This research
suggests that interpretations of what constitutes the “hard core” and essential elements of an

228

innovation varies by context, and is influenced by historical contexts, values, and goals that intersect
with the innovation use context.
In Evolutionary Biology, meta-analytic techniques could be interpreted as the “hard core” of
research synthesis methods. In Social Work and Conservation Biology, especially in later years, the
broader process of research synthesis as presented by Cooper and Hedges (1994), Higgins and Green
(2011), and Koricheva, Gurevitch, and Mengersen (2013) was central. Accordingly, data collection
protocols were more likely to be reported, and meta-analysis, though preferred where appropriate,
was not a necessary element.
To an extent, findings in Social Work and Conservation Biology echo findings of Boyle (2012).
Boyle found that Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) research was adapted to the
standard health sciences research model, which relies on the combination of experimental research
and research synthesis. In Social Work, interest in adapting research to this model was expressed by
some authors. Other authors sought to simultaneously reshape primary research practices in the field
and research synthesis methods to fit the field. Unlike the CAM case study, this research did not
reveal a strong association between NIH funding and field practices associated with research
synthesis, though authors discussed increased engagement with NIMH. Whether a research funding
policy intervention would affect Social Work research is an open question, but findings across Boyle’s
research and this study suggest that at least to an extent, such a change could be anticipated. Calls for
such funding from advocates of systematic review for evidence-based or evidence-informed practice
and policy in Conservation Biology (Pullin, Knight, & Watkinson, 2009) suggests some Conservation
Biology researchers would welcome implementation of such a policy intervention.

229

In fields investigated at the meso-level in this study, engagement with the methods was
secondary to other goals. In Conservation Biology and Social Work, the prevailing goal was to apply
research-based knowledge in practice and policy contexts. In Evolutionary Biology, researchers
sought to increase statistical power and investigate biological phenomena across different species. As
noted by Lajeunesse, Rosenberg, and Jennions, the “apples and oranges” problem is literal in ecology
and evolution (2013, p. 284). Feminist critique and elucidating health implications associated with
biological differences between men and women were primary interests in Women’s Studies. In
Information and Library Science, researchers had multiple interests, including facilitating research in
other fields where the methods are prevalent; informing professional practices; and integrating
research for researchers. These patterns support Platte’s (1996) observation that for most researchers,
methods are of secondary importance.
Though research methods may be of secondary importance in the minds of many researchers,
engagement with new ways of doing research can have far-reaching implications for how research is
practiced within science fields. As observed in Stage III of this study, patterns related to fundamental
relationships such as collaborations may change. In Social Work and Information and Library Science,
more authors contributed to research syntheses than reviews. Recently, Barrios, Guilera, and GomezBenito (2013) observed a similar pattern in Psychology: one to three authors wrote Psychology reviews
(median 2 (1 : 3)), and two to four contributed to research synthesis studies (median 3 (2 : 4)) . The
combination of these findings suggests that, at least in some fields in which reviews are typically
written by one or a few researchers, use of research synthesis methods contributes to higher levels of
collaboration. Such a trend supports assertions that research synthesis methods often require

230

collaboration to accommodate triangulation of researcher observations, process large quantities of
research information, and incorporate a broader set of technical skills. Though research synthesis
studies did not have more contributing authors compared to traditional reviews in the biological
science fields examined, the number of authors typically contributing to both types of publications
would be sufficient to conduct a research synthesis study.
Comparison of citation counts indicated that research syntheses were used more than reviews
in Conservation Biology and Women’s Studies. These findings echo past findings in other fields:
Patsopoulos, Analatos and Ioannidis (2005) and Barrios, Guilera, and Gomez-Benito (2013) found that
meta-analyses were more cited than reviews in clinical medicine and psychology. Further
examination of Social Work indicated that, though research syntheses and reviews were cited at
similar levels, production of reviews has decreased over time and production of research syntheses
has increased. These trends suggest that while research synthesis was becoming the predominant
method of review, traditional reviews remained valuable to researchers, though in an increasingly
narrow range of contexts. Arguments for different roles for different types of reviews have been
advanced in the health sciences (e.g., Dijkers, 2009), though may be considered an alternative
perspective. Findings from this study, however, suggest role differentiation across review types may be
a reality in Social Work.
In Information and Library Science, engagement with past research was relatively low and
research reviews were used more than research syntheses. Trends in the field suggest that research
reviews are a relatively rare but highly prized – or at least frequently used – resource. Though research
syntheses generally were written by a greater number of authors, they generally received fewer

231

citations. A possible explanation for these observations is that, like publications examined in the
second investigation of Levitt and Thelwall (2009), traditional research reviews were written by ‘elite’
or ‘influential’ information scientists, who tend to have higher citation rates whether or not they
engage in collaboration. Examination of who authored research reviews versus research syntheses,
and direct examination of the relationship between collaboration and citation levels would be useful
in interpreting these findings. The small number of review publications in the ILS journal literature
and limited resources devoted to reviewing activities may contribute to greater use of traditional
research reviews, which tend to be broader and less specific than research syntheses.
Though no difference between use of research syntheses and research reviews was observed
in Evolutionary Biology, examination at the field level indicated that research reviews might not be
the best comparison in the field. Research synthesis methods as defined in this study appear to be
used sometimes in the context of research review publications, but more often in the context of
studies that are considered “original research”. Increasing levels of data reuse, especially in molecular
Evolutionary Biology may further complicate perspectives of what it means to perform a research
synthesis – or meta-analysis – in the field. Though whether reuse of data constitutes a research
synthesis, secondary data analysis, or an original study technically might be determined by the nature
and direction of hypotheses in the primary studies, availability of information about primary studies,
researcher specialty, and past practices in the field likely influence researcher perspectives in practice.
Focus on research synthesis as a set of statistical techniques might contribute to interpretation of
‘independent participant data’ (IPD) meta-analysis and meta-regression simply as “regression”. Even
so, it would be important to account for study-level variables in analyses.

232

Implications
This study has contributed to our knowledge of the diffusion of research synthesis methods
across science broadly and in the context of the selected fields. Findings from this study extend
current concepts related to diffusion, including those that address the nature of innovations in
context presented by Denis, Hébert, Langley, Lozeau, and Trottier (2002), Latour and Woolgar (1986)
and Shalin and Wedlin (2008). For example, this study identified meta-analysis as the “hard core” of
research synthesis in Evolutionary Biology; and processes that included communication of search
protocols central to research synthesis in Social Work. Similarly, research synthesis methods were
edited and adapted to incorporate professional experience in Conservation Biology and Social Work;
and client or patient experience in Social Work. Women’s Studies researchers mobilized the methods
to critique research at the intersections of Women’s Studies and psychology and the health sciences;
and ILS researchers contributed to incremental adaptations in other fields. Through extending work
by Shalin and Wedlin and Denis and colleagues, this research connects diffusion research in
Information and Library Science with that in organizational studies and organizational studies in
health sciences and services.
This study identified changes in collaboration patterns associated with adoption of an
innovation, and associated changes in subsequent use of research in some fields. These findings link
and contribute to Information and Library Science research related to collaboration and research
practices. The design of this study provides an example of how studies of broad patterns and more
qualitative and detail-oriented research can complement each other. Finally, this study identifies the
intersection of research synthesis methods and information and library science as a site of inquiry

233

likely to yield information valuable to researchers and practitioners alike. For example, the
proliferation of research reporting guidelines associated with adoption of research synthesis methods
(e.g., APA Publications & Communications Board Working Group, 2008; Vandenbroucke, 2009) has
been understudied though it affects the nature of scholarly communications and researcher
interactions with information resources.
Broader implications: Professional practice and open science
At the broader level, this study has implications for professional practice in Information and
Library Science and related to issues associated with open science advocacy and practice.
Implications for practice
This research has contributed to our knowledge of how researchers in a diverse set of fields
perceive, implement, and discuss research synthesis methods. Professional librarians and information
specialists can draw on this evidence to inform interactions with clients or patrons engaged in
research synthesis studies; and to inform development of services. Similarities and differences
identified in Social Work and Conservation Biology versus health and medicine suggest, for example,
that a broader selection of research may be desirable for research syntheses in these fields. Knowledge
of levels of collaboration in these fields might also be used to inform service design since tendencies
towards more independent versus more collaborative research synthesis study designs has
implications for how researchers engage with information resources and share data.
On a broader scale, the lack of primary, centralized information resources was notable across
fields. ILS researchers and practitioners can contribute to research syntheses through continued
efforts to collocate, organize, integrate, and provide access to research materials in a manner that is
234

commensurate with the types of data and studies in the fields. The intersection of research synthesis
and Information and Library Science examined in Stage II clearly identified some of the ways ILS has
contributed to research synthesis in health and medicine. This study suggests that a broader set of
fields could benefit from ILS research and practice. Finally, this study offers guidance on future
studies that could inform practice at a more detailed level. For example, it might be helpful to identify
frequently used information resources through analysis of research synthesis publications.
Open science
Issues of concern to investigators who engage with research synthesis methods suggest that
open access and open science practices should be considered in a broader context. To perform a
research synthesis, findings and data need to be reported such that subsequent researchers may
directly incorporate them into research syntheses. Open access should imply open access to the
original research study through reports and archival data materials that are easy to identify and
retrieve through information systems. As researchers develop methods amenable to data synthesis,
which in some cases may be conceptualized as research synthesis methods based on the importance
of study variables, the importance of accessible, interoperable, and reusable data will only increase.
Research on and discussion of issues associated with research synthesis, including publication
bias (Rosenthal, 1979; Chavalarias, & Ioannidis, 2010), has the potential to inform scholarly
communications initiatives. Such studies suggest that it is preferable for a broader selection of
research reports, if not all reports, to be published. Further, development of prospective research
registries has been identified as a valuable tool to locate studies for research synthesis and to mitigate
the effects of publication bias. Examination of other types of bias in research related to research

235

synthesis may shed light on biases in how researchers write about past research (e.g., confirmation
bias) and biases associated with research problem selection (e.g., research bias, taxonomic bias).
Information resources such as research registries have the potential to enable researchers to revisit
and radically reinterpret collaboration and research practices. For example, with information
available at study conception, possibilities for research coordination, role specialization, and
evaluation of resource allocation would be enhanced. At the same time, approaches that are broadly
more collaborative could be impeded by competitive tendencies and concerns related to credit
allocation and priority claims.
Limitations
Limitations of the current research include the definition of research fields, the selective data
set used, issues associated with document type categorizations, and coding. As discussed by others
(e.g., Rafols & Leydesdorff, 2009), the Web of Science categories only approximate research fields. The
categories are intended for information retrieval though they are used to study research fields.
Limitations associated with the categories should be considered across all three stages of this
research. Engagement with content at the meso-level during Stage II provides some insight into the
contours of each field. In addition to inclusion of research across fields or subfields that are variously
interpreted, research in “multidisciplinary science” categories was excluded. Exclusion of this research
likely affects evaluation of research in the biological sciences more than other fields examined in
Stages II and III.
Selection of journal titles for inclusion in the S/SCI provides an unbalanced view of research in
fields (e.g., Åström, 2010; Meho & Yang, 2007). The extent to which selection distorts research fields

236

varies by field and is not well documented across fields. In the context of this study, inclusion of
journals not indexed in the S/SCI such as Evidence Based Library and Information Practice (EBLIP),
Environmental Evidence, Research Synthesis Methods, and Systematic Reviews would have been
preferable. Similarly, some important earlier work was excluded because earlier volumes of journals
such as the Educational Research Review are not indexed in the S/SCI.
Additionally, WOS document type categorizations were problematic in the context of this
research project. Though I endeavored to negotiate this issue, the resolution found was less than
optimal, in part due to resource limitations associated with this study. Overall, the issues encountered
reflect difficulties associated with bibliometric research more broadly, or at least in cases in which
commercial data resources are used for research and in which data are of interest at greater levels of
detail. An ideal solution to this problem might be to redouble efforts to create open databases
designed for informetric research. If broadly adopted, such databases could also increase the
transparency and repeatability of informetric studies; mitigate the effects of the unequal distribution
of resources across researchers and their institutions; and facilitate synthesis and accumulations of
research knowledge in the field.
Additionally, this study suggests that development of flexible, specifiable, and repeatable
units to operationalize concepts such as science fields should be a priority. Current approaches draw
on approximations based on units intended for information retrieval; selection based on journal titles;
or algorithmic methods that are sensitive to the materials that comprise a data set. Development of
suitable approaches to categorization could enable informetrics research to better account for
differences across and within fields such as field size and intensity of research in a given area. Such

237

approaches might incorporate traditional categorization approaches, algorithmic approaches, or
intermediate approaches, such as the use of reference points and distances to communicate how a
field was conceptualized and operationalized in a given study.
Dramatic increases in the levels of engagement with research synthesis methods in latter
years measured in this study in part may reflect expectations that authors identify research synthesis
studies as such in titles since Web of Science topic searches query the Keywords Plus™ field as well as
publication title, abstract, and author-provided keywords. Identification of whether a paper reports a
research synthesis is recommended by research reporting guidelines in the medical, health, and
psychological sciences (e.g., APA Publications & Communications Board Working Group, 2008); and
may appeal to researchers in fields in which hierarchies of evidence are recognized since research
synthesis studies are rated highly in such hierarchies.
Findings related to coding and reliability should be examined in more detail. Though
agreement for some categorizations was good or very good, including whether or not a research
synthesis was reported and whether or not a publication was a false positive, coding agreement
measures were low for infrequently occurring categories. The use of Cohen’s kappa to describe
agreement should be supplemented with prevalence-adjusted kappa measures (Byrt, Bishop, &
Carlin, 1993) to gain a better understanding of coding reliability. Cohen’s kappa is more likely to
indicate low levels of agreement if a category of interest is rare (Hallgren, 2012).
Primarily, this study relied on “presence” data. Areas of non-occurrence were inferred through
use of overlay techniques in Stage I. Some absences were documented in Stage II through, for
example, examination of journals in which publications do and do not occur. In Stage II, it would have

238

been preferable to use overlay techniques more broadly. For example, it would be would have been
interesting to compare topics in which research synthesis methods are and are not used. Such a
summary would provide information vital to understanding what lines of research have been
impervious to research synthesis methods; and whether and to what extent engagement with
research synthesis is confined to certain lines of research.
Finally, examination of both more pure and more applied fields within this study can be
interpreted as both a strength and limitation. It is a limitation in that the differences across fields
were a challenge to analyze together while maintaining ecological validity. Additionally, one can
imagine that this research might have resulted in findings more directly applicable to professionals in
the fields examined, and librarians and information specialists that support the professions had only
more applied research fields been included. Selection of diverse fields was a strength in that these
extremes exposed adaptations to both the innovation, research synthesis methods, and the use
contexts. Examination of diverse and less studied fields complements prior Information and Library
Science research, which has focused primarily on the health and medical sciences, and suggests
opportunities for ILS researchers and practitioners to become more engaged with efforts to
implement the methods in a broader set of fields.
Future Research
Widespread adoption of systematic approaches to research synthesis has had a profound
impact on how researchers interact with prior research in the medical and health sciences,
psychology, education, and at least to an extent in other fields, including Social Work and
increasingly, Conservation Biology. Use of the methods has affected collaboration patterns and how

239

researchers interact with literature, data, and information infrastructures. Some changes associated
with use of the methods are visibly manifested in research reporting guidelines and the development
of resources, organizations, and tools to support research synthesis. More subtle changes may relate to
what is included in reference lists, and how research is evaluated and used to support subsequent
research.
The current study suggests a number of future directions. First, “engagement” could be
examined in more detail across a broader selection of fields, or even at the macro-level. The role of
different types of publications might be examined in more detail in concert with research that
unpacks “engagement”. Examination of discussion surrounding the diffusion of research synthesis
suggested that a wide variety of genres, including editorials and letters, might have contributed to
diffusion of the methods.
Comparison across macro- and field-level findings also suggests that some of the fluctuations
observed in measures of the extent to which fields have engaged with research synthesis methods
may reflect controversies within the field, special issues, or other events. Such events would lead to a
temporary increase in the extent of engagement, and subsequent decrease. Therefore, we would
expect the first and second derivatives to reflect these changing levels of engagement. Analysis of such
patterns might enable more fine-grained understanding of how events affect the diffusion of ideas in
science. For example, one that indicated a decline in engagement following an increase might
indicate to a turning point in a field.
Diffusion was characterized as occurring in a political environment. In the case of research
synthesis methods, the political nature of contexts in which they are used may be amplified not only

240

by co-occurrence of engagement with EBP, but also because researchers seem to tend towards
reflexivity and engage in discussions of biases associated with research in literature associated with
the methods. The intersection of the political nature of research, scientific movements, modifications
of research practices, and the implications of such modifications presents a rich field of inquiry that
related to the diffusion of innovations. For example, it would be interesting to examine relationships
between use of research synthesis methods and advocacy for open access to research resources.
On introduction of this research project, it was noted that research synthesis methods, like
collaboration and interdisciplinary scholarship, promote integration of research-based knowledge, an
important counter-balance to specialization. Research synthesis differs in that it involves integration
at levels that are more granular and in response to specific questions. Future research should
investigate relationships between approaches to research integration; and outcomes of programs
designed to promote integration of science knowledge. A better understanding of how these
approaches complement each other and differ would lead to a better understanding of integration, or
synthesis, in science overall; and could inform design of research policy programs.

Appendix A. Comparison of Research Area (SU) and Web of Science categories (WC)
The Research Areas (SU’s) considered in this study correspond with the one hundred thirtysix Research Areas included in records in the Web of Science in June and July 2011 and not identified as
one of the fourteen Research Areas in the Arts and Humanities research domain (as identified in
Thomson Reuters support materials). The Arts & Humanities were not included in the analysis
because these fields are believed to differ in terms of publication patterns, in the use of language
related to “synthesis” and in approaches to synthesizing research.
The Web of Science Categories (WC’s) correspond with those available in 2010. The 2010 rather
than 2011 categories were used because cross-category citation data is readily available for this year
(Leydesdorff, et al., 2013). The “Audiology Speech Language Pathology” category was added to the
Journal Citation Reports in 2011, and therefore is not included in the cross-citation data. This set
includes records for Arts and Humanities WCs to the extent that they are indexed in the S/SCI.
The 123,881 records that comprise the dataset for this study correspond with 176,128 Research
Area (SU)-record, and 186,151 Web of Science Category (WC) instances. Therefore, the dataset records
were assigned approximately 1.422 Research Areas, and 1.503 WCs. As a result, the category counts
inflate the apparent total number of records by about 42% when Research Areas are used; and about
50% when WCs are used. The average number of SU and WC cross-categorizations for the study data
set is higher than the average number of cross-categorizations for records of all items published 1972
to 2011. Across the four decades, 41,268,729 records were found with publication year searches. About
53,542,935 Research Areas are indicated across the set, which corresponds to an average of 1.297
Research Areas per record. About 56,847,805 WCs are recorded across the set, about 1.378 categories

242

per record for the categories considered in the analysis. Since the figures across the database for 19722011 includes all records, and is not stratified to reflect the relative number of records per year in the
data set used for this study; it’s possible that some other factor accounts for the difference. For
example, it is possible that earlier publications could be less likely to be cross-classified in several
categories. Evidence from other studies suggests that this could be the case (Rafols & Leydesdorff,
2009; Rinia, Van Leeuwen, Bruins, Van Vuren, & Van Raan, 2002), which could be explainable if, for
example, titles added to the S/SCI in more recently more likely to be multiply categorized than were
ones added less recently.
In order to identify the relationship between the two category systems, a search for each WC,
limited to documents published between 1972 and 2011 was performed. WCs were matched with SUs
that included 100% of the SU publications. These searches indicate that approximately 110 Research
Area and WC categories appear to be approximately equivalent based on record counts and title
similarity (Table A1); fifteen SUs aggregate two WCs (Table A2); three SUs aggregate three WCs (Table
A2); two aggregate four WCs (Table A3), and eight SUs aggregate five or more WCs (Table A3).

Notes: At least four additional categories appear to also have a one-to-one relationship between the WOS
Category and Research Area: (1) Audiology Speech Language Pathology; (2) Cultural Studies; (3) History; and
(4) History & Philosophy of Science. These categories were not uniformly used across analyses in this study.
Therefore, the data is not included here.
A large difference in the total number of documents for Hematology was observed between September 2012
and February 2013. It is possible that this difference is due to changes in the database. February 2013 data
indicates that the Hematology WC and SU include the same documents. This similarity is not evident based on
the data presented here and used in this study.

Appendix D. Search Strategy Development
The search strategies were developed based on an extensive literature review, a short
bibliographic list (Cook et al., 1992), following reference trails, searches for research synthesis
methods texts in OCLC (Table D1), consultation with an extensive bibliography (Hafdahl, 2011), and
examination of terms used to identify systematic review guidelines in a cross-field study (Sander &
Kitcher, 2006). Query terms were limited to those that authors use to describe the composite process
of research synthesis. Titles and other content (e.g., abstracts, tables of contents) were reviewed as
necessary to determine whether to include seed publications. The final collections of terms and seed
publications represent a wide variety of research synthesis methods, from more traditional to
interpretivist and realist approaches.
For query-based searches, the topic index rather than the title index was chosen for search
because it was expected to increase recall, and also because publication guidelines used in some fields
but not others specify that type of review should be indicated in the title of a publication. Therefore,
searching only on titles would have resulted in an uneven representation of fields.
Because there are many ways authors may combine words to express the concept “research
synthesis”, the query terms are not believed to exhaustively retrieve relevant papers. Instead, the goal
was to maximize the ecological validity of how “research synthesis” was operationalized in this study
within the range of ways this concept has been expressed by authors in publications and captured in
records of the SCI/SSCI. In Stage I, all types of engagement with research synthesis (e.g., whether a
publication reports a research synthesis, discusses the method, evaluates research syntheses, or
develops research synthesis methods) were included.

Notes
In first pass, titles screened for relevance. Titles that indicated a study about a topic (primarily) rather than
primarily a methods discussion were not marked/considered for further review. There appears to be many
duplicate records in the 352 records of the original 855 that I marked. These will need to be
reviewed/deduplicated. There also appears to be little related to qualitative research synthesis based on the
titles that I am familiar with. Based on this observation, known works will be used as the basis for pearl growing
(Sandelowski, Noblit, Major & Savin-Baden). Also, there appears to be a limited number of works related to
systematic review - did not see Cooper's series of works. Will do a pearl search based on these. 78 dissertations
/ theses removed.
40 records of 805 checked for additional review related to qualitative methods
From the composite group of the two search strategies above, 68 duplicate references were found (not counting
the ones I kept), 78 dissertations/theses, 116 did not meet inclusion criteria - for reasons such as breadth (too
narrow or too broad) lack of relevance (especially in case of qualitative works for which titles / descriptions
were not descriptive enough to know without further investigations), not used or only used a few times though this is interesting in the context of diffusion, it does not make a good seed publication, some were
special journal issues and conference publications. Journal articles were in sources that would be found via the
search terms; conference publications reviewed were either off-scope or not cited very much or otherwise
determined to be not usable. 32 references were found to be of use as seed publications. It would be good to see
how much they are actually cited in more depth, especially in the case of more recent titles. Some items might
be classified differently in different databases - for example meta-analysis in ecology, a book series chapter

Appendix I. Financial Support For Research Syntheses
Though authors are often criticized for omitting references to research support in
publications, funding information extracted from publications is available from indexes such as the
Web of Science and Scopus. Funding data indicated in Web of Science records was cleaned to identify
levels of support from organizations overall and, where applicable, geographically. Support data is
summarized for each field by journal, organization, and region.
Evolutionary Biology
Financial support was identified in sixty-six of 255 publications (2008-2011) judged related to
research synthesis methods. Publication venues and years (Table I1) and support by organizations
(Table I2) are presented.

Appendix J. Topic Model Terms
The twenty most frequently occurring terms in each topic for each field are presented in
Tables J1 to J5. Only Information and Library Science topics are assigned labels. These labels were
assigned using personal judgment after review of topic terms and documents that were primarily
assigned to the given topic. Topics for other fields are labeled using the most frequently occurring
word stems associated with the topic. Topics were described in the text with reference to the most
commonly occurring terms and most closely associated documents. The number of terms assigned to
each topic overall is presented in the top row of the term frequency count column. These numbers are
greater than the sum of terms frequencies included in the table due to long-tail distributions.

Appendix K. Alternative Stage III Data Collection Strategy
S/SCI review classifications were determined to be too inclusive for the purposes of this
analysis. Therefore, Scopus document type categorizations were used to identify reviews (Table K1 and
Table K2). Scopus identifies publications as ‘reviews’ based on publisher records (personal
correspondence with Scopus representatives). In order to collect records matching other criteria used
to select records for this study, first WOS was consulted to identify the outermost perimeter of records
to be considered. A subset of records identified as review publications were identified via Scopus, and
citation reports downloaded from Web of Science through the following procedure: S/SCI
bibliographic records associated with items published 2006 – 2011 and labeled document type (DT)
‘Review’ were downloaded for each given Web of Science category (WC) corresponding to one of the
selected subject fields. The remaining S/SCI review records were sorted by DOI. Where available,
DOI’s were converted to a search string, and Scopus was searched using this search string. Scopus
records were downloaded, and items indicated as a ‘Review’ in Scopus were identified. Scopus records
were matched to S/SCI identifiers on the review list and on the research synthesis list based on DOI.
Records identified as reviews in Scopus that were not included on the research synthesis list were
allocated to the ‘review’ comparison group. For each set, research synthesis and review, Web of Science
was then searched, citation reports generated, and citation data for years 2005 to present
downloaded.
Data was arranged to identify the number of citations per year, each year beginning with the
year of publication. Any citations attributed before year of publication were added to first year
publication counts. Descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon sum rank tests were run in R using the base

package and ‘psych’. Subsequently, van Elteren tests were performed using SAS software system 9.3
for Windows to detect differences in times cited and number of collaborating authors, accounting for
differences in publication date.

Data was first described descriptively. Per group (research syntheses and reviews), median
and interquartile values for authors and times cited at two and five years, publication year
distributions were identified.
Data from all years were used in tests for differences in the number of collaborating authors
per publication.
Tests for differences in citedness were run on all publications using data for publication year
292

plus two additional years (times cited at 2), and publications from 2006 to 2008 using publication year
plus five additional years (times cited at 5).
