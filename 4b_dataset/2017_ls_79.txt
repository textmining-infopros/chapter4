ABSTRACT
This study is designed to determine if selected trends in the library literature take into
account the realities of libraries and librarians in conflict zones, and if the experience of
librarians in conflict zones can be used to provide a model for implementing these trends. The
researcher conducted a critical analysis of emerging trends in academic libraries from the
perspective of librarians operating in conflict zones. Specific attention is given to libraries
operating in Palestine and neighboring countries. These academic libraries are involved in a
transition process, moving away from traditional models of library practice but still searching for
the best models of practice to move towards. The need to transition is due to changes in higher
education’s teaching methods, rapid development in information technology, and students’
evolving needs. Just as in other parts of the world, academic librarians in conflict zones need to
improve their libraries’ services to meet patron demand. By reviewing the latest trends in
academic librarianship and the library literature regarding these trends, the researcher highlighted
three trends that can be applied by academic libraries in conflict zones. These trends are the
library commons approach, community involvement and collection assessment. This review
focuses on the emerging trends in academic libraries in conflict zones, challenges they
encounter, and how they deal with these challenges. It is followed by a critical analysis of the
three most applicable trends for academic libraries in conflict zones. This critique allowed the
researcher to build a model that focuses on creating a comfortable and collaborative place for
library patrons to facilitate their use of place and technology, satisfy their needs, and for the
growth of these libraries and the academic institutions they serve. The conclusion is that

ii

emphasizing local authority and political, economic, and cultural knowledge allows select
academic library trends to be embraced by librarians in conflict zones while minimizing
unintended negative consequences associated with those trends. Recommendations encourage
collaborative efforts between academic library professionals and organizations in conflict and
non-conflict zones by holding workshops, training programs and conferences to increase the
awareness of the emerging trends in conflict zones.

INTRODUCTION
Librarians around the world are providing library services to users who live in conflict
zones. These librarians, like many librarians, are motivated to continually update the services
they provide in an effort to better serve their patrons, and these librarians look to the literature on
emerging trends in library services for guidance in updating their libraries. However, this study
considers the literature on academic library trends to see if it takes into account the political,
economic and social realities of conflict zones. If not, this would leave librarians in these areas
with unrealistic guidance which has the potential to do more harm than good for their
communities. Using an analytical-critical approach, this study reflects on three selected trends in
academic librarianship. Drawing on published records of the experiences of librarians and other
practitioners in these zones, the researcher hopes to produce versions of these trends more
authentic to conflict zones and a resulting beneficial model for progress in these regions.
In this study titled “Critical analysis of academic library trends in conflict zones” the
researcher focuses on identifying the academic library trend literature part of the LIS scholarly
literature that seeks to anticipate future developments in librarianship and to create a norm for
what libraries should be attempting to become. To establish a norm is to simultaneously set what
is against the norm, so it is important that norms be analyzed for their assumptions and critiqued
in light of the needs of the people affected by the norm before one is accepted.
This scholarly study fills a gap in the library literature, and reflects the researcher’s professional
experience as an academic library practitioner from a conflict zone: Palestine.

1

Research questions
The study is designed to answer the following research questions:
1. Do selected trends in the library literature take into account the realities of libraries and
librarians in conflict zones?
2. Can the experience of librarians in conflict zones be used to provide a better model for
implementing these trends?
The researcher focuses on the latest trends in academic librarianship in conflict zones
especially in Palestine and other neighboring countries facing the same conditions because of the
belief that similar hardships may benefit from similar solutions.
The researcher focuses on reviewing sources concerning libraries in conflict zones from
several parts of the world, librarians considering transitioning their libraries from traditional to
commons, and sources writing about future trends that do not appear to take into account these
libraries.
Significance of the study
In reviewing different studies that focus on the latest trends in academic librarianship and
focusing on three trends which are applicable in conflict zones, the researcher notes that while
these trends represent essential information about academic libraries’ transition and their use of
information and learning commons, there is little published research available on how to apply
the latest trends in academic librarianship in conflict zones.
This study is significant therefor because there is no local scholarly criticism already
exists critiquing these trends, thus leaving the norms unchallenged for practitioners in conflict
zones. The practical harm of not critiquing is that strategic planning is expensive financially and
involved long term investments of funds with an expected return on investment. In terms of

2

staffing, failure to train for appropriate and relevant skills may lead to an inability to provide the
best services to library patrons. Likewise, failure to adequately preserve existing collections or to
develop future relevant collections may lead to a permanent loss of culturally and historically
significant material, and might serve as a competitive disadvantage for students, faculty, and
community members. On the other hand, the benefit from critiquing the literature is that if trends
can be recast in a way that is more authentic to the specific needs of learning communities in
conflict zones, it increases the library’s value for its host institution, provide innovative services
to priority service needs, and creates a collection that is tailored to serve the research and
education needs of local population.
This study will explore the possibility that libraries that combine the expertise of the
broader profession with local innovation will be more likely to promote improved models of
service, and the power of a good library to promote stable societies and further economic
opportunities. This study’s findings will contribute to a recognition that a balanced approach to
studying academic library innovation in conflict zones is needed. This research begins by
reviewing sources concerning libraries in conflict zones from several parts of the world written
by, librarians considering transitioning their libraries from traditional to modern, and reviewing
sources written about future trends that do not appear to take into account these types of libraries.
These sources present cases in different geographical areas such as Asia, Africa, Europe,
and the United States, that are facing different economic, social, political and cultural conditions.
Further each has different educational systems. Despite many differences these librarians are still
called on to respond to patron demand. That demand is in part driven by awareness of global
information technology developments and, as a result, librarians around the world are planning
to apply new technological advancements at their academic libraries. Technology is making the

3

world more like a small village in this respect, and the results of these studies can be generalized
and applied beyond the scope of these countries. The model produced by this study will inform
these selected demand-driven library practices and will contribute to a recognition that a
balanced approach to studying academic library innovation in conflict zones is needed.
The trend analysis below will demonstrate that librarians in conflict zones are aware of
the emerging trends in academic libraries; however, they are facing different political events (i.e.
instability through war, revolution and social change) which diminish patrons’ access to
knowledge and information. The researcher focuses on the latest trends in academic librarianship
in conflict zones especially in Palestine and other neighboring countries facing the same
conditions because of the belief that similar hardships may benefit from similar solutions.
Identifying library trends
Trends in academic libraries. Academic libraries are often considered the heart of
colleges and universities, and more than just a concrete or glass building. They are places where
one will find rapid advancement in information technology, evolving needs of university
students, and a changing higher education system with new teaching methods that result in a
dynamic environment for academic libraries (Forrest & Halbert, 2009), (Yao, Liu, & Cai, 2009),
(Sheikh, 2015), (Mitchell & Soini, 2014). Academic librarians are called upon to cope with these
changes by working to improve the services they provide their patrons: students, employees,
researchers, and the public. Academic librarians strive to satisfy their patrons’ needs by
developing new resources and services, anticipating patrons’ future needs and by working to
meet these needs. Increasingly, academic librarians are collaborating with technology experts to
build Information Commons (IC). These commons feature consolidated desktop environments,

4

robust technological infrastructures, and an emergent service model (Forrest & Halbert, 2009). It
is in this IC environment that trends are being implemented.
In 2016, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) listed several
emerging trends within academic libraries including “research data services (RDS), digital
scholarship, collection assessment trends, content provider mergers, evidence of learning, new
directions with the ACRL framework for information literacy, altmetrics, emerging staff
positions, and open educational resources” (C&RL News, 2016). Other trends also emerged such
as “Libraryness”1, “Information Technology growth and outcome” (Dahlkild, 2011), and the
transformation of the 21st century academic library into a so-called “one stop shop” by planning,
implementing, and assessing library commons (Forrest & Halbert, 2009).
Also, Schwartz mentioned that community involvement is an emerging part of the 21st
century libraries (Schwartz, 2013)
Awareness of emerging trends in academic libraries in conflict zones. Many
academic librarians practicing in conflict zones are aware of library trends whether or not their
libraries are implementing or planning to implement these trends. Librarians in conflict zones
whose libraries are in the transition process from traditional to digital places are particularly
aware of the new library trends. This is because librarians whose libraries are in transitional
states are moving away from their old procedures and are looking towards something new for
guidance. It is from these emerging trends that academic librarians around the world, including
those whose libraries are in conflict zones, draw inspiration.

1

Libraryness is the development of the physical and social construction of the modern library
space.

5

Since there is little research that directly discusses academic library trends in conflict
zones, this study is an opportunity to bring attention to these issues, particularly by focusing on
trends that could be applied favorably in areas of conflict if they did take local conditions into
account. Countries in conflict zones are encountering many political events (i.e. instability
through war, revolution and social change) which create libraries where people have an
inadequate access to knowledge and information (Rayward & Jenkins, 2007). It is important that
librarians working for transitional libraries in conflict zones exercise the authority to critique the
literature of trends in academic libraries, because doing so will make it more likely that the
transition process will be beneficial to their specific, local populations.
Selected emerging trends. Since this study is a critical analysis of emerging trends in
academic libraries from the perspective of librarians operating in conflict zones, it is necessary to
identify the range of academic library trends being considered. This will be accomplished by
reviewing the most influential sources of library literature regarding the latest trends in academic
librarianship for the last fifteen years. Exceptions arise where some valuable studies were
published more than fifteen years ago. From the latest trends in academic librarianship, the
researcher will choose a sample of three trends selected on the basis of relevance to the types of
libraries considered in this study and the feasibility of implementing those trends in Palestine and
its neighboring countries. Those three trends are the library commons approach, community
involvement, and collection assessment.
Conflict zones
Defining conflict and conflict zones. Conflict is defined as the strife between two parties
who realize intimidation of their needs and interests. This conflict involves open and prolonged
battle between people, ideologies, and countries (Dawson, 2011). Conflicts influence every

6

aspect in people’s lives by affecting their goals, comprise threats over property and/or lives loss
where people have little to no control (Dutton & Jackson, 1987), (Dai, Eden, & Beamish, 2013).
Conflict can be solved or settled through negotiation or it cannot be controlled, which creates
violence and armed conflict. Examples of international conflicts about geographical boundaries
include The India Pakistan Kashmir conflict and The Israel Palestine conflict. (Dawson, 2011).
In addition, conflict zones are places of war, dispute, political instability, rebellion, and
intense chaos; they demonstrate eventual threats and discomfort to people in their daily lives by
disorganizing substantial services such as housing, transportation, communication, sanitation,
water, and health care (Anderson, Markides, & Kupp, 2010), (Schwarz & Perry, 1994). This
happens through bombings, harm to people, and political jeopardizing, and demand the support
from people outside the affected society (Henisz, 2000), (Schwarz & Perry, 1994), (Dai, Eden, &
Beamish, 2013), (Prasad & Prasad, 2009).
Academic libraries transitioning in conflict zones. Academic libraries in Palestine and
neighboring countries are examples of libraries that are in the process of transitioning from
traditional to digital places despite being in recognized conflict zones. These libraries are
updating their approaches to layout and technology to satisfy their patrons’ needs and improve
the services provided.
Academic librarians in Palestine are facing some difficulties due to the political situation
which will diminish services provided to their patrons. In order to overcome the challenges that
Palestinian academic librarians face during this time of transition it is helpful to observe parallel
experiences in other parts of the world to identify ways that librarians in other conflict zones
have adapted and improved services. This may provide insight into how to satisfy patrons’ needs
for digital places. This leads to the discussion that certain techniques and services are common

7

among libraries in conflict zones such as those that focus on involving library patrons in the
decision making process of re-arranging furniture, purchasing new equipment, and re-modeling;
offering specialized services for refugees such as Skyping with relatives, sending scanned
identity documents to displaced persons, and using basements as refuge space; working to have
the library budget/planning made part of the university planning process. Because students
sometimes are embarrassed to ask questions of librarians, training student workers to provide
basic reference services to answer requests in various areas such as social sciences, technology,
business, history and other areas that are part of the university curriculum is a possible response.
Providing instruction sessions about library resources and services, circulation and technology
services would support student efforts.
Because libraries in conflict zones are targeted, they should plan to overcome the
challenges that arise. Even though they do not have control over the external factors, they should
have contingency plans to deal with internal factors since they have the greater control over
these.
The researcher will critically analyze these trends and create a model that will be suited
for implementation in conflict zones, especially in Palestine and its neighboring countries. This
model will guide librarians as they transition libraries into places that, through a combination of
space and technology, will satisfy patrons’ needs and the needs of the academic institutions they
serve. It will also consider how, when configured under this model, academic libraries can
function as sources of community leadership when crises are resolved and stability improves.
Service in conflict zones. Academic librarians in these areas are facing several obstacles
to providing service. These include political challenges related to war, revolution and social
change; technical challenges stemming from the uneven availability of certain technologies, and

8

the way librarians provide services to support the university research and learning needs;
accessing libraries through library space, open hours, and transportation; and services provided
such as research, public services, social media, and outreach. Solutions that would be satisfactory
in other parts of the world are insufficient in conflict zones as a result of these obstacles.
During the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, many institutions suffered from looting (i.e.
Iraq Museum, Iraqi universities and their libraries, the National Library and Archive, and other
institutions). University libraries especially in Baghdad faced looting of books, equipment,
furnishing, etc. Also, they faced many obstacles; such as the lack of basic technology-based
integration between the administration, faculty and students; no email system; lack of a steady
supply of electricity; and lack of expensive generators. As a result, some Iraqi libraries were
reconstructed through donations from the Goethe Institute, publishers and others (Spurr, 2007).
Moreover, in Iraq, the Islamic State (ISIS) invaded the Central Library of Mosul, stole
and burned around 2,000 books (i.e. children’s stories, poetry, philosophy, sports, health, culture
and science), left only Islamic texts, and demolished many archeological antiques and Islamic
sites. Since 2003, residents close to the Central Library protected some of the old manuscripts in
their homes to prevent from theft or destruction (Salaheddin & Yacoub, 2015), (Al-Shawi,
2008).
In Palestine, academic librarians have difficulty acquiring research materials (i.e. books
or journals about Palestinian culture or the Israeli-Arab conflict) which are forbidden or seized
by the Israeli occupation. Advanced forms of information technology are forbidden for security
reasons, which reduces access to e-resources and websites. The fact that 80% of Palestinian
professional librarians are close to retirement age, the absence of library schools and training
courses, language barriers (i.e. most e-resources are in English and few are in Arabic) and budget

9

cuts further complicate service (Kamal & Sayej-Naser, 2016). Also, the absence of Interlibrary
Loan programs because of the possibility of materials been seized, and travel restrictions through
Palestinian territories affect students and staff access to the universities.
Academic librarians in Palestine suggested the need for free access to all types of
information preparation; librarianship training, collaboration with foreign librarians, sending
library scholars to international conferences, funding for local digitization projects, partnerships
with library organizations, book donations by publishers, user services librarians, eliminating
physical barriers (i.e. checkpoints and other travel restrictions), canceling book fees, and freedom
of thought by limiting censorship. These suggestions when applied will help librarians better
serve their communities (Kamal & Sayej-Naser, 2016).
Structure of the research study
The research study is a critical analysis of academic library trends in conflict zones. It
focuses on reviewing the latest trends in academic librarianship, selecting those trends that can
be applied in conflict zones, especially in Palestine and its neighboring countries, and then
critiquing them through discussing the challenges and recommendations/or proposals to be
applied in conflict zones to improve the current situation of academic libraries. This process is
intended to guide librarians in their transitioning process and help them be able to enhance their
services to satisfy their patrons’ needs.
This study consists of five sections. The first section is an introduction section which
includes the research questions, presentation of emerging library trends, and introduction to the
conditions general to conflict zones. In the second section the researcher discusses the research
methodology and rationale, and provides examples of the use of the analytical-critical method in
other research studies. The third section consists of the critical analysis of the three most

10

applicable emerging trends in the LIS academic library trends literature; these trends were
selected by the researcher who is a library practitioner in conflict zones and is familiar with the
needs of academic librarians in these areas. The selected trends are the library commons
approach, community involvement, and collection assessment.
Each of these analyses include an introduction about the trend designed to present
background on the trend, discusses the challenges in both non-conflict and conflict zones that
hinder the implementation of these trends, and concludes with solutions and/or recommendations
for further implementation of these trends. These solutions/recommendations are intended to
help academic librarians in conflict zones implement the transition process from traditional to
digital places and to better serve the needs of their patrons. The fourth section is a construction of
a critical model for implementing the academic library trends addressed here in a selective way,
authentic to the realities of conflict zones. This model includes the internal and external
challenges that academic librarians encounter in conflict zones including Palestine and its
neighboring countries, and the solutions/proposals academic librarians can use to better
implement the authentic academic library trends. In addition, the authentic model can work
beyond academic libraries by serving other memory institutions such as archives and museums
while taking into consideration the authenticity of these institutions and the countries they serve.
Finally, the fifth section is the research study conclusions which contain implications for the
research study, with a brief summary of the research study followed by recommendations to
solve the internal challenges that libraries in conflict zones encounter, raise awareness of
communities in conflict zones, promote collaboration efforts, and ideas for future research.

11

METHODOLOGY AND RATIONALE
In this chapter, the researcher discusses the research study methods and rationale,
analysis and critique, data collection methods, scope of the research study, narrative in research,
and provides critical analysis examples that appeared in the Library and Information Studies
(LIS) literature.
Research study methods and rationale
Methods: the research study employed a qualitative research method called the
analytical-critical method which is the analysis of a discourse with the purpose of revealing and
critiquing assumptions made from positions of economic and historical privilege.
Rationale: in this case, the discourse is library trend literature and the assumptions made
by forecasters who have the privilege to not consider political instability, unstable economies and
unreliable technological infrastructure.
Analysis and critique
The analytical-critical method entails an analysis and critique. The analysis is a review of
the LIS literature regarding the emerging trends in academic libraries to determine which trends
being applied in conflict zones are problematic. The critique is in the form of a reasoned
argument, supported by published accounts, that the LIS literature does not adequately address
the challenges librarians encounter in conflict zones, or how they deal with these challenges, and
how these challenges affect their transition process to digital places. The goal of the criticism is
not to reject the trends but to make them authentic to conflict zones. Authentic means taking into
account the local needs of community in conflict zones.

12

To identify relevant, trends the researcher reviewed the latest trend literature in the
academic librarianship from various resources. These resources are from the Association of
College and Research Libraries (ACRL) and other resources by Dahlkild, Forrest and Halbert,
and Schwartz. From the reviewed trends, the researcher, drawing from her experience as an
academic library practitioner in conflict zones, selected three trends considered as the most
applicable upon those included in the LIS trends literature. Those trends, when implemented in a
manner authentic to the living conditions in conflict zones, will help academic librarians in
conflict zones to facilitate the transition from traditional to digital places and enhance the
services provided to satisfy their patrons’ needs and expectations. The selected trends are the
library commons approach, community involvement, and collection assessment.
The researcher reviewed the three trends from the LIS trends literature by providing an
introduction/background of these trends, challenges librarians in non-conflict and conflict zones
encounter which prevent the implementation of each of these trends, and the
solutions/recommendations that librarians in non-conflict and conflict zones adopt to overcome
these challenges.
Data collection methods and scope of the research study
The critiques depended on secondary resources which were drawn from material
published in conflict zones regarding challenging conditions to be found there. Its scope includes
scholarly and peer reviewed material from the LIS literature that was published in the past fifteen
years plus some valuable studies published more than fifteen years ago. Beyond these, special
emphasis was placed on reports by academic librarians who are involved in the transition process
of their libraries from traditional to digital places or that note any challenges that hinder

13

academic librarians from the transition process, especially those in Palestine and neighboring
countries.
As a result of this study, the researcher built a critical model for implementing the
academic library trends in a selective way, authentic to the realities of conflict zones especially
in Palestine and its neighboring countries that are in the transitioning process.
The researcher used the published experiences of how librarians in conflict zones were
adapting selected trends from the reviewed LIS trends literature to build the authentic library
trends model. The researcher gave authentic names to the model, meaning that each trend’s name
is compatible with the conflict zones. Further, each authentic trend includes a definition, internal
and external challenges that librarians in conflict zones encounter which hinders the trends
implementation, and the solutions/proposals to overcome these challenges.
This model should focus on ways to empower local librarians to create comfortable and
collaborative places for library patrons, to satisfy patrons needs for growth by facilitating their
use of technology and collections of resources, enabling librarians to serve the academic
institutions, and it will be a guide for academic librarians in conflict zones, implementing these
trends in ways that apply to their local situation.
Narrative in research
The revision and selection of the most applicable trends from the LIS trends literature
was made by the researcher, who is an academic library practitioner in conflict zones. The
critical analysis depended on literature written by library professionals, local people, and efforts
from other local, national and international organizations to deal with the situation in conflict
zones.

14

These experiences were discussed in a narrative way to reflect the challenges that people
encountered in conflict zones and how they dealt with these challenges. In this section, the
researcher discusses the narrative in research by providing brief information about its historical
background, narrative definition and an example of narrative work and how it relates to the
research study. Further, this study will provide two examples from the LIS literature about LIS
scholars who employed the critical analysis method in their research studies.
According to Bold, narrative in research began in the 1850s and was used by various
disciplines in the social sciences- sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, political
science and history, and recently narrative has been used in other fields such as the caring and
health professions, theology, education, business and management studies. Currently, narrative
methods in social sciences research use interviews, ethnographic observation and conversations
to collect data and analyze particular social contexts (Bold, 2012).
Narratives are defined as a set of social events of people’s lives which reflect their
subjective opinions and affect them and/or their social contexts. Narratives examine real or
fictional events and spoken or written stories. They comprise communication media such as
drawings, photographs, poetry, plays, video recordings, interview scripts, conversations and
observations. They consist of gesture, body language, visual images and various media effects.
Further, narratives reflect peoples concerns and experiences, affect their lives and social
context, help them understand themselves and others, and open people’s thoughts to new ideas
and future potential. In addition, narratives are synthesized, analyzed and interpreted upon
people’s knowledge and understanding, related to the social context, and represent lived personal
experiences (Bold, 2012).

15

An example of narrative work includes Booker T. Washington's Up from Slavery: an
Autobiography written in 1901 (2009 e-book) which represents social injustice and explains the
author’s personal experiences being in a slavery environment, to pursue and acquire freedom.
Also, it represents Washington’s slavery experience and not “all slaves” but acts as a convincing
narrative of the influence of freedom on a former enslaved culture especially when other slaves
from the same historical period and context have told similar stories (Bold, 2012).
This example helps LIS professionals understand the experiences of academic librarians,
libraries and local citizens in conflict zones through the obstacles they encounter and how they
deal with their obstacles. These obstacles are specifically related to each country which has its
own unique conditions, but acts as a persuasive narrative for people in other conflict zones who
are experiencing similar conditions and have similar needs. This will help them overcome their
obstacles and find solutions to implement the emerging library trends.
Analytical-critical examples
In this section, the researcher provides two recent examples from the LIS literature that
explain the works of two library professionals who used the critical analysis method in their
research studies and demonstrates its usefulness for a profession that values social responsibility.
These examples are drawn from the Journal of Critical Library and Information Studies by
Oliphant and Hudson. In her study “A case for critical data studies in Library and Information
Studies”, Oliphant focused on discussing the ontological nature of data and the contradictory
implications and effects which can be used for the public good, promote progressive social
change, and empower people. On the other hand, the data can be used for surveillance and this
impact privacy. It can be used for secondary objectives without consent, and can be hacked,

16

searched, aggregated, and preserved for years. In addition, the study focuses on discussing the
interchange between critical data studies and LIS (Oliphant, 2017).
Critical data studies are defined as “applying critical social theory to data to ensure that
they are not neutral, objective, independent, raw representations of the world, but are situated,
contingent, relational, contextual, and do active work in the world” (Oliphant, 2017).
In addition, LIS researchers and practitioners could contribute to critical data studies
through “applying critical social theory to analyze data power relations, the contradictory uses of
data, the ontological and epistemological status of data, and how data are visualized, presented,
analyzed, accessed, and managed” (Oliphant, 2017).
Finally, this study discussed how data (including big data) have been conceptualized in
research, corporate communities and in LIS, and focused on Thatcher and Dalton’s seven data
criticisms “a systematic approach to critical data studies” to examine how these data criticisms
are or might be used in the LIS academic discipline and education, and professional practice.
These criticisms include that data are situated in time and space, technology is inherently
political; data does not exist in a vacuum; data is never raw nor objective; data complement other
ways of knowing; data is used in socially progressive ways; and examine opportunities for
critical engagement with data through practice (Dalton & Thatcher, 2014).
Another study entitled “On ‘Diversity’ as anti-racism in Library and Information Studies:
a critique” where Hudson focused on providing a broad critique of diversity as the predominant
mode of anti-racism in LIS by emphasizing LIS diversity as a liberal anti-racism.
Hudson mentioned that diversity is a multiculturalism and a dominant concept that LIS
links with racialized power and difference, but limited as an antiracist modality and
representation. It is the core sign that problematizes LIS, formulates solutions, and expresses

17

ideals. In addition, diversity is the core value of major Anglo-Western library associations, the
center of professional standards and guidelines, and an essential body of literature by
practitioners and LIS faculty (Hudson, 2017). Further, discussions of diversity in libraries has
proliferated over the past few decades but without discussing race. The critiques of “diversity”
within LIS emphasize the superficiality of diversity and inadequacy for thorough inquiry of
racialized power relations.
Anti-racism is not the opposite of racism but defined as the different modes of articulated
oppositionality. It is based on various assumptions about the operations, agents, consequences,
extent, and geo-historical consistency of racism and race. It is aligned with interests of specific
social, political, and economic arrangements (Hudson, 2017).
Diversity addresses the differences within specific organizational environments, and it
seems that no one is currently discussing such concepts as race and power in LIS. This study
called for more LIS practitioners to be more conscious of racial micro-aggressions (i.e. less
Eurocentric collections, and the need for more non-white library workers in LIS and systems in
place to support LIS practitioners). This study added that race in LIS is still under-theorized, and
some LIS writings on race are far from focusing on a diversity paradigm and emphasizes the
field as a space that regimes of racial subordination are reproduced. Finally, the study concluded
by starting the importance of establishing spaces dedicated for diversity and anti-racist critique
writings in LIS on a continuous basis. An effort has been made by launching the Journal of
Critical Library and Information Studies (JCLIS) which represents a fundamental contribution to
critical race work within LIS. In addition, the study recommended collaboration with wellestablished entities of critical race analysis outside LIS, and social critique by treating the

18

relations of racialized difference and power in LIS as expansion of racial domination systems
that describe society (Hudson, 2017).
In conclusion, LIS is an interdisciplinary profession which requires librarians and library
staff to obtain various skills to serve various patrons. This raises the need to focus on diversity in
recruiting library professionals, improving the cultural competence skills for educators and
students, encouraging diversity in the LIS profession by offering distance learning, and
enhancing the number of diverse individuals working in the LIS profession. The LIS profession
provides various opportunities to educators through professional associations’ memberships,
participation in special designed workshops and conferences, and internships related to their
fields of interest. This will help to create library professionals with a unique set of experiences
that shapes their academic experiences, career tracks, and how they affect their communities and
the LIS profession (Croxton, Crumpton, & Holmes, 2016).
Finally, criticism is an important function of LIS research which depends on the
experiences of the LIS scholars and/or the citizens about whom they are writing. LIS scholars
evaluate these experiences, and emphasize them explicitly. This will help increase the awareness
of LIS professionals about the importance of such issues, and provide recommendations for
future implementation to better improve the LIS profession and the specific area they are
searching within the LIS field.

TREND ONE – LIBRARY COMMONS APPROACH
The World is a small place where any dynamic change that is happening in IT
development will affect the whole world, and library patron interests are likely to reflect those
changes. One response in libraries to dynamic technological change has been to create a “onestop shop” (Forrest & Halbert, 2009) by means of “academic, knowledge, learning or library
commons” (Forrest & Halbert, 2009). These are designed to provide increased access to
technologies that support faculty and students’ productivity, and their potential for success
(Forrest & Halbert, 2009).
History of library commons
Historically, the use of the “commons” concept began in England in the agriculture
sector. Access to the Commons would grant farmers the free use of the agricultural fields
allowing them to produce food and graze animals. However, between 1500-1800 many of the
common fields were turned into private properties. People in this period of time between 15001800 were able to reserve forests, fields and fisheries as common property resources. These
commons were governed by the open access or “no property” regimes, and common property
regimes. A framework was designed by common property scholars to understand, develop,
manage and assess commons. The lessons learned from common property scholars would come
to influence LIS scholars’ thinking about shared learning spaces.
LIS scholars studied the importance of the internet-based information communities in
uniting people around a common interest by increasing access to a widespread set of information
resources (Kranich, 2004). Since the late 1980s, academic librarians in the US have focused on

20

“patron-centered”, “learner-centered”, and “user-friendly services”. In the early 1990s, the
implementation and development of “integrated library public services” models known as
“information commons”, or “learning commons”. (Bailey and Tierney, 2008) in the US such as
the Information Arcade at the University of Iowa (1992) and the Information Commons at the
University of Southern California (1994) (Beagle, 1999).
In the mid- 1990s, the evolution from the Internet to the World Wide Web, greater access
to electronic information resources, information commons “learning or library commons”
increased and continued to develop among US institutions to provide services that will satisfy
patrons needs (Bailey & Tierney, 2008). By 1999, Donald Beagle described this development as
a “one-stop shopping” which is “a new model for service delivery in academic libraries.”
In 2004, the use of the term learning commons increased when the University of
Southern California hosted a national conference titled "Information Commons: learning space
beyond the classroom" (Beagle, 2004). Academic libraries are applying learning commons
through increasing their digital resources, and freeing up printed materials space for other
services.
Library commons trend
Today’s college students are changing the nature of higher education; they prefer
“blended learning” (Martin, 2008) which refers to those who expect frequent use of technology,
and need a place for group study, snacks, and comfort. Academic librarians must focus on
pursuing the interests and preferences of differentiated audiences, and as leaders they must
define the library role “as a place” (Martin, 2008) as a social gathering place to meet student
needs for group study, typing papers, creating presentations, e-mail, and access to online
courseware (Martin, 2008). These librarians are playing a role in educating college students i.e.

21

improve technology, provide access to information, “Information Literacy” through marketing
the library’s resources, outreach plans, and provide instruction classes. Other services include
creating spaces for art exhibit, collaborating with the college writing center, hosting campus
events concerts and receptions, collaborating with local public libraries, having access to
televisions, holding seminars, and having a student liaison. Librarians should listen to patrons’
complaints and concerns by making notes, distributing surveys, sponsoring focus groups, and
assessing programs and library functions to provide suitable services that will satisfy patrons
needs (Martin, 2008).
The role and place of academic libraries has changed in response to technological,
informational, economic, and social phenomena, teaching and learning, core campus missions,
interdisciplinary scholarship, and virtual classrooms. This increases the need for a higher quality
library-like space for student interaction, peer learning, and collaboration. To accommodate this
need, librarians are planning for ongoing library processes and activities by serving users and by
creating spaces for information, contemplation, and community (Mitchell, 2008).
Their role moves outside the library walls as they work as salespeople, designers of new
information systems, researchers and information analysts, marketing and public relations in new
environments. By changing into digital production centers; libraries will have the opportunity to
facilitate communication with others around the world, one can learn what has been already done
without wasting time and money by inventing what already exists (Mitchell & Soini, 2014).
Academic librarians worldwide (non-conflict and conflict zones) began to adapt new
technologies by means of commons (e.g. information, learning, research, and teaching).
Librarians in non-conflict zones are facing common difficulties in applying library commons.
Some of these difficulties are the lack of adequate space for implementing Information

22

Commons, lack of financial support from universities, space and budget shortages, and inability
to apply IC in its absolute form. Memory institutions (libraries, archives, and museums) located
in conflict zones encounter common difficulties which are instability, physical barriers, looting,
damaging, destruction, losing, seizure, bombarding, stealing of the cultural heritage, lack of
funding and freedom of movement, lack of inter-library loans, censorship, and lack of library
professionals.
Library commons in non-conflict zones: obstacles and solutions/proposals to implement
Academic librarians in Spain are adopting the “Information Commons Service Model”.
Information Commons “IC” include classrooms, group studies, coffee shops, spaces for
individual and collaborative work, data labs, and academic support services such as writing
centers, tutoring services, counseling and placement services (Forrest & Halbert, 2009).
The Information Commons Service Model focused on the current situation of these
libraries that are in the process of becoming Learning and Research Resources Centers (LRRC),
and the integration ability for these services and resources that provide support to teaching,
learning, and research. In her study, Pacios presented the progress of thirty-seven libraries and
data was collected through a web survey. It concluded that there is an incomplete,
deficient/absent integration of university services and resources. Not all libraries applied IC or
are still in the early stages due to lack of university support. There are different speeds or degrees
of adopting IC, the majority are halfway along with public university libraries making the most
progress. Factors for the success in implementing IC include the human factor, commitment,
network building, and collaboration (Pacios, 2015).
In his study, Sheikh analyzed the current situation of IC in academic libraries in Pakistan.
Data was collected through distributing an online survey to 117 university libraries. This study

23

found a lack of adequate IC, lack of staff and support from institutional authority, restricted
finances, space and budget shortage, and the inability to apply IC in its absolute form. Sheikh
recommended that Pakistani library professionals visit libraries that implemented IC to consult
with them and thus benefit from librarians’ practical experiences. They also need to review the
international literature on IC, apply for funding, organize the IC implementation project into
stages depending on cost, and ask for patrons’ feedback to ensure that IC is meeting their needs
(Sheikh, 2015).
The learning commons is an advanced form of information commons which includes all
features of information commons that operates on a large scale by collaborating with other
academic departments (Sheikh, 2015). This reflects the shift in learning theory from knowledge
transmission to patrons toward the emphasis on creating knowledge by commons staff and
patrons, and patrons’ self-direction in learning. Learning spaces are spaces that encourage social
interactions and knowledge exchange, to facilitate and support learning. Information and
learning spaces evolved from the IC concept into “maker spaces” which are “collaborative
learning environments where people come together, share materials and learn new skills for the
purpose of community partnerships, collaboration, and creation”. A variation on this model is the
research commons, that brings research collection access to individuals and groups of
researchers in a higher education institution locally or worldwide to allow and facilitate
collaboration (Turner, Welch, & Reynolds, 2013).
A learning commons may include classrooms, group studies, coffee shops and cafes,
spaces for individual and collaborative work, and academic support services (e.g. writing centers,
tutoring, counseling and placement services) (Forrest & Halbert, 2009). A study by Dryden &
Goldstein (2013) focused on the evolution of learning commons at five regional campus libraries

24

at the University of Connecticut. The university examined students’ usage of learning commons,
their activities in libraries, level of satisfaction, ways to improve the services/resources provided,
and the study/work preference places to make academic libraries as social centers. The authors
used several methods to evaluate learning commons among students. The assessment included
technology surveys, online space assessment surveys, marketing surveys, and focus groups. It
concluded that there was the need to convert these libraries to social centers while preserving the
quiet study space. They would market the libraries services through print and electronic means
(e.g. various spaces; quiet, group study spaces, etc.) to encourage students to visit the libraries
and benefit from the various services. Practical resources, such as lighting and outlets would be
added. They also stressed the importance of continuous evaluation to keep up with the dynamic
academic setting (Beagle, 2011, p.7), (Dryden & Goldstein, 2013).
Another example is that of the seven Indian Institute of Management (IIM) libraries in
India whose leaders are planning to transform these libraries from a physical to a learning center
by discussing the status of library collection, IT implementation, and adding different
information products and services for users. They also proposed exchanging staff, conducting
training on e-resources and databases, and connecting libraries to social media as a way of
marketing library information products and services to satisfy users’ needs and expectations
(Kumar, 2015). Kumar distributed a questionnaire to IIM library staff by email. This study
showed that IIM libraries are subscribing to numerous e-resources, providing remote access to
their users 24/7 from anywhere, and providing personalized reference service. It was
recommended that IIM libraries must acquire e-resources subscriptions from one consortia to
avoid duplication of effort, and waste of time and energy. Purchasing the same library software
can reduce the cost, and one can customize terms and conditions as well as the software. This

25

also encourages staff exchange, networking and collaborating by inviting publishers to provide
training sessions for e-resources/databases; and encouraging librarians to market their services
via social media (Kumar, 2015).
In summary, academic librarians in the US and other English speaking countries focused
on providing service by means of “academic, knowledge or learning commons” through
collaboration to support teaching, research, faculty and students’ productivity and access. This
keeps academic libraries at the center of a community of learners pursuing 21st century teaching,
research and scholarship (Forrest & Halbert, 2009), and they will be a public place that everyone
has the right to use freely. It is accessible, sociable, and familiar and supports conversation and
sharing (Forrest & Halbert, 2009).
Planning, implementing and assessing library commons
In addition to being academic librarians of the 21st century that provide a “one-stop
shop”, these librarians have to maintain their libraries’ position of being able to serve their
patrons (students’, faculty, and the general public) needs through planning, implementing, and
assessing library commons. In his book, Place Planning for Libraries: the Space Near the Heart
of the College, Mitchell outlined the planning process elements necessary for the academic
library space to be the 21st century library. These elements are; the team (library staff and
administrators, faculty and student representatives, and others), other experts (architects, interior
designers, etc.), and a time-frame expectation. Also, academic librarians have to identify spaces
and specific planning issues, set clear goals, gather data about the library and organizational
environment, and model best practices (i.e. read the professional literature; attend conferences
and presentations, and make site visits to learn from professionals to help improve library space).
Other elements for the academic library of the 21st century include flexibility, collaborations and

26

partnerships, collections, library commons (e.g. classrooms, individual and group study spaces;
work surfaces (desks, tables, etc.); social cultural and informal learning spaces; café; and zoning
(e.g. collaborative study areas, quiet spaces, etc.) (Mitchell, 2008).
Planning and implementing IC will help to meet patrons’ needs’ and expectations (Bailey
& Tierney, 2008), (Britto, 2011). Britto focused on the transition of academic libraries from
traditional to digital places by implementing well-designed and student-centered IC by providing
flexible and modular learning spaces, digital and mobile access to library resources and services
to support students’ academic needs. The author also focused on the importance of students’
involvement in the planning process to help design the IC, and students’ ongoing feedback which
will help librarians satisfy students’ needs (Britto, 2011).
In their book, Bailey and Tierney focused on technological changes, and explained how
academic librarians in the US are trying to adopt library commons (information, learning,
research, and teaching) through planning, implementing and assessing the progress which aims
to meet library patrons’ needs (students, faculty and staff) and enhance academic library and
university success. Finally, librarians at different academic libraries suggested, before
implementing IC, a plan that evaluated data and accepted students’ suggestions and complaints.
It would design a governance structure and policies, prepare qualified staff, design flexible IC
spaces for various purposes, and build various spaces (e.g. group and individual study rooms
with quiet and group spaces), choose modular furnishings that support wireless computing. The
IC, as part of the annual budget, should promote collaboration and networking with partners and
experts, and provide various and customized services to satisfy patrons needs; etc.) (Bailey &
Tierney, 2008).

27

In addition, many academic and research libraries in different countries around the world
have taken advantage of technological developments to improve their services and explore new
ways to contribute to their institutions learning communities by creating a place where everyone
feels welcome and comfortable, and can learn from one another organically and holistically
(Chudolinska, 2014). In this study, the author explained the Ontario College of Art and Design
OCAD University in Canada Library’s Learning Zone model developed by the staff. This
includes collaboration with other departments on campus (e.g. organizing outreach programs and
non-curricular activities), community involvement (e.g. accept students’ ideas and encouraging
their feedback to enrich the learning commons), and encouraging staff to collect usage and
attendance statistics to help arrange and schedule events for patrons’ benefit (Chudolinska,
2014), (OCAD University, 2011).
The commons model that was implemented in different US university libraries (North
Carolina State University, University of Connecticut, Buffalo State College, Brandeis University,
University of Massachusetts, and Belmont Abbey College) helped to build a number of
information and learning commons that focused on design aspects of “learning spaces” or
“library as place” and included, service evaluations and appraisals to assess learning outcomes
(Beagle, 2011). The commons became the core for collaborative service delivery and
emphasized the importance of continuous assessment of this model (Beagle, 2011).
Finally, library commons must be reviewed regularly to evaluate the efficacy “the power
to produce a desired result or effect” (Webster, n.d.); value of the commons (Britto, 2011);
enhance success, help to maintain, re-create or renovate commons and serve as a reference for
libraries transitioning from traditional to digital spaces (Bailey & Tierney, 2008). Bailey and
Tierney indicated diverse assessment methods including formal and informal evaluation,

28

qualitative and quantitative evaluation, needs assessment, usability studies and focus groups, and
explicit and implicit surveys (Bailey & Tierney, 2008).
Library commons in conflict zones: challenges to implementation
People in conflict zones face special conditions that hinder their ability to preserve
memory institutions (libraries, archives and museums) and apply library commons. The
following experiences from different countries in conflict zones describe conditions unique to
each country. People in these areas are facing various challenges such as instability, physical
barriers, devastation, damage, confiscation and plundering of cultural heritage, stealing,
bombarding, burning, and loss of collections, lack of protection efforts from international
institutions to the cultural heritage, loss of collections and equipment, outdated equipment, lack
of collection development and funding, lack of automated library systems, and limited access to
research materials.
Special conditions related to Palestine include lack of freedom of movement (i.e.
checkpoints and the separation wall) which discourages holding library meetings and
conferences, lack of funding, lack of Inter-Library loans, seizure of library documents,
censorship of library material by banning book titles related to Palestine, the long time needed
for book delivery, lack of library professionals, and lack of a professional LIS program. The few
Palestinian library professionals currently in libraries received their degrees from all over the
world and therefore brought different library cultures and standards to Palestine, thus often
making collaboration difficult. Beiraghi mentioned that the conditions in conflict zones hinder
the preservation of cultural heritage. These difficulties include instability, physical barriers (e.g.
international institutions failure to enter the country or contact governmental units to assess risks
for protection), prioritizing human lives over cultural heritage protection, devastation and

29

plunder of cultural heritage by locals, and limited protection efforts by the international
professional institutions (e.g. UNESCO, ICOMOS, and Blue Shield) (Beiraghi, 2012), (Bergan,
2000).
Another study by Hoxha discussed the effects of the armed conflict in Kosovo between
1998-1999 which included looting, damaging, destruction and losing traditional cultural heritage
monuments and sites as well as Kosovo’s museum collections and archives (Hoxha, 2012).
A study by Riedlmayer discussed the effects of the Kosovo war on libraries and archives
that include looting, demolishing and losing collections and equipment, outdated equipment (e.g.
unheated offices, no lights or electricity), lack of collection development, lack of funding, unpaid
librarians salaries, and loss of online catalog records and automated systems (Riedlmayer, 2000).
Another study by Riedlmayer mentioned the impact of the 1992-1996 Bosnia and Herzegovina
war on libraries and archives. These include destruction, seizure, looting, stealing, bombarding,
burning, and loss of collections (Riedlmayer, 2002). A study by Moustafa emphasized the effects
of the political conflict in the Middle East on the cultural heritage throughout the area (e.g. Syria,
Yemen, Libya and Iraq) which limited the access to research materials (Moustafa, 2015).
The Arab Spring in 2011 affected the Syrian cultural heritage. ISIS invaded heritage
sites, destroyed monuments, sold the artifacts, and looted at museums (Liang, 2016). Sahouri
focused on the destruction of the old city of Nablus in Palestine during the second uprising in
2002. Obstacles include the lack of freedom of movement, the separation wall (Taha, 2010), the
absence of a national management body for antiquities and cultural heritage in Palestine, and the
lack of international institutions support (e.g. UNESCO did not include Nablus on its “List of
World Heritage in Danger” (ICOMOS Palestine, 2003), (Sahouri, 2012). A study by Amit
focused on the destiny of private libraries owned by Palestinians in West Jerusalem. During the

30

1948 war, the Jewish community plundered the libraries’ collection (books, journals and
manuscripts), then the Jewish National Library collected the collection and kept them at their
library (Amit, 2011).
Library commons in conflict zones: solutions/recommendations to overcome
implementation challenges
Despite the difficulties that people in conflict zones are facing, they have tried to
overcome these difficulties and have suggested some solutions for implementation. Their
solutions and proposals will help memory institutions (libraries, archives and museums) to
become 21st century institutions and to implement the library commons. Recommendations to
preserve the cultural heritage in conflict zones include raising public awareness, implementing
risk assessments and evaluation, and collaboration and networking between local experts and
with international organizations to share their problems. This collaboration and networking will
help experts to inform each other about the latest conflicts, and find solutions to protect the
cultural heritage (Beiraghi, 2012).
During World War II, librarians and preservation experts played a great role to save the
cultural heritage in Europe. Archives in Europe were damaged and plundered, and Germany’s
army employed freight trains to carry off plundered items to Germany. Libraries in Germany
were destroyed and their collections were kept in depositories “i.e. cellars, mines, cloisters, or
farmhouses”, and library collections were lost through bombings or in transit. In addition, the
German and American armies developed two organizations. These organizations collaborated
with libraries, archives and museums by hiring experts to work for the art and cultural heritage
protection agencies. These experts educated the army and the public to respect and protect the
cultural heritage, and helped the public to enter art museums, take off artworks to safe storage
places (Ewanyshyn, 2007).

31

In Kosovo, International community efforts (e.g. UNMIK) worked to return Kosovo
artefacts but many are still missing. The UN created a comprehensive proposal to protect the
cultural heritage and made efforts to raise awareness by creating an informative brochure on the
many missing museum collections. Recommendations included establishing preservation laws
and regulations, establishing preservation and management frameworks, developing technical
guidelines under the European Union (EU) and the Europe Council, allowing public and
professional access to cultural heritage sites, establishing appropriate inventory systems,
enhancing public awareness of the cultural heritage role, international collaboration, and
providing professional skills and proper funding (Kosova Council for Cultural Heritage, 2011),
(Hoxha, 2012).
Librarians in Kosovo made efforts to maintain the looted, demolished and missed
libraries and archives collection by re-shelving the scattered books and refiling the library’s card
catalog. They depend on donations (e.g. Sabre Foundation) to maintain a card catalog.
Recommendations included providing professional training (e.g. short courses, and workshops),
and supporting libraries with a new automated system to transform their catalog (Riedlmayer,
2000) to an online format. During the 1992-1996 Bosnia and Herzegovina war, local people
protected the libraries and archives. For example the Catholic Parish Church archives were
hidden by local people who returned them after the war (Riedlmayer, 2002).
International organizations in conflict zones are playing an essential role to preserve the
cultural heritage. For instance, UNESO produced a project called “Memory of the World”, and
UNESCO and Blue Shield issued disaster management plans for libraries, archives and
museums. Recommendations for libraries and archives in the Middle East to protect the cultural
heritage include cooperation among international organizations, developing standardized and

32

comprehensive disaster management plans by referring to existing literature, digitizing the most
at risk collections, and involving library staff in the plans development and implementation
(Moustafa, 2015). International organizations (UNESCO, The International Council on
Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), and Blue Shield) tried to preserve the cultural heritage in
Syria but failed. Suggested solutions included developing a comprehensive framework for
heritage site protection.
This framework may include implementing and redesigning effective sanctioning
systems, keeping records of the signs or intentions of destruction, assessing heritage sites,
allocating resources to protect the heritage sites, managing the World Heritage Fund, setting
programs across conflict zones, and national and international collaboration (e.g. UNESCO can
register the sites onto the list of World Heritage in Danger) (Liang, 2016). A study by Mies
discussed the power of libraries in Afghanistan as safe places. A one-room library was
established in rural Panjawi with an estimate of 1,600 donated books and magazines, 5
visitors/day. The library provides access to literacy, education and information, and is considered
as a refuge place of peace and safety (Mies, 2016).
A study by Al-Jaffal concluded the experience of an Iraqi woman who used the
technology to overcome her lack of access to local bookstores due to the deteriorating security
situation. Despite this situation, she built her own library by ordering books online from a local
bookstore, and hosting discussions of what she reads over Twitter (Al-Jaffal, 2015).
In addition, Palestinian experts worked upon preserving the cultural heritage in the old
city of Nablus. They prepared a survey based on questionnaires, interviews with residents and
personal evaluations of site conditions. They received support from the World Heritage
Committee to prepare a list of the significant Cultural and Natural Heritage sites in Palestine

33

(Taha, 2010), and the Department of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage DACH will request that
UNESCO to preserve the cultural sites (ICOMOS Palestine, 2003). Recommendations include
collaboration between local organizations and the DACH to investigate the condition, nature and
degree of damage; and design and install protection emergency measures (Sahouri, 2012).
During the 1948 war, The Jewish National Library collected and preserved books that
had been plundered by the Jewish community from loss and demolition in order to save the
intellectual and cultural heritage to be returned to its owners the Palestinians. Some of these
collections were returned to Palestinians and kept at Palestinian institutions and academic
libraries. Through collaboration between Palestinian and Jewish Israelis in the Palestinian library
project, (the collection was sorted and cataloged) (Amit, 2011).
An article by Bergan described how people in Palestine are overcoming the obstacles
they encounter. Palestinian libraries currently disseminate computer and internet usage to many
libraries. Moving forward suggestions include establishing a Library and Information Science
program compatible to the Palestinian needs and improving their relationships with the
international library community (Bergan, 2000).
Summary
In summary, the researcher started with a historical background of the commons concept
and focused on the development of the library commons concept. Throughout this review, the
researcher discussed that college students are changing the nature of higher education. They
expect frequent use of technology, and need a place for group study, snacks, and comfort.
Academic libraries must focus on pursuing the interests and preferences of differentiated
audiences by creating a social gathering place to meet student needs for group study, typing

34

papers, creating presentations, e-mail, and access to online courseware (Martin, 2008) to be
academic libraries of the 21st century that are a “one-stop shop”.
Academic libraries worldwide began to adapt new technologies by means of commons
(e.g. information, learning, research, and teaching). These libraries are implementing or planning
to implement library commons, these libraries are facing common difficulties in applying library
commons. Some of these difficulties are the lack of adequate space for implementing
Information Commons, lack of financial support from universities, space and budget shortage,
and inability to apply IC in its absolute form.
Suggested solutions include visiting libraries that implemented IC to benefit from
librarians’ practical experiences, review the international literature on IC, apply for funding,
divide the IC implementation project into stages because it is costly, and asking for patrons’
feedback to implement IC according to their needs. It continued by providing examples about the
experiences of different countries that are implementing or planning to implement library
commons. These countries include academic libraries in Spain, Pakistan, US, and India. Then it
continued by providing strategies and examples for planning, implementing and assessing library
commons.
In addition, the researcher studied the conditions in conflict zones which reduced the
ability to implement library commons in these areas and how people are overcoming these
difficulties, and provided suggestions for how they might be overcome. These countries include
Europe and the US (During World War II), Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan, the
Middle East, Syria, Iraq, and Palestine.
Some of the common difficulties that memory institutions (libraries, archives, and
museums) encounter are instability, physical barriers, looting, damaging, destruction, losing,

35

seizure, bombarding, and stealing of the cultural heritage, lack of funding and freedom of
movement, lack of Inter-Library loans, censorship, and lack of library professionals. Efforts and
suggestions are provided by professionals and people in these countries to overcome these
obstacles. These include creating a standardized disaster management plan by referring to
existing literature, involving library staff in the plans development and implementation, and
collaboration and networking with local and international institutions to preserve the cultural
heritage. Raising public awareness to preserve the cultural heritage, establishing preservation
laws and regulations, establishing preservation and management framework, and providing
professional training (e.g. short courses, and workshops) are also recommended.
Local people during the war would hide memory institutions collections and then return them
after the war. There is the need to develop a comprehensive framework for heritage site
protection, with libraries playing the role of providing access to literacy, education and
information, and being considered a refuge place of peace and safety.

TREND TWO – COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Community involvement concept
For some time, libraries have been part of community digitization projects. Academic
libraries focus on community engagement by emphasizing the efficient use of resources,
outreach and recruiting, community relations and support, and collaborative projects
(collaboration between community partners and library interdepartmental collaboration)
(Gwynn, 2016). For instance, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG)
University Libraries focused on collaboration and building community relationships by making
community historical documents available to the public. The digital projects unit at UNCG used
its expertise and digital infrastructure to benefit their partners, which results in improving
support and establishing trust for collaborative community digitization partnerships (Gwynn,
2016).
As community involvement is an emerging part of the 21st century libraries, academic
libraries are focusing on the importance of connections, communication, and relationships with
library patrons. These 21st century librarians must have skills including knowledge of
technology, public speaking, (Schwartz, 2013), effective collaboration, clear communication,
creative thinking, and engagement with patrons. They may be embedded in their communities
(IMLS, 2009). In addition, Lankes considered that libraries are moving farther away from the
traditional activities (e.g. cataloging, books, buildings, and committees), and are transforming
libraries into more social places by focusing on the social aspects of interacting with patrons,

37

facilitating conversations, and providing access to information (Lankes, 2011), (Denda &
Hunter, 2016).
In addition, community involvement deals with inviting public participation to improve
public services and build the library’s social role (CSV Consulting, 2006), (Goulding, 2009)
which helps people to consider and to express their views on how their particular needs can best
be met. For instance, Goulding discussed community engagement terms such as informing,
consulting, involving, collaborating, and empowering. Activities supporting library community
engagement include: work spaces, partnerships with the community sector and other public
entities, and volunteering on projects. Input to strategic decision-making by involving library
patrons in decisions regarding the design, redesign of library buildings and library commons is
often invited (Goulding, 2009). Sung and Hepworth created a community engagement model
consisting of eight elements: accountability, belonging, commitment, communication, flexibility,
genuineness, relevance and sustainability (Goulding, 2009), (Filar Williams & Folkman, 2017).
Community engagement should reinforce democratic accountability, improve community wellbeing that will reinforce fairer and more effective decision-making (Sung & Hepworth, 2013),
(Somerville &Haines, 2008).
A second study by Goulding discussed the concept of community engagement related to
activities in public libraries. Data was collected by reviewing the engagement literature and
interviews with public library practitioners and policy makers. It concluded that community
engagement is an essential part of public libraries, and may include: offering library space for
community activities, partnership with the voluntary and community sector and other public
services, involving volunteers to deliver library services, and reinforcing community
participation in library decision making. For instance, public libraries often assess library

38

services by conducting surveys and asking local people about their opinions, and consulting with
them on some issues (Goulding, 2009).
Johnson discussed the challenges libraries are facing such as economic challenges,
budget cuts, branch closures, and decreased hours and staffing. These libraries deal with their
challenges by focusing on community involvement and support by engaging library patrons in
the library collection decision-making process (reviews, comments, and transcribing materials
into digital format), designing and uploading computer programs, and more to satisfy their needs.
For example, when an Oakland, California public library branch faced a closure decision, the
community arranged a campaign to support their libraries. At the New York Public Library,
patrons were able to prevent a library budget cut of $40 million and retained $36.7 million to the
budget. When the Charles Village branch in Baltimore, Maryland was closed, the community
opened the Village Learning Place (VLP) in the unused library space to provide open access to
books, classes, diverse historical and cultural displays, after school program and more (Johnson,
2011).
Community involvement in non-conflict zones: obstacles and solutions/proposals to
implement
Academic libraries in non-conflict zones encounter various obstacles. Library patrons
request and expect fast, easy and smooth access to information and flexible and comfortable
places where they can collaborate with colleagues, friends, classmates, and instructors. Also,
these patrons require information specialists’ assistance to navigate the library’s online
resources. Other obstacles include economic challenges, budget cuts; and decreased working
hours and staffing.

39

“One size does not fit all” (Britto, 2011) means that academic libraries have different
patrons including: students’ (i.e. undergraduate, master’s, and PhD), faculty members, other
university departments, technological companies, the public and others who are involved in
building and improving Information Commons “IC”. These patrons have different needs, and
librarians are expected to serve and satisfy these needs, and to involve patrons in the decisionmaking process for the development of academic libraries. Community involvement must focus
on emerging needs of patrons by developing new services and creating comfortable spaces
similar to their homes or the coffee shops they usually seek out for study or to relax. This sense
of comfort will encourage satisfied patrons, those who are invested in the library as place, to
become involved in the development of academic libraries. The goal is to establish a personal
relationship with students; encouraging them to communicate with library staff and effectively
share their needs, and to be part of the decision-making process to implement their ideas; such as
those related to library building (e.g. moving furniture around, purchasing new equipment, and
remodeling) or major construction (e.g. information, learning or knowledge commons, enhancing
library services, and having an innovative library staff). This will help to build suitable places to
satisfy students’ needs and preferences, and create livable and workable spaces (Woodward,
2009).
Academic library professionals are facing challenges in meeting patrons’ needs. Students
and faculty members demand and expect fast, easy and smooth access to information, and
flexible, comfortable, quiet individual places, where they can collaborate with colleagues,
friends, classmates, and instructors. Also, these patrons require information specialists’
assistance to navigate the library’s online resources. A study by Seal mentioned that in 20062007, Loyola University Chicago Libraries collaborated with the Information Technology

40

Services (ITS) on campus to build computer technology for information access- IC (internet,
databases, e-journals and e-books) to satisfy patrons’ needs. Loyola University Chicago Libraries
provided research assistance, information resources, bibliographic instruction and ITS by
providing the computer hardware and software, technology training, customer support, and the
network and wireless infrastructure. The study concluded that their service strategy depends on
the “four C’s”: connectivity, collaboration, creation of knowledge, and community (Seal, 2015).
Academic librarians work to satisfy students’ and instructors’ needs by providing
effective learning spaces to support teaching and learning goals, and collaboration with campus
partners. For instance, the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) Libraries built and
maintained effective learning commons (e.g. learning spaces and academic services) to support
the learning process, the Office of Information Technologies (OIT) collaborated with campus
partners to research, implement and assess new academic projects to satisfy patrons needs, and
the UMass library and OIT collaborated and created a coherent and accountable team-based
learning groups to support students’ pedagogical and curricular needs (Hutton, Davis, & Will,
2012).
In her study, Meglio focused on three skills that academic librarians must obtain
including: information skills, collaborative skills, and marketing skills (Meglio, 2012, p. 15).
Information skills are also known as soft skills. In order to carry out their jobs, information
literacy librarians must be experts in these soft skills, and they must be skilled in teaching their
patrons to access information, and find the best sources. They need to warn their patrons about
risks of depending only on search engines and teach them how to differentiate information from
disinformation (Meglio, 2012). Regarding collaborative skills, librarians need to deal with
stakeholders including clients, and co-workers. The marketing team and project managers who

41

are working with other librarians, students from different departments and various project
administrators they need to hone these skills and foster a team spirit (Meglio, 2012).
In the early 21st century, academic libraries started collaborating with potential
stakeholders, users of IC and various campus departments by investing the time and resources in
planning and building their own version of IC. For instance, students at the University of British
Columbia’s Irving K. Barber Learning Center collaborated with campus departments (e.g.
writing and research, study skills, multimedia creation, course tutoring, advising, and support for
teaching and learning) (McMullen, 2008), (Britto, 2011).
Academic librarians must obtain marketing skills possibly through outreach programs, to
increase their patrons’ awareness of available information resources offered in the library, and
increase their knowledge of how to use these resources in order to enhance their information
literacy skills (Meglio, 2012).
A study by Schneider focused on outreach programs as the role of academic libraries.
These outreach programs (e.g. business, government, health, and school-related) boost
community involvement (e.g. children, youth, local business interests, local health services),
other outreach programs focus on collaborating with on-campus programs. In addition, libraries
are networking, cooperating and collaborating with the same type of libraries and with multi-type
libraries, and combined collaboration with diverse kinds of libraries and non-library agencies
involved in related activities (Schneider, 2003).
Libraries, librarians, and patrons’ engagement in decision-making
Librarians have to listen, assess, respond, and work with their patrons to secure the
libraries current and future state (Martin, 2008). In fact, three concepts arise “Connection,
Competition, and Collaboration” that define today and tomorrows management of academic

42

libraries. With the technology that helps to deliver services and materials in new formats,
competition arises from businesses like Amazon, and Google, which forces librarians to
reexamine how they serve students and faculty members. Therefore, librarians must respond and
meet students changing wants and needs, discover new ways to reach out to them, and teach and
help them learn (Martin, 2008).
A study by Yates focused on the roles and services of academic libraries and librarians in
campus community engagement at the Center for Service-Learning (CSL) at Indiana University
Library. Librarians are working towards connecting college faculty with service-learning
projects across the curriculum; and preparing students for practical working experience. By
improving library space (as a place for teaching, learning and research) and by creating
information and learning commons, including maker spaces, a partnership between the campus
and the community they serve facilitates engaged learning (Nutefall, 2011). And partnership
between service-learning centers and academic libraries build curriculum (Yates, 2014).
A study by (Hurlbert, 2008) discussed the age range of librarians (e.g. middle aged; 45 or
older), faculty members and students. It is important that librarians educate themselves to be able
to respond to different patrons’ age needs and increase patrons knowledge about new
technologies and teaching techniques. Encouraging active participation from different patrons in
the decision-making process through assistance and feedback about current and future services,
and choosing new products will enrich the service.
Maintaining a successful learning commons require more than just the involvement of
librarians. Students in this setting benefit from the learning commons environment because the
commons combine advanced technology, learning support, and collaborative work areas,

43

emphasize a learner/student services centered approach, and provides “peer-to-peer” services
that contribute to students’ success.
These services are provided by a wide variety of professional staff (e.g. librarians, IT
professionals, learning specialists, and student affairs personnel). Examples include that since
2002 the University of British Columbia’s (UBC) Chapman Learning Commons has hired
students team to provide learning, technology, and referral support services to college students
(e.g. reference and circulation, tutoring, writing support, and peer academic coaching).
Also, since 2005 the Queen’s University Learning Commons employed a students’ team
to provide technical and referral support to all Learning Commons partners (e.g. the library, IT
services, the writing center, learning strategies and the adaptive technology center).
Both universities libraries provide training to new students each year to help them answer
reference questions. These universities also collaborated in an exploratory study to develop
comprehensive training programs.
This study reaffirmed the importance of student staff (peer to peer service) in the information/
learning commons space; students prefer to approach a peer student than a professional for
assistance.
Suggestions from the study include the need for a comprehensive training program e.g.
supplementary online training for new learning commons librarians, coordinators, supervisors,
and those who want to refresh their training program knowledge. Because of frequent student
turnover due to graduation, internships and study abroad, regular training for students should be
available.
The comprehensive training program can focus on IT support, general campus
information, and library research skills by using online, in person, and peer to peer training

44

approaches. It can focus on strategies such as pairing with senior students, informal observation,
satisfaction surveys, and end of shift reports.
Finally, this study recommended the importance of including improvement ideas for the
training and student staff competencies e.g. develop competencies inventory, tracking student
staff responses to questions (Mitchell & Soini, 2014).
All of the training and support partners represent additional potential conversation partners for
patrons and therefore it is important to inform those partners about the collaborative goals of the
library.
In addition, many libraries are collaborating; such as the collaboration between Pakistani
libraries and other libraries within the community which have implemented The IC service
model to exchange experience and ideas that can be applied (Sheikh, 2015). Therefore, this
process of informing partners about collaborative goals should extend also to institutional
partners.
A study by Buehler focused on community engagement in the 21st century libraries by
discussing the experiences of public libraries; Szabo noted that the public library in Los Angeles
(LA), California is collaborating with community-based institutions (e.g. the housing authority)
to satisfy patrons needs, and building trust by re-evaluating patrons’ needs and the library value.
In addition, the Chattanooga (TN) Public Library partnered and built collaborative space for
enterprises such as the Chattanooga Open Government Collaborative project funded by The
Knight Foundation (Buehler, 2014).
Another study entitled “Reimagining the research library for the 21st century” by the
Dean of Libraries at Georgia Tech, Catherine Murray-Rust focused on the library’s
transformation project, which consisted of renovating the library’s buildings, in cooperation with

45

Emory University. The librarians’ collaboration with the academic community in the whole
research process influenced and added value in their communities, and enhanced library
effectiveness (Landgraf, 2017).
Community involvement in conflict zones: obstacles and solutions/proposals to implement
Memory institutions (libraries, archives and museums) especially academic libraries in
conflict zones encounter various obstacles that prevent them from implementing the community
involvement trend which includes political uncertainty (i.e. race-based conflict, racial injustice,
war); the librarian’s lack of professional training; librarians recruitment deficiency, plundering of
libraries resources, lack of networking and collaborative initiatives by local library professionals,
lack of ILL (Inter Library Loan) and DD (Document Delivery), burning of libraries, and
devastation of the cultural heritage “i.e. monuments” in war-torn zones.
Further, there are specific conditions the Palestinian community encounters which affect
academic libraries. These obstacles are the Israeli occupation; physical barriers “the Israeli
separation wall and checkpoints”. Also, lack of a LIS program; lack of library professionals, and
problems encountered because library professionals got their degrees from all over the world and
brought various library backgrounds that are not compatible to the Palestinian community needs,
residency and travel restrictions, and financial constraints.
People in conflict zones are facing challenging conditions but they are doing their best to
cope with these conditions to survive by providing the best services according to the available
resources. Most of the reviewed literature regarding community involvement in conflict zones is
related to public libraries, local citizens, and academic institutions experiences with little
research regarding community involvement in academic libraries in conflict zones. The

46

researcher is providing experiences from different countries in conflict zones with conditions
unique to each country.
A study by Landgraf reported on during the ALA midwinter 2017 conference focused on
the role of libraries and librarians in times of political uncertainty by emphasizing intellectual
freedom, funding, core values, community outreach, libraries being trusted partners in the
community, innovation, and adaption to communities needs by providing the best services
(Landgraf, 2017).
A study by Roy provided examples about the public library’s role in conflict zones
towards their communities. They stand constant and strong to help their communities by offering
refuge, sanctuary, and an avenue for hope (Roy, 2014). For instance, the Ferguson public library
in Missouri became a community refuge during the race-based conflict for community members
of all ages “children and adults”; the library offered classes for school-children led by school
teachers to help them feel secure in their world of learning and lessons, and it was a supporting
and protection place for adults during protests against racial injustice (Roy, 2014).
In Ukraine, a war-torn nation, public libraries played the refuge role by offering
specialized services to IDPs (Internally Displaced People) such as Skype that keeps people who
are still living in the conflict zone in touch with their family and friends; helping community
members keep in touch with family and friends who have fled the conflict zone (e.g. sending
scanned identity documents to family members who live elsewhere and looking for information
about life outside the zone); converting libraries basement storage spaces into bomb shelters to
protect civilians; and other services to find homes, jobs, and schools for the evacuees (Roy,
2014).

47

A study by Batubo discussed the obstacles libraries and librarians operating in the Niger
Delta region, a conflict resolution zone, are facing and their role in the education system.
Librarians encounter obstacles such as lack of training. In addition, these libraries focus on
empowering the youth by investing in education and libraries in this region, collaboration
between the Federal and State governments in Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers and other stakeholders
to build public libraries of the 21st century e.g. building IC, learning commons and maker spaces
to facilitate, increase awareness, and encourage a reading cultures among the youth. There were
suggestions that librarians should attend courses or workshops on peace and conflict resolution,
and that Nigerian universities must include peace and conflict resolution studies in their
curriculum (Batubo & Digitemie-Batubo, 2010).
In addition, in the 1990s, the Egyptian government collaborated with international
organizations to reconstruct the Library of Alexandria which was burnt in 48 BC. In 2002, the
Egyptian government collaborated with the Norwegian firm Snøhetta by designing and
completing “The Bibliotheca Alexandria” monument at an approximate cost of $220 million.
Further, the Egyptian government cooperated with the Internet Archive to provide long-term
preservation of online resources “offline backup of every website since 1996”, and digitizing
projects for early Arabic and ancient Egyptian archives. This study concluded that libraries will
survive if their communities want and need them (Agresta, 2014).
A study by the Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF) discussed the obstacles that hindered
local communities and stakeholders from managing and preserving the cultural heritage. This
included the devastation of the monuments in Palmyra and Basra (Syria), Nimrud (Iraq), Luxor
(Egypt), Timbuktu (Mali) and other places; communities’ inhabitancy in these areas during the
19th and 20th centuries; and prohibiting foreign experts from entering these sites. Communities

48

and stakeholders managed and preserved the cultural heritage by forcing the citizens who were
occupying the monuments to leave in order to preserve and rebuild these monuments for tourism
purposes. Proposals for implementation included depending on local expertise and communities,
implementing a short-term project exploring ways to engage local communities in managing the
cultural heritage and a long-term project by creating a Responsibility to Protect (R2P) protocol
for cultural heritage (HIF, n.d.).
A study by Al-Kanan discussed the obstacles that academic libraries in Kuwait
encountered such as recruitment deficiency, lasting effects from the plundering of resources
during the 1990 invasion, lack of local professionals, and reluctance to network and collaborate,
and the lack of ILL (Inter Library Loan) and DD (Document Delivery). Proposals include a
country level consortium such as the cooperation between the National Library of Kuwait (NLK)
and the Library and Information Association of Kuwait (LIAK); an international level
consortium such as the collaboration between the Kuwaiti academic libraries (e.g. The American
University of Kuwait (AUK) Library) and the American International Consortium of Academic
Libraries (AMICAL)). They would share resources and provide collaborative services to
minimize their costs and their dependence on outside supplier. Establishing a committee for
academic libraries to encourage academic professionals cooperation through Listservs, blogs,
online forums and social networking sites to enhance libraries collections and services and
reduce costs to benefit the academic and research communities was also proposed (Al-Kanan,
2016).
A study by Watson, Hollister, Stroud, and Babcock discussed Al-Quds’ University
community involvement role in Palestine. The university is facing some obstacles that affect the
university role in their community including the university’s location, physical barriers to travel,

49

community needs, the Israeli separation wall, checkpoints, residency and travel restrictions, and
financial constraints. To overcome these obstacles, the university depends on student fees to
cover its essential costs. In addition, the university president raised international financial
resources, created new service-oriented collaborations with other universities and institutions
worldwide to support community programs, and provided full-time staffed service programs to
satisfy community needs (Watson, Hollister, Stroud, & Babcock, 2011).
Abdullahi discussed the obstacles that libraries in Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) are
facing which hinder their improvement such as the Israeli occupation, restrictions on movement,
lack of a LIS program, lack of professional librarians, various library background academic
degrees from all over the world (e.g. Leningrad, Cairo, Leeds, Amman, Kiev, Sofia, and many
others). Partial solutions provided included that the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and
a British library expert collaborate and conduct a study to assess the situation to develop a LIS
program at the Palestinian universities, and suggested the need for establishing a LIS program
according to the Palestinian libraries’ needs (Abdullahi, 2009).
Summary
In summary, the researcher discussed the concept of community involvement, its
evolution, implementation in libraries (e.g. public and academic) in non-conflict zones,
providing various experiences regarding community involvement, and adding proposals for
future implementation. Further discussions focused on the role of various libraries and the
cultural heritage in conflict zones by discussing the obstacles and how librarians and citizens
dealt and solved them and providing suggestions for further implementation.
Community involvement started in the 21st century as part of the transformation of
libraries from traditional to digital places, and it deals with including public participation to

50

improve public services and build the library’s social role (CSV Consulting 2006), (Goulding,
2009) which help people to consider and express their views on how their particular needs can be
best met. In addition, librarians have to be aware of different patrons’ needs and attitudes by
establishing a personal relationship and encouraging them to communicate with library staff and
effectively share their needs and interests that will help to build suitable places to satisfy all
patrons’ needs and preferences, and create livable and workable spaces (Woodward, 2009).
Meglio mentioned that librarians must obtain various skills including information skills,
collaborative skills, and marketing skills (Meglio, 2012, p. 15). Libraries in non-conflict zones
are collaborating, involving their patrons e.g. students, faculty members, and the community in
the decision-making process. They are employing students and training them to provide peer-topeer services to satisfy students’ needs. Further, different libraries e.g. public and academic and
the cultural heritage groups in conflict zones are dealing with political uncertainty, lack of
trained librarians, burning of libraries, devastation of monuments, plundering of resources, and
other obstacles specific to each country. Implemented solutions and suggestions such as
community outreach; collaboration with other libraries, on and off campus organizations, and
national or international institutions; and involving library patrons in the libraries decisionmaking process. The literature also included solutions and proposals specific to each country.
In conclusion, one of the findings of this chapter is that as a consequence of reviewing
the literature the researcher may report that there have been no comprehensive studies related to
the history and evolution of the community involvement trend but there have been discussions
that the community involvement approach started in the 21st century during libraries
transformation from traditional to digital places.

51

The second finding is that in order to best cope with the obstacles associated with
engaging in community engagement conflict zones, librarians are drawing on local citizens’
experiences. From the reviewed LIS literature, the researcher considered how drawing on local
knowledge and experiences can be an essential part of developing a model that will help
implementing community involvement trend in academic libraries in conflict zones especially in
Palestine and its neighboring countries.

52

TREND THREE – COLLECTION ASSESSMENT
Collection assessment
Collection assessment is an emerging trend in collection development (i.e. acquisitions,
digitization, preservation, storage, and weeding) (Knievel, Wicht, & Connaway, 2006) decision
making process (Johnson, 2016). In academic libraries, it is an ongoing process that contributes
to students’ development, helps libraries to define how the various and specialized collections
support academic research and teaching (Kelly, 2015), and helps libraries to determine if the
developed collections correspond to the priorities of the academic libraries and their institutions
(Munde & Marks, 2009).
Collection assessment deals with qualitative and quantitative analysis of libraries
collections. It is defined as the qualitative analysis of libraries’ collections that measures how
those collections support specific subjects, compare the quality of the collection to that of other
libraries, and compare the scope in which the libraries are purchasing the resources that patrons
want (Johnson, 2016). It also focuses on the quantitative analysis of the libraries collections by
analyzing all or part of the library collections using various collection assessment methods such
as collections usage, identify collections strengths and weaknesses especially in new areas of
interest, identify areas for additional funding, and identify the collections expenditures (Johnson,
2016). Academic libraries depend on faculty as the primary source for collection purchasing
decisions. Other sources include usage patterns (what being used and who is using it) (Knievel,

53

Wicht, & Connaway, 2006) bibliographers, or subject liaison librarians to support and satisfy
different patrons’ needs (Kelly, 2015).
Collection assessment justifies library collections and helps to ensure that library
expenses are aligned with library goals. It does this by allocating funds towards resources that
will suit the mission and needs of the academic institutions they serve. Librarians also need to
keep track of all the collections and services provided to their patrons, and this can be done, in
part, through collection assessment (Johnson, 2016).
Collection assessment measures libraries effectiveness and future planning, provides
them information about the use of the purchased resources (i.e. print and electronic), helps assess
the cost-effectiveness of libraries’ collection resources, and enables them set clear collection
goals in the strategic planning. This will help libraries to define the funds and effort needed to
meet institutional goals and priorities, preserve support collection, and expand to new areas
(Johnson, 2016).
Collection analysis and assessment projects have been conducted in the US by academic
institutions at a state and national level. At the state level, academic librarians conducted usage
analyses of the academic library collections system depending on subject, publisher data,
collection overlap, and gap analysis; and analysis of circulation and Interlibrary Loan (ILL) data.
On the national level, in 1977-78 the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) developed the
Collection Analysis Project (CAP) which helped member libraries conduct a self-study of their
collections. The collaboration between ARL and the Research Libraries Group resulted in the
North American Collections Inventory Project of library collections (George & Blixrud, 2002).
For instance, the University of Colorado at Boulder used the circulation and ILL data to
analyze the use of monograph collections, use of items by subject collection, and the ratio of ILL

54

requests to holdings in a particular subject area (Knievel, Wicht, & Connaway, 2006). Another
study used the circulation and ILL data to identifying heavily and low-used materials that might
be moved to remote storage (Ochola, 2002). George Mason University Library used various
approaches for collection assessment comparing George Mason University’s collection to
published bibliographies and the holdings of peer institutions, assessing usage data such as ILL
statistics and usage data for online journals and databases. They also conducted a citation
analysis of monograph resources and reviewed accreditation guidelines (Kelly, 2014), (Johnson,
2016)
Library collections
Library collections are considered fundamental resources provided by libraries. They are
part of the collection development and management process, mentioned in libraries strategic
plans, and they reflect and support the curricular and research goals of the academic institutions
they serve to satisfy patrons’ needs. Collection policies and priorities guide the growth of
libraries collections. Therefore these collections have to be consistent with patrons’ needs over
time. This can be reflected through collection evaluation that will help manage the day-to-day
library operations. In the library’s strategic planning process it is important to identify strengths
and weaknesses in the collection especially new areas of interest, and identify areas needing
additional funding to continue the level of support previously maintained for an area) (Johnson,
2016). Library collections made up a huge share of library budgets, according to the Association
of Research Libraries. Between 2005-2014 the total library expenses for library collections
increased from 39.98%-44.11% (Association of Research Libraries Statistics and Assessment
Program, 2015), (Johnson, 2016).

55

A study of the University of Botswana Library Special Collections examined the
awareness and usage of library collections by students in all the five university faculties
(Education, Humanities, Social Sciences, Science and Engineering, and Technology). These
library collections support the learning and research activities at the University of Botswana by
having relevant and easily accessible information resources for students.
This study concluded that the awareness of the collection, information services provided,
and usage of information materials were high among Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences
faculties who used the collection for learning purposes (i.e. doing assignments or research), and
low in Science and Engineering, and Technology faculties. The low usage is related to the fact
that materials in the collection do not support student learning and research, and lack of students’
awareness of materials and services provided by the collection. This led the Botswana Library to
add more patron awareness programs about the collection and information services especially
among low awareness students (Nfila, 2001).
Collection assessment mechanisms
In this section, the researcher explores the experiences of academic libraries in the US
and around the world. From the reviewed LIS trends literature, the researcher noted that except
for few studies that discussed academic libraries experiences in the US, Ghana, and India there
was a lack of published resources discussing collection assessment in libraries located in nonconflict zones.
In addition, there are no studies that discuss collection assessment trends in academic
libraries located in conflict zones especially in Palestine and its neighboring countries. An
exception to that was a study about academic libraries in Iraq that deals with the collection
development and other obstacles and solutions before and after the 2003 Iraq war. Another study

56

by Margaret Stieg discussed the situation of public librarianship in Germany before and during
the Nazi regime between 1933-1939 by focusing on the challenges that public librarianship and
librarians encountered and how they dealt with these challenges.
The reviewed literature discussed the challenges libraries encounter which hinder their
capabilities in implementing a comprehensive collections assessment approach. These challenges
include acquiring methodological guidance and substantial skills to plan and conduct assessment
(Munde & Marks, 2009). Some selectors depend on their own knowledge not upon the usage
pattern (what is being used and who is using it) of library collections (Knievel, Wicht, &
Connaway, 2006). In this section, the researcher discusses the experiences of various academic
libraries in the US, the challenges in implementing an assessment method in general and an
assessment collection method in particular, how academic libraries in different countries deal
with these challenges and/or suggestions for future implementation to solve these challenges and
implement assessment methods. These methods are implemented to assess academic libraries
(library services, collections, and others) in general and collection assessment at these libraries in
particular.
Academic library collections (i.e. journals and monographs -print and electronic-,
databases, datasets, digital text and images, streaming media, visualizations and animations, and
other new genres and formats) are expanding rapidly; with content shared in new ways and
various platforms (i.e. peer reviewed journals, repositories, blogs, wikis, and other social and
institutional networks) (Brantmeier, et al., 2013). Therefore, libraries need to develop holistic,
consistent, or agile collection assessment methods (quantitative and qualitative analysis of
library’s collection), to measure the importance of library’s collection in supporting a specific
subject. They need to measure the value of library collection compared to other libraries, and the

57

scope of library purchases according to patrons’ demands to ensure that collections are meeting
institutional research, curricular and patrons’ needs (C & RL News, 2016), (Duncan & O’Gara,
2015).
Academic libraries face several assessment challenges which include gathering
meaningful, purposeful, and comparable data, acquiring methodological guidance and substantial
skills to plan and conduct assessment, and managing and organizing assessment data.
These challenges can be overcome through creating a self-assessment process or plan; and
collaboration with campus departments to develop instrument design and administration, data
analysis, data validity and reliability issues (Munde & Marks, 2009).
A study by (Munde & Marks, 2009) mentioned the reasons why academic libraries do not
foster an assessment culture. These reasons include the perception that library accomplishments
cannot be measured. Some selectors depend on their own knowledge not upon the usage pattern
(what is being used and who is using it), of library collections (Knievel, Wicht, & Connaway,
2006). Lack of leadership skills, lack of library control over its outcomes, the potential to use the
assessment information against the library, and the enhanced demand for e-resources and
services all play a role.
The assessment culture at academic libraries include student learning, collections
acquisition, and reference service. Assessment helps librarians and staff to better understand
library patrons and how they can enhance services and collections to meet and satisfy patrons’
needs. In the study “Bridges and barriers: factors influencing a culture of assessment in academic
libraries”, Farkas emphasized that an assessment culture must be a user-focused learning culture,
involving an administration that appreciates assessment in word and deed. Also needed are time,
funding and support, a committed faculty and staff who value assessment, and the existence of a

58

trust relationship between the faculty and staff to ensure that assessment results are not used
against them. Finally one needs to boost data collection and analysis (Farkas, Hinchliffe, &
Houk, 2015).
Farkas went on to say that academic libraries in the US encounter various factors that
hinder them from building an assessment culture. These factors consist of lack of time, lack of
knowledge about assessment, lack of support, lack of clear expectations, and lack of confidence
that the assessment process will enhance students’ learning (Farkas, Hinchliffe, & Houk, 2015).
In order to enhance an assessment culture, academic libraries should ensure that their
mission, plans, and policies support the information and communication needs of library patrons.
The library’s strategic plans must include performance measures, and assessment should be
considered a part of library leaders regular tasks. Academic librarians should maintain ongoing
communication with library patrons through needs assessment, quality, outcome and satisfaction
measurements. These assessment methods will help academic libraries set priorities, allocate
resources and make decisions to satisfy their patrons’ needs (Munde & Marks, 2009).
Recent LIS trends literature focuses on the collection assessment methods that are used in
academic libraries. These methods include circulation data analysis that can be used by subject
librarians (depending on their professional assessment and patron satisfaction surveys) to
evaluate collection acquisition policies, allocate physical space for print resources, identify
resources for offsite storage, allocate funding for resources, and propose approaches to deselection. Other methods include ILL data analyses, or a combination of circulation and ILL data
analysis (Knievel, Wicht, & Connaway, 2006).
Additional methods for collections assessment that have been adopted by many academic
libraries in the US include proportionate circulation patterns statistics by a process that combines

59

three subject area methods: user factor ratio which is a comparison between the number of
circulations in a specific subject area to the number of holdings in the same subject area;
percentage of expected use (the user factor ratio multiplied by one hundred to obtain a
percentage; if more than 100% overused, under 100% underused), and ILL circulation requests
(comparison of the number of ILL to holdings in a specific subject area). Another method
includes usage data of remote storage facilities and the attendant collection storage decisions
(Knievel, Wicht, & Connaway, 2006).
Examples of additional collection assessment processes include the following Oregon
State University Library emphasized assessing library acquisitions for new academic programs,
and provided suggestions for other universities libraries interested in being part of the new
program review process. They provided a comprehensive assessment report which helps assess
collections expenditures for new programs and to obtain university funding. The
recommendation was made that library budgets should reflect the institutional mission and the
strategic plan (Schwartz, 2007). Collaboration on a university-wide level to assess library
collections will develop fair research collections across all disciplines (Bobal, Mellinger, &
Avery, 2008).
James Madison University (JMU) libraries implemented a flexible collection
development process to meet patron and content needs by applying collection practices that
include several methods. Collapsing siloed, department-based funds allows for collaboration in
selection across interdisciplinary fields through revising allocation models to reflect changing
constituent and curricular needs. Contemporary content development through consortial demanddriven acquisition programs, device-lending, curation of local digitally born collections, hosting
of undergraduate and faculty research, publishing of JMU open-access journals, platforms for

60

campus conference presentations and proceedings, and more further extends resources. (Duncan
& O’Gara, 2015).
Other studies concluded that there is no specific comprehensive collection assessment
model because of the weaknesses of individual tools and the enormous amount of subject areas
to assess (Kelly, 2014). Despite this, Kelly notes that libraries are developing assessment models
that are aligned with their institution’s goals and missions to satisfy their patrons’ needs (Kelly,
2014).
Collection assessment at libraries around the world
In this section, the researcher discusses the experiences of academic libraries in
implementing the collection assessment methods. These libraries are in the US, India, Ghana,
Iraq and Germany. The following studies mentioned the challenges these libraries encounter,
how they cope with these challenges and the types assessment methods they used that best suit
their institutions missions, vision, objectives and goals.
Academic libraries in non-conflict zones face various challenges which include that some
librarians depend solely on their own knowledge for collection selection. There may be a lack of
leadership skills, lack of time, and lack of knowledge and skills to plan and conduct assessment.
Financial support, is linked to the strategic plan of the university and the case for funding must
be made within this context. Librarians must also factor in the increased costs of journal
collection, and consider space limitations. In some cases libraries contain outdated collection and
may have restrictions on the use of Information Technology and electronic facilities. Each of
these factors needs to be weighed as one builds a collection development and assessment policy.
In addition, academic libraries may suffer from the lack of clear expectations, lack of
patron awareness of library collection development policy and procedures, lack of collection

61

development policies, and a lack of collection development assessment policies. They may be
unsure as to whether the assessment process will enhance students’ learning; or will be used
against the library. Librarians need to follow the latest research within LIS; and learn about
implementing a comprehensive collection assessment model.
Farkas, Hinchliffe and Houk mentioned that “a few studies from organizations within
academic librarianship provide valuable insights into assessment practices and issues and the
library profession lacks any wide-scale and systematic study of the topic of how to build a
culture of assessment in the academic librarianship” (Farkas, Hinchliffe, & Houk, 2015). They
emphasized that constructing and maintaining a successful assessment culture in academic
libraries involves a library leadership which promotes, supports and uses assessment, faculty
participation, resources (i.e. money and time), use of assessment data, and a customer-centered
organizational culture encouraged to reinforce library services. In order to develop an assessment
culture in academic libraries, librarians can select the method/s that is compatible with the library
and the institution. This involves campus engagement, administrative support, and ground-level
activities (Farkas, Hinchliffe, & Houk, 2015).
A study by Hufford mentioned that the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL) encourages academic libraries to implement assessment methods such as student
learning outcomes assessment. The ACRL Assessment Committee supports a quality assessment
toolkit, LibQUAL+, which includes tools and examples of use.
Developed co-operatively in 2003 as a research and improvement project by the Association of
Research Libraries (ARL) and Texas A&M University with funding from the US Department of
Education, LibQUAL+ is used to assess e-journals and books, determine patrons’ opinions of the
academic libraries services quality, and market the academic libraries. ACRL is future plans

62

involve creating more opportunities and obtaining funds for academic librarians to improve
assessment and research skills (Hufford, 2013).
According to (Gorman, 2003), library collections consist of locally owned and housed
materials, materials physically owned by other libraries but available through Interlibrary Loan
(ILL), electronic materials (purchase of or subscribed to), and open access free electronic
materials (donations or gifts). Diverse collections can be assessed through capacity or usage.
Capacity is measured in many ways; by number of titles and volumes for print resources. It is
difficult to assess e-resources and hybrid collection (print and electronic) because new
issues/volumes are not recorded in the online catalog. With consortia and package deals (local or
consortia) libraries have less local control on acquired content e.g. the same titles may appear in
different packages. There is unclear ownership and access as titles/issues/volumes can be added
or dropped at any time. There may be selective full- text content through aggregator databases
(i.e. selective issues from volumes, or selective articles from issues etc.) which make it hard to
track title and volume. To solve the title/volume problem of assessment, librarians are assessing
the collection using expenditures (dollars) to describe what is spent on resources to support
students and faculty.
Collection usage is measured by patrons’ access to the collection, patrons’ interest in the
accessed collection (viewing, printing, downloading etc.), their usage of the information for
learning or research (i.e. through citation analysis), and format or funding type where libraries
use the best measurements suitable for their library and institution (Borin & Yi, 2008), (Borin &
Yi, 2011).
A study at Montana State University (MSU) library focused on budget cuts and increased
costs of journal collections. It assessed the value of the journal collection by reviewing users’

63

(faculty and graduate students) citation behavior (cited items) analysis of 2004, 2008 and 2012
and LibQual+ satisfaction ratings for print and electronic journal collections. Fulfillment rates
for subscription requests; and Interlibrary Loan (ILL) for frequently requested journals was
analyzed as well. They found a gap between user journal citation behavior regarding the
University Library collections and patron perceptions that needs are met. Citation analysis does
not give a complete picture of patrons’ needs and behavior. While it informs librarians about the
relationship between these needs and behavior, and may identify a separation between user
behavior and attitude librarians must be responsible for educating users about options for serial
acquisition, improve branding of library-provided resources, and provide the resources needed
by the university community (Rossmann, 2013).
An article by Sinha & Tucker (2005) focused on the effects of the rising number of
students enrolled, and proposed improving academic programs at the University of Nevada, Las
Vegas (UNLV) by enhancing the type of services offered by the library and increasing the
number of library staff. As a result, librarians responded to UNLV’s program growth by hiring
additional subject librarians and support staff to increase communication with academic
departments, and ensure that new program proposals include funding for library services (i.e.
document delivery, instruction and new information resources). Also, new facilities increased
library use, affect staff training i.e. reference service and collection development. The increase in
new academic programs made it possible for the library to adopt new approaches to budget
allocation and collection development.
A study of two universities in Punjab, India (i.e. Punjab University, Chandigarh; and
Punjab University, Patiala) discussed patrons’ perceptions (postgraduate students from all
disciplines) and the needs of library collections (print and electronic resources). They were asked

64

to discuss awareness of library collection development policy and procedures, and their
satisfaction levels in using the library resources. The data was collected by using a stratified
random sampling method through questionnaire and unstructured interviews about patron’s
opinions regarding collection development of university libraries. The study found that most
patrons lack awareness of library collection development policy and procedures, and it was
recommended that libraries engage patrons’ in collection development by requesting patrons’
feedback and suggestions. In addition, library collections should be assessed regularly (Singh &
Mahajan, 2015).
A study by Tabacaru and Pickett discussed the construction, management and assessment
of library collections at Texas A&M University (TAMU) libraries. The author mentioned that
constructing and managing library collections must be compatible with the university
curriculum, technology and evolving patrons’ needs. TAMU libraries used LibQUAL+ to assess
their collections, programs and services (Tabacaru & Pickett, 2013). This data driven collection
analysis recommended increase in their e-resources and digital preservation initiatives and that
they transfer the print collections to remote storage facilities. These remote storage projects
require timely communication and collaboration among library administration, collections
personnel, subject librarians and constituencies (Tabacaru & Pickett, 2013).
Other studies determined that small and medium-sized academic libraries are
encountering various challenges such as space limitations, tight collection concentration, and
lack of financial resources to invest in new buildings or storage facilities. Ways to solve the
space limitation include transferring print resources to off-site storage and purchasing eresources. Off-site storage may also include resources that support current curriculum offerings.
Librarians need to maintain a continuous history of circulation data, ILL usage and other

65

resources identified by teaching faculty (Bracke & Martin, 2005), (Rais, Arthur, & Hanson,
2010), (Thomas & Shouse, 2012), (Tabacaru & Pickett, 2013).
Another study focused on the University of Houston Digital Library (UHDL) collection
selection methods. The UHDL was launched in 2009 and it’s collection consists of rare and
unique e-resources UHDL extended it’s e-resources by implementing the Digital Asset
Management System (DAMS) selection activities such as needs assessment, systems evaluation,
and systems testing. Implementing DAMS strategy consists of several phases: system
installation, data migration, and interface development (Wu, Thompson, Vacek, Watkins, &
Weidner, 2016).
A study entitled “analyzing digital collections entrances: what gets used and why it
matters” by Biswas and Marchesoni focused on analyzing usage data for digital collections at
Western Carolina University (WCU) Hunter Library using Google Analytics for a period of
twenty-seven months from October 2013-December 2015. The data analysis and evaluation
identifies collections that receive the largest number of visits, and helps to make better informed
decisions for building digital collections to serve patrons’ needs (Biswas & Marchesoni, 2016).
Ameyaw focused on the collection development practices at the Valley View University
(VVU) Library in Ghana to determine if a collection development policy exists. VVU Library
collections include print and e-resources and it’s collection use is measured to see how the VVU
Library meets the goals, needs, missions, vision and objectives of the library and its parent
institution. The study found that VVU has a written collection development policy but it has not
been revised since its implementation, and it suffers from the lack of access to print and online
resources. Regular meetings of the collection development committee who are in charge of
acquisition and selection was recommended. Faculty members would be given deadlines to

66

submit suggested textbooks and titles. During these meetings the committee would include
regular review of the collection development policy. That is compatible with the goals and
objectives of the academic institution. The regular review of the collection development policy
will help to meet the interests and expectations of the various users. Other challenges include
limited space and funds which requires the management of the VVU Library to collaborate with
on-campus authorities to solve these issues (Ameyaw & Entsua-Mensah, 2016).
Academic librarians in conflict zones encounter additional obstacles that hinder them
from implementing collection assessment. These include lack of funding, lack of security,
bombing of the libraries, devastation of libraries and their resources, censorship of the library’s
collection development policy and library collections, strict circulation policies, delays of book
deliveries, severe book shortage, and irregular communication levels between local and
international parties.
Qureshi discussed the challenges that librarians in Iraq encountered before and during the
2003 Iraq war. Library and archive specialists noted that, prior to the war, libraries did not have
collection development policies. There was a lack of financial budget and funding, library
resources were out of date, restrictions on Information Technology and electronic facilities
existed, and the library staff did not follow up with the latest LIS research. During the 2003 Iraq
war, librarians encountered issues including lack of funding (1/3 of the allocated funding
disappeared due to corruption), lack of security which delayed library projects, and irregular
communication levels between international and local parties in Iraq. On the other hand, Iraqi
librarians faced positive changes and improvements which consist of retraining library and
archive staff, noticeable development in library collections through print and e-resources, and
improvement in the relationship with international libraries and library professionals that help to

67

bring the world’s attention to the value and importance of the historical collections that were
seized during 2003 Iraq war (Qureshi, 2009).
Several studies by Margaret Stieg discuss the situation of public librarianship in Germany
between 1933-1939, before and during the Nazi regime. Pre-1933 public libraries were full of
outdated books. During the Nazi regime, public librarianship and librarians in Germany
reinforced the educational role by increasing the educational collections. At the same time, the
Nazi regime imposed a strict censorship on public libraries by imposing a Nazi collection
development policy to control library collections “i.e. the police seized publications of unsuitable
content that jeopardize public security, systematic weeding of unsuitable books, and addition of
Nazi books”. Nazis built programs to encourage and increase library use and impose the Nazi
ideas and values. The Nazis passed legislation in 1926 to prevent young people from accessing
undesirable publications and imposed tighter control over book selection. Librarians had limited
books selection choices and strict circulation policies that put limits on borrowing books. There
was a reduction in circulation statistics due to library users who had no time for leisure reading.
Libraries endured devastation, delays of book deliveries and severe book shortages. Heavy
bombing influenced library services and created physical damage. To deal with these issues, The
Public libraries continued to obtain financial support from local governments (i.e. gifts, fees, and
grants) (Stieg, 1992), (Stieg, 1994). Large numbers of refugees who relocated in places near the
public libraries increased their library usage as people used the library for entertaining reading
which increased circulation statistics, relaxation and escape.

68

Summary
To summarize, the researcher discussed the collection assessment trend concept, library
collections, collection assessment mechanisms and collection assessment at libraries around the
world. Throughout the discussions, there has been no research in the LIS trends literature that
studied the collection assessment trend at libraries located in non-conflict zones except for few
studies that discussed academic librarians experiences in the US, Ghana, and India. Also, there
are no studies that discuss collection assessment trends in academic libraries located in conflict
zones especially in Palestine and it’s neighboring countries, except one study about academic
libraries in Iraq during the 2003 war. Another study discussed the public libraries situation
during the Nazi regime in Germany.
Throughout the literature, the researcher identified the challenges academic librarians
face that hinder their implementation of the collection assessment trend, how they deal with
these challenges and/or recommendations for future implementation. Also, the studies discussed
the collection assessment mechanisms that each of these libraries implemented.
Collection assessment is an emerging trend in the collection development (Knievel,
Wicht, & Connaway, 2006) decision making process (Johnson, 2016) in academic libraries. It is
an ongoing process that contributes to students’ development, helps librarians to define how their
libraries various and specialized collections support academic research and teaching (Kelly,
2015). It measures libraries effectiveness and future planning, provides them information about
the use of the purchased resources (i.e. print and electronic), helps assess the cost-effectiveness
of libraries collection resources, and enables them set clear collection goals in the strategic
planning (Johnson, 2016). For instance, library collections made up a huge share of library
budgets; according to the Association of Research Libraries. From 2005-2014, the total library

69

expenses budgeted for collection development increased from 39.98%-44.11% (Association of
Research Libraries Statistics and Assessment Program, 2015).
The reviewed literature discussed the challenges academic librarians encounter which
hinder them from implementing a comprehensive collections assessment approach. Some of
these challenges include acquiring methodological guidance and substantial skills to plan and
conduct assessment (Munde & Marks, 2009). Some selectors depend on their own knowledge for
library collections acquisition (Knievel, Wicht, & Connaway, 2006). Lack of leadership skills,
lack of time, lack of knowledge about assessment, lack of support, lack of clear expectations, and
lack of confidence that the assessment process will enhance students’ learning contribute to the
situation (Farkas, Hinchliffe, & Houk, 2015). Library patrons lack the awareness of library
collection development policy and procedures (Singh & Mahajan, 2015) to be supportive. Other
challenges that academic librarians in Iraq encountered before and during the 2003 war include
the lack of collection development policies, lack of financial budget and funding, restrictions’ on
Information Technology and electronic facilities, and lack of security (Qureshi, 2009). Obstacles
faced by public librarians in Nazi Germany included outdated books and strict censorship. The
Nazis built programs by imposing Nazi ideas and values, put in place strict circulation policies.
The devastation of libraries and books, delays of book deliveries, severe book shortage, and
heavy bombing during the war limited the ability of public libraries to serve their communities.
Suggestions to implement the collection assessment trend at academic libraries include
enhancing the library’s educational role, acquiring financial support and imposing tighter control
upon library collections (Stieg, 1992), (Steig, 1994). Allocating the academic library budget to
adjust to changes in the academic institutional mission (Schwartz, 2007), (Bobal, Mellinger, &
Avery, 2008), (Farkas, Hinchliffe, & Houk, 2015), and involving a library leadership which

70

promotes, supports and uses assessment is essential as is faculty participation and sufficient
financial support. The use of assessment data reinforces a customer-centered organizational
culture, encourages academic librarians to select the assessment method/s that is compatible with
the library and the institution (Farkas, Hinchliffe, & Houk, 2015), and engages patrons’ in
collection development. Patrons’ feedback and suggestions, and regular assessment are necessary
(Singh & Mahajan, 2015).
The researcher concluded the section with discussions regarding the collection
assessment methods that academic libraries around the world implemented. One initiative was by
the ACRL that supported academic libraries in implementing assessment methods such as
student learning outcomes assessment, and LibQUAL+ (Hufford, 2013). Other methods that
were implemented by libraries around the world include usage data on remote storage facilities
and the attendant collection storage decisions, circulation data analysis, ILL data analysis, and a
combination of circulation and ILL data analysis (Knievel, Wicht, & Connaway, 2006).

71

MODEL REVISED AUTHENTIC LIBRARY TRENDS
Throughout the literature review chapter, the researcher reviewed the emerging academic
library trends that were published by the LIS literature including ACRL (C&RL News, 2016)
and other resources by (Dahlkild, 2011), (Forrest & Halbert, 2009), and (Schwartz, 2013),
selected the most applicable trends in academic libraries that can be applied in conflict zones. In
the literature review, the researcher focused on providing background for each trend, discussed
and critiqued the trends at libraries located in non-conflict and conflict zones, identified
challenges to implement these trends in non-conflict and conflict zones, and provided
solutions/recommendations to overcome implementation challenges. The selected trends are the
library commons approach, community involvement, and collection assessment.
In this section, the researcher is revising the challenges, solutions/recommendations of
the academic library trends to build an authentic model that will focus on the challenges and
solutions/recommendations that are most applicable and that will be applied in academic libraries
located in conflict zones especially in Palestine and it’s neighboring countries. This model will
provide guidance for those librarians in conflict zones who can benefit from whatever is suitable
for their libraries and can be applied to their specific situation.
The challenges will be divided into internal and external challenges. Librarians in conflict
zones should prioritize solving the internal factors since they have the greater control, with an
intention to solve the external factors. The model is created to promote authenticity.
In this section, the researcher is assigning an authentic name for the model and the trends
compatible with conflict zones. The model will be called “Academic library trends model in

72

conflict zones” and provide authentic names for the trends that will be implemented in academic
libraries located in conflict zones. The library commons trend will be called the techno-space
hub, the community involvement will be called integration for collaboration, and the collection
assessment is kept the same because it is worldwide known trend that is used in conflict zones
including Palestine.
Model steps for authenticating library trends:
-

Identify a trend in librarianship.

-

Find the normative statements in that trend.

-

Identify the historic and economic privilege hidden in those norms.

-

Identify the distinct challenges existing in a particular conflict zone.

-

Either communicate directly with local experts or consult scholarly or professional
literature produced by local experts.

-

To identify internal and external factors.

-

Develop best practices for mitigating internal factors with the purpose that resolving
internal factors will help resolve external factors by including both factors as part of
the strategic planning of the academic institution.

-

Communicate the authentic trends with other librarians, archivists and LIS in conflict
zones.

-

Implement the authentic trend.

-

Assess the implementation of the authentic trend.

Following are three examples of selected library trends including the techno-space hub,
integration for collaboration and collection assessment. Other trends will benefit from being
authenticated by using this model.

73

Authenticating the library commons trend
This trend deals with creating a “one-stop shop” academic library which is designed to
provide access to technologies that support faculty and students’ productivity, and their potential
for success (Forrest, 2009). Also, a “one-stop shop” creates a place for group study, snacks and
comfort (Martin, 2008) by means of planning, implementing, and assessing library commons
“information, learning, research, and teaching” commons (Forrest, 2009).
From the reviewed and critiqued literature, the researcher identified the challenges that
memory institutions (libraries, archives and museums) including academic libraries in nonconflict and conflict zones encounter that hinder the implementation of library commons. In this
section, the researcher will focus on the challenges and solutions/proposals to create the technospace hub at academic libraries in conflict zones especially in Palestine and its neighboring
countries. From the different studies, the researcher determined that the challenges libraries in
non-conflict zones encounter can be the internal factors that librarians in conflict zones face, as
well as external factors that hinder creating the techno-space hub. After that, the researcher
selects the most applicable challenges, solutions/proposals to academic libraries in conflict zones
especially in Palestine and its neighboring countries.
Academic libraries in conflict zones: challenges and proposals to implement.
Academic librarians in conflict zones face internal and external factors that hinder their ability to
create the techno-space hub. The internal factors include lack of funding and financial support,
space and budget shortage, outdated equipment (i.e. unheated offices, no lights or electricity),
outdated automated systems (i.e. cataloging system and others), lack of collection development,
limited access to research materials, unpaid salaries to librarians, and the high costs and inability
to apply library commons in its absolute form.

74

Academic librarians in conflict zones can deal with the internal factors to facilitate the
creation of the techno-space hub through network building and collaboration with on-campus
departments, partners and experts to provide various and customized services to satisfy patrons
needs; network and collaboration through staff exchange; visit libraries that implemented library
commons and thus benefit from their practical experiences; review the international literature on
library commons; apply for funding; divide the library commons implementation project into
stages; encourage library patrons’ to provide feedback (suggestions and complaints) to
implement library commons according to their needs; and include library commons in the annual
budget of the academic library.
Also, academic librarians should invite publishers to provide training sessions for eresources/databases; encourage their libraries to market their services via social media;
encourage libraries to acquire e-resources from one consortia to avoid duplication of effort,
waste time and energy; and encourage multiple academic libraries to purchase the same library
software to bargain the cost, terms and conditions and customize the software.
In addition, the researcher mentions the external factors that prevent memory institutions
(libraries, archives and museums) especially academic libraries in conflict zones from creating
an authentic version of the academic learning commons. These factors are divided into two
sections; those that exist in conflict zones in general and the others are special conditions related
to academic libraries in Palestine. External factors in conflict zones include political, social,
cultural and economic instability; devastation and plunder of cultural heritage and libraries
collection; damaging, stealing and confiscation of library collections; loss of library collections
through bombing and burning; looting the museums’ collections; loss of traditional cultural
heritage monuments and sites, collections, equipment and archives; invasion of the heritage sites

75

and selling the artifacts; and limited protection efforts and lack of support by the international
professional institutions (i.e. UNESCO, ICOMOS, and Blue Shield) for the cultural heritage.
Memory institutions including academic libraries in Palestine encounter external
obstacles such as lack of freedom of movement due to physical barriers (i.e. restrictions, the
separation wall, and checkpoints) which discourages holding library meetings and conferences.
The absence of prompt Inter-Library Loan (ILL), the long time needed for book delivery, and
censorship by banning book titles related to Palestine hinder scholarship and the lack of a
professional LIS program and library professionals limit the service that can be provided.
Additionally, the few Palestinian library professionals currently in libraries got their degrees
from all over the world and therefore bring different library cultures and standards to Palestine.
There is also the absence of a national management body for antiquities and cultural heritage in
Palestine.
Memory institutions especially academic libraries in conflict zones can deal with the
external factors, those existing in conflict zones in general and in Palestine in particular, to
facilitate the creation of the techno-space hub through involving library staff in the development
and implementation of library commons, and retaining the libraries’ and archives’ collection in
safe depositories during the war to return them after the war. Reinforcing networking with the
international library community, and enhancing the power of libraries as safe, peace and refuge
places by providing access to literacy, education and information through the use of technology
are important activities. In addition, enhancing public awareness of the cultural heritage role and
the awareness to preserve the cultural heritage; collaboration and networking among local
experts/organizations and with international organizations to preserve the cultural heritage,
encourage local people to be involved in the preservation of the cultural heritage. Establishing

76

preservation laws and regulations, developing a standardized and comprehensive disaster
management plan and preservation framework for memory institutions by referring to the
existing literature, implementing risk assessments and evaluations, digitizing the most at risk
collections are important steps in protecting the collections. Urging international organizations
“i.e. UNESCO, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), Blue Shield, the
World Heritage Committee and the European Union (EU)” to support preserving the cultural
heritage, provide professional training (i.e. short courses, and workshops); and provide funding
support are important components.
Efforts must be applied to establish a Library and Information Science program
compatible to the Palestinian needs that is readily available.
These proposed solutions will help memory institutions (i.e. libraries, museums and
archives) especially academic libraries in Palestine and the neighboring countries to become 21st
century institutions and to facilitate creating the authenticated learning common.

Authenticating the community involvement trend
Integration for collaboration is an emerging trend of the 21st century academic libraries. It
focuses on the importance of connections, communication and relationships with library patrons
(Schwartz, 2013), and reinforces public participation and decision-making (Britto, 2011) to
improve public services and build the library’s social role (CSV Consulting, 2006), (Goulding,
2009). Also, it helps library patrons’ to consider and express their views on how their particular
needs can be best met (Goulding, 2009). In addition, “One size does not fit all” (Britto, 2011)
means that academic libraries have different patrons. These patrons have different needs, and
librarians are responsible to serve and satisfy these needs, and to involve patrons in the decisionmaking process for the development of academic libraries (Woodward, 2009).
In this section, the researcher focuses on the challenges and proposals that libraries
encounter in non-conflict and conflict zones. She divided them into internal and external
challenges with solutions related to each of these challenges. The reviewed and critiqued
literature focused on the role of libraries, librarians, and patrons engagement in the decision
making process. Further, the researcher is using the reviewed and critiqued literature to discuss
the challenges that prevent academic libraries, librarians, and patrons from implementing The
integration for collaboration trend, and proposals to help them in future implementation.
Academic libraries in conflict zones: challenges and proposals to implement.
Academic libraries in conflict zones encounter internal challenges; library patrons request and
expect fast, easy and smooth access to information, flexible and comfortable places where they
can collaborate with colleagues, friends, classmates, and instructors. Also, these patrons require
information specialists’ assistance to navigate the library’s online resources. Other challenges
include economic challenges, budget cuts decreased working hours and limited staffing.

79

Academic libraries in conflict zones can overcome these obstacles by encouraging
librarians to obtain the skills needed to serve different patrons information needs. These skills
include information skills, collaborative skills, and marketing skills (Meglio, 2012, p. 15);
obtaining knowledge about new technologies and teaching techniques, developing new services
for library patrons, designing and uploading computer programs, providing effective and
comfortable library spaces (as a place for teaching, learning and research) and by creating
information and learning commons, and maker spaces. This supports teaching and learning goals
and encourages satisfied patrons to become involved in the development of academic libraries.
Other solutions include collaboration with various on-campus departments “i.e. IT
services, writing and research, study skills, multimedia creation, course tutoring, advising, and
support for teaching and learning”. For research, service-learning projects, one can build
computer technology for information access, planning and building customized IC” and
programs to support and satisfy patrons’ pedagogical and curricular needs. Building connections,
communication, and relationships with library patrons “faculty and students” and the
community, encourage them to actively participate in the decision-making process “i.e. share
their ideas and needs, feedback and assessment of the library services” to help improve library
services and effectiveness to satisfy patrons needs.
Encouraging networking, cooperation, collaboration and partnerships with other
academic libraries, the academic community, and diverse kinds of libraries within the
community strengthens what academic libraries can do, connecting with potential stakeholders,
public entities, non-library agencies involved in related activities and community-based
institutions for volunteering and collaborative projects “i.e. implementing IC service model” are
important steps. Applied research that can facilitate engaged learning, involves students.

80

Students can also help deliver library services by helping to provide learning, technology, and
referral support services to other students. These services might include IT support, general
campus information, library research skills, reference and circulation, tutoring, writing support,
and peer academic coaching. Other library partners on-campus including IT services, and the
writing center can develop partner to apply outreach programs to students increase patrons’
awareness of available information resources offered by the library, and increase their
knowledge of how to use these resources to enhance their information literacy skills.
In addition, the researcher mentions the external factors that prevent memory institutions
(libraries, archives and museums) especially academic libraries in conflict zones from
implementing the integration for collaboration trend. These include political uncertainty,
plundering of libraries resources, burning of libraries, and devastation of the cultural heritage in
war-torn zones.
Specific conditions that the Palestinian community encounters which affect academic
libraries include the Israeli occupation; physical barriers “the Israeli separation wall and
checkpoints”. The absence of sufficient library professionals whose backgrounds and
understandings are compatible to provide service is an issue. Library professionals got their
degrees from all over the world and brought various library backgrounds that are not compatible
to the Palestinian community’s needs.
Academic libraries can overcome the external factors. These solutions collected from the
LIS trend literature while focused on public libraries in many cases can be applied to academic
libraries in conflict zones. These libraries have to emphasize intellectual freedom, funding, core
values, outreach, innovation, funding and adaption to patrons’ needs by providing the best
services. They help their communities by offering refuge, sanctuary, and an avenue for hope by

81

offering specialized services. Libraries must enhance their role in the education system “i.e.
teaching, and internet services such as Skype. At the same time, they need to be prepared to
convert libraries basement storage spaces into bomb shelters.
In addition, academic librarians should strengthen their collaboration with other
stakeholders to build the libraries of the 21st century (i.e. building IC, learning commons and
maker spaces); encourage collaboration with stakeholders “i.e. international organizations and
the government” to rebuild the libraries and preserve their archives through digitization projects.
Collaboration among local communities and stakeholders to manage, preserve and rebuild the
cultural heritage is an important component. Making training courses and workshops available to
librarians to assist them in delivering services to patrons is the next step.
It is important for academic libraries to establish a country and international level
consortium to enhance collaboration among the several stakeholders; national libraries, library
associations, international academic libraries and international library associations. This will
facilitate sharing resources and has the potential to minimize libraries costs and dependence on
outside suppliers. Establishing a committee for academic libraries to encourage academic
professionals’ cooperation through Listservs, blogs, online forums and social networking sites
will enhance libraries collections and services and reduce costs to benefit the academic and
research communities.
Academic libraries in Palestine can begin to overcome external obstacles through
collaboration between local and international institutions for financial support to create new
services that will support and satisfy patrons’ needs. Encouraging collaboration between the
Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and other local, national and international institutions

82

to develop a domestic LIS program would be an important step in meeting local needs for
librarians.
In conclusion, integrating the authenticated community involvement trend will help
academic libraries to build suitable places to satisfy patrons’ needs and preferences, and create
livable and workable spaces.

Authenticating the collection assessment trend
Collection assessment is an emerging trend in the collection development (Knievel et al.,
2006) decision making process (Johnson, 2016) in academic libraries. It deals with qualitative
and quantitative analysis of libraries’ collection (Johnson, 2016), contributes to students’
development, and helps libraries to define how its’ various and specialized resources support
academic research and teaching (Follow, 2015).
The researcher uses the reviewed and critiqued LIS trends literature to emphasize the
challenges that academic libraries encounter that hinder their ability to implement collection
assessment in conflict zones. Proposals for implementation to overcome these challenges are
presented.
Academic libraries in conflict zones: challenges and proposals to implement.
In order to maximize support, library expenditures need to support the strategic plan.
Increased costs of journals and databases continue to place additional pressure on funds. In
addition, academic libraries suffer from the lack of clear expectations. Patrons lack awareness of
library collection development policy and procedures when they exist. There are no collection
development policies or policies that are out of date and other limitations. Some librarians lack
confidence that the assessment process will enhance students’ learning. They may face that
others may use the assessment information against the library. Librarians need to follow the
latest research within LIS, to understand the need for a comprehensive collection assessment
model.
Academic libraries in conflict zones can overcome the internal challenges to creating a
patron-focused learning culture by ensuring that libraries mission, plans and policies support the
information and communication needs of library patrons. Academic libraries should be part of

85

the strategic planning process of the academic institution so librarians know what the university
expects of them so they can plan accordingly.
Assessment should be part of the library’s strategic plans and library professionals
regular tasks. Building trust relationships with library faculty and staff to ensure that the
assessment results are not used against them is a component of this. Providing assessment
training for library faculty and staff, and providing technologies to boost data collection and
analysis need to be a priority. Obtaining university and departmental funding to acquire
collections for new programs, and allocate library budget to adjust changes in the academic
institution’s mission are a continuing responsibility.
Librarians should maintain an ongoing communication with library patrons through needs
assessment, quality outcome and satisfaction measurements. They engage patrons in the
collection development process “i.e. request their feedback and suggestions” and can as so by
initiating a collection development committee for regular assessment of library collections and
the collection development policy. Librarians have to develop and/or select assessment methods
that are compatible with the library’s and academic institution’s mission, vision, and objectives
to satisfy patrons’ needs.
Suggested collection assessment methods include circulation data analysis, Inter Library
Loan (ILL) data analysis, a combination of circulation and ILL data analysis, and proportionate
circulation patterns statistics by depending on a user factor ratio. This user factor ratio depends
on the percentage of expected use and ILL circulation request, capacity data, usage data,
collection expenditures analysis, citation analysis; and LibQual+ analysis.
Academic librarians should expect the collection development committee to hold regular
meetings and to carry out assessments on a university-wide and across all disciplines. Librarians

86

must be responsible to educate and inform their patrons about the available library resources that
will satisfy their learning, teaching and research needs. Librarians need to invite other units on
campus and patrons to discuss transferring print resources to off-site storage and purchasing eresources. While this will address space issues, it raises questions of access and the discussion of
how to move forward needs to have input from all stakeholders.
Academic libraries in conflict zones encounter external obstacles unique to them that
hinder them from implementing collection assessment. These include lack of security, bombing
of the libraries, devastation of libraries and their resources, censorship on the library’s collection
development policy and library collections, strict circulation policies, delays of book deliveries,
severe book shortages, and irregular communication levels between local and international
parties.
Academic libraries in conflict zones can overcome the external obstacles through
developing library collections that include print and e-resources, improving the relationship with
local and international libraries and library professionals, and enhancing collaboration with on
and off campus departments to obtain financial and professional support.

Summary of general recommendations
Suggestions for general implementation may be divided into four sections: proposals to
help solve the internal challenges that libraries in conflict zones encounter, raise awareness of
communities in conflict zones, promote collaboration efforts, and ideas for future research.
Solving internal challenges that libraries in conflict zones encounter:
These solutions can be used by librarians in conflict zones and in chronic countries for
resilience; these countries which do not have yet real conflict but they should be prepared to how
to overcome any challenges they might encounter.
-

One ideal outcome in areas where instability happens periodically as part of the strategic
planning, develop the type of contingencies that make use of the lessons learned after
conflict is broken out.

-

Libraries should be proactive through outreach the community to provide the services
that best suit their needs. These services include providing training sessions for eresources/databases by publishers, and marketing the library services via social media.

-

Librarians must emphasize having greater and multiple communication channels by
distribute networking (decentralizing resources) and expertise.

-

Initiate LIS program to be compatible to the local needs of the community in conflict
zones. This program may start as short courses provided online through webinars or
onsite and encourage exchanging expertise by collaboration between local, national, and
international library professionals.

-

Initiate online LIS program.

89

-

Librarians in conflict zones have common goals and so they have to collaborate towards
achieving these goals. One of the most important goals is to work towards mitigating the
effects of the internal challenges.

-

Because libraries in conflict zones are targeted, they should plan to overcome the
challenges. Even though they do not have any control over the external factors, they
should have contingency plans to solve the internal factors since they have the greater
control over these factors.

-

Design programs for librarians with different backgrounds to work together. This can be
done by encouraging library professionals who got their degrees from different parts of
the world to discover the similar experiences they gained through collaboration to share
the best practices to better serve library patrons.

-

The libraries budget must be allocated towards acquiring the resources needed to best
serve library patrons. These resources include various print and electronic resources,
library commons, and for current and future projects.

-

Encourage libraries to acquire e-resources from one consortia to save time and effort.

-

Encourage collaboration among academic libraries to acquire the same library software to
negotiate the price, terms and conditions, and customize the software.

-

Involve library patrons in the decision making process of re-arranging furniture,
purchasing new equipment, and re-modeling.

-

Offer specialized services for refugees such as Skyping with relatives, sending scanned
identity documents to displaced persons, and using basement as refuge space.

-

Prepare storage areas for library collections for protection such as homes, or other safe
storage areas outside the libraries.

90

-

Emphasize remote storage areas for library collections.

-

Devastated libraries, archives, and museums should have multiple storage platforms for
access and retrieval of print and e-resources.

-

Because students sometimes are embarrassed to ask questions to librarians, train student
workers to provide reference services to answer requests in various areas such as social
sciences, technology, business, history and others that is part of the university curriculum.

-

Provide instruction sessions about library resources and services, circulation and
technology services.

-

Work to have the library budget/planning made part of the university planning process.

-

Encourage academic libraries to collaborate with various on-campus departments to
provide IT support services, general campus information, writing and research support,
library research and study skills, reference and circulation services, multimedia creation,
course tutoring, advising, and support for teaching and learning.

-

Emphasize partnership among libraries, other institutions such as IT and request funding
to build collaborative space for library patrons.

-

Encourage libraries to use the collection assessment methods compatible to their needs
such as collections usage data, capacity data, collection expenditures analysis, circulation
data analysis, ILL data analysis, citation analysis, and LibQUAL+ analysis.

Raise awareness of communities in conflict zones include:
-

This research study has to be presented at local, national and international conferences
(Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) conference, Middle East
Librarians Association (MELA) conference, and others) to increase the awareness of

91

academic libraries and organizations in non-conflict zones about the importance of this
research.
-

Increase the awareness about the emerging academic library trends in conflict zones by
holding workshops, training courses and seminars, inviting national or international
expertise to exchange experiences and provide proposals to better deal with the obstacles
in conflict zones.

Promote collaboration efforts include:
-

Encourage academic libraries to work to get librarians to be part of the strategic planning
of the academic institution.

-

Collaboration between libraries in conflict-zones, non-conflict zones and international
organizations for funding and exchange human expertise to implement these trends in
conflict zones.

-

Other studies related to emerging library trends in conflict zones can be published and
presented in such conferences as well.

-

Since the ARL is the association who initiated the LibQUAL+ to assess library
collections; libraries in conflict zones can collaborate with ARL to use LibQUAL+ and/or
create an assessment method/s that best apply to conflict zones.

-

Due to the expensive membership fees for applying to SLA, ALA and other library
associations, librarians in conflict zones are encouraged to network by applying for
sponsorship from international institutions perhaps IFLA.

-

Contribution by librarians in conflict zones through establishing a course about libraries
in conflict zones to be part of the LIS program in non-conflict and conflict zones. This
will help increase the awareness of library professionals in non-conflict zones about the

92

situation of libraries in conflict zones and help collaborate by sharing the best practices
among librarians in non-conflict and conflict zones to better improve the situation.
-

Librarians should attend courses or workshops on peace and conflict resolution and
universities must include them in their curriculum.

Ideas for future research include:
-

Collaborative research efforts between library researchers and academic librarians in
conflict zones to study the emerging trends and the unique conditions specific to each
conflict zone by applying primary research methods (i.e. interviews, surveys, and others)
to envision the experiences of local librarians and provide solutions.

-

Collaborative efforts can be made between the Association of College and Research
Libraries (ACRL) and academic librarians in conflict zones to focus on studying the
emerging trends in academic libraries in conflict zones.

-

Academic librarians should focus on studying the role of academic libraries within the
community by collaborating with public libraries and sharing of activities.

-

Further studies can focus on discussing a holistic collection assessment method/s that can
be applied in conflict zones which takes into consideration the specific conditions unique
to each conflict zone.

-

Future studies need to recognize that collection and services assessment studies and
implementation are interconnected and both enhance the services provided to library
patrons.

-

Ultimately, an international professional organization that is designed explicitly to bring
together librarians who serve in a conflict zone, perhaps working with IFLA, would allow

93

for more rapid sharing of innovations, the sharing of best-practices, and a sense of
solidarity with one another in what is a long, difficult, and important endeavor.

94

CONCLUSIONS
This study was designed to answer the two research questions: Do selected trends in the
library literature take into account the realities of libraries and librarians in conflict zones, and
can the experience of librarians in conflict zones be used to provide a better model for
implementing these trends? It emphasized that there is no scholarly research exists to critique
these trends, libraries promote improved models of service by combining the expertise of the
broader profession with local innovation, good libraries promote stable societies and economic
opportunities. This study hopes to contribute to a recognition that a balanced approach to
studying academic library innovation in conflict zones is needed. It continued by identifying
academic library emerging trends from various LIS resources such as ACRL and by LIS
scholars; Dahlkild, Forrest and Halbert, and Schwartz. There trends include ACRL 2016
emerging trends such as “research data services (RDS), digital scholarship, collection assessment
trends, content provider mergers, evidence of learning, new directions with the ACRL
framework for information literacy, altmetrics, emerging staff positions, and open educational
resources” (C&RL News, 2016). “Libraryness”, and “Information Technology growth and
outcome” (Dahlkild, 2011). The “one stop shop” library by planning, implementing, and
assessing library commons (Forrest & Halbert, 2009). Community involvement is an emerging
part of the 21st century libraries (Schwartz, 2013).
The researcher presented three of the emerging trends within academic libraries by
reviewing different studies for academic libraries that are implementing or planning to
implement these trends. Special emphasis was given to academic libraries which are located in

95

conflict zones. Academic librarians in conflict zones are aware of academic library trends and
are planning to apply them in these areas. The researcher focused on three trends that can be
applied in conflict zones including the library commons approach, community involvement, and
collection assessment. The researcher started with some examples about the challenges libraries
encounter in conflict zones such as Palestine and Iraq followed by a detailed discussion about the
three emerging trends that can be applied in conflict zones.
The researcher used the analytical-critical method to analyze a discourse which is the
library trend literature with the purpose of revealing and critiquing assumptions made from
positions of economic and historical privilege. These assumptions made by forecasters who have
the privilege to not consider political instability, unstable economies and unreliable technological
infrastructure.
It entails an analysis and critique. The analysis is a review of the LIS literature regarding
the emerging trends in academic libraries to determine which trends being applied in conflict
zones are problematic. The critique is in the form of a reasoned argument, supported by
published accounts that the LIS literature does not adequately address the challenges librarians
encounter in conflict zones, or how they deal with these challenges, and how these challenges
affect their transition process to digital places.
The researcher collected data from various sources including scholarly, and peer
reviewed material from the LIS literature. Reports by academic librarians involved in their
libraries transition process, or that note any challenges that hinder their transition process. The
result of this analysis and critique was a recognition of the need to create an authentic model.
Then the researcher continued the discussion about academic library trends in conflict zones by
defining conflict zones and each of the three selected trends, and providing examples about the

96

experiences of librarians in conflict zones by explaining the challenges that hinder the
implementation of each trends and solutions/proposals of how they dealt with these challenges.
Conflict zones are places of war, dispute, political instability, rebellion, and intense
chaos; they demonstrate eventual threats, discomfort to people in their daily lives by
disorganizing substantial services such as housing, transportation, communication, sanitation,
water, and health care (Anderson, Markides, & Kupp, 2010), (Schwarz & Perry, 1994). This
happens through bombings, harm to people, and political jeopardizes; and demand the support
from people outside the affected society (Henisz, 2000), (Schwarz & Perry, 1994), (Dai, Eden, &
Beamish, 2013), (Prasad & Prasad, 2009).This study provided examples of zones that are still in
conflict and those that had suffered from conflict in the past. These zones such as Palestine,
Syria, Iraq, Germany during the World War II, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Kosovo, and others in
different parts of the world.
This study continued by defining the Library Commons approach as a “one-stop shop”
(Forrest & Halbert, 2009), and focusing on the reasons that encouraged academic libraries to
adopt this trend. These reasons are the Rapid development of Information Technology, evolving
students needs, and changing in higher education teaching methods created the need for
academic librarians to transform their libraries from traditional to digital places.
It also mentioned that the community involvement focuses on public participation to
improve public services and build the library’s social role (CSV Consulting, 2006), which helps
people to consider and to express their views on how their particular needs can be best met
(Goulding, 2009).

97

Collection assessment involves the analysis of libraries’ collections to measures how
those collections support specific subjects, to support the academic needs “learning & research”
of library patrons (Johnson, 2016).
In addition, the researcher provided examples for each trend. The library commons
approach includes examples from Kosovo (Riedlmayer, 2000), Palestine (Bergan, 2000) and Iraq
(Spurr, 2007). Community involvement include examples from Ukraine, the refuge role of public
libraries beyond their education role (Roy, 2014), The Library of Alexandria in Egypt (Agresta,
2014), and academic libraries in Kuwait (Al-Kanan, 2016). Also, collection assessment includes
examples form libraries in Iraq pre & during the 2003 war (Qureshi, 2009), and libraries in
Germany pre & during the Nazi regime (Stieg, 1992), (Stieg, 1994).
The goal for the authentic model is to build a critical model for implementing the library
trends in a selective way, authentic to the realities of conflict zones. This model should focus on
ways to empower local librarians to create comfortable and collaborative places for library
patrons, to satisfy patrons needs for growth by facilitating their use of technology and collections
of resources. Enabling librarians to serve the academic institutions, it will be a guide for
academic librarians in conflict zones, as they implement these trends in ways that apply to their
local situation.
In order to propose the authentic model, the researcher reviewed the emerging trends in
academic libraries and then selected the ones most applicable to conflict zones to build an
authentic academic library trends model in conflict zones. The names of the model and the three
trends are applicable to conflict zones in which the model is called “Academic library trends
model in conflict zones”.

98

Each example trend authenticated using this model explores the internal and external
obstacles that prevent academic libraries in conflict zones from implementing these trends and
the proposals to overcome these obstacles, with specific attention towards academic libraries in
Palestine and its neighboring countries. Throughout the study, the researcher studied the
limitations that academic libraries encounter within each country and provided solutions which
can be generalized with a specific attention towards each country. The researcher used the
limitations and solutions/recommendations to build a model for academic libraries to implement
three of the emerging trends that were selected from the academic library trends literature.
The researcher found that the library trend discourse does not take into account the
realities of conflict zones. Library service in conflict zones is a category whose similarities
warrant more research. Local librarians have created innovative solutions to provide service in
conflict zones and thus should feel empowered to critique these trends by combining their
knowledge of emerging trends of LIS profession with local institutional awareness and regional
focus. This research study concludes that it is the first one that is conducted about academic
libraries located in conflict zones, it is a critical analysis (review and critique) of three of the
most applicable academic library trends to build an authentic model to evolve library services
offered, to meet the needs of local users, and to help facilitate the libraries transition from
traditional to digital places.
The selected academic library trends in conflict zones and the authentic trends were
dependent on the researcher’s experience as an academic library practitioner in conflict zones,
and upon the reviewed and critiqued LIS trends literature which works as a guide, taking into
consideration the specific issues unique to each conflict zone. The literature of library trends do
provide guidance on anticipated areas of change in service, but also sets the standard for what so-

99

called good, modern libraries should be doing. There exists a need to adopt a more authentic,
local model of library trends, and for those trends to be compatible with the needs of patrons in
conflict zones. This will result in more sustainable service.
