DEDICATION

This dissertation is dedicated to my mother, Joan C. Kaible Stuart – the first person in her
family to ever attend college. She passed on to me her passion for learning and her buoyant and
indefatigable curiosity about life. Her inspiration, encouragement, and support led me to—and
through—this ultimate educational journey.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The first person I want to thank is the individual who started me on this journey – and
then stuck with me every grueling inch of the way, even until the final hour of editing before the
submission deadline. This has been such an amazing experience, and I am so grateful to you for
planting the seed, and being a role model and a mentor. Thank you for your encouragement,
support, advice, patience, and friendship.
To my faculty committee, I am so honored to have had the opportunity to study with
professors of your caliber and experience. I learned so much from all of you, in so many ways.
To Dr. Kathleen King, for your inspiration and thoughtful direction—and many kind words
along the way. To Dr. William Young, who became my champion in resolving bureaucratic
challenges, and for your sense of humor at just the right moments. To Dr. Donald Dellow, for
your extraordinary insight into how universities work, for your attention to detail, and for
introducing me to Bolman and Deal. To Dr. Robert Sullins, for your clarity and talent for
analysis, and your willingness to take a chance on a student you didn’t know. I am also
extremely grateful for your help in supporting my initial idea for this dissertation, and initiating
my introduction to the library leaders in this study.
And to all of you, thank you for sharing your passion for education.

ABSTRACT

During the past five years (2010-2015), U.S. universities experienced a simultaneous
downturn in financial support along with rapid changes in technology and increased demand for
accountability. Academic libraries, among the most central and visible units in the university
system, were often at the forefront of financial cutbacks and increased pressure to demonstrate
both unit effectiveness and closer alignment with the overall institutional mission. Little
research existed to document academic libraries’ changes during this volatile period in history, or
how the role of the academic library as part of the university system evolved during this period.
Through interviews with the library leaders at four public, doctoral, comprehensive research
universities in Florida, and an examination of a variety of documents, artifacts, news sources,
and electronic and other resources, this qualitative multiple case study explored how four
academic libraries were reframed, using the analytic lens of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory of
reframing organizations. The evidence from this study revealed these four libraries
demonstrated engagement in strategic changes across all four of the frames of Bolman and
Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing organizations to become innovative, agile, pro-active
organizations closely involved in the academic enterprise of their parent universities, and with a
reimagined sense of place and purpose as the symbolic heart of the campus. A clear
understanding of the activities of these four libraries in reframing their organizations may better
inform the future evolution of academic libraries in higher education.

CHAPTER ONE:
INTRODUCTION

The academic library in higher education has traditionally been viewed as a repository for
books and publications and a destination site for the retrieval of information. That role remained
relatively unchanged for centuries, until the late 20th century advances in technologies of
electronic communication and information retrieval forced academic libraries to embrace new
pathways to deliver information to students and faculty (Brinley, 2012). In 2002, Wendy Lougee
published a white paper calling for the need for radical transformation of the mission of
academic libraries into “diffuse libraries,” moving from their passive role as storehouses of
knowledge to more a more active role as strategic partners in the educational mission of the
university. Several other researchers made similar predictions for the need for change (Attis,
2013; Dillon, 2008; Stoffle, 1995; Stoffle, Renaud, & Veldoff, 1996). Lougee (2009) and
Franklin (2012) followed these reports with single cases studies of the ways in which two U.S.
academic libraries enacted the type of strategic change identified in earlier predictions. More
research is needed to discover if other academic libraries have made similar strategic changes,
and what these changes may encompass. Frye (1997) documented the ongoing struggle this
way:
Libraries today are in a very real sense struggling to be three different institutions
concurrently: the library of the past, with all of its traditional expectations about building
comprehensive collections and providing direct access to printed materials; the library of

1

the present, with the extraordinary added costs of inflation, automation, and preservation
of decaying print; and the library of the future, with all the attendant costs of developing
and implementing new concepts, prototypes, and technologies for publishing, acquiring,
storing, and providing access to information. (pp. 12-13)
Rationale/Problem Statement
During the five years in which the major effects of the Great Recession were manifest
(2008-2013), higher education in America experienced a significant drop in public funding and
private giving (Lowry, 2010). Simultaneously, colleges and universities were compelled to
respond to increased demand for accountability, and to demonstrate the value and effectiveness
of higher education (Stoffle, Allen, Morden, & Maloney, 2003). The academic library, one of
the most publicly visible units within the university organization, often found itself at the
forefront of reactions to these simultaneous internal and external pressures (Montgomery &
Miller, 2011). Academic libraries in colleges and universities had to find ways to adapt their
organizations on many levels: a) to address severe financial cutbacks; b) to embrace new
technologies; c) to reorganize the organizational structure and retrain staff; c) to find ways to
demonstrate effectiveness to meet new external and internal metrics; d) to more closely align
their mission to their respective university’s overall institutional mission; e) to explore and meet
rapidly changing user expectations; f) to redesign their physical facilities; and g) reassess and
redesign their role within higher education (Association of College & Research Libraries
[ACRL], 2010; Brinley, 2012; Lowry 2010). Little research exists to document the full extent of
academic libraries’ changes during this volatile period in academic history. More research is
needed to discover how, or if, the role of the academic library, as part of the university system,
has evolved. This multiple case study examined the changes to the academic libraries of four

2

public comprehensive research universities in one U.S. state during the past five years (20102015) to shed more light on how, or if, academic libraries have responded to multiple
simultaneous challenges to their mission, purpose, funding, operations, organizational structure
and operations, staffing levels, technological advances, and other areas. These case studies were
analyzed through the filter of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing organizations.
Bolman and Deal (2008) revealed organizations are complex systems composed of four
“frames—structural, human resource, political, and symbolic” (p. 6), and managers and leaders
need to consider all these aspects to successfully and effectively engage in comprehensive
change or “reframing” (p. 6) of their organization. This multiple case study described specific
areas within the library organization where changes occurred, and whether these changes were
patchwork responses to situational catalysts or part of a strategic and organization-wide
reframing for long-term success. The results of this study will better inform the contemporary
role of the academic library in higher education.
Conceptual Framework
This study began with a brief history of the role of libraries and progress to the evolution
of the role of academic libraries in higher education. This overview then tightened its focus to
the role of academic libraries in multi-campus comprehensive research universities, from their
inception in the mid-20th century to the first decade of the 21st century. Within this summary, a
review was conducted of the ways in which libraries historically demonstrated their effectiveness
and alignment with their overall institutional mission, and the perceived changes to their goals
and services. Current trends and issues in academic libraries were also reviewed.
To place the academic library’s role in context, and define its relationship with the
institution of the university, the literature review also included an overview of the history of the

3

evolution of academic research libraries. Birnbaum’s (1988) systems theory, in particular, were
utilized to situate the dynamics of institutional change within a complex organizational structure.
Birnbaum (1988) noted the organization of universities is unique and distinct from any other type
of organization. He (1988) defined a university “system” as “the dynamics through which the
whole and the parts interact” (p. 1). An academic library is one of the largest and most
prominent “parts” of the university “whole,” and an overview of this relationship and how it has
changed over time will provide a foundation for understanding the current challenges facing
academic library directors.
Finally, a discussion of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing organizations was
critical to understanding both the organization of this study as well as its analysis. The data
collection and interviews were categorized into themes under each of the four frames identified
by Bolman and Deal (2008): (a) the structural frame, (b) the human resource frame, (c) the
political frame, and (d) the symbolic frame. The analysis of the results of this study was also
conducted using Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing organizations.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this study was to describe ways in which the academic libraries of the
four top-tier, Carnegie-classed, public research universities in Florida adapted or changed their
role within the university during the past five years (2010-2015). This timeframe is further
defined by academic fiscal years: July, 2010 through June 2015. This study examined the
activities, services, and administration of the academic libraries of the four public universities in
Florida identified by the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH” with “very high research activity”
(Carnegie Foundation, n.d.b, para. 5). Data was collected through semi-structured, open-ended
interviews with the libraries’ leaders (dean/director), researcher observation of the libraries’

4

facilities including notes and photographs, and analysis of the libraries’ websites and documents
(such as annual reports). A researcher’s journal, written during the data collection and analysis
phase of the study, provided additional data. Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing
organizations provided the framework for analyzing the changes in these libraries during the
timeframe of the study to discover evidence of strategic change.
Research Questions
The guiding question for this qualitative, phenomenological, multiple case study was: In
what ways have the academic libraries of four public, doctoral, research universities in Florida
identified by the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH” adapted or changed their role within the
university during the past five years, 2010-2015 (academic fiscal years), from the perspective of
the leaders (dean/director) of the libraries? Other, more specific, questions arose during the
course of the investigation. These additional questions added further depth to the discussion of
the guiding question, and included:
1. As defined by each of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) four frames—structural frame,
human resource frame, political frame, and symbolic frame—in what ways have the
academic libraries of these four universities exhibited evidence of reframing during
the past five years: 2010-2015?
2. During the past five years, 2010-2015, what was the nature of the relationship
between the libraries and their parent universities and how has this relationship
evolved during this period?
3. How have the libraries’ missions changed during the past five years (2010-2015), and
what factors or environmental forces may have been influential catalysts?

5

4. How have the responsibilities and duties of the library leaders changed during the
past five years (2010-2015)?
5. How have the ways in which the libraries assess and communicate their value to their
constituencies changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
6. In what ways have the libraries’ interactions with students, faculty, and the
community changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
7. When changes occurred, were they library-led or university-directed? If they were
library-led, in what ways did the libraries persuade their parent institutions (and/or
other constituencies) to accept the change(s)?
8. In what ways has the evolution of the virtual library impacted and influenced changes
in the libraries?
9. How have the libraries’ role in the life of the university changed during the past five
years (2010-2015)?
Significance of the Study
The academic library is one of the most public and integral elements of a university.
Within the structure of the university organization, the academic library has traditionally been
recognized as a stand-alone unit, perceived simultaneously as both essential and non-essential to
the overall university mission. It is perceived as essential for research and scholarship, while it is
viewed as non-essential due to a lack of direct student instruction and perceivable direct
outcomes. Historically, the academic libraries’ place within the university was relatively stable,
due to its perceived role as central to the support of scholarship, teaching, and research.
However, due to the 21st century’s rapid changes in technology, combined with reduced funding
following the economic downturn of the Great Recession, and a decline in public confidence, the

6

academic library’s traditional role has been challenged (Baker, 2014; Lougee, 2009; Stoffle,
Allen, Morden, & Maloney, 2003).
More than ten years have passed since the publication of Lougee’s (2002) original report
forecast a watershed change for academic libraries in higher education. Another six years have
passed since Lougee’s (2009) follow-up article and three years since Franklin’s (2012) single
case study of an academic library engaged in strategic organizational realignment with their
parent university’s overall institutional mission. Little research exists to document the ways in
which other academic libraries may have changed during the past five years, and how, or if, their
role within their parent institution has changed.
This study’s analysis of four public academic research libraries in one U.S. state may
serve as a bellwether for the future role of academic libraries in the new landscape of higher
education in America. The results of this study may additionally provide information to future
decision-makers involved in the implementation of strategic change in the structure, services,
and administration of academic libraries. The results may also be of importance in the future
development of relationships between academic libraries, their parent institution, and their
diverse constituents.
Definition of Terms


Academic Library—This study will use the understanding of the term academic library as
defined by The National Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of
Education (2003):
. . . An entity in a postsecondary institution that provides all of the following: an
organized collection of printed or other materials, or a combination thereof; a staff
trained to provide and interpret such materials as required to meet the

7

informational, cultural, recreational, or educational needs of clientele; an
established schedule in which services of the staff are available to clientele, and;
the physical facilities necessary to support such a collection, staff, and schedule.
(pp. 4-5)


Carnegie Classification—In 1970, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching developed a classification system
to define and identify the many different types of higher education institutions in the U.S.
(Carnegie Foundation, n.d.a). The classification category of RU/VH translates to
“research university (very high research activity)” (Carnegie Foundation, n.d.b, para. 5)
at doctorate-granting universities with at least 20 doctorates awarded during the year
reviewed for the classification survey (Carnegie Foundation, n.d.b).



Diffuse Library—Lougee (2009) described a diffuse library as one designed to focus on
the needs of users, and prepared to reach out beyond the historic role and traditional
physical boundaries of an academic library:
The concept of diffuse library recognizes that the information universe is now
highly distributed and the library is no longer the center of that universe. In
addition, the ‘open’ models that were nascent at the beginning of the century are
now far more robust – everything from open access, to open source, to open
knowledge networks, to open communities. In essence, open models are
characterized by collaboration and mechanisms to share intellectual assets that are
less restrictive and intentionally advance the creation of new knowledge. (p. 611)



Epoche—This term conveys a suspension of personal judgment and presuppositions by
the researcher to allow data to be perceived and understood in its own context (Patton,

8

2012). In other words, “everyday understandings, judgments, and knowings are set aside,
and the phenomena are revisted, visually, naively, in a wide-open sense, from the vantage
point of a pure or transcendental ego” (Moustakas, 1994, p. 33).


Great Recession—On September 15, 2008, the U.S. investment firm of Lehman Brothers
went into bankruptcy, and the global insurance company AIG followed suit shortly
afterwards, precipitating the United States and the world into a financial downturn
unprecedented since the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s (Temin, 2010).
Additional impacts came with the nearly simultaneous collapse of the housing market,
the stock market crash in the fall of 2008, a steep rise in the U.S. national debt, and a
sharp increase in unemployment rates (Coy, 2012; Hurd & Rowhwedder, 2010). While
the National Bureau of Economic Research officially designated June 2009 as the end of
the recession, the economic effects continued to be felt through 2013 (Coy, 2012; Hurd &
Rowhwedder, 2010).



Information Literacy—This study will use the definition of information literacy published
by the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL) (ACRL, 2014):
A set of abilities requiring individuals to recognize when information is needed
and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed
information. . . . Information literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning. It is
common to all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of
education. It enables learners to master content and extend their investigations,
become more self-directed, and assume greater control over their own learning.
(para. 1-2)



Reframing—Bolman and Deal (2008) described reframing as “an ability to think about

9

situations in more than one way” (p. 6). Organizations are multidimensional and
complex, and leaders need to consider all the dimensions of the organization when they
attempt to adapt to change, from the people employed to the technology and tools
utilized, from the politics necessary to enact change to the symbols and rituals designed
to implement change (Bolman & Deal, 2008). Bolman and Deal (2008) indicated
reframing involves a leader’s ability to consider the entire organization through four
frames—structural, human resource, political, and symbolic—and to understand these
frames’ connections and implications before “breaking frames” (p. 12) and implementing
change. Bolman and Deal (2008) likened this view to the creation of a “mental map” (p.
12) or a physician’s ability to consider the entire patient before administering treatment
for a specific problem.


Strategic Change—This study used an understanding of the term strategic change as
defined by Dempsey (2012). Dempsey described strategic change as “making choices
that increase impact. It is about moving resources to where there is most beneﬁt, and
ﬁnding the right level at which things should be done” (p. 208).

Limitations and Delimitations of the Study
The cases selected for this study represented a purposeful sample and included the
academic libraries of four public research universities in one U.S. state, identified by the
Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH” with “very high research activity” (Carnegie Foundation,
n.d.b, para. 5), during the past five years, 2010-2015. This approach was intended to reveal
“information rich” (Patton, 2002, p. 563) cases to better understand the degrees of change in
these four specific institutions, in their unique contexts, and to gain clarity on their “principles of
practice” (Patton, 2002, p. 564) through comparative analysis. This study is not intended to be

10

generalizable or to imply similar findings at other institutions. Future research is needed to
determine if these cases represent a trend or pattern.
This is a qualitative, phenomenological multiple case study. Data was collected from
multiple sources, including interviews with the library leaders in each case, researcher
observation, and document and Web site analysis. Each of these data sources has certain
limitations. For example, documents can reveal only a partial history and may reflect subtle or
obvious institutional perspectives (Patton, 2012). Observations are limited to the small window
of time the researcher is in the field (Patton, 2012). Data from the participant interviews carry
the possibility the participants’ statements (because they are self-reported) may be influenced by
the quality of the participants’ memory of events or facts, the political implications of their role
within the university administration, or their interaction with the researcher/interviewer (Patton,
2002). The inclusion of interview data, however, is important since the theoretical framework
for this research is constructivist, which involves the “meaning-making” (Crotty, 1998, p. 58) of
a phenomenological situation by individuals. Such research reveals how participants’
perceptions shape their reactions (Crotty, 1998; Lincoln & Guba, 2013; Paul, 2005). These
limitations will be controlled as much as possible through the method of data triangulation
defined by Denzin and Lincoln (2008). In triangulation, multiple data sources are used to assure
rigor and credibility of the research through cross-checking and confirmation across all the data
sources (Patton, 2012). Additionally, this is a heuristic inquiry, in which the researcher is the
data collection instrument and the researcher’s personal perspective may have unintentional
influence as the data collection and analysis are filtered through the researcher’s own
background, experience, and beliefs (Patton, 2012). Rigor in this heuristic inquiry will involve
bracketing of the researcher’s background, epoche, and continuous researcher self-dialogue and

11

reflection through a researcher’s journal (Husserl, 1913; Johnson & Christensen, 2012; Patton,
2002).
Organization of the Study
The next chapter of this study (Chapter 2) presents a literature review closely paralleling
the conceptual framework described above. This chapter looks at the historic role of academic
libraries in higher education, evolutionary changes to that role, and contemporary issues
affecting that role. A brief discussion of organizational theory, systems theory, and Bolman and
Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing organizations is covered. Chapter 3 describes the
methodology used in this research inquiry, and includes a detailed explanation of the research
design. This chapter also identifies the population sample and sampling procedures used in the
study; descriptions and copies of the instruments used in the study; a discussion of the steps
taken to ensure the validity and reliability of the study; and a description of the data collection
procedures, timeline, and analysis methods. Chapter 4 relays the procedures undertaken and
within-case results of the study. Chapter 5 offers the cross-case analysis, discussion of the
findings, implications for practice, limitations of the study, and opportunities for further research.

CHAPTER TWO:
LITERATURE REVIEW

Introduction
A study of the literature on the history of the development of the academic research
library and its role in higher education in the United States reveals a story rich in challenges,
ingenuity, stubbornness, entrenchment, and advancement as complex as the development of
American research universities themselves. The parallels are many, from the founding of the
first colleges and their struggle to infuse traditional Old World educational practices into the new
world of Colonial America, to the early 20th century college libraries’ efforts to adapt to an
explosion of new media—such as film and sound recordings—and the need to implement
information literacy programs; and from the burgeoning of the true academic research library in
the post-World War II educational boom of the mid-20th century—which required simultaneous
diversification, specialization, and expansion at an unprecedented pace—to the technological,
financial, organizational, institutional, and accountability challenges academic research libraries
face today (Atkins, 1991; Frye, 1997; Shores, 1966; Wilson & Tauber, 1956). Yet academic
research libraries faced an additional, unique challenge imposed by their fluid role in the
academy, alternatively situated within the organization of the parent institution, outside the
parent institution, or as a hybrid of both (Atkins, 1991).
While the depth of literature on the history of academic libraries in research universities
is slim, several scholars published seminal, comprehensive works written from a historical

13

perspective, including Atkins (1991), Lyle (1949), Harris (1995), Shores (1966), and Wilson and
Tauber (1956). Other scholars, such as Thwing (1906) and Rudolph (1990)—noted for their
published histories of American higher education as a whole—included brief synopses of
portions of academic libraries’ history encapsulated within their works. This chapter will present
a review of the literature according to the main themes informing the guiding question for this
research, as well as a review of the history of academic research libraries using the perspective of
the four frame model of organizations developed by Bolman and Deal (2008).
In her seminal publication, Diffuse Libraries: Emergent Roles for the Research Library in
the Digital Age, Lougee (2002) wrote “as is often the case in times of change, organizational
structures and the language for describing an organization’s activities do not adequately reflect
the transformation under way” (p. 5). This statement, by a leading scholar on the topic of the
evolving role of academic libraries, was the inspiration for utilizing Bolman and Deal’s (2008)
theory of reframing organizations as the principal theory for this research study. I believed
Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory provided the best framework to inform an understanding of the
changes in academic research libraries during the past five years. The comprehensive nature of
Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory offered a scaffold by which the many aspects of a complex
organization, such as an academic library in a top-tier research university, may be viewed as
individual processes as well as interrelated parts of the whole.
The complete history of the academic research library in America is lengthy and
complex. I could not attempt to summarize the entirety within the scope of the literature review
for this study. However, the following section provides a focused perspective on issues and
changes in academic libraries, pertinent to this inquiry, in order to establish both the context for
the research and the structure for the data analysis.

14

The Evolution of the Role of the Academic Research Library in American Higher
Education
The Colonial Era
The academic library in higher education in the United States originally began as a
repository for books, but soon expanded its role to enhance classroom education through the
practice of course reserves—setting apart a specialized collection from the academic library’s
broader collections, grouped around particular subjects or topics required for a particular course
or academic program (Shores, 1966; Thwing, 1906). Shores (1966) attributed this change to a
proposal made by Edward Wigglesworth, a professor of divinity at Harvard in 1784. By 1877,
the practice became pervasive throughout the college’s academic programs, thanks to the efforts
of Justin Winsor, then-head librarian at Harvard (Lyle, 1949). However, the traditional view of
the role of the academic library during this period may perhaps best be seen through this
description of Harvard’s library, reported by Bush (1891):
The alcoves of books retreating beyond the eye, surmounted by names of donors to the
library; the busts of eminent men connected with the college; the great cabinet,
containing the card catalogue (sic); the cases of rare books and manuscripts and literary
curiosities; the silent tread of librarians and assistants; and the groined vaulted ceiling
covering the whole and resting upon white pillars. (p. 105)
During those early centuries, books were rare, valuable, and extremely susceptible to
damage or loss by human mishandling, fire, water, environmental conditions, and military
conflict (Atkins, 1991). As a result, the role of the early academic librarians prioritized
guardianship and preservation of these assets, to the extreme that students were rarely allowed
access to the books (Atkins, 1991; Thwing, 1906).

15

The Early 20th Century
By the 1930s, the academic library had begun to take on the mantle of instructional
partner with its parent university (Lyle, 1949; Wilson, 1931). The emergence of this new role
became such a nationwide issue that the American Library Association launched a national
discussion of the topic in 1937, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools
followed suit with a series of conferences resulting in a report listing four key goals for
successful transition to this new role (Lyle, 1949). Lyle (1949) identified two types of
instructional functions common at that time: “direct and indirect” (p. 196). Lyle (1949) defined
the indirect function as activities involved in “making accessible information which may
improve the quality of instruction” (p. 196), and the direct function as one which “involves the
act of teaching” (p. 196). Yet Wilson (1931) noted these activities were not fully aligned with
the mission of the university, and he called for a more strategic alignment of library function
with institutional objectives, to become an “integral element” (p. 443) of the university.
In 1932, the Carnegie Corporation Advisory Group on College Libraries confirmed
Wilson’s (1931) call to action when it published a report based on a three-year survey of more
than 200 four-year liberal arts institutions, which identified a list of proposed standards for what
academic libraries “should be” (Carnegie Corporation, 1932, p. 7). These standards emphasized
areas targeted for the improvement of the “quality both of books and of staff, and . . . the service
of the college library to college teaching” (Carnegie Corporation, 1932, p. 8). The list addressed
the library building itself, recommended the building should be “centrally located” (Carnegie
Corporation, 1932, p. 9) on campus, and emphasized librarians should have input into the
building’s construction and design (Carnegie Corporation, 1932). In addition, the report
recommended the library provide areas for group and individual study by students, and

16

specialized subject collections to enhance teaching and research (Carnegie Corporation, 1932).
Further, the report suggested the library director should be an administrative partner in the
governance of the university, and staff should have appropriate backgrounds in “educational,
administrative, and technical services” (Carnegie Corporation, 1932, p. 10). Wilson (1931)
echoed this when he noted librarians need to be subject matter experts, with the skills to teach
students how to use the library’s resources.
The Post-War Era
This brief background on the expansion of American research universities of this period
is key to understanding the corresponding growth of the academic research library and its
evolving role. Following the end of World War II, the organization of American universities
began to be more complex, as universities opened “branch” campuses, greatly expanded their
physical facilities, and devoted more resources to graduate and professional studies and research
(Wilson & Tauber, 1956, p. 4). The forerunners of what would later be known as American
research universities became more involved in conducting research—catalyzed by the financial
support of government grants—and established university-based presses to publish scholarly
articles (Wilson & Tauber, 1956). While Thwing (1906) noted the origins of the academic
library’s expansion into the role of research library are found in the late 19th century’s fascination
with scholarship and discovery, Wilson and Tauber (1956) indicated it was during the postWWII era when academic libraries moved into a role of critical support for the academic,
instructional, curricular, and research needs of universities. Wilson and Tauber (1956) revealed
the acquisition of materials and the expansion of library facilities became prime goals during this
period, as academic library collections grew “fourfold” to “tenfold” (p. 6). By 1953, 19
academic libraries in the U.S. boasted collections of more than one million items each; the

17

academic libraries of Harvard and Yale, two of the original nine Colonial universities, had
amassed more than five million and four million volumes respectively by this time (Wilson &
Tauber, 1956). Wilson and Tauber (1956) identified the expansion of academic research
libraries during this period as “one of the most pronounced aspects of university development”
(p. 6) in American history up to that point.
In the midst of this expansion, dynamic and rapid changes in new media and technologies
forced a new and additional role upon academic research libraries (Wilson & Tauber, 1956).
Academic research libraries needed to find a way to collect, store, and steward film, microforms,
record albums, maps, photographs, newspapers, sound recordings, and more (Wilson & Tauber,
1956). Academic research libraries also began to engage in partnerships—usually termed
“cooperatives” (Wilson & Tauber, 1956, p. 7)—with other academic libraries and external
organizations to share acquisition expenses, as well as extend their collaboration with other
academic research libraries, nationally and globally, to advance academic research opportunities
for their parent institution as well as the library profession itself (Wilson & Tauber, 1956).
Simultaneously, as academic libraries expanded their external connections, they began internal
programs of specialization in distinct academic subject areas to better support their parent
university’s curricular and research objectives (Wilson & Tauber, 1956). In fact, Wilson and
Tauber (1956) disclosed the purposes of the research university and its academic library during
this period were parallel: “a) conservation of knowledge and ideas, b) teaching, c) research, d)
publication, e) extension and service, and f) interpretation” (defined as “the dissemination of new
knowledge”) (pp. 15, 18). In other words, the overarching role of the academic library at this
point was to both support and implement the university’s goals and mission (Wilson & Tauber,
1956). The teaching function of the library at this time primarily involved information literacy,

18

yet Wilson and Tauber (1956) revealed that as universities evolved more fully into the
contemporary model of research universities, they sought more intercession from their academic
libraries to fulfill new models of teaching and scholarship (Atkins, 1991).
The Mid- to Late-20th Century
During the mid-20th century, academic research libraries enjoyed a golden era, as
described by Miller (2012):
We were truly essential to the academic enterprise in fundamental and unchanging ways,
or so we thought at that time. Our values reflected the values of the academy and our
budgets were considered solid investments in the academic reputation of the institution,
and of course in its success. Presidents in those days liked to talk about the library as the
“heart” of the university and to extol its central role in the academic life of the campus.
Faculty depended on the library for their research and research libraries built huge
collections of materials from around the world to serve their needs, and shared collections
with one another to supplement local collections. … We can now look back on the past
35 years with some nostalgia, because as we all now know, those were the “good ole
days” that are never coming back! (p. 4)
By the 1990s, the development and growing use of the World Wide Web and low-cost desktop
and Internet publishing, created—for the first time in history—significant competition for
academic libraries’ historic role as the center of the information universe and a creeping
perception “that libraries have become irrelevant” (Lougee, 2002, p. 3). Libraries struggled to
adapt to and incorporate new technologies and new processes for cataloguing and disseminating
electronic information, as their historic role of control of information was superseded by the
global open access movement (Lougee, 2002). Within this landscape, academic libraries also

19

had to relinquish their role as sole providers as they became increasingly involved with a wide
variety of new stakeholders and moved to a more collaborative model (Lougee, 2002). These
stakeholders include students (not only university students but also K-12 students), faculty,
researchers, academic administrators, librarians and other professional and non-professional
library staff, elementary and secondary school teachers, the community at large, government
leaders (at the local, regional, and state levels), and business/corporate and community college
partners. In other words, during this era, “the role of the library moves from manager of
scholarly products to that of participant in the scholarly process” (Lougee, 2002, p. 11).
The Contemporary Era (Early 21st Century)
The role of the academic research library in the second decade of the 21st century is
unclear, under threat, and underprepared for change. Rogers (2009) explained:
We believe the old saw that the library is the heart of an educational institution, and we
somehow intuit from that that no matter what we do or do not do, our futures are ensured.
. . . Unfortunately, that is no longer true. . . . Our work and, in fact, our very identity are
threatened by a pace of change that is awe inspiring and not a little daunting. (p. 548)
Despite the clarion calls of many scholars—including Lougee (2002, 2009); Rogers (2009);
Stoffle, Leeder, & Sykes-Casavant (2008); and Wilson (2012); among others—for academic
libraries to transform themselves, for the sake of their very survival, the reactions may have
come too slowly, too sporadically or not at all. For example, Google cornered the market on
digitizing academic materials, while Amazon and other for-profit e-retailers have successfully
converted access to information into a retail commodity, while academic libraries remain well
behind the pace (Dunn & Menchaca, 2009; Rogers, 2009). Yet scholars implied that it was not
too late for libraries to re-envision their mission, reformat their structure, and reinvigorate their

20

relationship with their institutions (Lougee, 2009; Rogers, 2009; Stoffle, Leeder, & SykesCasavant, 2008; and Wilson (2012).
The years following the Great Recession seemed to be a watershed period for academic
librarians as the pressures to adapt to technological change were exacerbated by extreme
financial duress (Dunn & Menchaca, 2009). In a landscape of rapidly increasing operational
costs, severe and sudden—and ongoing—reductions in financial support, increased demands for
accountability, declining use of the library’s physical facilities and resources, and increased
pressure from students and faculty to access materials instantly and electronically, the struggle
for survival transitioned from an intellectual concern to a literal need (Lougee, 2009; Tenopir,
2010; Wilson, 2012).
The publication of No Brief Candle, by the Council on Library and Information
Resources (CLIR) in 2008, shortly before the worldwide economic collapse, was initially
produced as a collective call to action among librarians for dramatic and strategic change in their
academic libraries (Henry, 2008). However, the publication acquired almost the characteristics
of a manifesto and provided a solid foundation for rethinking the role of the academic library
during the volatile years of economic recovery after the Great Recession. Essays in the
document, which were intended to be provocative and predictive about the urgency for the need
for institutional change, came to be seen as visionary and directive in providing an outline for the
future to help academic librarians identify and manage both change and risk (Henry, 2008). One
of the key themes throughout the document is the importance of the academic library’s integral
connection to its university—especially the university’s research function, and the library’s
ability to adjust its processes with agility as higher education itself adapted to ongoing changes
in mission, structure, services, and perceived social compact (CLIR, 2008). The document also

21

postulated academic libraries of the 21st century “will be more of an abstraction than a traditional
presence” (CLIR, 2008, p. 8), and Florida Polytechnic University’s new library—completely
digital and without a single book in its collection—is a case in point (Riley, 2014).
Views of the Evolution of the Academic Research Library in Higher Education in America
through Bolman and Deal’s (2008) Four Frames
Views of the Evolution of the Academic Research Library in Higher Education in
America through the Structural Frame
Bolman and Deal (2008) described the structural frame as the systems, rules, policies,
and organizational architecture (such as organizational charts) around which an organization is
built. In the structural frame, an organization relies on formal and well-defined goals and
objectives, and sets out the procedures, technology, and personnel to meet those goals in the
most efficient and productive manner possible (Bolman & Deal, 2008). An academic library, as
part of a large public university, is most often a bureaucratic institution with a formal hierarchy
(Birnbaum, 1988). In this type of organization, “rational” decision-making dominates: cause is
linked to effect, means are linked to ends, and resources are linked to objectives (Birnbaum,
1988; Bolman & Deal, 2008). The organizational processes are typically “tightly controlled,
with centralized authority, and a clear chain of command” (Bolman & Deal, 2008, p. 50). These
characteristics of American academic libraries developed along with the evolution of the libraries
themselves and their mission of support for higher education (Harris, 1995).
As far back as colonial America, the academic library was central to the success of the
United States’ first colleges and universities (Shores, 1966). In fact, Shores (1966), in his
seminal history of the Colonial colleges and their libraries, stated “American higher education
began with a library” (p. 11). Lyle (1949) indicated academic libraries were integral to the

22

founding and growth of eight of the nine original Colonial colleges. Specific examples of the
critical role of the academic library in postsecondary institutions’ development is revealed in the
following examples.
Harvard was founded in 1636 as the first American college, yet it did not assume the
aspect of a true university until the Rev. John Harvard donated more than 300 books to establish
Harvard’s academic library in 1638 (Bush, 1891; Shores, 1966). While this original collection
was later destroyed by fire, Harvard rebuilt both its library facilities and its collection to become
the third largest academic library in America by the late 1800s (Bush, 1891; Shores, 1966).
Subsequently, the founders of William and Mary—the nation’s second college—purposefully
devoted a section of the institution’s 1693 charter to the imperative of establishing an academic
library (Shores, 1966). In 1701, Yale was established through a donation of 40 “folio volumes”
(Shores, 1966, p. 227) which accompanied a proclamation by the institution’s founding
committee of 11 ministers (Shores, 1966). Princeton was chartered in 1746, however, Shores
(1966) indicated that, like Harvard, Princeton did not fully function as a college until the
establishment of its library in 1757, when Massachusetts’ then-Governor Jonathan Belcher
bequeathed a gift of 400 books to the young institution. Kings College (later named Columbia
University), founded in 1754, was fortunate to receive several bequest gifts of books during its
first half-decade, and additionally engaged its academic library in one of the earliest
collaboratives with the libraries of the New York Society and Trinity Church (Shores, 1966).
Pennsylvania and Dartmouth Universities both received donations of book collections several
years prior to their official founding dates of 1755 and 1769, respectively (Shores, 1966). Brown
University, founded in 1764 and chartered in 1765, was not as fortunate as its predecessors in
receiving library bequests, so its then-president James Manning not only personally donated the

23

first book to his university’s library, but also set out to strategically acquire books for the
university’s library, which he believed was the foundation for “the college’s chances for success”
(Shores, 1966, p. 228; Brown University Library, n.d.). Rutgers’ rocky start left few records
indicating precisely when the college’s library began, but the earliest remaining record shows a
donation by Peter Leydt in 1792 (Shores, 1966).
Today, the academic research library’s place in the structure of the university is no longer
guaranteed (Rogers, 2009). Particularly perilous is the institutional adoption of “responsibilitycentered budget management” (Rogers, 2009, p. 550), which creates financial silos of each unit
within the university and causes the academic library—which traditionally brings in little
revenue of its own—to be viewed by both internal and external stakeholders as both expensive
and extraneous (Rogers, 2009). While some academic libraries have moved to better align
themselves within the organizational structure of their parent universities, these attempts have
been piecemeal efforts at “playing catch-up” (Rogers, 2009, p. 5). The University of
Pennsylvania libraries’ assumption of the overall management of the university’s learning
management system is a case in point (Rogers, 2009). Yet, while some strategic planning is
taking place, the biggest stumbling block facing academic research libraries in this process is the
accurate identification of who their users are, what different users need, and the best ways to
meet those needs (Rogers, 2009, p. 6). Academic research libraries are under increased pressure
to reassess their operations and their services and to communicate their return on investment to
their stakeholders (Rogers, 2009; Taylor & Heath, 2012; Tenopir, 2012). In Florida, where state
universities receive annual financial allocations based on a performance based funding model of
ten metrics tied to institutional strategic plan goals, academic research libraries need to find ways

24

to not only better align themselves with institutional priorities, but also to communicate their
initiatives in support of those priorities (State University System Board of Governors, 2014).
Views of the Evolution of the Academic Research Library in Higher Education in
America through the Symbolic Frame
Bolman and Deal (2008) described the symbolic frame as the organizational culture and
beliefs that cement the organization. This includes the ways in which employees interact with
each other, communal events and their meanings for both the employees and the organization as
a whole, and the symbols the organization uses to communicate various meanings (Bolman &
Deal, 2008). The symbolic frame also includes organizational myths and legends, as well as the
institutional vision (Bolman & Deal, 2008). In the symbolic frame, solutions emerge from the
organization’s use of symbols (such as a strategic plan) to create a shared basis for understanding
and to help employees resolve confusion and find direction (Bolman & Deal, 2008). The
organization also can create transition rituals and ceremonies to help employees mourn the past
and celebrate the future (Bolman & Deal, 2008, pp. 266-267).
For academic libraries, the symbolic frame has been one of the most challenging areas to
engage in change in response to contemporary changes in user needs and expectations. Since the
founding of the earliest U.S. universities during the Colonial Era, the predominant symbols of
the library were books and buildings, the culture focused around collection of information rather
than distribution, and events (such as instructional activities) involved how to use the library
rather than how to use information. The predominant myth portrayed the academic library as the
heart of the university, while the prevailing legend depicted the academic library itself as a
symbol of the quality of its parent university.
Shores (1966) indicated the early Colonial academic library served not only as a

25

repository for books and a center for research, but also as a “symbol of academic life” (p. 212)
itself. The early Colonial library buildings held a significant pride of place on campus, and
served as the site for the college’s academic, administrative, and social events, as well as a place
where students could meet, study, and engage in discussions (Shores, 1966). Shores (1966) even
cited occasions when the academic library was used as a courtroom and the site for a flogging.
In the post-WWII era of rapid university expansion, the symbolic role of the academic
research library continued to expand. The library building remained a physical representation of
its host university’s prominence, and many universities built new library buildings designed
especially to serve this purpose (Wilson & Tauber, 1956). In the 1960s and 1970s, the academic
library building also gained increased importance as a site for students to gather for noninstructional purposes, such as student organization meetings and study groups (Wilson &
Tauber, 1956). The library also became a preferred site on campus for visiting lecturers’
presentations and other special academic events (Wilson & Tauber, 1956).
Today, most academic libraries still maintain a main library building, centrally located on
campus, even if they offer services at multiple locations throughout the university and branch
campuses (CLIR, 2008). This “traditional position . . . reflects its function as a crossroads for
intellectual activity” (CLIR, 2008, p. 5), even if students and faculty rarely visit the physical
facility. If patrons do come to the physical library, they come for much different reasons than
they did in the past: with the ease of accessibility of digital, online, information, students and
faculty come “for programs, a quiet place to work, group study spaces, or to use the computers”
Shumaker, 2012, p. 3).

26

Views of the Evolution of the Academic Research Library in Higher Education in
America through the Political Frame
Bolman and Deal (2008) described the political frame as the process of making decisions
and allocating scarce resources through “ongoing contests of individual and group interests” (p.
194). In the political frame, an organization is viewed by the coalitions, groups, and individuals
who have the power to implement their decisions, and those decisions emerge through
bargaining and negotiation among the coalitions (Bolman & Deal, 2008). In an academic
library, while there is often a defined hierarchy, the power structure is often an “underbounded
system” (Bolman & Deal, 2008, p. 205), in which power is diffuse and loosely controlled, with
many players: library staff and administration, university administration, student users,
governing boards, and community groups such as a fundraising task force. Each group has their
own, sometimes competing, agenda, and these differences become more prominent during times
of adversity (Bolman & Deal, 2008).
During the Colonial era, administrative and leadership support from the college president
helped ensure the central role of academic libraries in the overall institution (Shores, 1966;
Thwing, 1906). Shores (1966) showed at least one president from each of the nine original
American colleges helped advance their academic libraries by personally directing their
administrative leadership, funding, and staffing. In the case of Harvard, the president served on
the council responsible for governance and administration of the academic library, while at
Princeton the president served as the chief librarian (Bush, 1891; Lyle, 1949). More than 200
years later, Harvard’s library was still ranked among the top items in the president’s annual
report (Bush, 1891). In the case of Columbia, its first president, Samuel Johnson, was the former
head librarian at Yale (Shores, 1966). In the case of Brown, its first president, James Manning,

27

exercised his influence to solicit gifts of books and funds from donors and to use university
resources to purchase books and materials for the university’s academic library (Brown
University Library, n.d.; Shores, 1966). In the case of Yale, its early president, Thomas Clapp,
not only launched the construction of new library buildings and oversaw the expansion of the
library’s collection to include subjects such as science and English literature, but he also altered
his college’s administrative policies to require active support and use of the library by students
and faculty (Shores, 1966). In the case of Princeton, its president, Samuel Davies, was the
catalyst for the creation of the college’s first library catalog (Shores, 1966). However, by the
1930s, things had changed dramatically. Wilson (1931) described college administration of that
time as having limited contact and “but slight acquaintance with librarians” (p. 441) and library
functions. The academic library’s relationship with the university president and upper
administration is significant because it implies the library’s connection to the power center of the
university. In a complex organization such as a university, political maneuvering centers on the
allocation of scarce resources (Bolman and Deal, 2008). The closer the library is aligned with
the power base of the administration, the more likely it will have participation in key planning
and decision-making processes involving its future (Bolman and Deal, 2008).
Views of the Evolution of the Academic Research Library in Higher Education in
America through the Human Resource Frame
Bolman and Deal (2008) described the human resource frame as “what organizations and
people do to and for one another” (p. 117). In other words, this frame is analogous to the idea of
families (Bolman & Deal, 2008). The human resource frame is characterized by an
organization’s ability to make people feel good about the job they do as well as about themselves
(Bolman & Deal, 2008). In the human resource frame, solutions to problems or techniques to

28

address change emerge from the organization’s ability to provide employees with training and
opportunities for participation and involvement (Bolman & Deal, 2008).
In the contemporary academic library, globalization and rapid changes in technology are
stressors requiring employees to adapt quickly, often before the library can mobilize sufficient
training programs. Institutional loyalty, longevity, and professional librarians with Master’s
degrees in library and information science are becoming displaced by the conflicting needs for
academic libraries to simultaneously downsize legacy staff and hire additional personnel with the
specific technical skills to meet new organizational goals and mission. The literature examining
the role and professional status of academic librarians over the past two centuries is too vast to
summarize succinctly in this paper (Atkins, 1991). However, several milestones in that
evolutionary process will be covered in this chapter to provide a greater understanding of the
background for this research.
For most of the 18th and 19th centuries, the staff of academic libraries consisted of only a
part-time head librarian, yet this position was often held by the president of the university or
other individual with significant university or community influence and prestige (Rudolph, 1990;
Shores, 1966). By the 1930s, the importance of the role of head librarian from the university
administration’s perspective had disintegrated to the point where Wilson (1931) indicated:
Frequently a librarian is secured fresh from library school and without experience in or
special gift for integrating the library in the instructional program of the college. The
salary paid is low, and the librarian, if called elsewhere at a larger salary, is replaced by a
new recruit. (p. 441)
By the mid-20th century, professional academic librarians took on a new role as instructors in the
new area of information literacy, and the contemporary idea of “dedicated, instructional

29

librarian” (Zai, 2014, p. 2) came into being (Zai, 2014). In the early 21st century, the ACRL
cemented the librarian’s teaching role when it included information literacy in its Competency
Standards (ACRL, 2014).
In 2008, the landmark publication No Brief Candle: Reconceiving Research Libraries for
the 21st Century predicted the retirement of half of the academic librarians currently practicing in
the U.S. during the following decade (CLIR, 2008). The report identified this situation as both a
challenge and an opportunity for academic libraries to re-engineer their staffing policies and to
incorporate a variety of professionals from diverse fields, including technology, assessment,
business/management, and specialized academic areas (CLIR, 2008). In fact, Stewart (2004)
showed hiring of non-professional staff is already outpacing the number of library professionals
who hold the Master’s degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS). At the same time,
salaries for professional librarians are perceived as too low to provide incentive for new MLIS
graduates to enter the field (Stoffle, Allen, Morden, & Maloney, 2003).
While the focus of academic librarians shifts outward toward subject specialization,
technological facility, and embedded librarianship to meet changing institutional goals, many of
the historically traditional duties of these librarians—staffing the reference desk, for example—
have shifted to support staff (Stewart, 2004). This constitutes nothing less than a change of
identity among academic librarians, who must develop new skill sets in order to assume a variety
of new roles: (a) visionaries for the institution; (b) strategists for developing methods to achieve
institutional priorities in research; (c) consultants and collaborators with faculty on curriculum
and research; (d) specialists in technological advances; and (e) innovators in information literacy
(Johnston & Webber, 2004, p. 17). Academic librarians also find themselves at the center of the

30

transition from print to electronic resources, with technological skills now listed as requirements
in most job postings for academic librarians (Goetsch, 2008).
Factors Influencing Change in Academic Libraries
Academic libraries today are under pressure from internal needs, external demands, rapid
technological change, transitions in leadership and leadership styles, financial cutbacks, and a
changed perception among their stakeholders of the role of the academic library in the university.
Any one of these factors alone would provide enough cause for change in the library
organization (Bolman & Deal, 2008). In fact, in the past, libraries have successfully
demonstrated their ability to change with the times, as evidenced by the advance in technologies
from the printing press to the 20th century development of multimedia formats, described in the
sections above. Today, however, academic libraries are experiencing the impact of many forces
simultaneously, which may cause them to change in unforeseeable ways. This section includes a
brief survey of a variety of dominant trends pertinent to this study.
Biennially, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) publishes a list of
the top ten trends influencing academic libraries. The ACRL also publishes a biennial
environmental scan of the issues impacting academic libraries. A survey of the past three reports
(published in 2010, 2012, and 2014) is provided in Appendix A. This survey reveals some
enduring trends as well as singularities. For example, budget cutbacks featured prominently in
the 2010 report only, while the growth in mobile technologies cut across all three reports in
various dimensions. Academic libraries need to not only get ahead of technological advances
such as mobile and tablet computing, but also to enable effective access to information on mobile
devices, or “the university of the future will have no library because students will carry it in their
pockets” (Augustine, 2013, p.373).

31

The importance of assessing and communication the library’s value, meeting demands for
accountability and assessment, and adapting to the changing landscape of higher education also
are prominent in all three reports. Other noteworthy trends include the library’s focus on patron
needs as the driver for change, including repurposing the physical space of the library,
establishing embedded librarians throughout the university, actively supporting faculty’s and
students’ research needs, and managing the tracking and impact of scholarly publications. In the
most recent report, open access and open educational resources—such as MOOCs (massive,
online, open courses)—are prominent.
Economic Impact
While the economic downturn following the Great Recession may have been both
catalyst and driver of recent changes in academic libraries, technological advancement provided
the fuel for the libraries’ forward progress (Smith, 2008; Wilson, 2012). “Scarcity has benefits”
(Wilson, 2012, p. 79), and one of those benefits may be the propulsion from complacency to
action through the implied sanction to jettison what isn’t functioning well and reimagine new
ways of working (Wilson, 2012; Rogers, 2009). However, the impact of the Great Recession
only intensified a trend in declining state support for higher education begun early in the 21st
century (ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee, 2010).
Increased Demand for Accountability
Another important factor influencing change in academic libraries’ is the increased
demand for accountability coming from all stakeholders (Taylor & Heath, 2012; Tenopir, 2012).
Tenopir (2010) identified this as the “value gap” (p. 40) which occurs as perceptions of libraries’
value declines even as the libraries’ costs increase and funding decreases. Both the 2010 and
2012 editions of Top Trends in Academic Libraries, published biannually by the Association of

32

College and Research Libraries, listed accountability among the most important collective issues
facing academic libraries (ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee, 2010, 2012).
One of the biggest challenges in this area concerns how to identify and measure the
concept of value. Libraries have a history of successfully counting quantifiable measures, such
as collection size, number of user visits, expenditures on technology, and so on, so it seems a
natural evolution for academic libraries to adopt the use of the method of return on investment
(ROI) (Courant, 2008; Tenopir, 2010). The common expression of ROI is in the form of a ratio
or a percentage. For example, the ROI for public libraries in the U.S. has been assessed at 4:1
and 5:1, meaning that for every dollar invested in the library, it brings a return of four dollars or
five dollars (Kelly, Hamasu, & Jones, 2012). Public libraries have been collecting data about
their return on investment (ROI) since the early 1970s, and the trend gained momentum during
the mid-1990s, yet by 2002 less than 2% of academic libraries were analyzing or reporting their
ROI (Kelly, Hamasu, & Jones, 2012).
Going forward, the emphasis on accountability for academic libraries will continue to
remain high. For example, the 2011 ACRL Standards for Libraries in Higher Education includes
metrics for alignment with the parent institution’s mission, support of the parent institution’s
institutional effectiveness goals, and collection development to support research and teaching
goals (ACRL, 2011, p. 9). Current accreditation criteria for the academic library also look at its
support for institutional effectiveness and institutional mission (Southern Association of Colleges
& Schools [SACS], 2012). These metrics can additionally include mandated performance-based
funding goals from the state government as well as the institutional ranking metrics used by
ranking organizations such as U.S. News & World Report.

33

While these traditional metrics count data such as graduation/retention rates and other
institutional criteria, a new ranking model, Webometrics, instead looks at the quantity and
quality of an institution’s Web presence and research output for its ranking criteria
(Webometrics, n.d.). Webometrics analyzes overall institutional visibility on the Internet, and
measures research output by counting the number of published papers and citations for faculty
research (Webometrics, n.d.). Shulenberger (2010) noted the academic research library has a
new opportunity to become integral to its parent institution’s achievement of these new metrics
through the publication and management of digital scholarly resources.
These metrics also have the capability to impact public perception of the public good of
both the library and its parent institution (Bailey-Hainer & Forsman, 2005). This perception
swung widely during the history of higher education in America between the two poles of
individual benefit and societal benefit (Rudolph, 1990). The current perception leans more
toward individual benefit than public good following the impact of the Great Recession and the
increase in higher education costs (Bailey-Hainer & Forsman, 2005). Academic libraries’ ability
to demonstrate its parent institution’s research output may go a long way to improving public
perception of the value of public investment in higher education (Shulenberger, 2010).
The Need to Demonstrate Value
Academic libraries’ value also resides in providing quality, for example, by “correlating
library services with student success, retention, and faculty research and teaching” (Kelly,
Hamasu, & Jones, 2012, p. 660). Academic libraries, therefore, utilize the LibQual+ survey
created in 1999 by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), Statistics and Assessment
Program, to capture both quantitative metrics as well as qualitative data gathered directly from
library users (ARL, n.d.). The survey measures users’ opinions in three main areas: information

34

access, quality of service provided by library staff, and the quality and accessibility of the
physical library itself (Cook & Maciel, 2010). Courant (2008) suggested academic libraries’
contribution to the public good, as well as their efficiency, should additionally be considered in
any evaluation of value. Academic libraries must also be able to adequately and appropriately
communicate their value to a variety of stakeholders, from the Provost’s Office to Board of
Governors, from students to faculty, from corporate partners to donors, as a few examples.
Technological Trends
The Horizon Report 2013: Higher Education Edition (Johnson, Adams Becker,
Cummins, Estrada, Freeman, & Ludgate, 2013) predicted MOOCs and mobile computing to
become the top two technological innovations to impact higher education within the next year or
two (New Media Consortium, 2013). More than 500 MOOCs are already in place at universities
around the nation, including Stanford University and MIT, offered through collaborative
arrangements on a single Web site via independent organizations such as EdX (New Media
Consortium, 2013). Up to now, however, academic libraries have had little to no involvement in
the development and implementation of MOOCs, and the libraries’ role in supporting students
and faculty in MOOCs is yet to be discovered (Barnes, 2013; Massis, 2013). The emphasis on
the universality of mobile computing requires libraries to make all their information accessible
through a variety of screen sizes and multiple platforms (ACRL, 2013; New Media Consortium,
2013).
Cloud computing has emerged as an opportunity for academic libraries to establish a
niche both with their users, as the central gateway to the global world of information, and with
their institution as the central authority on complex issues of “intellectual property control, data
protection and privacy laws” (Mavodza, 2013, p. 136), especially as the globalization of higher

35

education continues to expand (Mavodza, 2013). Libraries began migrating their collections to
the cloud in 2010 (ACRL, 2013). Following this transition, libraries realized the potential to join
regional, nationwide, and often globally networked consortia to offer their patrons resources
from around the world through single portal (ACRL, 2013). The growing popularity of personal
cloud computing may offer academic libraries new challenges (ACRL, 2013).
The digital migration of academic libraries’ print collection to electronic resources is a
massive undertaking referred to as the equivalent of the transition following the invention of the
printing press (Lewis, 2007). Digitization of legacy collections, and the acquisition of access to
broad digital gateways of information are changing the academic library’s role from that of
collection manager to content manager, while the focus of the organization transitions from an
inward perspective to an outward view toward users’ needs (Lewis, 2007). This is an example of
what library and information science scholars term “disruptive technology”—following the
phrase initially created by Clayton M. Christensen, a Harvard University professor, in 1997:
The theory explains the phenomenon by which an innovation transforms an existing
market or sector by introducing simplicity, convenience, accessibility and affordability
where complication and high cost are the status quo. Initially, a disruptive innovation is
formed in a niche market that may appear unattractive or inconsequential to industry
incumbents, but eventually the new product or idea completely redefines the industry.
(Clayton Christensen Institute for Disruptive Innovation, 2012, para. 2)
The open access movement is another example of disruptive technology (ACRL, 2013).
Open access provides academic libraries with dual opportunities: (a) to become involved in
publishing content through digital university presses; and (b) to become collaborators with
faculty in managing content of scholarly communications and digital academic journals (ACRL,

36

2013). Open access is traditionally understood to mean content available free of charge, which
carries implications for the academic library’s budget and business model as well as for the
perceptions of faculty regarding the professional credibility and peer-review process of open
access scholarly journals (ACRL, 2013).
Academic Library Support for Faculty
Driven not only by technological advances but also by the fluctuating current landscape
of higher education, academic librarians’ support for faculty also has an opportunity to evolve.
Librarians can assist faculty in a variety of new ways. Activities such as creating course reserves
and providing information literacy instruction for students are traditional instructional support
activities taken to new levels with technology and the advent of the embedded librarian or
blended librarian. Shank and Bell (2011) indicated “the principal that librarians can and should
be integral, educational partners as well as a catalyst for students’ knowledge enrichment and
intellectual inquiry guides blended librarianship. This aligns perfectly with the educational
mission of colleges and universities” (p. 106). In Shank and Bell’s (2011) view, blended
librarians combine subject expertise with technological proficiency and can bring both to bear to
assist faculty with diverse instructional needs and to serve as catalysts for the creation of
effective collaborative groups.
The concept of embedded librarians is different from that of blended librarians, yet, while
the term is currently in nearly universal use in academic libraries, there is not a common
universal definition (Bezet, 2013; Shumaker, 2012). Shumaker (2012), in his comprehensive
survey of the development of embedded librarianship, identifies the origin of the term as an
adaptation of the concept of an embedded element from the science of geology (Shumaker, 2012,
p. 4). The general understanding of the term involves varying degrees of librarian interactions

37

with students and faculty outside both the traditional confines of the library as well as outside the
traditional confines of the library’s legacy collections (Shumaker, 2012). It is the evolution of
the historic role of reference librarian from passive assistant to integral partner providing
personalized, customized information, technology, and instructional services wherever users are,
whether in the classroom, the information commons, or online in formal courses or Internet chats
(Bezet, 2013; Shumaker, 2012).
One area which dominates this conversation is the librarian’s role in teaching. Lougee
(2002) emphasized the need for academic libraries to move beyond traditional concepts of
information literacy of “identifying, finding, and evaluating” (p. 18) to a more inquiry-based
approach involving problem-solving and a sophisticated understanding of “issues of intellectual
property, authenticity, and provenance” (p. 18). Nichols (2008) added academic libraries need to
actively engage in “bringing the library into the classroom” (p. 28) and emphasized the
relationship between teaching and research.
One of the newest trends is research data service (RDS) (ACRL, 2013). With the
growing emphasis on research in higher education, academic librarians are in a position to build
relationships with faculty to support their research needs across multiple platforms in a global
environment, and to help in the management of the large amount of data increasingly required by
funding agencies (ACRL, 2013). This service places academic libraries and librarians in the
center of the university’s mission, as Tenopir, Birch, and Allard (2012) revealed:
The convergence of data-intensive science, technological advances, and library
information expertise provides academic libraries with the opportunity to create a new
profile on campus as a partner in knowledge creation, helping it expand beyond

38

traditional roles of libraries. This new environment allows libraries to take a more active
and visible role in the knowledge creation process. (p. 41)
This process is reflected not only in the sciences, but increasingly in the humanities with the
advent of digital humanities—one of the top current trends in academic libraries identified by the
ACRL (ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee, 2014). In a comprehensive study of
the phenomenon, Burdick, Drucker, Lunenfeld, Presner, and Schnapp (2013) described digital
humanities as:
. . . A reinterpretation of the humanities as a generative enterprise: one in which students
and faculty alike are making things as they study and perform research, generating not
just texts (in the form of analysis, commentary, narration, critique) but also images,
interactions, cross-media corpora, software, and platforms. (p. 10)
The implications in this emerging field for the library and librarians are many-faceted and can
involve librarians as partners in teaching rhetoric as well as technology. The implications for the
role of the library within the university are also significant. For example, Yale University
Library recently received a $3 million grant to fund a new digital humanities laboratory,
including the addition of three new dedicated digital humanities librarians (Buckingham &
Rogers, 2015).
Library as Social Space/Library as Place
With the transition of the academic library’s collection from print to digital, academic
libraries are moving their legacy print collections from places of central prominence in the
library building to storage/warehouse sites, sometimes offsite, and opening up new opportunities
for the library’s use of the newly cleared space to design areas for “social interaction around
learning and research” (Dempsey, 2012, p. 209) (Dempsey, 2012; Dempsey & Varnum, 2014).

39

Gayton (2008) defined social space in the academic library as a place where “students and
faculty collaborate and communicate with each other in the creation of new knowledge” (p.60).
Matthews and Walton (2014) in their survey of the history of library space in the 20th and 21st
centuries, revealed libraries have taken a strategic direction to evaluate and plan their space to
accommodate developments in mobile technologies, social spaces for collaboration and learning,
new ways of teaching, and student expectations for instantaneous access to information. These
“social spaces” include not only include cafes, meeting rooms, collaborative study/research
spaces equipped with state-of-the-art digital collaboration technologies, and a learning commons,
but also support areas for student success such as writing centers, multimedia centers, and
technology rental and support (Dempsey, 2012; Dempsey & Varnum, 2014; Gayton, 2008;
Lewis, 2007; Matthews & Walton, 2014).
Globalization and International Connections
One of the ways in which academic libraries can better align themselves with their parent
institution’s goals is in the area of globalization. University campuses today are multicultural
environments, and university strategic plans often include goals for global outreach. Academic
libraries can contribute through targeted collections development to support both the parent
institution’s global initiatives as well as the diverse populations coming to campus either in
person or virtually through online courses and collaborative research projects (Downey, 2013).
Joint-Use Facilities and Florida Statewide Shared Resources
The idea of joint-use facilities has been around since the Colonial Era in America, both in
public and academic libraries, because of the economic advantages as well as the ability to reach
more library users (Rudolph, 1990; Harris, 1995). In Florida, the University of Central Florida
opened its libraries to area community college students as early as the 1960s (Stahley, 2004). In

40

1999, a report from the former Florida Postsecondary Education Planning Commission (PEPC)
emphasized “the expansion of joint-use facilities as a priority strategy to address postsecondary
access” (PEPC, 1999, p. i). In 2001, the state’s new long-range master plan for education by the
Florida Department of Education, Council for Education Policy, Research, and Improvement
(CEPRI), also encouraged partnerships between universities, community colleges, and colleges
to share resources (CEPRI, 2003).
More recently, the Florida Board of Governors created opportunities for a variety of
shared and centralized digital resources for academic libraries, such as the Florida Virtual
Campus, which includes the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) to provide
“automation services that assist the libraries of Florida’s publicly-funded universities in meeting
their teaching and research objectives for students and faculty” (FLVC, 2012, para. 3). A similar
network, the College Center for Library Automation (CCLA) offers shared services for the
state’s public colleges and community colleges (Task Force on the Future of Academic Libraries
in Florida, 2011). Additionally, the Florida Distance Learning Consortium (FDLC) supports the
state’s postsecondary institutions’ online learning needs (Task Force on the Future of Academic
Libraries in Florida, 2011). Collaborations and partnerships between academic research libraries
and public libraries and schools are also encouraged (Task Force on the Future of Academic
Libraries in Florida, 2011).
Other Trends
Smith (2008) identified six additional environmental trends influencing change which are
distinct to academic research libraries. These factors all relate to the academic research library’s
core mission to support scholarship and research. Smith (2008) noted that while researchers will

41

always need access to information, the following factors, shown in Table 1, influence the ways in
which academic research libraries adapt to changing demands in providing that access.

Information Resources.
Visions of the Future for Academic Libraries
Wendy Lougee, University Librarian and McKnight Presidential Professor at the
University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and a participant in developing the watershed 2008 CLIR
report, No Brief Candle, described above, envisioned the urgent need for academic libraries to
reinvent themselves more than a decade ago. Lougee is identified as a national pioneer in the
42

digital transformation of academic libraries as well as one of the strongest proponents for
academic libraries’ closer alignment with their parent universities’ overall goals (Marcum,
2008). In 2002, Lougee published a paper on a concept she termed “diffuse libraries” (Lougee,
2002, p. 1). In this publication, Lougee (2002) called for academic libraries to change on a
fundamental level:
The past two decades have been a time of tremendous social, economic, and institutional
change for all sectors of higher education, including the research library community.
While responding to the unprecedented development of technology, colleges and
universities have also addressed issues of social relevance, accountability, diversity, and
globalization. Although academic institutions are notoriously slow to change, they have
experienced considerable ferment, prompting shifts in priorities and constituencies and
within disciplines. . . . The changes under way reflect an evolutionary path in which, as
distributed and collaborative models emerge, libraries are taking on far more diffuse roles
within the campus community and beyond. That is, libraries are becoming more deeply
engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge and are becoming essential
collaborators with the other stakeholders in these activities. (p. 1)
Lougee (2002) described her vision as the transition from the academic library’s historic
role of repository to one of service, from that of information collector to information
disseminator—across multiple media and pathways, and from a siloed culture to an integral
interdisciplinary collaborator with the university as a whole. She defined her use of the word
“diffuse” as similar to its understanding in the science of physics, as “the spreading out of
elements, an intermingling (though not combining) . . . [wherein] the library becomes a
collaborator within the academy, yet retains its distinct identity” (Lougee, 2002, p. 4).

43

In 2009, when Lougee published a follow-up to her original document, she revealed that
while some academic libraries had responded to the challenges facing them, they were doing so
primarily on a case-by-case basis as each situation warranted, rather than fully engaging in the
comprehensive paradigm shift she had espoused. Some of the obstacles include a tendency for
libraries to follow the glacial pace of change in higher education overall, an aversion to risktaking practices, lack of adequate funding, the limitations of digital copyrights, and a reluctance
to partner with for-profit organizations (CLIR, 2008).
Despite these challenges, there are indications academic libraries are changing. For
example, the University of Wisconsin Libraries used their funding shortfall as a springboard to
strategically design a new and sustainable business model “internally integrated and aligned with
university priorities” (Wilson, 2012, p. 82). The University of Tennessee Libraries made a
concerted effort to reach out to students and faculty, both within the library and throughout
campus, by using a strategy involving opportunities to “connect, create, collaborate, [and]
communicate” (Dewey, 2009, p. 533). The University of Tennessee Libraries boldly adopted
strategies “using the most resourceful means possible [and] flinging away tried, true, and
treasured methodologies” (Dewey, 2009, 5. 534). Cornell University’s Library followed the
university’s development of a new strategic plan by reformatting their own goals to match and
support the new institutional goals (Kenney, 2009). Taylor and Heath (2012) published a case
study of how the University of Texas at Austin Libraries engaged in an evolving strategic
planning process to undergird all the libraries’ activities, goals, institutional alignment, and
accountability. Franklin (2012) showed the University of Connecticut Libraries took this
approach one step further by developing specific metrics to demonstrate alignment with the
overall institutional mission and strategic plan goals.

44

Visions of the Future for Academic Research Libraries in Florida
In 2010, the State University System Board of Governors convened a task force to create
a roadmap to ensure the future viability and sustainability of Florida’s academic libraries (Task
Force on the Future of Academic Libraries in Florida, 2010). The result was the development of
the Strategic Plan for the Future of Academic Libraries in Florida (Task Force on the Future of
Academic Libraries in Florida, 2011), which called for greater collaboration, innovative
development and use of technologies to provide information access to users, and emphasized the
importance of academic libraries’ role in creating “a 21st century knowledge-based economy”
(p. 14). One notable difference in the Florida plan compared to other states’ academic libraries
included the projected hiring and retention of additional library staff (Task Force on the Future
of Academic Libraries in Florida, 2011). This indicated anticipated growth in the key areas of eresources and technological development, as well as the institutional support to provide a
working environment to support professional development and retraining of existing staff
(ACRL Research Planning and Review Committee, 2012).
Summary
Much has been written in the past decade about the anticipated future of academic
libraries, yet no single vision has emerged to dominate the profession with a clearly identifiable
new trajectory (Baker, 2014). Instead, scholars and academic librarians called for academic
libraries to move in new and unanticipated directions, to become innovators and entrepreneurs,
to become co-creators in the process of knowledge discovery and research, and to become
dynamic and integral partners with their parent institution, and collaborators with their
community (Baker, 2014; Dempsey, 2012; Law, 2014; Massis, 2014; Walter & Neal, 2014). In
other words, the traditional path of adapting to changes incrementally is no longer a viable option

45

for academic libraries’ survival, as revealed in John Seely Brown’s (2012) remarks to the fall
2012 meeting of the Association of Research Libraries:
The challenges we face are both fundamental and substantial. We have moved from an
era of equilibrium to a new normal, an era of constant disequilibrium. Our ways of work,
ways of creating value, and ways of innovating must be reframed. (p. 8)
Lewis (2007) reiterated libraries should “manage this change purposefully and that we
not drift through it” (p. 2). Academic libraries’ innovation strategies also need to be holistic—
taking into account external and internal environmental factors as well as user expectations and
parent institution priorities—and strategically designed (Baker, 2014; Massis, 2014). The
Association of Research Libraries also included the importance of strategic design in their recent
workshops designed to create a vision for the future of research libraries by 2033 (Groves, 2014).
Miller (2012) confirmed that boldness in reframing academic library administration,
rather than retrenchment, is key to the future of academic research libraries. Yet Rogers (2009)
pointed out there isn’t enough data to determine if examples like those libraries described above
are the exception or the leading edge of a trend. Many academic libraries are still encountering
change in a “reactive mode without a purposeful vision of where these changes should lead”
(Stoffle, Leeder, & Sykes-Casavant, 2008, p. 5). Shumaker (2012) described the librarian
profession as “disconnected and stovepiped” (p. xv), and recommended libraries “need to travel,
together, in the same direction” (p. xv). Further, Shumaker (2012) indicated:
The way society handles recorded information is undergoing the greatest change in
centuries (since Gutenberg, in Western society), and we’re likely to continue to
experience accelerating change for the foreseeable future. The mutually reinforcing

46

revolutions in our tools and our social structures have fundamental implications for the
profession of librarianship that we are in the midst of working through. (p. xv)
Bolman and Deal (2008) cautioned organizations in the midst of change to view their
institution multi-dimensionally, through four frames—structural, political, symbolic, and human
resource—to facilitate a multi-dimensional response. Organizational leaders need to consider the
impact of change across all frames to engage in successful and effective change (Bolman &
Deal, 2008). Bolman and Deal (2008) explained “changes rationally conceived at the top [of the
organizational hierarchy] often fail” (p. 377) while “more versatile approaches have a better
chance” (p. 377).
Recent research offered brief glimpses into the many changes in which libraries are
currently engaged. Studies revealed changes through the lens of leadership attributes, individual
case studies, or surveys of changes within a specific department or area. See Appendix B for a
summary of recent dissertations. This study informed a gap in the literature by providing a
broader lens to discover patterns of change among academic libraries in one U.S. state and
described their movement toward reframing their organization. Future research of similar
organizations in other U.S. states may reveal trends in the changing role of academic libraries in
higher education.

CHAPTER 3:
METHODOLOGY

Research Design
Throughout most of the history of libraries and academic libraries, the indicators used to
measure performance were primarily quantitative. Academic libraries were perceived to be
successful based on the size of their collection, the amount of materials checked out, the numbers
of students and patrons entering their doors, the number of staff members employed, the amount
of budget expenditure for new materials, the diversity of technologies employed, and other
similar criteria. These data are reported annually in publications such as the Association of
Research Libraries’ Statistics, and university and library annual reports. However, as described
in Chapter 2, a survey of the recent literature shows a call for academic libraries to re-think this
traditional view of assessment. Especially since the advent of the Great Recession and its
aftermath, when academic libraries’ quantifiable resources shrank considerably and are not
expected to return to pre-recession levels, academic libraries are being tasked to show alternative
methods for the assessment of their value to their institution, and to redefine their role within
higher education (Miller, 2012; Regazzi, 2013).
This study employed the qualitative research paradigm. Qualitative inquiry is the most
appropriate method to employ in studying this phenomenon, for several reasons to be discussed
here. Patton (2002) explained “qualitative methods permit inquiry into selected issues in great
depth with careful attention to detail, context, and nuance” (p. 227). This depth arises from the
collection of data in several formats: interviews with participants who experienced or observed a
48

specific phenomenon or situation, observations of the study site, analysis of relevant documents,
and the researcher’s journal or field notes (Johnson & Christensen, 2012; Locke, Spirduso &
Silverman, 2014; Patton, 2002). Qualitative research is also helpful in exploratory situations or
to understand the human experience of a phenomenon (Johnson & Christensen, 2012, p. 33).
Qualitative research seeks to discover “patterns and relationships” (Hatch, 2002, p. 10), rather
than setting out to prove or disprove a certain idea. Guba (1967) added it provides a “rich and
detailed supply of information about a particular happening in a particular context” (p. 60). This
detail is often provided by multiple individual perspectives of a phenomenon (Schwandt, 1998).
The selection of qualitative inquiry as the paradigm for this study also corresponded to the three
characteristics of qualitative research identified by Hatch (2002): (a) it captured the “lived
experiences of real people in real settings” (Hatch, 2002, p. 6); (b) it showed how the participants
in the study derived meaning from their experiences; and (c) the researcher served as the
“primary data collection instrument” (Hatch, 2002, pp. 6-7).
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical research framework for this study is social constructivist, since it involves
the “meaning-making” (Crotty, 1998, p. 58; Paul, 2005, p. 60) of a phenomenological situation
by individuals (Crotty, 1998; Denzin & Lincoln, 1998). Research conducted in this paradigm
sets out to reveal how the participants’ perceptions shaped their reactions (Crotty, 1998; Lincoln
& Guba, 2013; Paul, 2005, Schwandt, 1998). The constructivist paradigm also presents
“pluralistic, interpretive, open-ended, and contextualized (e.g., sensitive to place and situation)
perspectives” (Creswell & Miller, 2000, p. 125).
Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing organizations undergirded the data
collection and analysis of this study. Large public universities are complex organizations, with

49

shared governance among faculty, administration, and boards of trustees/governors. Historically,
management and performance have not been closely linked (Birnbaum, 1988). However, in the
current climate for higher education and academic libraries in the U.S., as described in Chapter
2, performance and accountability are increasingly important to the university’s and academic
library’s stakeholders. Institutional leaders must find ways to make traditionally loosely coupled
systems more sensitive and responsive to environmental stimuli to meet these new demands
(Birnbaum, 1988). Bolman and Deal (2008) revealed leaders who are aware of all the
multifaceted aspects of their organizations make better decisions about how and where an
organization needs to change. These scholars’ (Bolman & Deal, 2008) theory of reframing
organizations identified four specific aspects, or “frames” of an organization for leaders to
consider: (a) the structural frame, (b) the human resources frame, (c) the political frame, and (d)
the symbolic frame. A multidimensional perspective—and often a multidimensional solution—
leads to successful and effective change within an organization (Birnbaum, 1988; Bolman &
Deal, 2008). Organizations engage in reframing when their environment shifts, when technology
changes, when the organization grows, and/or when there is a transition in leadership (Bolman &
Deal, 2008). Academic libraries are experiencing all these impacts simultaneously. The use of
Bolman and Deal’s (2008) theory of reframing organizations provided a practical and systematic
framework for the data collection and analysis in this study.
Research Method
The research design for this study was a multiple case study. Case studies are appropriate
when the research question involves “developing an in-depth understanding about how different
cases provide insight into an issue” (Creswell, Hanson, Clark Plano, & Morales, 2007, p. 239). I
used a multiple case design to enable cross-case analysis, with the results of each case presented

50

individually followed by a synthesis of the results across the cases to identify and describe
potential emergent patterns (Stake, 2006; Yin, 2009; Yin, 2014). Stake (2006) also identified
this type of research design as collective case study.
Johnson and Christensen (2012) defined a case “as a bounded system” (p. 395). In this
study, a case was be represented by an academic research library within a doctoral research
university in on state in the United States designated by the Carnegie Classification of RU/VH,
during the past five years: 2010-2015, inclusively. The years were defined as academic fiscal
years, beginning in July, 2010, and ending in June 2015. Four cases were examined in this
study. Johnson and Christensen (2012) determined the inclusion of multiple cases yields greater
breadth of information, and allows comparisons and contrasts between the cases. Yin (2009)
confirmed the use of multiple cases also provides a higher confidence level in the research
findings.
Multiple Case Study Research
Multiple case studies examine each of the cases in the study individually, in their own
context, as well as the entire group of cases as a collective entity (Stake, 2006). Stake (2006)
explained this is especially important in research studies of complex organizations (pp. ix-x).
Multiple case study research design “builds on” (Stake, 2006, p. x) the research design of single
case studies, and is considered to fall within the same methodological framework as single case
study designs (Stake, 2006; Yin, 2014, p. 56). However, in a multiple case design, the research
question focuses on the understanding of the phenomenon under study from the collective
experience rather than that of the individual cases (Stake, 2006, p. 6). Yin (2014) noted the
“evidence from multiple cases is often considered more compelling, and the overall study is
therefore regarded as being more robust” (p. 57).

51

Research Questions
The guiding question for this qualitative, phenomenological, multiple case study was: In
what ways have the academic libraries of four public, doctoral, research universities in Florida,
identified by the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH,” adapted or changed their role within the
university during the past five years, 2010-2014, from the perspective of the leaders
(dean/director) of the libraries? Other, more specific, questions arose during the course of the
investigation. These additional questions added further depth to the discussion of the guiding
question, and included:
1. As defined by each of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) four frames—structural frame,
human resource frame, political frame, and symbolic frame—in what ways have the
academic libraries of these four universities exhibited evidence of reframing during
the past five years: 2010-2015?
2. During the past five years, 2010-2015, what was the nature of the relationship
between the libraries and their parent universities and how has this relationship
evolved during this period?
3. How have the libraries’ missions changed during the past five years (2010-2015), and
what factors or environmental forces may have been influential catalysts?
4. How have the responsibilities and duties of the library dean changed during the past
five years (2010-2015)?
5. How have the ways in which the library assesses and communicates its value to its
constituencies changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
6. In what ways have the library’s interactions with students, faculty, and the
community changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?

52

7. When changes occurred, were they library-led or university-directed? If they were
library-led, in what ways did the library persuade its parent institution (and/or other
constituencies) to accept the change(s)?
8. In what ways has the evolution of the virtual library impacted and influenced changes
in the library?
9. How has the library’s role in the life of the university changed during the past five
years (2010-2015)?
Role of the Researcher
Reflexivity and Voice. In qualitative research “the researcher is the data collection
instrument” (Patton, 2002, p. 64) and both an observer and participant in the study (Denzin &
Lincoln, 2000). The issue of the researcher’s voice in presenting qualitative data and findings
was a topic under debate by scholars for many years (Wolcott, 2009). However, the use of the
first-person, active voice in qualitative inquiry is currently considered critical to the authenticity
and trustworthiness of qualitative research (Patton, 2002). Patton (2002) demonstrated “the
perspective that the researcher brings to a qualitative inquiry is part of the context for the
findings” (p. 64). Honest acknowledgment of the researcher’s self-awareness, and accurate and
appropriate documentation and bracketing of it in the research, can strengthen the research
method, as shown in Figure 3.1 (Patton, 2002).
Epoche. As the researcher for this study, I took the stance Patton (2002) described as
“empathic neutrality” (p. 569), to both acknowledge my personal perspectives and set them aside
to conduct an impartial evaluation as defined by House (1980), where “the evaluator must be
seen as that of an actor in events, one who is responsive to the appropriate arguments but in
whom the contending forces are balanced” (p. 93). According to Schwandt (1998):

53

The act of inquiry begins with issues and/or concerns of participants and unfolds through
a ‘dialectic” of iteration, analysis, critique, reiteration, reanalysis, and so on that leads
eventually to a joint (among inquirer and respondents) construction of a case (i.e.,
findings or outcomes). (p. 243)

relationships among the perceptions of the researcher, the study participants, and the audience
receiving the study are illustrated in this visual representation.

Wolcott (2009) added the reader of qualitative research must remain aware of the researcher, and
the researcher’s perspectives and potential bias (even if unintentional), to balance the subjectivity
of human interpretation in the presentation of findings. Patton (2002) called this the “perspective
of epoche” (p. 485). Husserl (1913) identified this technique as bracketing. A formal definition
of epoche is provided in Chapter 1 (page 8) of this proposal, however the common understanding
of the term involves an honest self-assessment by the researcher, presented in clear terms in the
54

proposal—in advance of the data collection process—to identify any and all areas in the
researcher’s background, beliefs, or experiences which might influence the researcher’s
collection and analysis of the data (Patton, 2002).
I am an employee of the University of South Florida (USF) as well as a graduate student
and doctoral candidate. I began as a part-time clerical assistant in the USF College of Business
during 2002. In 2003, I was promoted to a full-time administrative assistant for the USF
Foundation (the university’s direct support organization), assigned to the constituent area of the
College of Business. In 2007, I began a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science in
the USF College of Arts & Sciences. After completing this degree in 2009, I was formally
admitted to the doctoral program in curriculum and instruction, with an emphasis in higher
education administration, in the USF College of Education in 2011. My doctoral dissertation
timeline is shown in Table 3. As my professional career advanced, in 2008 I transferred to the
USF College of The Arts (sic), and in 2013 I was promoted to Administrative Specialist in the
college’s division of External Relations, responsible for marketing and promotion of the
college’s events and achievements. In early 2015, I was hired by the office of the Senior Vice
President for Research, Innovation, and Economic Development as a research services
administrator in the area of faculty awards and honors.
During my professional experiences at USF, I was fortunate to work closely with the
dean’s office in both the College of Business and the College of The Arts (sic), and now with the
Vice President’s office. This provided me with a firsthand view of many of the administrative
challenges discussed in my doctoral courses. As a student, I also witnessed many changes occur
in the USF library during the period of time encompassed by this study. The idea for this
research study ultimately grew from my personal observations of these changes. However, my

55

experience with these changes was entirely from a student perspective, as my position with the
university included no administrative interaction with the library.
Throughout my career, I also worked as a professional journalist and freelance writer for
newspapers and magazines, and have solid experience in interviewing and listening skills.
However, I acknowledge a significant difference in the style and approach of qualitative research
interviews compared with journalistic interviews. In my experience, a journalist conducting an
interview assumes the stance of an objective observer, and stands apart from the events (context)
about which the interviewee is being questioned. The interview questions are probing, directed
toward a predetermined path, and often aggressive in challenging the interviewee’s experience or
interpretation of events.
Qualitative interviews, on the other hand, are more “responsive” (Rubin & Rubin, 2012,
p. 36), with “give-and-take” (p. 36) between the researcher and the interviewee. The researcher
also sets out to build “a relationship of trust” (Rubin & Rubin, 2012, p. 36), empathy and
friendliness with the interviewee (Rubin & Rubin, 2012). The interview questions are openended and, while some of the questions are prepared in advance, as shown in Appendix C, the
researcher is open to following new trajectories as the conversation evolves (Rubin & Rubin,
2012). I used the qualitative interview style for this research. Finally, as the researcher for this
study, I served in the capacity of what Denzin and Lincoln (1998) described as a “bricoleur” (p.
4), one who participates interactively with study respondents, to tell the story of the subject of
this study through a “complex, dense, reflexive, collagelike creation” (p. 4).
Site and Sample Selections
The cases selected for this research were chosen to fulfill, as much as possible, Stake’s
(2000) definition for a multiple case study:

56

…A researcher may jointly study a number of cases to investigate a phenomenon,
population, or general condition. …It is instrumental study extended to several cases.
Individual cases in the collection may or may not be known in advance to manifest some
common characteristic. They may be similar or dissimilar, redundancy and variety each
important. They are chosen because it is believed that understanding them will lead to
better understanding, perhaps better theorizing, about a still larger collection of cases.”
(p. 437)
Yin (2014) added the individual cases selected for a multiple case study should be chosen for
their potential ability to illustrate a phenomenon or portray contradictory results. The cases
selected for this multiple case study consisted of the academic libraries of four public doctoral
research universities in one U.S. state, identified by the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH”
with “very high research activity” (Carnegie Foundation, n.d.b, para. 5) during the past five
years: 2010-2015. This was a “purposeful sample” (Patton, 2002, p. 46) of individual cases.
The use of purposeful samples, as defined by Creswell (2007), is to “inform an
understanding of the research problem and central phenomenon in the study” (p. 125). Further,
the selected cases are criterion-based, meaning that all the selected cases experienced the
phenomenon under study (the criterion) in some way (Creswell, 2007, p. 128). This sampling
technique is recognized as increasing the quality of the study (Creswell, 2007).
To select this purposeful sample, I employed the strategy of “maximum variation
(heterogeneity) sampling” (Creswell, 2013, p. 156; Patton, 2002, pp. 234-235). In other words,
this represents the selection of several cases where the outcome is unknown in advance, in order
to present a potential variety of situations and experiences (Patton, 2002, p. 235; Creswell, 2007,
p. 127). Patton (2002) indicated this approach strengthens the research design, because:

57

The data collection and analysis will yield two kinds of findings: (1) high-quality detailed
descriptions of each case, which are useful for documenting uniquenesses (sic), and (2)
important shared patterns that cut across cases and derive their significance from having
emerged out of heterogeneity. (p. 235)
Stake (2000) alternatively explained, “the phenomenon of interest observable in the case
represents the phenomenon writ large” (p. 446). Academic libraries at large, top-tier, doctoral
universities are at the crucible of change due to their significant and integral role within their
university and therefore provided “information rich” (Patton, 2002, p. 563) and illustrative
experiences for this study. These libraries also are perceived as the “drivers” (Regazzi, 2013, p.
220) of trends among academic libraries nationwide (Regazzi, 2013).
This study examined the top four academic research libraries in one state as the
individual cases for this study in order to gain a perspective of the landscape of change in
academic research libraries across a defined geographical region. For a multiple case study,
Stake (2006) advised researchers not to analyze selected cases too much prior to the study in
order to prevent potential bias in choosing only cases which either support or differ from the
research question. While the optimum number of cases for a multiple case study varies among
scholars, Stake (2006) recommended a minimum of four, while Creswell (2007) also proposed
the number of individual cases in a multiple case study should not exceed five cases.
I selected the leader (dean/director) of the library as the most appropriate representative
to interview, because of the library leader’s unique, overarching perspective of the entire
academic library organization as well as the ways in which the library integrates into its parent
university. The individuals holding these positions were shown to have held their role as library
leader of the selected cases for a minimum of three years in order to provide a longitudinal

58

perspective of the changes in their libraries. The Dean of Libraries at the University of South
Florida, offered his voluntary assistance to introduce me to the library leaders of the selected
cases. The dean meets regularly with academic library directors at the meetings of professional
library organizations. Rubin and Rubin (2012) suggested employing a technique such as this to
help gain access to high-level individuals and bypass “gatekeepers” (p. 80).
I applied for approval with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of
South Florida (USF), and contacted the IRBs of the universities of the study cases. The IRBs of
the universities in the other study cases indicated USF’s IRB approval was sufficient and did not
require additional submission. When IRB approval was granted, the data collection phase of this
study began. I asked the dean to send an e-mail introducing me to the library leaders of the
selected cases. Once a response was received from the deans, I sent the library leaders of the
selected cases a personal e-mail to further introduce myself, described this study, and requested
their participation. A copy of this e-mail is shown in Appendix D. Once they agreed, I sent
them an e-mail request for their informed consent to participate in the study, as shown in
Appendix E.
Data Collection
The data for this study included multiple formats, from multiple sources, to provide
triangulation and strengthen the research validity or “trustworthiness” (Johnson & Christensen,
2012, p. 264, 398). I examined the Web sites of the selected cases for common themes
applicable to this research study. I also reviewed documents—such as annual reports, strategic
plans, administrative memos, and other publications—from the selected cases. I conducted onsite observations of the selected cases through a personal visit and tour of each participating
library. Finally, I conducted in-depth, semi-structured, open-ended interviews with the leaders of

59

the libraries in the selected cases. I also wrote a researcher’s journal to document my experience
conducting the research, to strengthen the self-reflexivity inherent in the research. A summary of
these data collection methods and a timeline for the data collection process is shown in Table 2.
I asked respondents for their preference for anonymity in the study, and abided by their
wishes, however Yin (2014) suggested the identification of participants in a case study can yield
“important background information” (p. 197) necessary to understand the case as well as the
cross-case analysis. Even though the participants in this study were provided anonymity, all the
selected cases are public institutions, with open public records, therefore some readers of the
research report may be able to infer the identity of the cases and the individuals interviewed.
This situation was made clear to each of the participating institutions and library directors, and
their informed consent was obtained, with this understanding.

Interviews. I met personally with each library leader in the selected cases and conducted
a one-to-one interview, in person, at the library leader’s office for approximately one hour. I had
planned a follow-up interview by phone, for approximately one hour, after the participant
reviewed the transcription from the first interview. However, in two of the cases, the second
interview proved not to be necessary, since the library leaders allowed me to complete the full
interview in one session. More about this is described in Chapter 4.
During these interviews, I employed the feminist-based interviewing ethic, which
“transforms interviewer and respondent into coequals who are carrying on a conversation”
(Denzin & Lincoln, 2000, p. 634; Fontana & Frey, 2000). The interview format followed
Fontana and Frey’s (2000) definition of a “field formal” (p. 653) interview, in which the setting
is pre-determined but takes place in the field, the role of the interviewer is somewhat directive,
the question format is semi-structured, and the purpose is phenomenological (p. 653). The
interview itself, however, was the type defined by Fontana and Frey (2000) as “unstructured:
61

…to understand the complex behavior of members of society without imposing an a priori
categorization that may limit the field of inquiry” (p. 653). The overall interview style, as
indicated above, followed Rubin and Rubin’s (2012) model of “responsive interviewing” (p. 36).
A list of open-ended questions, based on this study’s guiding question and research
questions, was e-mailed to the library leaders of the selected cases at least two weeks in advance
of the interview appointments. These questions are shown in Appendix C. Since the timeframe
of this research study stretches back over five years in the past, I believed it important to allow
the respondents time to reflect and remember past events more clearly, as well as to assemble
supporting documents.
These interviews were audio-recorded using a portable digital voice recorder in order to
accurately acquire the “verbatim responses” (Patton, 2002, p. 380) of the participants. I had the
audio recordings transcribed by a professional transcription service, to help strengthen accuracy
and trustworthiness. I also listened to the recordings of the interviews several times. These
procedures helped address issues of reflexivity and provided greater depth of understanding of
the respondent’s subtle emphases or other verbal cues to meanings which may have been missed
during the interview process itself (Yin, 2014).
I took both descriptive and reflexive notes during the interviews, following Creswell’s
(2013) protocol, as shown in Appendix F, to make observations as they occurred and to identify
and clarify key points of the conversation. Patton (2002) indicated this process helps the
interview follow its planned course or identify new and important directions for additional
questions. Patton (2002) called this “the emergent nature of qualitative inquiry” (p. 383).
Immediately following each interview, I wrote a “post-interview review” (Patton, 2002,
p. 384). This review, composed while the memory of the interview experience was fresh,

62

included additional notes about observations and reflections during the interview, descriptions of
the interview setting, identification of any areas where self-reflexivity may have had an impact,
reflections about the attitude and reactions of the respondent, and perceptions about the overall
success of the interview (Patton, 2002, p. 384). Patton (2002) explained this post-interview
process is critical to ensuring quality and rigor in qualitative inquiry, and also to ensure the data
captured are “reliable and authentic” (p. 384).
Finally, I sent the transcriptions, and copies of my notes taken during the interviews, to
each respective library leader for member-checking of the content. Stake (2006) described
member-checking as asking the respondent to read the researcher’s rough draft of the report “for
accuracy and possible misrepresentation” (p. 37). Stake (2000) emphasized it is a vital ethical
consideration of case study research “for targeted persons to receive drafts revealing how they
are presented, quoted, and interpreted and for the researcher to listen well for signs of concern”
(p. 448).
Interview Questions. According to Stake (2006), the interview questions for each case in
a qualitative, multiple case study should include some of the same questions for all the cases,
with additional, unique questions for each particular case (p. vi). Yin (2014) recommended
using “how” rather than “why” (p. 110) questions when asking respondents about past
experiences in order to preserve an open and trustful relationship during the interview. The
specific questions developed for the interview portion of this study utilized three of the five
levels of research questions identified by Yin (2014) as appropriate for multiple case study
research: (a) Level 1: questions for the specific individuals in the case; (b) Level 2: questions
about the individual case; and (c) Level 3: questions about “patterns of findings” (pp. 90-91).
Yin (2014) advised researchers most interview questions will fall within Level 2. Qualitative

63

researchers have also identified several additional types of interview questions. Yin (2014)
recognized “conversational” (110) questions to establish rapport and trust with the respondents.
Rubin and Rubin (2012) distinguished “tour questions” (p. 116) to gather contextual and
situational detail, and “probes” (p. 118) to gather greater detail or clarification of a previous
response. See Appendix A for the list of initial interview questions, and Appendix G for a
description of the ways in which each interview question aligned with the guiding question and
research questions for this study, and the levels and types of questions they represented.
Documents. In addition to the interviews, I collected and analyzed a wide variety of
documents and publications from each of the academic libraries in the selected cases. A detailed
list is provided in Appendix H. Other documents and/or artifacts, which may be provided at the
time of, or following, the interview itself, were also collected and analyzed. Hodder (2000)
explained including these types of items in a research study is important “because the
information provided may differ from and may not be available in spoken form, and because
texts endure and thus give historical insight” (p. 704). Stake (2006) and Patton (2002), among
other scholars, confirmed the review of documents as essential to qualitative research. The
documents reviewed for this study were produced or published during the timeframe of this
study (academic fiscal years 2010-2015). The review of documents produced by a variety of
organizations and individuals—such as newspaper articles, university reports, and library
publications—was intended to increase the trustworthiness of this study. These documents were
analyzed for content pertinent to the scope of this study as well as confirmatory data. More
detail about the document analysis process is provided in Chapter 4.
Observations. I scheduled one site visit to each library. This visit lasted several hours
and included time for my initial interview with the library leader. Following the interview, I

64

toured the library at that site for approximately two to three hours to observe the site, and take
notes and photographs to enable data comparison with the details of the interviews during the
data analysis process of this research study. See Appendix I for a detailed plan of the systematic
observation data collection. These observations provided detailed context for each selected case
and visually confirmed other collected data to aid in triangulation and the trustworthiness of the
research findings (Patton, 2002).
Web Site Data Collection. An analysis of each of the libraries’ Web sites as part of the
document and artifact analysis supported triangulation of the data. Web sites, however, are
highly mutable and subject to change frequently. To mitigate this characteristic, a PDF of each
the Web pages viewed was created. I planned to view all the libraries’ Web sites during the
month in which the interviews with the library deans occurred, however this process took longer
than I anticipated, and stretched out for several months. The Web site analysis was also
longitudinal, through equivalent snapshots of each library’s Web site as it appeared during 2010
or the closest date available, through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine Web site
(http://www.archive.org/web.php). This process was intended to reveal any changes to the Web
sites over the time period of this study (2010-2015). For example, current trends in academic
library Web sites emphasize the use of “full library discovery” (Dempsey & Varnum, 2014, p.
24) tools to enable users to find information in one cloud-based, easy-to-use portal in which
information about collections, staff, services, and other library features are displayed in the same
frame (Dempsey & Varnum, 2014).
Academic library Web sites, however, rarely have uniformity, and there are few universal
or professional standards for their organization and design (Little, 2012). This study used a
detailed Web analysis protocol developed from several sources, as shown in Appendix J. The

65

Web coding list developed by Tolppanen, Miller, Wooden, and Tolppanen (2008) was the
primary source for the protocol developed for this study. Tolppanen et al. (2008) surveyed 133
academic library Web sites in the United States in 2000 and 2003 to determine common content.
While the results of these studies revealed 42 core components across more than 50% of all
universities in the studies, most of their entire research list—organized according to various
subject areas—relevant to this study were included in the Web analysis protocol. Several
additional categories identified by Detlor and Lewis (2006) as characteristics of “robust library
Web sites” (p. 251) were also be included. The resulting protocol enabled robust and thorough
examination and documentation of any areas of change corresponding to the four frames of
Bolman and Deal (2008). Coding responses will be either “yes” (the criterion is present in the
Web site) or “no” the criterion is not present in the Web site. If other coding categories emerge
during the Web site analysis of the specific libraries in this study, they will be added.
Research Credibility and Rigor
Johnson and Christensen (2012) defined qualitative research validity as “research that is
plausible, credible, trustworthy” (p. 264). Validity in this research study was approached in
several ways. Descriptive validity or “factual accuracy” (Johnson & Christensen, 2012, p. 265)
was applied through the triangulation of my researcher’s journal with observations, analysis of
documents and artifacts, and member-checking of the transcription of the library directors’
interviews. Thick description of the cases also strengthened the research validity (Creswell &
Miller, 2000, p. 124; Patton, 2002). Yin (2014) added the researcher of a case study should have
some knowledge and expertise of the subject under study as well as the techniques specific to
case study research, such as interview and listening skills. I described my background as a

66

professional journalist and graduate of a Master’s degree program in Library and Information
Science in the epoche section of Chapter 1.
Interpretive validity was applied through participant feedback on my interpretation and
findings, as well as the use of direct or “verbatim” (Johnson & Christensen, 2012, p. 267)
quotations. Construct validity appropriate for a case study design was established by defining
the type of change this study looked for, as identified in the research questions, and setting out
pre-determined methods to examine the data for that change (Yin, 2014). Internal validity of the
research was applied through data triangulation and methods triangulation. Additionally, rigor
was enhanced by exploring potential “rival explanations” (Patton, 2002, p. 553; Yin, 2014, p. 47)
for the behavior/actions of the selected cases. The reliability of this study was established
through all the procedures outlined in this chapter, to provide a clear road map for future
researchers who may wish to follow these methods in other similar situations in other locations
(Yin, 2014).
Data Analysis
The selected cases are presented individually, in Chapter 4, with thick, rich description of
the context for each case and the library leader’s perspectives of the changes within their specific
library, along with an analysis of patterns and themes within each specific case. This is followed
by an integrative, interpretive section highlighting common or divergent themes and patterns
across all the cases in Chapter 5 (Flick, 2007; Patton, 2002; Roberts, 2010; Yin, 2014). These
patterns and themes were identified through “content analysis” (Patton, 2002, p. 453) of the
interview transcripts, using qualitative coding procedures (Patton, 2002). More detail about this
process is provided in Chapter 4.

67

Saldaña (2009) defined a code as “a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a
summative, salient, essence-capturing, and/or evocative attribute for a portion of language-based
or visual data” (p. 3). Rubin and Rubin (2012) identified several common types of codes,
including events; “topical markers” such as places, dates, legislation, or people; and examples,
concepts, and ideas (pp. 193-194). The specific codes, categories, and themes used in this study
emerged through multiple reviews of the interview transcripts (Patton, 2002; Saldaña, 2009).
Saldaña (2009) suggested a minimum of two cycles of review of the data to allow “deep
reflection on the emergent patterns and meanings” (p. 10). Creswell (2013) recommended
researchers consider a maximum of 25-30 categories subsumed in just half a dozen themes for
the final analysis (pp. 184-185).
Since the data was gathered and organized according to Bolman and Deal’s (2008) four
frames, following the guiding question and research questions, a hermeneutic perspective was
also necessary in the interpretation in “relating parts to wholes, and wholes to parts” (Patton,
2002, p. 497). Patton (2002) described hermeneutics as a common technique in interpreting
qualitative interviews (p. 497). I used the matrices created by Stake (2006) as the inspiration for
developing the cross-case analysis. However, this study was not a comparative study of the
individual cases—and Stake (2006) confirmed multiple case studies should not be approached in
that manner. Instead, this analysis identified common or divergent themes and patterns which
led to greater understanding of the guiding question for this research study.
Timetable for Completion of Doctoral Dissertation
Since this research is part of my progress toward my doctoral degree, it was important to
outline the anticipated timeline in which this research will occur. The timetable may also assist
future researchers who attempt to reproduce this study. Therefore, a schedule of major deadlines

68

in this dissertation process and this study’s progress is shown in Table 3. However, while these
dates were determined following careful planning and consideration of the tasks involved, the act
of inquiry is a fluid process, and unforeseen or unexpected circumstances affected this timeline.

CHAPTER 4
PROCEDURES AND FINDINGS

Introduction
This chapter presents the results of the data collection and analysis for this research study
to inform the guiding question: In what ways have the academic libraries of four public, doctoral,
research universities in Florida identified by the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH” adapted or
changed their role within the university during the past five years, 2010-2015, from the
perspective of the Deans of the Libraries? As described in Chapter 3, the data collected included
interviews with four library directors, documents, observations, archival records, artifacts,
photographs, the four libraries’ Web sites circa 2010 and 2015, and a researcher’s journal.
Additionally, several audio/visual media were collected. More detail on these data types, and
how and when they were collected, is presented in the sections below. Qualitative scholars
advised collecting data from multiple sources to strengthen a qualitative research study’s quality
and validity (Creswell, 2013; Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014; Patton, 2002; & Yin, 2014).
This chapter also includes the rationale for decisions made during the process of the data
collection and analysis, so the reader of the report will be able to understand how the findings
were obtained and the analyses were determined. Yin (2014) recommended this type of
procedure to provide a clear “chain of evidence” (p. 127) and to strengthen the reliability of the
case study.

70

Organization of This Chapter
This chapter is organized into two main sections. The first section follows the
convention for qualitative dissertations, and includes information about the data collection,
procedures, methods, and analysis (Roberts, 2010). Stake (2006) identified the importance of
including a description of these methods early in the report. The second section presents the
“within-case analyses”—the results of the data collection and analysis for each of the four cases
in the study. In this section, each case is introduced with a description of its unique context and
background. Within each case, the results are organized according to the order of this study’s
nine research questions (shown in Chapter 1), following Yin’s (2014) plan for presenting data for
embedded multiple case studies. Each research question is further subdivided into four sections:
one section for each of the four frames identified by Bolman and Deal (2013), which provides
the theoretical foundation for this study. Figure 4.1 provides a visualization of the organizational
model for the second section of this chapter.
Data Collection Process, Organization, and Management
Data collection timeframe and duration. The University of South Florida Institutional
Review Board (IRB) granted approval of this study on March 25, 2015. A copy of this
document appears in Appendix E. The data for this study were collected over the next six
months (March – August) of 2015. Most of the documentary evidence, archival materials, and
artifacts were collected prior to the interviews with the library directors, although some of these
materials were collected in the weeks following the interviews. The observation data collections
occurred on the same days as the interviews, immediately before or after the interviews – except
in one case. The director of Library B included a guided tour of her library during the interview.

each case in the second major section of this chapter. (Original figure by Victoria Stuart, 2015.)

Photographs of each library were taken during the observation process—except in the case of
Library B, when the photographs were taken following the tour with the director. The
researcher’s journal was an ongoing project throughout this research study, from the day IRB
approval was granted to the day the final report of this research study was submitted to the
doctoral committee. An overview of this process is shown in Table 4. Yin (2014) explained
data collection often continues during the analysis and reporting phase as missing pieces are
identified or more detail or explanation is needed.

Participants in the study. This study examined four cases: the academic libraries of
four public doctoral research universities in the United States, in one state (Florida), identified by
the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH” with “very high research activity” (Carnegie
Foundation, n.d.b, para. 5). The time frame for this study spanned the past five years: 20102015. The selection of these cases demonstrated the collection of a “purposeful sample” (Patton,
2002, p. 46) of individual cases, chosen for their ability to potentially reveal information about
the research question(s) for the study (Creswell, 2013; Yin, 2014). As explained in Chapter 3,
the director/dean of each library was identified as the best representative of the library for the
interview data collection. Each of the directors/deans had served in their respective libraries for
73

a minimum of three years. While the demographics of the individuals interviewed were not a
part of this study, Table 5 provides a brief summary as part of the context for this study.

Assignment of pseudonyms. Pseudonyms were assigned to each case in the study, as
reported in the IRB application and described in Chapter 3. The assignment of the pseudonyms
was determined by an alphabetical scheme (e.g., Library A, Library B), because a numerical
scheme (e.g., Library 1, Library 2) might inadvertently imply a hierarchical order of the
importance of the libraries to readers of this study. The use of descriptive pseudonyms (e.g.,
“Big State Library,” or “Urban University Library”) was rejected for similar reasons, in that any
adjectives used might inadvertently imply a characteristic of the libraries to the readers of this
study and affect readers’ perceptions of the report. The use of adjectives might also have had an
effect on the researcher’s perception of the cases and subsequently might have inadvertently
impacted the data analysis and final presentation of the report. The alphabetical pseudonyms
74

were assigned randomly, based on the order in which the interviews with the library directors
occurred. Approaching the order of the interviews in this manner also helped minimize any
inadvertent hierarchical assumptions on the researcher’s part, because the appointments were
determined by the availability of the library directors. This decision-making process was
documented thoroughly in the researcher’s journal as part of the researcher’s ongoing selfreflexivity in conducting this research.
Data Collection Completeness. Patton (2002) suggested several steps for assessing the
completeness of the data collection phase of a research study. He recommended researchers start
with “an inventory” (p. 440) of all the data, then review it all for accuracy, and finally ensure the
data collection is complete—that all the proposed data collection methods have been fulfilled
and all the information proposed to be collected was, in fact, collected. I followed these three
steps, using the protocols discussed in Chapter 3 and presented in the Appendices, and
discovered two “holes” in the information I had collected during the library director interviews,
which necessitated my contacting two of the library directors for a follow-up interview. More
detail about these follow-up interviews is provided below in the “interviews” section.
Rubin and Rubin (2012) explained a research study’s data collection process may be
considered complete when the researcher reaches the point when “no new information is
forthcoming” (p. 63). Stake (2006) provided a template for a spreadsheet checklist to ensure the
data collection for a research study is complete. However, the volume and type of the data
collected for this study did not fit naturally into Stake’s (2006) template. This study collected
data in nine categories (data sources) for four libraries (cases), to answer nine research questions
(plus a guiding question)—each in relation to the four frames described by Bolman and Deal
(2013). More detail about each data source is discussed in the related sections below.

Data collection summary. Yin (2014) advocated the collection of a minimum of “six
sources of evidence” (pp. 105-106) for a case study to strengthen the research’s validity and
reliability. This study collected nine types of data. The totals and types of data and materials
collected for this research study are represented in Table 6. The data collection for this study
also included news reports, as described in Chapter 3. Yin (2014) indicated news reports “are
excellent sources” (p. 107) for providing details and corroborative evidence, and confirmed “a
good case study will therefore want to rely on as many sources as possible” (p. 105). The
relative contribution of each data source to the study is displayed in Figure 4.2.

Figure 4.2. Relative Contribution of Each Data Source to the Study

Data collection organization and management. Patton (2002) acknowledged one of
the main challenges of conducting qualitative research is handling and managing a large volume
of data (p. 432). The following excerpt from the researcher’s journal illustrates the way in which
this aspect of data collection was realized by the researcher:
While I had read, and intellectually understood, qualitative research involves “massive
amounts of data” (Patton, 2002, p. 432), and had read Patton’s (2002) warning that
novice researchers are often unprepared for “the sheer mass of information they will find
themselves confronted with,” (p. 440), I nevertheless fulfilled Patton’s (2002) prediction
of being “overwhelmed” (p. 440) by the amount of my data. So, I looked to scholars for
guidance, then tried several recommended approaches, until I realized the design of my
study would require the invention of a hybrid technique based on a combination of
recommended methods.
Creswell (2013) indicated there is no one formula for data organization and management. He
explained scholars have developed guidelines to help researchers, but each qualitative study is
77

handled in a unique way by the researcher leading the study (Creswell, 2013). The following
excerpt from the researcher’s journal describes the process followed in developing a data
organization and management scheme:
I am proficient in the use of data management software such as Microsoft Excel and
Access, so I initially organized my collected data in spreadsheets, following the data
organization tables described in Chapter 3 and presented in Appendices F to J. I saved all
the data in files and folders on my personal computer in a password-protected drive, as
well as in a portable thumb drive. I also saved and organized all the hard copy data in
matching folders and files in a locked file cabinet in my home office. Creswell (2013),
Patton (2002), and Stake (2006) recommended saving research data in hard copy as well
as electronically. Creswell (2013) confirmed saving data in several formats to ensure the
data will be preserved if one of the formats fails or is accidentally destroyed.
However, once I had all the data categorized, classified, and organized and filed by cases,
I encountered my second difficulty: how to condense and analyze the date to explore
complex connections to the data across multiple files, folders, and data types. Many
scholars suggested the use of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software
(CAQDAS) to organize and manage data in qualitative research studies (Creswell, 2013;
Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014; Patton, 2002; Roberts, 2010; Rubin & Rubin, 2012;
Stake, 2006; and Yin, 2014). I explored the types of CAQDAS software currently
available, read reviews and blogs of personal experiences with several of the software
packages, talked with fellow students, and tested the free trial versions of three of the
CAQDAS packages mentioned by the scholars noted above—AtlasTi, MAXQDA, and
NVivo. Ultimately, I decided to use Microsoft Excel. I designed my own spreadsheet
template, and used the multiple data analysis features of Excel to explore the data,
discover the results, and prepare illustrative charts and graphs. An example of this
spreadsheet is shown in Appendix N.
Data collection process: Interviews. Once IRB approval had been granted, this
researcher sent an e-mail to the Dean of Libraries at USF who had indicated he would be willing
to introduce me, via e-mail, to the library directors identified as potential participants in this
study. The e-mail requested a brief personal meeting, in order to reacquaint him with the
purpose of the study and reaffirm his voluntary commitment to introduce this researcher to the

78

other library directors. This meeting was a critical element in the data collection process, as
shown in this excerpt from the researcher’s journal:
The purpose of this meeting was to personally ask the dean if he was still willing to
contact the other library directors I planned to interview for this study. After all, his offer
had come more than a year ago, and he might not remember or still be willing to provide
a connection for me. I e-mailed him with a request to meet and explain my study, now
that it was finalized and approved by the IRB, and also to ask him if he was still willing
to provide an introduction for me to the other library directors. He responded
affirmatively and asked me to also plan to explain my protocol and process at this
meeting. He did not say so in words, but I had the impression he wanted to confirm my
protocol was appropriate, and not intrusive of the other library directors’ time, before he
would make a commitment to support me to the others. I provided him with a copy of
my approved proposal by e-mail approximately two weeks before the date of our
appointment. I also provided him with the list of interview questions I planned to ask the
library directors, as well as a Letter of Informed Consent for his review and signature, if
he agreed to participate in my study.
Today, we met in his office, and I briefly outlined my data collection plan, following the
summary I presented during my Proposal Defense. He listened intently, and did not say
very much until I was finished. He nodded occasionally during my presentation. After
about 15 minutes, I ended my data collection summary and process description. He
nodded and reached for his Letter of Informed Consent, which he had in front of him on
his desk. I had brought a copy with me, but he had it printed out in advance in
preparation of our meeting. He signed it in my presence at that time. Then he asked me
to confirm the names of the library directors I planned to contact for interviews. I told
him, and he jotted their names on a Post-It Note. He said he would send them an e-mail
to introduce me, and would include my e-mail address in the CC line so that I would have
a copy of what he sent, and also be included in any responses from the other directors. I
thanked him, and told him that his introduction meant a great deal to me, as I did not
think that, on my own, I would have been able to navigate very well through the other
library directors’ gatekeepers to gain an interview with the directors. I also thanked him
again for his time in meeting with me today, and said I was excited about conducting our
interview the following week. (The dean’s assistant helped plan and set these
appointments for me, and was extremely cordial and helpful throughout the process.)
This meeting lasted about half an hour. I left his office to walk back to my office, and by
the time I got back to my desk and logged back on to my computer, the dean’s promised
e-mail to the other directors had not only been sent, but I had already received positive
replies from all of the library directors, letting me know they were interested in
79

participating in my research project. They also provided the names of their
administrative assistants for me to contact to set up the appointments.
Rubin and Rubin (2012) explained “having someone vouch for you is another important way to
build trust” (p. 79).
The following day, each of the library directors was contacted individually, by e-mail,
and sent the formal letter of introduction and request for them to complete the Letter of Informed
Consent approved by the IRB (Appendix E). This purposeful, brief waiting period allowed this
researcher time to assemble the letters and attachments and make sure everything was accurate
and correct. Any mistake made by rushing through the process would have made a poor first
impression and might potentially have impacted the quality of the interview. The library
directors’ assistants were the main points of contact in determining an appointment date and
time. Following the confirmation of each interview appointment, the list of interview questions
and Letter of Informed Consent were e-mailed to the library directors and their assistants, so they
would have them at least two weeks prior to the interview, as indicated in the research Proposal
and IRB application. Janesick (2015) advised this practice to help “jog their memory” (p. 59)
about events and activities in the past. These e-mail communications also made it clear that this
researcher was willing to meet the library directors in their office or other location of their
choice. Several of the libraries in the study were located hundreds of miles away from this
researcher’s hometown, but I indicated I would come to meet them at their campus. I believed
meeting in person, in a location in which the library directors were comfortable, would help
build a level of trust and confidence. Rubin and Rubin (2012) described this approach as key to
their “responsive interviewing model” (p. 23), which was followed as the basis for this research
study’s approach to the interviews with the library directors. All of the library directors chose to
meet with me in their office. I believed this was the optimal location, because the familiar
80

surroundings for the library director would serve as an additional memory aid to events that
occurred years in the past, and also allow the directors to access documents or artifacts to share
with me if the occasion arose. Janesick (2015) cautioned researchers to avoid situations where
either the interviewer or the interviewee assumed a role of dominance, and instead attempt to
establish a “mutually agreeable balance” (p. 63). While all the interviews with the library
directors occurred in their offices—which might potentially have been perceived as intimidating
to a novice researcher—three of the library directors came out from behind their desks to sit with
me at the more casual seating group of sofa/chairs and tables in their office. The other library
director, even though he sat behind his desk, maintained what this researcher perceived as a
cordial, welcoming, and friendly attitude that met the requirements for a balanced interview.
The appointments were arranged based on the availability of the library directors. The
library directors each offered several appointment times, but the final appointments were
selected to provide several days or more between each interview. This excerpt from the
researcher’s journal explains why:
As a novice researcher, I believed I would need a sufficient period of time in between
each interview to digest the results of the interview and to complete recording my notes
of the experience. Also, as a novice researcher, I believed a buffer of time and space
would enable my memory of each experience to remain distinct and not overlay aspects
from the other interviews. Rubin and Rubin (2012) also cautioned in-depth interviewing
can be “exhausting,” which supported my decision to allow a few days in between each
interview.
The initial in-person interviews with each library director occurred during the last week of April
and the first three weeks of May, 2015, with one interview per week.
The responsive interviewing model. As stated above, the interviews were planned and
executed by closely following Rubin and Rubin’s (2012) “responsive interviewing model” (p.
23). After establishing trust and confidence, this researcher endeavored to “show respect”
81

(Rubin & Rubin, 2012, p. 85) by arriving to the appointments at least 15 minutes early, being
prepared, and presenting a professional and friendly demeanor. Rubin and Rubin (2012)
explained timeliness and politeness in keeping appointments indicate the researcher values the
interviewees’ time and participation. Rubin and Rubin (2012) also recommended coming to the
interview prepared, by having completed enough research in advance, in order to show respect to
the interviewee by not wasting their time addressing obvious questions whose answers could be
found elsewhere. As described above, this preparation was completed by engaging in the
document collection and Web site review for each library in the study in the weeks between
receiving IRB approval and the dates of the interviews.
As I met each library director, I shook their hand, smiled, and looked them in the eyes as
I greeted them and thanked them for meeting with me and participating in my research project.
Then, I took my next conversational lead from their reply to talk about something informal and
unrelated to my study. Rubin and Rubin (2012) encouraged this type of brief “casual chat” (p.
107) as the first stage of a responsive interview. Once the library director and I were seated in
their office (all four library directors chose their office for the location of the interview), I
engaged in the second stage of Rubin and Rubin’s (2012) responsive interviewing model. This
part involved introducing myself, briefly describing my research purpose and method, explaining
the IRB Letter of Informed Consent, and emphasizing the library director’s opportunities to
review both the transcript of the interview and the draft of the final report to correct or edit their
remarks. Rubin and Rubin (2012) emphasized candidness in informing interviewees they are
being recorded, and recommended telling interviewees at the start of the interview that the
interview will be recorded. Rubin and Rubin (2012) also suggested reminding interviewees
about the recording occasionally during the rest of the interview. This researcher followed those

82

guidelines and began each interview by showing the library director the digital recorder,
explaining that the interview will be recorded, and, for politeness and a continued effort to build
trust, asking the library director again for permission to be recorded before initiating the
recording. The digital recorder used in this case was an Olympus, model WS-822, hand-held
digital recorder purchased specifically for these interviews. This model had a large digital
display showing the time elapsed during the recording, which proved helpful in staying on track
in keeping the appointment time to the hour promised to the library director in the e-mail
requesting the interview. Rubin and Rubin (2012) emphasized researchers need to keep their
promises to interviewees. The digital format also helped more easily manage the transcriptions
of the recordings, as digital MP3 files carry date/time stamps and can be easily transcribed using
a computer. Rubin and Rubin (2012) also recommended the “recording should be as smooth and
unobtrusive as possible so that it does not distract” (p. 100), and the Olympus WS-822 was both
silent and small. However, while recording the interview provided a verbatim record of the
interview, many scholars also recommended the researcher take notes during the interview
(Creswell, 2013; Patton, 2002; Rubin & Rubin, 2012). As indicated in Chapter 3, this researcher
utilized Creswell’s observational protocol format (See Appendix F) to record descriptive and
reflexive notes during the interviews with the library directors. An example of a portion of this
completed protocol for Library A is shown in Table 7.
In the next stage of responsive interviewing, Rubin and Rubin (2012) recommended
starting with “some easy questions, showing empathy” (p. 108) to help make interviewees feel
comfortable and at ease. As indicated in the Interview Protocol in Appendix C, the semistructured interview process began with a question about the library director’s background.

The dean arrived at this library in 2008.
He grew up trilingual in his home.
His primary background is in technical
services.
First impressions:
 Impact of the recession forced the
library to look at every single thing we
were doing. And so, on some levels, it
put us on the cutting edge.
 It meant that the organization became
one that is used to rapid change and
risk-taking, because we had to be, and
we became quite nimble.
Fighting the battle of changing perception of
the campus about the library –
demonstrating the ROI.
The first renovation changed the look of the
library as well as began integrating the
library with the academic mission of the
university.
Shifting the service culture.
Changing on multidimensional layers
simultaneously.
Negotiations – with all internal
stakeholders.
The provost put him on the lead group for
the university’s Student Success initiative,
and the goals of the university became a
priority.
He found a niche in digital media literacy
and information literacy.
Technology rentals at the library are highly
used.

The dean met me in his office, and greeted me
cordially. He immediately set me at ease with
a handshake, and made a joke about the heavy
rain. He asked if the other library directors
had connected with me yet.
He was prepared for the interview, with the
set of questions on his desk as well as a copy
of the IRB and a bottle of water. Other than
that, his desk was clear of work (I considered
this to imply his only focus would be on the
interview).
He talked about his feelings and emotions as
well as facts.
His screensaver showed a variety of scenes of
libraries, implying his passion for his career.
His passion and energy are clearly expressed
through his direct eye contact, enthusiastic
tone of voice, active body language – using
his hands for emphasis, leaning forward in his
chair when he talked about things.
Follow-up question: Ask him how he
demonstrated student success to the provost?
Follow-up question: Ask him about the
research emphasis of the university.
He expressed sensitivity to staff feelings and
perceptions and demonstrated exceptional
people skills.
We went a little off the planned order of the
questions, but it made sense to follow his
train of thought rather than impose mine. I
kept on track with the questions by making
notes of what we had covered and what still
remained.

Follow-up question: Ask about upcoming

His relationship with the other deans and the
provost made the library more integral to the
university instead of extraneous.

This proved to be a helpful ice-breaker, and each library director demonstrated engagement with
this question, as this excerpt from my interview with the director of Library C shows:
Researcher: Okay, great. Thank you so much, and may I start by just [asking] what led
you to be in this particular library at this particular time, and just a little bit about your
background, and then what...
Library Director: <laughs>
Researcher: ...your initial perceptions were when you arrived here? I like it because
everybody has a different story.
Library Director: I’ve got a good one. I actually started my library career . . . in this
library.
Rubin and Rubin (2012) recommended ordering the rest of the questions in the semi-structured
responsive interviewing model to gradually build up to the point where the interviewer can begin
to ask sensitive or provocative questions. Rubin and Rubin (2012) explained “at this stage of an
interview . . . the interviewees already know which side you are on; they have learned that you
will pay attention and that you understand their perspective” (p. 111). The Interview Protocol in
Appendix C was built on this model, and lists all the questions, in the order in which they were
asked. However, this researcher remained flexible in following this plan, as Rubin and Rubin
(2012) advised, to adapt the interview to match the personality and style of each interviewee.
The following excerpt from the interview with the director of Library A provides an illustration:

85

Library Director: At least initially the library did not receive direct dollar cuts. Our cuts
came in the form of when positions became vacant we couldn't fill them and we lost
them. So I know this is going to jump ahead into some of your questions . . .
Researcher: Doesn't matter.
Library Director: Okay.
Researcher: This is not a script.
Library Director: No, no, understood.
In the final stages of the responsive interview model, Rubin and Rubin (2012) directed
interview questions “wind down” to a close, and the interviewer should reverse roles with the
interviewee and encourage the interviewee to ask questions. As shown in the Interview Protocol,
each interview closed with a question designed to give the library director an opportunity to
reflect on the future of their library and the impact of their achievements during the past five
years. The Interview Protocol also included a question asking each library director to express
anything of relevance which may not have been discussed during the interview, as recommended
by Rubin and Rubin (2012). Finally, each interview closed with this researcher’s expression of
thanks and appreciation for the library director’s participation, as advocated by Rubin and Rubin
(2012). I also re-confirmed that I would send the library directors the transcripts of the interview
for their review in a few weeks, and asked if they would be open to my contacting them at some
point for a follow-up interview by phone. Rubin and Rubin (2012) suggested this procedure to
“keep the door open” (p. 112) for future conversations. Immediately following the interview, I
found a quiet place to write down my thoughts, reactions, and observations during the interview.
Patton (2002) indicated this “post-interview ritual” (p. 384) is critical to “the rigor of qualitative
inquiry” (p. 384), and ensures “that the data obtained will be useful, reliable, and authentic” (p.
384).
Researcher’s role in the interview process. Rubin and Rubin (2012) referred to the
importance of the researcher’s awareness and acknowledgement of “how their own attitudes
86

might influence the questions they ask as well as how they react to the answers. . . . [and] be
sensitive to their own emotions as well as those of their interviewees” (p. 72). In the epoche
section in Chapter 1, I indicated my background as a professional journalist and how this
experience would, I believed, be helpful in planning and conducting the interviews for this
research study. However, I also indicated I needed to remain vigilant to the ways in which the
style, approach, and goal of qualitative research interviewing differ from journalistic
interviewing. That being said, I should also explain that my journalistic background involved
writing feature stories primarily, which developed my skills in listening and showing empathy
toward interviewees. Good listening skills on the part of the researcher are key to a successful
qualitative interview (Creswell, 2013; Rubin & Rubin, 2012). Rubin and Rubin (2012)
emphasized that responsive interviews should be “gentler” (p. 37) than other interviewing styles
and “are not interrogations” (p. 37). The goal of a responsive interview is to let the interviewee
become a “partner” (Rubin & Rubin, 2012, p. 37) in the interview process, to allow both
interviewer and respondent to explore the answers to the interview questions together (Rubin &
Rubin, 2012). Rubin and Rubin (2012) also encouraged the researcher to adopt “a friendly and
supportive tone” (p. 37), and refrain from interjecting their own opinions, comments, or
emotions. In the responsive interviewing model, the researcher is also concerned with
maintaining a relationship of trust and respect (Rubin & Rubin, 2012). I kept these guidelines
firmly in mind as I engaged in the interviews with the library directors in this study, and tried to
convey these concepts in my actions and attitude. At the end of each interview, each of the
library directors expressed appreciation for being included in this research study.

87

Following the completion of the interview data collection process, this researcher
experienced an effect which required in-depth self-reflection, as indicated by this excerpt from
the researcher’s journal:
I became aware of a personal attitude which surprised me as I was reading the transcript
of the initial interview with the director of the university where I am a student, alumna,
and employee. When I wrote my researcher’s journal entry on that experience, I
discovered that I was inadvertently “rooting” for this university’s library, and found
myself strongly hoping for positive outcomes. Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014)
noted this as “the effects of the site on the researcher” (p. 298). Stake (2006) explained
this experience is common among case study researchers, because “we care about the
case . . . [and] sometimes we are studying a part of our own organization” (p. 86). Once I
recognized this potential influence on my analysis and data collection for this case, I
bracketed it out by writing about it in my researcher’s journal, as recommended by Stake
(2006), and tamping down any personal enthusiasm for my alma mater in evaluating the
research data. I also kept a strong mental focus on my research questions and method, as
recommended by Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014) to mitigate the effect.
Rubin and Rubin (2012) advised the researcher adopt a specific “research role” (p. 73)
for their qualitative interviews. In this study, the role of “student researcher” (Rubin & Rubin,
2012, p. 74) was the obvious choice. This researcher’s past experience and Master’s degree in
library science also enabled the cultivation of a partial role as what Rubin and Rubin (2012)
termed an “insider” (p. 76). Rubin and Rubin (2012) explained interviewees feel more confident
and more willing to confide in someone who has at least some knowledge of their profession and
would be able to understand their responses and discipline-specific terminology. This was found
to be the case, as this excerpt from the interview with the director of Library C illustrates:
Library Director: We were kind of dependent on FCLA. You remember FCLA? It was
our statewide university library consortium.
Researcher: Oh, yes.
Library Director: Which has morphed into FLVC.
Researcher: Exactly.

88

Rubin and Rubin (2012) confirmed a single role or a combination of roles may be appropriate,
depending on the research situation, as long as the researcher makes a commitment to that role in
advance and maintains it throughout the research project.
Interview transcription process. The digital interview recording MP3 files were
uploaded to Production Transcripts, Inc. for professional transcription. Rubin and Rubin (2012)
and Janesick (2015) indicated hiring a professional transcription service is an acceptable practice
in qualitative research. This researcher had used this transcription service previously, for a class
project involving an interview with a library director and similar set of questions to the Interview
Protocol for this study. In that instance, the library director interviewed complimented the
accuracy of the transcription in her member check and made no changes. That experience,
coupled with recommendations from scholars, as well as faculty and students who had also used
this service, gave this researcher the confidence to use it for this research study. The transcripts
were prepared in “verbatim” format, and included indications of non-verbal audible responses
such as laughter or pauses. Rubin and Rubin (2012) explained including non-verbal reactions
can assist the researcher in interpreting an interviewee’s verbal response.
Member check of the interview transcripts and final report. The interview transcripts
were e-mailed to the library directors for member checking on the dates shown in Table 8. Only
one library director requested a change resulting from one typographical error. The follow-up
interview with the dean of Library B was not used as part of this study, since it repeated most of
the information already collected in the initial interview.
Data collection: documents. The document collection for this study followed the
protocol described in Chapter 3. During the months of March, April, May, June, July, and
August 2015, as many documents as possible were collected from those listed in the document

89

collection protocol shown in Appendix H, as well as some additional documents which emerged
during the data collection process.

Note: The second interview with the dean of Library B was not used in the data analysis, as
review of the transcript revealed a saturation point had been reached, and no new information
had been collected.
Patton (2002) explained the analysis of institutional documents such as those collected
for this study provide corroborative evidence for the other sources of data collected in a study (p.
499). The majority of the documents were collected from the universities’ and libraries’
websites. Other documents were collected during this researcher’s personal visits to each
campus to conduct the interviews. News publications, as recommended by Yin (2014), and other
records, were also examined and collected using the databases available through the University
of South Florida’s library. When the documents needed weren’t publicly available, they were
requested from the library directors in this study. In a very few instances, however, the
documents either did not exist or were not able to be obtained.

90

Collecting and analyzing the complete universe of news articles about each of the four
libraries over the five-year timeframe of this study was beyond the scope of this research study.
Therefore, a decision needed to be made about which news articles would be collected. As
indicated in Chapter 3, this study aimed to collect only “relevant” news articles. For this
research study, “relevance” was defined by whether or not the news articles provided affirmative
or negative confirmatory data for the interviews and observations, or to “identify important
issues” (Patton, 2002, p. 171) which may not have arisen during the interviews or observation, as
indicated by Patton (2002). Yin (2014) confirmed “the most important use of documents is to
corroborate and augment evidence from other sources” (p. 107). For example, this study did not
collect news articles about every event held in the libraries as a normal part of their operations,
such as book readings, instructional sessions, or exhibition openings. However, articles
indicating special events, or events directly illustrating one of the aspects of the four frames of
Bolman and Deal (2013), were collected as corroborative data. In one example, Library B
hosted a day-long information session about new GIS (Geographic Information System)
technologies, which brought more than 150 students from around the university into the library
(Wagner, 2010).
The news articles about Library C raised a different challenge. In November 2014,
Library C was the site of a mass shooting. The number of news articles about this event far
exceeded the scope and capacity of this study. However, two “relevant” articles were chosen
because they illustrated specific aspects of Bolman and Deal’s (2013) four frames in relation to
the tragic incident. One article described a ceremony honoring one librarian who was wounded
while saving student lives. The other article described a ceremony of healing in which the
library dean and the university president co-led the re-opening of the library.

Data collection: Web sites. The Web site data collection for this study followed the
protocol described in Chapter 3. Information about the Web sites of each of the four cases, from
2010 and from 2015, were collected according to the Web site data collection protocol shown in
Appendix J. For the purposes of this research study, the libraries’ historic Web sites were
considered archival records – one of the six sources of evidence Yin (2014) cited as crucial to a
research study’s “construct validity and reliability” (p. 105). This study regarded the historic
web pages as archival records because these pages are snapshots, frozen in time, and maintained
by a third party (The Internet Archive). The libraries’ contemporary Web sites were considered
physical artifacts, since they are tangible products of the libraries which can be seen and
touched—albeit electronically. Physical artifacts are also among Yin’s (2014) recommended six
sources of evidence.
The research proposal for this study indicated the historic Web pages would be retrieved
from The Internet Archive. However, when data collection began, the Web address for the
archive had changed from the address listed in the proposal to: https://archive.org/web/. Another
unexpected problem was the unavailability of some of the libraries’ Web pages from 2010. Here
is an excerpt from the researcher’s journal describing how this issue was resolved, and the
decision-making process in determining alternative Web pages to collect:
I began my search with Library A. I saw what looked like pages archived for 2011, but
none of them were available to be viewed. I checked every entry for that year
individually, and each one resulted in a message showing that the Internet Archive’s web
crawler had received an HTTP 302 error on that occasion, so none of the archived pages
for that year were available. I also tried accessing each of those pages three different
ways: a) from the calendar page, b) from the home page, and c) from the timeline. None
of these attempts worked. The closest date I was able to access, of the dates available,
was February 7, 2012.
I then decided to try looking farther back in time, and checked 2010. All of the Internet
Archive’s web crawls for 2010 also resulted in HTTP 302 errors. I also tried accessing
92

each of those pages the same three different ways as I had done with the images from
2011. The closest date to my research time frame the Internet Archive captured was
December 14, 2009.
Since the timeframe of my research is 2010-2015 by Fiscal Year: July 2010-June 2011
through July 2014-June 2015, the December 14, 2009 date is approximately six and onehalf months earlier than the start of my timeframe, while the February 7, 2012 date is
approximately 19 months past the start of my timeframe. I find I am faced with a
difficult decision on which web page to choose for the web site analysis for this study.
The design of the 2009 site is drastically different from the 2012 site, and I am very
tempted to select that page for the Web site longitudinal comparison. Six and one-half
months is also a shorter period of time than 19 months. This site might also reveal a
larger change than if the 2012 site were used for the comparison because just one glance
at the page shows a very different design from the contemporary Library A Web site.
However, the 2012 site, although it is later, falls within the timeframe for this study,
while the 2009 site does not. My ultimate choice was made by referring to the methods
chapter in my final proposal, which indicated “the Web site analysis will also be
longitudinal, through equivalent snapshots of each library’s Web site as it appeared
during 2010 or the closest date available” (p. 66), and “to reveal any changes to the Web
sites over the time period of this study” (p. 66). The key phrases are “closest date” and
“the time period of this study.” Therefore, I will use the 2012 site for the Web site
comparison. I will, however, check the Internet Archive site again to see if the 2010 or
2011 pages become available before the end of this research study.

Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014) indicated slight changes in data collection plans
sometimes occur in qualitative research and are acceptable if documented carefully. Another
methodological choice made during the Web site data collection included developing more
precise definitions of the terms listed in the Web site data collection protocol. Here is another
excerpt from the researcher’s journal indicating the decision-making process involved in refining
these terms:
Tonight, I began searching the current Library A Web site for the Web data collection. I
noticed that the term “Friends of the Library,” from the template I adapted from
Tolppanen, Miller, Wooden, and Tolppanen (2008), and Detlor and Lewis (2006), does
not seem to be used by Library A, although the library does have a similar organization,
named the Library Advancement Board. Going forward, I will consider the term
93

“Friends of the Library” a generic term for a library fundraising group, regardless of the
name each library may have assigned to this organization. I used that decision-making
process to define other terms more generically (e.g., “quick facts,” and “FAQ”). I also
added two additional categories—Social Media/Tools and Cell/Mobile Applications—
which were not included in my original plan. However, during my analysis of the
libraries’ Web pages, social media and cell/mobile applications were prominent in the
libraries’ 2015 Web sites, so they seemed a natural and important type of information to
collect.
Data collection: Observation and photos. The observation undertaken for this study
involved observing the physical settings and activities of each library in this study. Patton
(2002) explained observations of this type should “describe the setting that was observed, the
activities that took place in that setting, the people who participated in those activities” (p. 262),
and that these descriptions should be “factual, accurate, and thorough” (p. 262). For this study,
this researcher’s role was as a “nonparticipant/observer” (Creswell, 2013, p. 167). The
observation data was collected following the Observation Protocol described in Chapter 3 and
shown in Appendix I. The observation periods were scheduled immediately following the
interviews with the library directors. It was anticipated that this researcher would need three to
four hours in each library collecting observation data, however two to three hours proved to be
sufficient to fulfill the Observation Protocol. Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014) explained
this type of systematic data collection and use of a common instrument is important in multiple
case studies “so that findings can be laid side by side” (p. 39) in the eventual cross-case analysis.
The researcher’s observation notes were supplemented with photographs taken by the
researcher during the observation activities. Permission to take the photos was requested in
advance from the library directors, even though state university library buildings are understood
to be public places and photos are allowed, according to Florida Statute 876.11 (Florida Senate,
2015), as long as the photos do not identify specific individuals. This researcher used a small,
94

personally-owned, portable Pentax camera, which was purchased prior to engaging in this study.
The quality of this camera was deemed sufficient for the research purpose of this study. The
photographs added additional descriptive detail, through the use of an image, to the textual
observation descriptions, and increased the reliability of this study (Yin, 2014). These
photographs were inserted into the observational protocol, which resulted in a detailed
spreadsheet. An example of the observation data collection results is shown below in Table 9.
Patton (2002) indicated the use of photographs in qualitative research is a growing practice.

Description

This six-story building has a classic red brick
and white stone façade.
 The street-facing side is elegant, with
two large bay windows with peaked
roofs, a solid wall of windows running
along the center of this side, and both of
the rest of this side of the building.
Three stories are visible.
 Campus-facing side features rows of
windows on each story for nearly 2/3 of
the length of the building, shaded by a
permanent screen of slender brick and
stone columns. The front walkway is
shaded by a cement/stone awning in
graduated heights, stretching the length
of the building, and also creating a
breezeway connection to the satellite
building, known as Library East.
The landscaping is formal, with box hedges,
stately rows of palm and oak trees, park-like
green lawns, and vintage-style street lamps with
black metal poles and white globe lights on top
on the street-facing side.

Data collection: Researcher’s Journal. Janesick (2015) described the researcher’s
journal as an important data set in the research study, because it is “a record of all that is
occurring in the study, the processes of the study, and most importantly, the meaning of the
study” (p. 127). The researcher’s journal for this study began the day IRB approval was
received, and continued until the final dissertation defense. The researcher’s journal also offered
96

another reflexive opportunity for this researcher to consider her role in the study (Janesick,
2015). The following excerpt from the researcher’s journal revealed this researcher’s approach:
In my proposal, I explained that multiple methods of data collection would be used to
strengthen the validity and trustworthiness of the research through the technique of
triangulation. Keeping a researcher’s reflexive journal is a key component of that
process. This is a qualitative research study, and therefore heuristic in nature, since the
researcher (me) is the data collection instrument (Patton, 2002). All the information will
be filtered through my own awareness and understandings.
The intent of the researcher’s journal is not only to assure that the researcher’s
background and beliefs are clearly transparent, but also to help ensure rigor in the study
by confirming that those beliefs and perceptions (whether intentional or unintentional) do
not influence the data collection or outcome of the data analysis (Patton, 2002). By
showing where I’m coming from (literally and philosophically), how I intend to go about
this study, and setting out in plain sight everything in my experience or considerations
that could have an effect on the data collection and analysis, it should strengthen the rigor
of the study as well as increase the transferability of the research methods. Most
importantly, it will increase the readers’ understanding of the final report and the “lived
experience” (Janesick, 1998, p. 4) of the participants.
In beginning the journaling process, however, I was unsure where to begin and what,
exactly, to write about. How would I determine which thoughts would be important to
document—adding to the rich and thick description characteristic of qualitative inquiry,
and which might be extraneous? How should I organize the journal? Should I write
something every day or only when something significant occurred or a milestone was
reached? How much should I write? Should I write about the process or only about my
interactions with the study participants and the data?
So, as usually happens when I have questions like these, I looked to the scholars and
relied on their experience to guide me. Janesick (1998, 1999, 2000, 2011, 2015) has
written extensively on the topic of reflexive journaling, both about its importance to
authentic qualitative research as well as how to approach writing the journal. Janesick
(1998) explained “the clarity of writing down one’s thoughts will allow for stepping into
one’s inner mind and reaching further into interpretations of the behaviors, beliefs, and
words we write” (p. 11). Slotnick and Janesick (2011) also provided an in-depth look at
the method.
For the past few days I’ve been mulling over what I discovered about reflexive
journaling. That said, I must also be honest and admit that this particular part of the
research process seems overwhelming to me at the moment. How can I possibly write
about everything I’m thinking and doing for my dissertation research? It’s something
97

which occupies nearly every free moment of my life right now. I need to find a way to
frame the journaling so it makes sense to me and for my research study.
I found an article published in The Qualitative Report which offered a constructivist
perspective on the importance of the researcher’s journal as a way of clarifying and
justifying the methods of the study, described by Ortlipp (2008):
It was through written reflections in my journal that I clarified my research aims
and approach where I asked, explored, and answered ontological, epistemological,
and methodological questions about what I could know, my relationship to what
could be known, and how I might come to know it. I wrote in order to learn and
to understand issues around methodology so that I could settle on a way of
conducting my research and justify my decisions. I began to see the relevance
and suitability of this reflective writing process for the way I was conceptualizing
(sic) my study and enacting my research as an individual with particular personal
experiences, desires, and ways of looking at the world. (pp. 699-700)
This approach resonated with me, because it seemed to provide some acceptable and
appropriate boundaries to the journaling, it advocated illuminating the research process
itself, and it was drawn from the constructivist perspective, as is my own research study.
Analysis strategy. The analysis strategy for this complex multiple case study followed
Yin’s (2014) recommendations. Yin (2014) suggested several steps, shown in Table 10. This
analysis strategy was used as the basis for developing coding procedures and a coding scheme
for this study, described in the following sections, as well as to engage in the qualitative crosscase analysis, which is presented in Chapter 5.
Coding procedures. Noted qualitative researchers and scholars, such as Saldaña (2009)
and Patton (2002) indicated the coding procedures for each qualitative study will be unique, and
designed specifically to study the data collected for that study in light of the study’s research
questions. Rubin and Rubin (2012) and Saldaña (2009), however, offered substantial guidance
and a road map for qualitative researchers—especially novice qualitative researchers—to follow
in designing their coding procedures. Therefore, the coding procedures for this research study
were guided by Rubin and Rubin’s (2012) and Saldaña’s (2009) methods of coding and analysis.

Note. Adapted from Yin (2014), p. 174.
Saldaña (2009) recommended a careful review of the data collected for a research study
prior to determining coding methods for the study in order to select the most appropriate coding
methods for the study. This study’s research questions involved four a priori themes: the four
frames of Bolman and Deal (2013). However, the research questions also allowed for
exploration of emergent themes and patterns through inductive analysis. Saldaña (2009)
confirmed a blend of coding for both a priori and emergent themes is an appropriate approach,
and inductive analysis is especially appropriate for case study research (p. 144).
First cycle coding. This researcher followed Saldaña’s (2009) recommendation to
analyze the data through first and second cycle coding processes. The first cycle coding for this
study involved a holistic review of the data, followed by an additional review of the data using
descriptive coding (Saldaña, 2009). Saldaña (2009) defined holistic coding as “grand tour” (p.
48) of the data and descriptive coding as “a detailed inventory of their contents” (p. 48). He
99

(2009) recommended descriptive coding as an effective “first step in data analysis” (p. 66),
especially for novice qualitative researchers and when multiple sources and types of data are
being analyzed. In descriptive coding, Saldaña (2009) explained a “word or short phrase” (p. 70)
is used to define “the basic topic of a passage of qualitative data” (p. 70). This research study’s
approach to this review of the data was also heuristic, as defined by Miles, Huberman, and
Saldaña (2014), and involved “careful reading and reflection on its core content or meaning” (p.
73).
The data were then reviewed again for sub-codes, and then again for categories, as
recommended by Saldaña (2009). Saldaña (2009) explained sub-codes and categories provide
further detail for the main codes determined through the descriptive coding process, and assist in
the organization of the analysis. Rubin and Rubin (2012) indicated this part of the coding
process is important “to recognize and identify concepts, themes, events, and examples” (p. 192)
related to the study’s research questions. Rubin and Rubin (2012) suggested these concepts and
themes can emerge from multiple perspectives, including: a) the interview questions; b)
statements emphasized or repeated by the interviewees; c) differences and similarities between
different interviewees’ responses on the same topic; d) figures of speech of the interviewees; e)
combinations of emergent concepts into broader categories; and f) concepts emergent from the
researcher’s knowledge of the topic.
For this research study, the first cycle coding process included a minimum of four
reviews of the data. Additional (but uncounted) passes through the data were made during this
cycle when intuitive analysis required more in-depth consideration of the data in order to identify
an appropriate code, as well as to become immersed in the data as recommended by Janesick
(2015). For example, this excerpt from the researcher’s journal reveals the decision-making

100

process involved in identifying an appropriate code for “budget” by engaging in multiple passes
over the interview transcripts:
Today, I am continuing my struggle to determine if “budget” is a code or a category, or
perhaps even a theme. There are justifications in the data for all these approaches. I also
wonder if merely the word “budget” is the most effective descriptor I could use, or if I
should expand it to “budget decisions” or “budget impact” or “budget planning.” All of
the library directors talked about their budgets, in many different iterations. They spoke
of the budget cutbacks imposed on them by the Great Recession as well as through state
legislative and university decisions. They spoke of their own budget planning processes.
They spoke of frustrations in coping with budget cutbacks and managing their rising
expenses in a “flat budget” environment throughout the timeframe of this study. Even in
the libraries where the impact of budget cuts from the Great Recession were relatively
minor, the dichotomy of coping with a flat budget environment while simultaneously
acceding to increasing university needs was expressed in frustrating terms by all the
library directors. As I kept going over and over the interview transcripts, searching for
understanding of how to express this, I finally came to realize that the budget was one of
the most dominant concepts, following Rubin and Rubin’s (2012) advice. I think it
deserves to be a Theme (with a capital T). So, I made several more passes through the
data to reclassify budget as a code, and then identify new categories and sub-codes for
things like “impact of the Great Recession” or “external forces.” In hindsight, I probably
should have counted the number of passes I made through the data during this process,
but at the time I was engrossed in the understanding the data. This is an example of my
own individual cognitive approach, which might not be necessary for another researcher
in a similar situation.
To analyze this study’s interview transcripts, the transcripts were exported from their
original Microsoft Word format provided by the transcription service into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet. The data were initially delimited to place entire paragraphs into single cells in the
spreadsheet, arranged in a vertical array. However, during the initial (holistic) coding review of
the data, it became necessary, for clarity, to further subdivide these large segments into single
sentences or several sentences depending on the topic under discussion. Saldaña (2009)
indicated the length of the segment selected for coding can vary, depending upon its ability to
represent the code assigned to it (p. 3). Once the data were split into cells, each cell was
101

numbered sequentially to provide a reference back to the original order of the statements. Then,
significant comments were identified, and assigned a sequential number in the order they
appeared in the transcript. Once all the cells were coded, each cell was assigned a third
sequential number, in order to later be able to break out the total number of coded
comments/cells from the total number of comments/cells. To display the codes, categories and
sub-categories, I added many columns to the spreadsheet so that each “data chunk” (Miles et al.,
p. 72) had its own row, following Saldaña’s (2009) model. The first cycle coding resulted in a
large number of codes, categories and sub-categories.
Second cycle coding. A second cycle coding process followed the first cycle coding, as
described by Saldaña (2009):
Your data may have to be recoded because more accurate words or phrases were
discovered for the original codes; some codes will be merged together because they are
conceptually similar; infrequent codes will be assessed for their utility in the overall
coding scheme; and some codes that seemed like good ideas during first cycle coding
may be dropped altogether because they are later deemed “marginal” or “redundant.”
(p. 149)
I followed the steps described above, distilling and refining original perceptions into more
focused and descriptive codes and categories through several more passes through the data.
Saldaña (2009) explained the overall goal of second cycle coding is to “develop a sense of
categorical, thematic, conceptual, and/or theoretical organization from your array of first cycle
codes” (p. 149) and to distill the large number of first cycle codes into a smaller list of themes
and concepts. Second cycle coding may utilize the same “data chunks” (Miles et al., 2014, p. 72)
as first cycle coding (Saldaña, 2009).

102

Saldaña (2009), as well as Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014) recommended pattern
coding as an appropriate method to accomplish second cycle coding. Pattern coding is a method
to extract emergent themes from the initially coded data (Miles et al., 2014; Saldaña, 2009). In
pattern coding, similar codes are pulled together and their meaning is defined and clarified, and
documented through the creation of a code book (Saldaña, 2009). Miles, Huberman, and
Saldaña (2014) recommended researchers create a matrix to display the collection of codes and
their meanings, rules of use, limits, and illustrative excerpts. This code book was created using
the capabilities of Microsoft Excel, and is shown in Appendix M. In this second cycle coding
process, a minimum of three additional passes were made through the interview transcripts.
The final stage of the coding process for this study engaged what Saldaña (2009)
described as “theoretical coding” (p. 163) which “functions like an umbrella, that covers and
accounts for all other codes and categories” (p. 163). In the case of this research study, the
theoretical coding looked to align the emergent themes, codes, and categories from the first and
second cycle coding with the four a priori themes of this research study: the four frames of
Bolman and Deal (2013). Additionally, each coded comment’s relevance to the research
questions were noted, up to three levels (primary, secondary, tertiary). These levels were
determined by the obvious meanings of these words, as shown in this excerpt from the
researcher’s journal:
June 28 2015: Primary Alignment indicated the most important or most prominent aspect
of the coded phrase aligned with the research question. Secondary Alignment indicated
an aspect of the coded phrase aligned with a research question, but not to as significant a
degree as it did with the Primary research question. Tertiary Alignment indicated an
aspect of the coded phrase aligned somewhat with a research question, but to a lesser
extent than the other two research questions.

103

Some coded phrases only aligned with one research question, some coded phrases only aligned
with two research questions, and some coded phrases aligned with three research questions.
Each coded phrase was analyzed separately and independently to determine its research question
alignment, after the full coding process was completed.
The data analysis spreadsheet created for this study also included a column for analytic
memos, as recommended by Saldaña (2009) and Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña (2014). Saldaña
(2009) described analytic memos as “open-ended” (p. 34) reflections from the researcher
concerning “anything about the researched and the researcher” (p. 33). These analytic memos
were used primarily to help place the coded data into context within the four frames of Bolman
and Deal (2013) and to note this researcher’s thoughts about the coded data’s relationship to
Bolman and Deal’s (2013) theory of reframing organizations as well as the research questions for
this study. Rubin and Rubin (2012) also recommended researchers keep track of “notable
quotes” (p. 195) from their interviewees. These quotes were identified through bolding and
underlining of the selected text in the Excel spreadsheet. Significant comments were underlined
and bolded in a separate color text, while comments pertaining to the potential cross-case
analysis were highlighted in yellow. An illustration of the final spreadsheet is shown in
Appendix N.
In the final stage of the coding process, a minimum of seven additional passes were made
through the transcripts: one pass for each of the four frames, plus one pass for each of the three
levels of relevance to this study’s research questions. The complete process of this data analysis
is summarized in Table 11. Once the interviews were analyzed and transcribed, the same
process was conducted with all the documents collected for this study, and the findings of all

104

these data merged. The analysis and coding of the documents confirmed the codes and themes
discovered during the analysis of the interviews, and no new themes or codes emerged.

Findings within Individual Cases
This section of the report presents the findings of the study within each of the four cases,
according to the research questions and the four frames of Bolman and Deal (2013). The
organization of this report follows the question-and-answer format recommended by Yin (2012,
2014). In this format, each case is presented individually, as a whole, beginning with the context
105

for each case. Stake (2006) explained the inclusion of context in a multiple case study is
important, since the context may have an impact on what occurred in the case during the period
under study or how different situations were perceived by the individuals interviewed. The
following sections of this report describe the context for each of the cases in this study. Each
context section begins with a brief description of the parent university of the library under study.
This description includes basic facts, information, and history pertinent to understanding the
situation of each library during the timeframe for this study. This brief description is not
intended to be a capsule history of the university, but rather a foundation for understanding the
experience of the library and the library director within the scope of this study. The description
of the university is followed by a detailed description of the library in the case, including its
holdings, physical facilities, organization, leadership, and location in the university. Finally, the
setting for the interview with the library director is depicted.
The findings for each research question within the case are then presented in numerical
order. Stake (2006) also emphasized these findings must be evidence-based, and confirmed with
a minimum of three methods of triangulation. Therefore, evidence related to each finding is also
presented. Finally, the emergent themes of each case are presented. The definition of “theme”
provided by Stake (2006) was used to identify the themes in this study. Stake (2006) explained a
theme “is a central idea having importance related to its situation” (p. 64).
Library A
Context: Library A
Library A is situated in a state university system in a metropolitan hub that includes three
separately accredited universities on three campuses in three cities across a single major region
in the state. The university is relatively young—it was founded in 1956—but has grown to serve

106

a total of more than 48,000 students and offer 243 degrees (USF, 2015a; USF Office of Decision
Support, 2015). The university system employs 17,732 people, and its campuses span 1,642
acres and 297 buildings (USF Office of Decision Support, 2015). The university system’s
annual economic impact exceeds $4.4 billion (USF, 2015b).
Library A includes five libraries (USF Office of Decision Support, 2015). The main
library is located on the campus of the “main doctoral research institution” (USF, 2015, para. 1),
which also includes the College of Medicine and health disciplines. The six-story library
building is adjacent to the main entrance street into the campus, close to the physical center of
the university. The main library is surrounded by the main university road on one side, a parking
lot and another main university road on the second side, another parking lot on the third side, and
other campus buildings on the fourth side. The building has a “Library” sign on the exterior, but
without the specific name of a donor or honoree attached. The exterior façade is composed of
tan brick with dark brown trim, and features a large mural of stampeding bulls (the university’s
mascot) along the side of the building adjacent to the main university entrance road. The front of
the building includes a nicely landscaped lawn, shade trees, seating areas, and a covered portico.
The back of the library features a large park with fountains, formal tropical landscaping,
hammock swings, tables, chairs, benches, and sail-shade awnings.
The library’s collection exceeds more than 2.4 million volumes, “1.3 million books,
52,000 e-journals, 443,000 e-books, and more than 800 databases” (USF Libraries, 2015, para.
2). The library’s mission, vision, and strategic goals are listed on the library’s Web site. The
director of the library holds the position of academic dean, and reports directly to the university
provost. This excerpt from the library’s Web site provides additional descriptive information
about the library (USF Libraries, 2015):

107

The Library is a comfortable and inviting place for students and faculty to meet, study,
conduct research, and complete group assignments. Library facilities provide computer
access and individual and group seating areas. The Learning Commons (LC) on the first
and second floors has extensive seating, wireless access and electrical connections for
laptops, and over 140 computer workstations, as well as the state-of-the-art SMART Lab,
with over 300 computer workstations. (para. 3)

Context: Interview with the dean of Library A. The first interview with the dean of
Library A was conducted on Tuesday, April 28, 2015, from 9:30 to 10:45 AM. This was the first
interview of the data collection phase of this research study. Here is a brief excerpt from the
researcher’s journal describing a portion of the meeting:
When I began the interview, for some reason I suddenly became nervous. My hands
started to shake a little, and I suddenly blanked on how to set the digital recorder! In my
nervousness, I thought I might look incompetent and unprepared, and I rapidly tried to
think of a way to fix the situation. I decided honesty was the best policy, and I told Dean
A that I suddenly and inexplicably was a little nervous, and that my hands were shaking.
I told him how much I had been looking forward to our conversation, and didn’t know
why I was suddenly nervous. We both laughed and he said it might be because I was
starting the first phase of the data collection process for my dissertation. Well, that
worked, and my nervousness disappeared. I started the digital recorder, and our
interview began.
I had been excited about this opportunity to finally begin collecting my data, and looking
forward to having an extended conversation with Dean A. On the two previous occasions
I have met him—both of them for this research project—he has been cordial and friendly,
and not intimidating at all for someone in his position in the administration. (He reports
directly to the Provost.) He had also offered nothing but encouragement and enthusiasm
for my project. When I entered his office, he came out from behind his desk, shook my
hand and welcomed me in, and made a joke about the rain. I laughed and told him I had
to come in by row boat. As he indicated a chair for me to sit in, he asked if the other
library directors had connected with me yet to set appointments. I told him that yes, they
all had, and I thanked him again for volunteering to be my conduit to them. I told him
108

that I recognized that they would not have responded so quickly or so enthusiastically to
my project if he had not provided an introduction for me. He nodded. I took the
opportunity to thank him again for his time, especially his voluntary offer to meet at 9:30
AM instead of our planned 10 AM, so that we could have a full hour to talk before he had
to leave for his next appointment at 11 AM. Understanding his busy schedule and many
responsibilities, I expressed again my appreciation for giving me his time for my project.
We had set up the meeting to take place in his office. While some scholars recommend a
neutral location for qualitative research interviews, I did not believe that was necessary
for this interview. After all, I was going to talk to him about five years of his experiences
in his library, from his recollection, so I wanted to the location to be his choice, one
which would set him most at ease. Also, I thought a benefit of holding the interview in
his office is that his surroundings might offer him memory cues for events and
experiences he would relate to me. Holding the interview in his office also helped to
demonstrate, I hoped, my concern for, and appreciation of, his time, and continued to
build the sense of rapport and trust between us that is so fundamental to quality interview
experiences in qualitative research.
Findings: Library A
Two interviews with the dean of Library A resulted in a total of 171 significant
comments, and 128 coded comments. Additionally, 23 documents, 15 news articles, 70 photos,
ad 32 observations, were collected. My researcher’s journal and analysis of historic and
contemporary web pages from the library provided further sources of evidence. The total data
collected for Library A are shown in Table 12. The relative contribution of each data source to
the findings for Library A is displayed in Figure 4.3.

Research Question 1
As defined by each of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) four frames—structural frame, political
frame, symbolic frame, and human resource frame—in what ways have the academic
libraries of these four universities exhibited evidence of reframing during the past five
years: 2010-2015?
Library A exhibited evidence of reframing across all four frames during the past five
years, as indicated in Figure 4.4, with the majority of the evidence falling in the Structural
Frame.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the budget proved to be a key issue, as it remained at relatively
the same level over the timeframe of this study, and was the source of reframing organizational
structure and operations, as the dean explained:
110

Our budget for purchasing materials has been flat for seven years or reduced slightly, and
our costs keep going up.
So we're less than half doing more, so how do we do that, okay? So that's just one
example of where we had to look at efficiencies, and we had to implement things that
others didn't, so we became this sort of lean operation there because we had to.

Figure 4.4. Library A: RQ1

The dean indicated the catalyst was the impact of the Great Recession, as he described:
It forced us to really look at every single thing we were doing from top to bottom. Do we
need to do this? Are we doing this in the most efficient and effective way? How are we
going to continue to move forward? How are we going to just make it work so that we're
doing things as efficiently and effectively as we can?
So, we had to think of new and creative ways.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the dean worked to build relationships with the university’s
administrative and faculty leaders in order to negotiate for scarce resources the library needed
while also providing value to the institution.
111

My ears are always open for what's happening, whether it's in Student Affairs or, you
know, where can we fit in, where can we help, where can we partner, . . . without
replicating the services that are offered elsewhere.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the library lost 35 positions from 2008 – 2011. When
opportunities arose to eventually fill the empty positions, the dean strategically created new
positions to match the library’s new direction, and enabled existing staff to take “authorship”
(Bolman & Deal, 2013, p. 399) of the organization through participation in planning and
decision-making, illustrated by these comments:
No, I was not refilling the same positions.
I also encouraged my directors to think not like I think, but don't get mired in the detail.
You know, let's think big. Let's think big.
I gave my team instructions, and I said, “OK, give me a business plan.”
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the most recognizable change involved extensive renovations to
the library’s physical facilities. When the dean arrived, he found a library that he termed merely
“a book warehouse,” as he described in these comments:
It was dark, it was dingy, it was unfriendly, it just felt cold and not welcoming, not
service-oriented, not helpful. The signage was bad. It was dirty-looking, and I thought,
"This is not a place anybody would want to come.”
Students themselves recognized this, according to a quote from a student in the university’s
student newspaper, “Some rooms are kind of ratty and have a mildew smell to them. If they are
going to spend money, I think the library is something they need to spend money on”
(Rodriguez, 2010, para. 10).
The dean began initial renovations to the library in 2010, leading one student to remark in
the university’s student newspaper, “This floor is a lot newer and more open and so much
112

cleaner. It makes the study environment nicer and just easier to be a part of.” The provost of the
university indicated commitment of the funds for the renovation were due to the university’s goal
of “enhancing the learning environment” (Oxner, 2010, para. 8). Additional renovations
followed. In 2012, the second floor was completely remodeled, at a cost of more than $3
million, to install a SMART lab to accommodate primarily STEM-related instruction and to
provide a contemporary space designed for group study, install the Job Shop and Career Corner,
and landscape an unused area behind the library to become an inviting park with fountains,
seating, and walkways (Abramova, 2012). In 2014, the university invested more than $2 million
in a complete remodel of the first floor and lobby to create a contemporary Learning Commons,
including the expansion of the Digital Learning Studio, installation of new computer stations and
high-end group study areas to accommodate student use which had reached 125 percent capacity
prior to the remodel (Rosenthal, 2014). The dean indicated he perceived these renovations
helped transform the perception of the library from an obsolete “book warehouse” to a central
hub for student success on campus, as indicated in these comments:
We created a space there for tutoring and learning to come in. So they were our first
tenant, if you will. As we did that, we then also brought the Writing Center in, which is
now called the Writing Studio, so that was our first "Here we're going to create a place
where students can come." It's bringing this facility into the 21st century to meet the
needs of the 21st century students.
Research Question 2
During the past five years, 2010-2015, what was the nature of the relationship between
the libraries and their parent universities and how has this relationship evolved during
this period?
Library A exhibited evidence of reframing across all four frames during the past five
years, as indicated in Figure 4.5, with the majority of the evidence falling in the Structural,
Symbolic, and Political Frames.

Figure 4.5. Library A: RQ2

All Four Frames
When the dean arrived at Library A in 2008, he related he perceived that “the library was
viewed on this campus as a book warehouse. We in no way, shape or form were viewed as
partners in the academic enterprise.”
By 2010, the new dean had already begun to change this relationship. Letters from both
the university president and provost were published in the library’s annual report that year, and
continued to be published in every issue through 2014. The minutes from the September 6, 2012
Board of Trustees meeting reported “the Provost announced a recent unveiling of the new Job
Shop and Smart Lab which are located in the . . . library and encouraged everyone to visit. The
. . . library has become an active learning environment equipped with 300 computers.” The June
6, 2013 minutes recommended implementation of a textbook affordability initiative, open-access
114

textbooks, e-textbooks—all available through the library—and “promoted laptop and iPad loaner
programs in the library.” The president’s fall address for 2013 connected student success with
the library and mentioned the new Smart Lab, while the president’s 2014 fall address connected
research and teaching “in our classrooms, our libraries.”
Structural Frame
Bolman and Deal (2013) emphasized the importance of organizational leaders’ thorough
understanding of their environment in order to successfully engage in reframing. In Library A,
the dean made a strategic effort to understand his environment, and to match the demands of the
environment and the needs of stakeholders to changes in process and products. For example, he
researched the university faculty profiles to discover their research interests before he engaged in
building the library’s collections. Then he established new collections designed specifically to
match both faculty needs and university mission as indicated in these comments:
One thing that emerged very clearly to me was we had a group of, I would say, about 130
faculty [who] in some way, shape or form were doing research that was related to
genocide, the Holocaust, trauma caused by natural or manmade disaster, PTSD, …human
rights, …the mental health issues of survivors of torture, trauma. …So eventually over
the course of a year or so, we established the Holocaust and Genocide Studies Center.
During that time I was able to get one-time dollars from the provost to help us build those
collections. Environmental [studies] … was another big thing that the university was
going for, and there are many faculty doing research there, so we also poured resources
into building that [collection] up. We began to shape where we were going.
In another example, he researched the demographics of the student body to determine their need
for technology rentals, and discovered an opportunity to provide laptops and iPads for
checkout—an initiative so successful it caught the notice of the Board of Trustees, as indicated
above, and in these comments:
I also did a lot of digging into the demographics of our student body . . . [and] 44 percent
of our undergraduates have Pell Grants. You know they're not coming from wealthy
families, right? They don't have laptops necessarily. So we started applying for
115

technology fees. We check out 100 laptops now. We have iPads we check out. We
check out video equipment to [students]. We check out cameras, audio, the whole bit.
Political Frame
When the dean first joined Library A, he found that while his position reported to the
provost, he, as the Dean of the Libraries, was not included on any university administrative
councils. In 2010, the dean began a strategic process of engaging the library with the power base
of the university administration and its goals and objectives, as indicated in these comments:
So I started fighting that battle, sort of subtly, but I did. … I managed to get the president
and the provost in a room in the library at the same time to lay out what we were doing.
It blew them away. They were like “Oh my . . . You get it.” So we carefully crafted
what we were doing to feed into the university's strategic plan. …But in order to do that
it meant we really had to start engaging with the teaching faculty. …We need[ed] to
have a different face to the faculty, to the students.
And so the next time I went in [to meet with the provost], …I said, “You know, I'm
working so hard here to try to form these relationships, and I'm not sitting at the tables
where I can do anything.” And fortunately, there was another dean in the same boat—
that was the Dean of the Graduate School at the time. …So he [the Provost] restructured
some things, and he put both of us on the Council of Deans. So we were sitting in the
group where the decisions were being made. …That started another shift where the
perception of the deans was that I was one of their colleagues, not, you know, off on the
side.

Involvement in the university’s decision-making bodies and relationships with the university’s
upper administration, enabled the dean to continue to successfully negotiate for scarce resources.
For example, when the university wanted to create a Smart Lab in the library, the lab was
originally intended for the use of math students only. The dean successfully negotiated it into a
lab for the use of all students, as he explained:
I just had to be very calm about it, but it was “No, we're not going to do that. I can't have
a single academic department monopolizing space in the library and only those people
using it. No. We are a building for everyone.”
116

The dean also began negotiating partnerships with other areas of the university. When the
provost wanted to find a new home for the tutoring and learning center, the dean took the
initiative and offered a place in the library. Utilization of the center immediately went up 900
percent. That was the library’s first partnership with another area of the university. A career
center and job shop were next. The dean recalled it this way:
Well, when you look at what the performance metrics are for the university, I mean one
of them is the six year graduation rate. You know, where are the students placed? What
kind of jobs are they getting? How much are they making?
Not only was [the Office for Undergraduate Research] in the [library] building, but when
undergraduates would come in and talk . . . about research projects, I think in the first 15
projects, five of them were [by] students who were doing research into special collections
that we have here [in the library].
More recent partnerships included the innovative strategy of assisting the university’s College of
Marine Science with the National Science Foundation mandate for data management of grants
for research, indicated in these comments:
We had discussions internally and we jumped in with both feet. We started doing
consultation work with faculty who were applying for grants on the data management
planning that they needed to do, which then quickly morphed for us into . . . actually
working with the data itself to provide the Metadata for it, and to create the repository for
many of the data sets and data files. Now, we're almost overrun with work. So Marine
Science is over the moon with what we're doing.
The dean and the library also engaged in relationship-building with faculty through
innovations in scholarly communications. The dean took a strategic risk, shortly after the effects
of the Great Recession were being felt by the university, to invest scarce resources in a service to
support the rising trend of scholarly communications or open publishing, as he described:
In 2009, I used money from a foundation account that I have to license software from
BePress. The software package is called Digital Commons. …Within that software
117

package faculty can put their own profiles in. They can upload their own articles or we
can do it for them. We're [now] publishing 15 open-access journals through there.
Symbolic Frame
When the dean arrived on campus, the physical facilities of the library as well as the
perception of its mission by stakeholders, indicated obsolescence and a lack of connection and
alignment with the parent university. The library’s own strategic plan and mission statement
also indicated a lack of connection with the parent university’s goals, as well as a lack of
consideration of the impact of environmental forces, such as the effects of the Great Recession,
which had begun prior to the implementation of the new plan, as the dean described:
So, when I arrived, the university already had a strategic plan, and the library did not fit
into that. There were a set of decisions made about three weeks or four weeks before I
showed up that I was really not happy about. I had specifically asked, you know, don't
make any major [plans], and out trotted a [library] strategic plan and out trotted a new
mission statement about a month before I started . . . which I had no input into.
Research Question 3
How have the libraries’ missions changed during the past five years (2010-2015), and
what factors or environmental forces may have been influential catalysts?
Bolman and Deal (2014) indicated that organizational missions and strategic plans fall
into the Symbolic Frame, so it is natural that the majority of the evidence for research question
three, concerning the mission of the library, fell into that frame, as illustrated in Figure 4.6.
Symbolic Frame
As indicated above, a new strategic plan for the library was provided to the dean when he
arrived in 2008. A copy of this strategic plan was not available to be obtained for this study.
The dean indicated for the first few years of his tenure with Library A, he did not actively try to
change that plan:

118

When I started, I didn't want to come in like a bull in a china stop until I knew the lay of
the land and had time to make my own observations about what was going on, what was
needed, where we needed to go. So, I would guess, I don't think we made any changes to
it for at least a year, year-and-a-half. The strategic plan that was there, in my opinion,
wasn't really a strategic plan. And my own personal philosophy, quite frankly, is when
you're in an economic recession and you're engaged in budget cuts, it's really dumb to
waste time on a strategic plan. Because all of them always end up with lofty things that
you want to do and they always require dollars. And when you don't have dollars to do
that. So it was better to come up with a set of, “here's our strategic directions. This is
where we want to go.”

However, the dean indicated future mission statements were developed with staff input and
included research on environmental factors such as the rapid advent of new technologies and a
flat budget forecast. The library’s current strategic plan, 2013-2018, published on the library
Web site, included a mission statement with a direct connection to supporting the parent
university by providing “resources, services and collections to advance the [university’s]
119

teaching, learning, and research mission” (USF Libraries Office of the Dean, 2015, para. 1). The
plan’s strategic goals emphasized engagement and collaboration with faculty and students, as
well as continuous improvement of “library operations, facilities, services, programs, and
collections” (USF Libraries Office of the Dean, 2015, para. 6).
Research Question 4
How have the responsibilities and duties of the library dean changed during the past five
years (2010-2015)?
The majority of the evidence indicated changes in the duties of the dean of Library A fell
in the human resource frame, as shown in Figure 4.7.

Figure 4.7. Library A: RQ4
Human Resource Frame
The dean of Library A initially focused his efforts on realigning staff responsibilities to
staunch the gaping loss of more than 35 positions due to the impact of the Great Recession, as he
explained:
120

At least initially the library did not receive direct dollar cuts. Our cuts came in the form
of when positions became vacant we couldn't fill them and we lost them. And so in the
aggregate over the first three years that I was here, so from '08 to '11, the library lost 35
positions, just gone, which amounted to way over a million-dollar budget cut, and it left
us completely short-staffed. We had no backup for anything, and so there were several
things that happened as a result of that. One was that the organizational structure
completely flattened.
Structural Frame
As a result, the dean focused many of his efforts on changing the structural frame of the
library organization, as he explained:
That hit us where it most likely did not hit other libraries in the state. They didn't suffer
the same kind of massive personnel loss. So I would say on some levels it put us on a
cutting edge primarily because of that, so while we bemoaned the fact we lost all these
positions it made us into what I think really ended up being a lean, mean fighting
machine, because we had to.
The dean also transitioned the library into the digital age, as describe in RQ8, below.
Political Frame
Later on, the emphasis of the dean’s activities moved into the political frame, as the
library expanded its engagement with the university and external community—building
relationships and partnerships. The dean also became more involved in fundraising efforts to
raise money from private donations. He summarized his experience this way:
At the very beginning of my time here, I felt like I needed to have sort of an intensive
internal focus on the organization with a slightly less external focus. But, as time has
gone by, I also now have a much more external focus than I do internal, in a way. I think
many of the organizational problems that existed when I came in have been fixed, and so,
I'm able to concentrate much more on a higher level than I was, say, initially, where I
needed to dig down to find out what was really going on.
Research Question 5
How have the ways in which the library assesses and communicates its value to its
constituencies changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
121

Library A exhibited evidence of reframing across all four frames, as shown in Figure 4.8,
with the majority of the evidence in the symbolic frame.

Figure 4.8. Library A: RQ5
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the dean of Library A confirmed that his library still continues to
collect and communicate traditional quantitative values about the library. These metrics include
the number of volumes, serials, and databases, as well as the number and type of libraries in the
system, and the total collections expenditures (USF Office of Decision Support, 2015, p. 21).
Gate count—the total number of students through the doors—also continues to be important, as
shown by the dean’s comments here:
[The administration] sees that students want to be here. They see them engaged in work
here. They see how our equipment is used. They see the value in that.
We’re the busiest facility on campus. The number of people coming in got bigger, and
. . . it kept increasing, and we kept getting more demand.
Tutoring and learning services and utilization went up 900 percent when they came in
here.
122

Political Frame
In the political frame, the dean transitioned his role with the university to become an
active member of the university’s Council of Deans. The dean also encouraged his staff to
become involved in key university committees across campus, and helped open the doors for
their participation.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, Library A proved its value through vigorous attention to
alignment with its parent university’s mission, goals, and strategic plan, as indicated in these
comments from the dean:
I think it's been an effort on my part to constantly make sure that we're walking in lock
step with the university strategically.
[The provost] saw that it was not only to be a hub for student success in the library, and
transforming it from this book warehouse into something much different, and he looked
at that, and that's why I got the support from him. So it was on multiple levels. He saw
we were feeding into the strategic plan for the university. He saw that our use [of the
building] was going sky-high because of the services we were offering and what we were
able to do for the students. We went to 24/5 access. All kinds of things were happening.
Research Question 6
In what ways have the library’s interactions with students, faculty, and the community
changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
The majority of the evidence for research question six fell into the structural frame, as
shown in Figure 4.9.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, Library A instituted a variety of new services and products strategically
designed (through focus groups and other research) to meet the needs of students and faculty.
Some of the services included the expansion of the liaison librarian service to reach out to faculty

123

in their own departments, increasing the library’s operating hours to a 24-hour schedule five days
a week, providing hi-tech equipment such as 3-D printers for student and faculty use, and
offering laptops and other technologies for check-out. The library also took the lead in
university-wide initiatives such as textbook affordability, as the dean explained:
We were very early on, we took the lead on campus in the textbook affordability issue.
We were the first ones, I think in the state to do it. Which I mean involved a multitude of
things, from putting open access textbooks up to working with the bookstore so that for
each class, I believe it was, that had an enrollment of 100 or more, the bookstore gave us
two copies of the textbooks to put on reserve for the students.

Figure 4.9. Library A: RQ6

Political Frame
In the political frame, the dean made an effort to open lines of communication with the
deans of the other colleges and the faculty senate, as he indicated in these remarks:

124

I began forming, I would say, really close relationships with the deans of the colleges and
talking with them about what are their needs, what are their wants. They know what it is
we're doing and the fact that we stepped up.
The dean also formed partnerships with other areas of the university, to bring in services such as
the writing center and office of undergraduate research, as described above.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the library’s renovations and addition of a Starbucks café made it
a popular draw for students as well as an actively utilized center for academic resources and
services, as described in the sections above.
Research Question 7
When changes occurred, were they library-led or university directed? If they were
library-led, in what ways did the library persuade its parent institution (and/or other
constituencies) to accept the change(s)?
The evidence indicates Library A led change across all four frames, as shown in Figure
4.10, with the majority of the changes in the structural frame. All the changes experienced by
Library A, described in this report, were led by the Library, even if the original catalyst for the
change was an environmental factor, such as the impact of the Great Recession. The dean
expressed it this way:
For far too long, libraries have been reactive rather than proactive. And as much as I can
do it, I try to be proactive. …We've made do with what we've had, but we've continued
to change, we've continued to innovate, we've continued to move forward. And yet,
we're still in line with the University's strategic plan.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the biggest change came as the result of the effects of the Great
Recession, which forced a change in the organizational hierarchy from a traditional vertical
structure to a horizontal professional bureaucracy, as the dean indicated:

Figure 4.10. Library A: RQ7

And so in the aggregate over the first three years that I was here, so from '08 to '11, the
library lost 35 positions, just gone, which amounted to way over a million-dollar budget
cut, and it left us completely short-staffed. We had no backup for anything, and so there
were several things that happened as a result of that.
One was that the organizational structure completely flattened. We had to, because it was
like there was no middle management kind of layer, so it was the top layer and then sort
of everybody else.
So I would say on some levels it put us on a cutting edge primarily because of that, so
while we bemoaned the fact we lost all these positions it made us into what I think really
ended up being a lean, mean fighting machine, because we had to.
The library also was an early innovator and leader in the purchase and licensing of electronic
resources, which is described in further detail in section RQ8 below.
Political Frame
In the political frame, as described in sections above, the dean engineered opportunities
to become a stronger participant in university decision-making groups.
126

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the dean leveraged the university’s goal of enhancing student
success to establish the library as a hub for student success and a priority of the university’s
strategic plan. For example, the dean was the catalyst for all of the renovations to the library
previously described. Additionally, the dean indicated the library led an initiative on information
literacy:
We're living in a digital age. It’s multi-media, it’s digital media. We not only need
information literacy, we need digital media literacy. How are they [students] going to get
that when they don't have a place to learn it? So that’s where we jumped in. All right.
So now the students, the general student body, can come here. You know, we’ll show
them how to use a video camera. We’ll show them how to use the audio equipment.
We’ll show them how to do this. We’ll help them learn the software packages in the
digital media commons where they can go in and … do video editing, audio editing. So
they’ve got a place that they can come, okay. We’re now going to move into 3D printing.
We’re putting in a proposal to bring some of that into the library.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the dean indicated an active progress toward reframing the
organizational culture through empowerment of the employees:
I mean, two times a year at least I would hold an all-staff meeting where we would talk
about things. I would let them ask me questions. You know, I’d go through what we
were doing, how we were doing, why we were doing things.
I also told all of my directors, I said, “I’m available if you want me to come to any of
your group meetings or unit meetings. I’m available.” I did that at least once a year with
each of the groups. Constantly reinforcing why we were doing this. And they started to
get it.
Research Question 8
In what ways has the evolution of the virtual library impacted and influenced changes in
the library?
127

The majority of the evidence regarding the impact of the virtual library fell into the
structural frame, as shown in Figure 4.11.

Figure 4.11. Library A: RQ8
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, providing sufficient digital resources to the university community
meant retooling the library organization to handle and deliver the new technologies—hardware
and software. The advent of the virtual library also impacted the budget, as the demand for eresources consistently climbed, while library funding for expenditures fell or remained relatively
flat, as he explained:
I think we've seen a sharp preference, at least on the part of the students, for digital,
digital, digital. Not all students, interestingly enough, but I would say the vast majority,
want it anytime, anywhere, anyplace. And so, that has really had an impact on how we
purchase and the formats we purchase. The other area [in] which that's had a major
impact is in service delivery.

128

Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the library provided training for employees in the new
technologies, and also created new positions designed specifically to manage these resources.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the library’s implementation of these resources early in the
timeframe of this study—for example, mobile access to resources were integrated into the
library’s services in 2011, as indicated by the Library’s archival Web sites—supported the
library’s growing reputation as a service-oriented organization and “one-stop-shop” for research.
Research Question 9
How has the library’s role in the life of the university changed during the past five years
(2010-2015)?
The evidence indicates Library A’s role in the life of its parent university changed across
all four frames during the past five years, but most predominantly in the symbolic frame, as
shown in Figure 4.12.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, Library A, at the beginning of the timeframe for this study, had a
mission and strategic plan which were, for the most part, disconnected from the goals of its
parent university and the needs of its students. The library’s facilities were also aging, and
provided a less-than-welcoming environment for the university community. The new dean
employed innovation, ingenuity, an understanding of both the environment of the library and the
university and the environmental forces acting upon them, as well as his political savvy to begin
a comprehensive and strategic process of renovations and remodels—to both facilities and
technologies—and vigorous reconnection to the mission and strategic goals of the university.

Figure 4.12. Library A: RQ9

By 2014, the library had become, in the dean’s words, “the busiest facility on campus,” and a
place so desirable to students they staged a protest when the library’s operating hours were
planned to be reduced. In this frame, the library’s role changed from a superfluous extremity of
the university body to the symbolic heart of the institution, as indicated in this quote from the
university president printed in the library’s 2014 annual report:
The University Libraries have had a spectacular year with beautiful renovations,
enhanced learning and research opportunities, and extensive academic support programs
which truly make our libraries the heart of our students’ campus life. The Libraries'
faculty and staff have worked diligently to be responsive to student needs. … The
Libraries' inclusive approach not only supports the research and teaching goals of
students and faculty, but contributes to an environment that makes all students feel
welcome. (p. 1)
Summary and Themes
While the themes for this study were a priori the four frames identified by Bolman and
Deal (2013), nevertheless, seven themes emerged in the data analysis which deserve mention.
130

The evidence revealed the majority of the changes to be the result of strategic effort, primarily
through the actions and leadership of the dean, indicated by the dean’s use of the words “work,”
“try hard,” “need to change,” “effort,” as well as indications of proactive planning. The
companion theme to this emerged as leadership, indicated by the dean’s comments describing
his efforts to take proactive action to initiate a project or goal.
The dean of Library A also successfully engaged in risk-taking and leading change,
which mirror Bolman and Deal’s (2008) admonition for successful leaders “to see new
possibilities and to create new opportunities” and “to discover alternatives when options seem
severely constrained” (p. 438). For example, the dean related one anecdote about a discussion
with the provost concerning the early renovations to the library:
I said, “If we're going to do anything on the second floor of the library we're going to
redo the whole floor. It's the whole floor or nothing.”
A final theme of transformation was also evinced, as the ongoing changes in the library were
identified and recognized as transformative by its constituents across the board. This was
indicated through the dean’s use of the word “transformation” and “change.” In summary,
Library A engaged in reframing across all four frames, as shown in Figure 4.13, with the
majority of the evidence falling into the structural frame.

Figure 4.13. Library A: Summary of Results

Library B
Context: Library B
Library B is situated in the flagship public university in the state. Founded in 1858 as a
land-grant university, the parent university of Library B is the oldest university in the state, is
located in the county seat, and is a member of the elite Association of American Universities
(University of Florida [UF], 2014a). The university is currently ranked 14th in U.S. News &
World Report’s “Top Public Universities,” as well as in the top ten among a variety of other
rankings (UF, 2014b, para. 1). The university offers more than 100 undergraduate degrees and
nearly 200 graduate degree programs, and has a student enrollment exceeding 50,000 (UF,
2014b; UF, 2014c). The 2,000 acre campus houses 16 colleges—including a college of medicine
and a hospital, 900 buildings, and a section included on the National Register of Historic Places

132

(UF, 2014a; UF, 2014b). The university has an annual economic impact of nearly $9 billion, and
employs more than 41,000 people (UF, 2014b).
Library B consists of seven libraries, and is recognized as “the largest information
resource system in the state … containing more than 5.6 million volumes, 7.9 million
microfilms, 453,000 e-books, 158,695 full-text electronic journals and 1,162 electronic
databases” (UF, 2014c; UF, 2014d). The main building houses the humanities, business, and
social sciences library (UF George A Smathers Libraries, 2015). The building is situated on the
historic university quadrangle containing the university’s signature bell tower. The library
building’s front entrance faces the quadrangle, which consists of a large expanse of green lawn,
trees, seating areas, and pedestrian walkways. The bell tower is on the opposite side from the
library. The front entrance also has a long covered portico stretching the length of the building
and creating a breezeway to the large original wing of the library. The building’s façade is
composed of red brick with ivory-colored stone trim. Most notable in the building’s design are
rows and rows of windows. In fact, the back side of the building features nearly wall-to-wall and
floor-to-roofline windows. The back side of the library is the public “face” of the building, as it
faces the main street in the university’s city. This side also features a large, formal park, with a
wide expanse of lawn, trees, pedestrian walkways, seating areas, and street lamps with a historic
design. The park stretches approximately 100 feet from the building to the sidewalk, where a
large, separate sign indicates the name of the library, designated for a donor who was both an
alumnus and state leader. The fourth side of the library building is adjacent to other university
buildings. This excerpt from the library’s Web site provides additional descriptive information
about the library (UF George A. Smathers Libraries, n.d.):

Context: interview with the dean of Library B. I conducted my first interview with the
dean of Library B on Friday, May 8, 2015, from 1:00 to approximately 4:30 PM. The dean
voluntarily extended the time of the interview. We talked for approximately two hours. Then, at
3:00 PM, the dean also offered to give me a guided tour of the library. I used this opportunity to
gather data for my observation data collection. Here is a brief excerpt from my researcher’s
journal describing a portion of the meeting:
At the dot of 1:00 PM, the dean came out of her office to meet me. She gave me a big
smile, and shook my hand. I thanked her again for letting me interview her, and she told
me it sounded like it would be “fun.” She showed me to her office, and indicated for me
to sit on a couch in a seating area, adjacent to her desk. The couch was dark orange (one
134

of the university’s colors). She sat beside me, which seemed to me to indicate she was
treating me as an equal in this conversation. It also seemed to me to indicate a relaxed
and friendly personal style on the part of the dean. While I was setting up the recorder
and taking out my notepad, the dean gave me a brief “tour” of her office, which was
filled with bookshelves full of gator statues, gator figurines, gator drawings, gator stuffed
animals, and on her desk were more gators. She laughed and said most of them were
given to her. When I heard her story, a few minutes later, I understood her passion for
collecting the mascot of the university, since she was an alumna and an employee. Her
passion for the university and her enthusiasm for the library became quickly evident
during the interview. She exuded tremendous energy and a positive attitude,
demonstrated through her sense of humor, frequent laughter, energetic tone of voice, and
her comments filled with hope and an optimistic outlook.
I asked my first question, then the dean took the lead on the conversation. She seemed to
be enthusiastic to share her information, so I decided not to force the interview to tightly
follow my interview protocol. Instead, I took my direction for the interview from the
Dean’s conversation, and followed where her conversation led. She had obviously
thought about this interview and prepared for it, because as she spoke, she had a number
of documents ready to share with me. As she spoke and recalled her experiences in the
library over the past five years, I interjected my interview questions when and where they
seemed to fit into the flow of the conversation. I kept track of where the interview was
going through the notes I was taking during the interview. At the same time, though, I
needed to maintain eye contact with the dean, so I couldn’t focus on the note taking for
more than a few seconds at a time. We also talked about some topics which were not in
my interview protocol, but they were interesting trails to follow. For example, the dean
and her library were integrally involved in the university’s fundraising campaigns, and
this, to me, indicated an aspect of the relationship between the library and the university I
wanted to make note of. I might even add questions about fundraising to the remaining
interviews I have with the other two library directors.
We talked for nearly two hours. I asked the dean after an hour if she wanted to end the
interview and continue the rest of it at a later date, but she told me she had set aside most
of the rest of the afternoon to spend time with me. I thought that was incredibly nice, and
I told her so. So, we continued the interview for another hour and a half. Then, she
offered to take me on a guided tour of her library. I was thrilled! Especially because
most of the areas in the library are key card controlled, so I wouldn’t have been able to
enter or observe them without an escort.
So, for the next hour and a half, the dean walked me through every floor of the main
library, as well as the historic Library East wing, and the nearby Science Library, which
135

the dean drove me to in a golf cart. I took my notepad with me, and kept notes on our
conversation, but I couldn’t record it, because we were walking and driving, and I had my
hands full taking notes while also trying to look where I was going and also pay attention
to the dean. I also made my observation notes during this guided tour, but wasn’t able to
take photos, because my hands were full, and we were walking and talking and meeting
people, etc. It was very stressful to be doing all this simultaneously! But it was an
amazing experience! I was able to see the library in a way I never would have been able
to on my own, and everywhere we went, everyone we met seemed to me to be excited
and happy to meet the dean. Everyone stopped what they were doing and came over to
talk to her. They were always happy and smiling and greeted her enthusiastically. Her
return greeting was reciprocally enthusiastic, and she knew everyone by name and
complimented them on some aspect of their area or service.
Findings: Library B
Two interviews with the dean of Library B resulted in a total of 202 significant
comments, and 178 coded comments. Additionally, 20 institutional documents, 37 news articles,
54 photos, 1 video, and 32 observations, were collected. My researcher’s journal and analysis of
historic and contemporary web pages from the library provided further sources of evidence. The
total data collected for Library B are shown in Table 13. The relative contribution of each data
source to the findings for Library B is displayed in Figure 4.14.

Research Question 1
As defined by each of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) four frames—structural frame, political
frame, symbolic frame, and human resource frame—in what ways have the academic
libraries of these four universities exhibited evidence of reframing during the past five
years: 2010-2015?
The majority of the evidence for research question one fell into the symbolic frame, as
shown in Figure 4.15.
Symbolic Frame
Shortly before the beginning of the timeframe for this study, the leadership of the
university in this case set a strategic goal for their university to achieve national preeminence,
and the university achieved preeminence in 2013. The university leadership launched a
transformation of their century-old library as part of their strategic plan. They renovated existing
137

library facilities, and built a new modern wing onto the library’s historic main building, as the
dean explained:
So this library had been closed for three years and had reopened less than a year before I
came. So they had gutted it and they had completely redone it. So it was a very modern
building. We had the first Starbucks. It was very highly energized.

A news article at the time reported it this way:
It was described as looking like a haunted house because of the dim lighting in the lobby
before the renovation.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the university changed the organizational structure by elevating the
former position of library director to Dean of the Libraries—an academic leadership position
which provided entrée into the university’s top leadership groups. The university then hired a

138

new dean (the dean interviewed for this study) to lead their library, with the implicit charge to be
a change agent, as illustrated by the dean’s comments:
And at that time the University of Florida was recruiting for a dean and during the four
years I had been superintendent of documents I had worked very closely with the ARL
libraries because most of the ARLs are depositories and many of them are regionals. In
fact, the provost who was then in place who was the one who actually hired me had
contracted a sort of an elite distinguished faculty kind of study the year before I came
called the “Future of the Libraries,” which is still out on the website, which really had
looked at the state of the libraries currently and some of the issues about where they were
going.
In the phone interview it became very clear that they were interested in change
management and a lot of that kind of thing and so my qualifications from having
managed a large budget and a large staff and a huge cataloging operation and the back-they were very interested and intrigued by the fact that I had this background in both
government and industry. And I did have this strong working relationship already with
ARLs so I knew a lot about the issues that were going on.
He [the provost] also elevated the position. It had been a director to a dean so he put me
in the community of academic deans which has made a huge difference in my access and
ability when I was hired.
And the president, when he told the deans that I had accepted the job, told them that I was
a diversity candidate, not because I was a woman but because I had worked in
government and industry, and in academia we run the risk of only talking to people like
ourselves.

Research Question 2
During the past five years, 2010-2015, what was the nature of the relationship between
the libraries and their parent universities and how has this relationship evolved during
this period?
The majority of the evidence for research question two fell into the symbolic frame, as
shown in Figure 4.16.

Figure 4.16. Library B: RQ2

Structural Frame
The university engaged in a strategic and thorough environmental scan and consideration
of the future of the university’s library, led by the then-provost and conducted by a universitywide Future of the Libraries Committee (2006):
The committee came away with a renewed appreciation for the absolute importance of
the library in a major research university where it should occupy a central role. Indeed,
the library has been called “the DNA of the academic institution,” determining our
quality and directions. [Library B] is fortunate to have a library that is vital and valued,
but like many libraries, it stands in a precarious position.
The major pressure from the external environment included the universal impact of the
technological revolution on library collections and services (Kisling, 2007). Some of the
pressures from the internal environment included the retirement of the then library director after
service of more than 22 consecutive years, the retirements of several additional long-serving
library staff, and a lack of storage space for print and materials collections (Kisling, 2007). The
140

university set out to meet these challenges through the construction of a new wing and
renovation of their existing library building (which is discussed in detail in the symbolic frame
section below). Strategic directions for the library were set out in a general way in the report
from the Future of the Libraries Committee. The university also reframed the library’s
organizational structure by elevating the position of library director to Dean of the Libraries—
responsible for leading all of the university’s satellite and branch libraries—and a position
integrated into the top leadership groups of the university. More about the impact of this change
is discussed in the political frame below. Once this foundation was laid, the university hired a
new dean to complete the transformation.
The new dean brought a wealth of non-traditional professional experience to her role,
with a background as the first woman and second librarian to serve as Superintendent of
Documents at the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO). She also had been responsible for
directing the first office of electronic information dissemination at the GPO, and had experience
with the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, an organization with “a
charter to develop policy to meet the information needs of the American people and advise
Congress and the White House” (Library Dean B, Personal communication, May 14, 2015).
The organizational structure of the library when the new dean joined it in 2007 resembled
what Bolman and Deal (2014) term “a headless giant” (p. 87). The dean described her first
impressions of the library’s structure this way:
So in this building we had chairs of three different departments reporting to two different
associate deans. And so I would come in, because it was our first football season since
the library reopened, and there were all sorts of issues about, do we have enough paper
towels, and toilet paper, and overflowing trashcans, and revelers coming in, whatever.
And I would come in, and say, "How did it go this weekend?" And somebody would
answer me for the second floor, and say, "But you'd have to ask somebody else to get the
answer for the third floor." And I was like, what is wrong with this picture, right? And
141

we had a chair for collection development, and another person who was in charge of
reference, humanities and social science reference. But it turned out that all of the
collection managers were in humanities and social sciences but two, and they did some of
the sciences, but not all, and they were actually physically in Marston, in the science
library, which was probably right. But there were other people, many of the liaison
librarians, doing selection within their own discipline, in the sciences, and in the
humanities and social sciences. So they weren't doing comprehensive collection
development. They were doing some. And then, when you said to them, well what do
they do? Well, they work the reference desk, they do collection development, they do
instruction. And then when you talk to the reference people, what do you do? “Well,
we're at the reference desk, and we have some collection development.” And it was like,
you're doing the same things in different proportions, and you're reporting to two
different directors in the same building.
During the past five years, the dean of Library B revised the organizational structure into that of
a more professional bureaucracy, with divisions matched to new organizational directions, and
clear vertical hierarchies within divisions, as indicated by the libraries’ organizational charts.
More detail about these changes is discussed in the human resource frame section below.
The university’s Future of the Library Committee (2006) had also committed the
university’s financial support for library initiatives and $25 million from a dedicated portion of
the university’s upcoming Capital Campaign. Unfortunately, the Great Recession arrived mere
months following the arrival of the new dean of the libraries. The impact of the recession
manifested in immediate budget cuts to the library, as well as long-term effects which continued
through the entire timeframe of this study (2010-2015). Renovations and upgrades were
postponed, the planned capital campaign was also postponed, and rising costs of electronic
resources necessitated cutbacks in other areas. University financial support helped fill in some
gaps, but the budget has remained relatively flat since the recession. The dean described the
experience:
I came in May and we took our first budget cut in July. … So obviously the biggest
single thing [impacting the library] has been the budget, because it has really constrained
142

growth and positions, and it’s constrained opportunities to even do these kinds of
renovations although our provost has been very generous. … I would say that the
academic deans would all say, and have said, they understand, and they are very unhappy
with the loss of the funding for the libraries, but their own colleges are suffering too and
it's kind of “How of do you rearrange those deck chairs on the Titanic?” And on average
our materials costs are going up about six percent per year and our budget has been flat.
And so we have been cutting content primarily print. … So we’ve all talked about we
have to get new money. We can’t just rob Peter to pay Paul. I do think that,
notwithstanding the cuts we have seen, they have been very generous to the libraries
given the recession, and given the other cuts that the university was experiencing.
Funding also came in from unexpected sources. The university’s student government voted to
fund extended hours for the library, as well as additional renovations to the front façade of the
library, to make it a more student-centered environment. The student government also voted to
assess themselves with a new technology fee to support library initiatives, but the proposal was
rejected by the state governor. By mid-2015, near the end of the timeframe for this study, the
university’s capital campaign was once again close to implementation, and the library was once
again included among the campaign’s fundraising goals, as the dean’s comments indicate:
It happens that the new president did ask for some central themes that were cross-cutting,
and the library—because it does serve everybody—really fits the model of what he’s
looking for. And what they’re saying is the president is going to do a lot in the way of I
mean he’ll help everybody with development. That's part of the job, but he is going to
really spend a lot of his time on the crosscutting themes. So if we can get into that, that
could be really beneficial.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the needs of students were the priority in the design of the new
building and the renovations, and this was reflected in the architect’s description and plans
(Design Cost Data [DCD], 2007). This was a dramatic change from the library’s pre-renovation
years, with an aging building, outdated technological resources, and physical facilities in which

143

the growing need for space for materials storage overrode the need for student-oriented space.
The dean related:
This building, as I understand it, had become just crammed full of books, so much so,
that there wasn’t shelf space for them and that they were literally moving [student study]
tables out to make space for books. [Now] there’s a distinctive wing on the back where
most of the books are, and they’re in compact shelving, … and then the perimeter where
the windows are is the student study space.
So in this process they turned the whole original part of the building almost totally into
space for students. They cleared the ground floor and did this beautiful student learning
commons. We had the first Starbucks. So it was a very modern building. It was very
highly energized, … and [it was] very, very popular with students. The year before they
closed [it for renovations], the average foot traffic in and out of the building was about
445,000 a year and it went up almost immediately to 1.4 million [when it reopened].
The new building design also emphasized bringing more natural daylight into the building
(DCD, 2007).
While the dean inherited a partially renovated main building with a new wing, there yet
remained many areas in the main building, as well as satellite library buildings, clinging to the
past. As she focused her efforts on realigning library operations to institutional mission, the dean
also continued to direct efforts to refocus the library’s spaces toward the needs of students.
So we could see in [the main library building] some new ways of providing space for
students. But most of our other buildings were not there. And so we’ve gradually, even
with the recession and with very limited funding, between donors and the president of the
university, paid for the renovation of [the science library], and we have more in the
pipeline. We have a 1970s education library so we’re putting together a plan to send to
the provost and the president for about a $2 million renovation of that to just completely
refresh the building.
The dean also restored some of the library’s historic spaces to their original purpose. For
example, the original reading room of the library had gradually, over the past century,
accumulated administrative offices and row upon row of materials storage shelving to the point
where students and faculty rarely used the facility or accessed the materials collected there. She
144

moved the materials to a high-density storage facility, and renovated the space back to nearly its
original look and design, uncovering windows hidden behind shelving and a historic
architectural wooden balcony hidden behind a temporary wall. More importantly, the dean
opened the collections to universal use, as this anecdote relates:
We have an [original] Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings manuscript. It’s 14 feet long. And our
conservator encapsulated it, in a kind of a plastic, so it can be rolled and stored: it won't
get brittle, it won't deteriorate from light. I took it to a board of trustees luncheon, and let
them pass it around the table, and I was not worried about what people had on their
fingers, because it's protected. What that means is this isn't something where every use
deteriorates it, and [only] two people a year see it in the back, in the dark, with their
white gloves. It's something I can bring out for any visitor, for any student. It doesn't have
to be a senior scholar to get to handle a Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings manuscript. It can be a
freshman who's interested in her, and writing a paper. I mean, it just changes the whole
dynamic, and it relates the investment that we make in the building, in the staff, and in
the collections to the academics of the campus.
The dean also moved the library’s significant collections – those tied most closely with the
university’s institutional mission and the research needs of students and faculty—into more
central areas of student use. She added more lighting, new furniture for the lobby (the new
building didn’t have lobby furniture when she arrived), a sixth floor dedicated to graduate
student use, and private study cubicles for graduate students and faculty. She instituted a policy
to allow students to rearrange the library’s furniture to suit their study needs and habits, and to
bring food into the library, as she related in these comments:
[When] I walked in [to the library] for my interview, and there’s Starbucks, and there's a
sign that says, “No food or drinks upstairs.” The building was designed with that little
space opposite Starbucks, so people could go downstairs and eat their lunch, but don't
bring it upstairs. So the very first day I was here, we changed the food policy. We still
don't encourage pizza and fried chicken, but non-smelly, non-messy. And in fact, the
head of student government said to me, “Now I don't have to sneak to eat a granola bar
when I'm studying in the library.”

145

The next planned renovation is a redesign of the front entrance to the library as a gathering place
for students. This planned renovation, already approved by the university’s student government,
will, as the dean explained, extend the library's perception of service and support physically
outward, into the campus' main central quadrangle. The dean explained, “it’s space that's going
to serve students, so it takes the whole kind of student learning commons outside.”
Through all these activities, the dean also actively worked to reframe the library as a
cultural center for the university, a place not only for traditional library activities, but a site for
events, ceremonies, rituals, and other activities important to the life of the university. For
example, she arranged for the library to annually host an alumni homecoming parade watch
party, since the new wing’s third-floor wall of windows directly overlooks the street of the
parade route. She brought in cutting-edge new technologies—such as 3D printers—or centrally
relocated them into the library from dispersed areas around campus to create spaces for classes,
conferences, and collaborative research. She established a ceremony to celebrate the library’s
digitization of its 10 millionth page. The new president of the university, installed in January
2015, requested the library as a location for some of his inaugural events.
Political Frame
When the new dean arrived at Library B, her position had already been elevated from
“director” to “dean,” giving her access to, and participation in, the university’s top leadership
groups—both formal, such as the council of deans, and informal, such as the women’s
administrators group. The dean commented on the impact of this change:
It’s been really, really, really helpful to have that access, and to be able to talk with them.
When I first came, I went around and did a meeting with each dean, and talking about
what was going on. My staff continues to tell me that they see a huge difference because
I’m an academic dean: the meetings I’m in, the social events at the president’s house, the
president’s box for football games.
146

One of the dean’s first actions was to establish a statewide coalition among all the statesupported universities to create a joint depository for all the universities to share print resources
and save on the costs of purchasing and maintenance of duplicate items.
So I came in May, [and] in June I proposed it to my colleagues in the state university
system. In August, we sent the proposal to the Board of Governors. In October, the
Board of Governors approved it, and they were actually thrilled. They had been looking
for initiatives that benefited more than one institution. They really did see this as being a
very cost-effective way to manage low-use print collections without losing the richness of
the research collections.
She established a pattern of meeting with the university’s student government, faculty
senate, and the university’s fundraising leadership. She also held town hall meetings with
faculty across the university. She described her communication efforts in this comment:
I think if you don't have this expectation that you have to have total unanimity, and you
do have an expectation that people are informed, and they have a chance to express their
opinions, and justify their opinions, then I think you can move them through the process.
I think the provost would tell you this. I know the deans would tell you this. I’m not
building my empire. I am acquiring materials to serve their faculty, their students, their
researchers; in the case of the health science center, their clinicians. And they know that.
I mean they recognize that when I’m asking for more money I’m not empire building.
That it’s a real need.
The university recently included the library as one of the central themes in the
university’s upcoming capital campaign.
Research Question 3
How have the libraries’ missions changed during the past five years (2010-2015), and
what factors or environmental forces may have been influential catalysts?
Bolman and Deal (2013) indicated that organizational missions and strategic plans fall
into the Symbolic Frame, so it is natural that the majority of the evidence for research question
three, concerning the mission of the library, fell into that frame, as illustrated in Figure 4.17.

Figure 4.17. Library B: RQ3

Symbolic Frame
This library did not enact a formal mission statement and strategic plan until 2014, as the
dean explained:
We do [now] have a document up on our website called Strategic Directions that we just
completed last year. I think the problem was we immediately went into this recession,
and it’s very hard to be doing a lot of strategic planning when you’re just trying to keep
your head above water. So there were certain things we identified, and we sort of chipped
away at some of these issues in an opportunistic way. And we’ve sort of known where we
wanted to go but we hadn’t really put it into so much of a planning document at that
point, because when you’re having all of these meetings with people about budget cuts
it’s kind of hard to be saying, “And what’s your strategic plan?” but we did.
And it very closely parallels the university mission statement, as it needs to.

Nevertheless, the dean stated she purposefully, if informally, enacted a process to bring her
library into close alignment with the university mission:
148

And I think that's been a real part of my personal philosophy, always. You have to make
this collection relevant and meaningful.

Research Question 4
How have the responsibilities and duties of the library dean changed during the past five

Figure 4.18. Library B: RQ4

Political Frame
The dean related one change in her role came from the result of the title change to “dean”
when she was hired, which enabled her to participate in arenas where she was able to build key
alliances, relationships, and formal and informal partnerships to communicate the library’s goals
and strategies, acquire needed resources, assess the university’s expectations and needs of the
library, and further embed the importance of the library into the university community.
149

I think that’s part of my being in the academic dean's meeting, being a little ahead of the
curve, so we can anticipate it, and begin to respond here in the way we shift the
collection, and shift the staffing, and that kind of thing. So I would say that’s not a
leading, but not following either. It’s kind of trying to be sure we’re lockstep, and
moving together.
One of the most extensive changes for the role of the dean in Library B was an intense
focus on the budget and the acquisition of new funding sources. While budget management
would be expected to appear in the structural frame, for Library B, it had its greatest impact in
the political frame. The impact of the Great Recession and its aftermath left Library B with a
relatively flat budget for the past five years, while costs for acquiring electronic resources
continued to rise, and planned renovations needed to be financed.
The telling statement is that our materials budgets is below the level that it was in 200809 in actual dollars. I mean that’s not talking about adjusted for inflation. That’s hard
dollars, without considering the fact that during that same time period we’ve lost $3.4
million in purchasing power due to price increases. So as a result we’re currently
delivering less content to students, faculty, researchers, [and] clinicians than we provided
six years ago. It’s not something I like to brag about but it’s a really important thing for
the deans and the VPs and the provost and the president to know.
The dean also engaged in a strategic campaign of assessment of the library’s needs and
communication of those needs to university and state government leaders.
I’ve been very careful not to cry fire in a crowded theater and we’ve cut from the bottom,
the least used resource. It’s not the fault of our faculty and students that we’re having this
recession and that we’re getting these budget cuts from Tallahassee. We’re not penalizing
them. It isn’t going to help to make a scene. But I’ve been saying year over year we’re
getting to the cliff, we’re getting to cliff and last year we finally said okay now we’re at
the cliff.
Research Question 5
How have the ways in which the library assesses and communicates its value to its
constituencies changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?

Figure 4.19. Library B: RQ5

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the main website for the university included the library among
virtual tours for prospective students. The library virtual tour is listed in the top row of choices
for students and shares how students “experience” the library, formally, as well as through
informal and cultural functions. The library developed a document titled Strategic Directions
(2014) which formally states the library’s mission and strategic goals to more closely align with
its parent university’s mission and goals. The library also communicated its value through nontraditional ways, including the progressive renovations and repurposing of physical facilities, as
well as the institution of new rituals and traditions involving the university community, such as a
celebration marking the digitization of the 10 millionth document in the collection. The dean
151

also installed a system of signage, identifying the library’s main areas and special or significant
collections, to increase the visibility of the library’s collections to its stakeholders. Gate count—
the total number of students through the doors—also continues to be important, as this comment
from the dean illustrates:
The year before they closed [the library] the average foot traffic in and out of the building
was about 445,000 a year, and [after the renovations] it went up almost immediately to
1.4 million.

Research Question 6

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the library established events, rituals, traditions, and other
activities, as described above, to create a perception of the library as a destination place for
students, faculty, alumni, university leadership, and the community at large. The library also
actively listened to student requests, and enacted student-led initiatives, as these comments from
the dean indicate:
So really a lot of focus [was] on what do the students need? So we're kind of constantly
looking at that, of what are the students’ wants and needs? And they want so many
different things. They want private study space, quiet space, social space.
People beg to come in there for special events, and for classes, and we had a chess
tournament in there.
So we bring many more classes into that building, since we've been refurbishing it. And
we have faculty who are now building into their classes exercises that cause them to
come and use primary source material.
I’ve heard so many students comment about the fact that they're motivated to study when
they're in the library, they feel safe in the library. I mean, we have spaces in the student
union and other places on campus. But most of them have roommates in the dorm, or in
an apartment. And so it’s hard, maybe, to study at home. But it isn’t even the distraction
of the roommate. It’s the, “I come there, and I have multiple resources.”
In the libraries, there’s enough life and vitality, you can go down to Starbucks and get a
cup of coffee, and come back up and concentrate. And there [are] a lot of choices of
spaces that, you know, right now I've got to finish this paper, and I need to go find a dark
corner, where my friends aren’t going to see me. But other times I really want to be
sitting in a small group, or I want to be in a group study room. So we’re offering them a
lot of what they need.
The library also created a new mission statement and strategic plan matched to the
mission and goals of its parent university titled Strategic Directions (UF George A. Smathers
Libraries, 2014):
153

The … Libraries partner with [University] faculty, students and staff, as well as the
University’s collaborators and constituents, to facilitate knowledge creation that
contributes to [the university’s] standing as a preeminent public research university. (p. 2)
Political Frame
In the political frame, the library partnered with other university departments on various
initiatives. For example, the dean recently met with the head of the university’s capital
campaign regarding the selection of the library as a theme for the campaign, as she described:
We’re about to start a big capital campaign and that library collections and services
should be a central element of the campaign. And I met yesterday with the head of the
foundation and they are planning to have several central themes this year and he is very
open to the idea that the library would be one of those because it is cross cutting to every
faculty member, every student. And so we’re honing a pitch to have available by the end
of June, a case for what would be the capital campaign goals for the library.
The dean was also actively involved with student government.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the dean strategically hired librarians with subject area
expertise to help meet faculty needs, as she explained:
This is a STEM university. We have to have a chemistry librarian. We’ve hired another—
and both are Ph.D. chemists. That was a more critical credential for us than a library
degree, because they're talking to graduate chemists, and helping them with their
research. And they need to talk their language, and they need to understand their type of
research. It’s a lot easier to teach them the library-specific schools than it is to take a
librarian, and—I know it's old dog, new tricks—but you would be hard-pressed to get me
up to speed to be a graduate chemistry librarian. I may be smart, but I don’t speak their
language.
Research Question 7
When changes occurred, were they library-led or university directed? If they were
library-led, in what ways did the library persuade its parent institution (and/or other
constituencies) to accept the change(s)?

Figure 4.21. Library B: RQ7

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the university’s emphasis on preeminence and the university’s
initial renovations to the library were both foundation and catalyst for future library-led changes.
The library continued the brisk pace of renovations begun by the university, as indicated by
multiple news reports, as well as in this comment from the dean:
If you look at the priorities on each of our campuses, so better managing our collections
and reusing the space we have to be more effective for students has been a really
important part of what we’ve been doing.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the library aligned collection development to faculty needs, as this
comment from the dean indicates:
155

There are some ways in which the library has to be reactive, rather than leading. So for
instance, we identified some time ago, in consultation with the College of Liberal Arts
and Sciences, that eventually they were going to have a Center for Arabic, Muslim,
Middle Eastern Studies. We're not going to start building a collection and doing that
ahead of them. But as they begin to add faculty and staff for it, we need to be in sync
with them, and moving with them, and we certainly need to anticipate that. And the
whole premise of that was that we should each select what we've called centers of
excellence – sub-collections within our documents collections that were highly relevant
to something that's happening at the university, and in the campus.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the dean led an initiative to more closely tie the fate of the library
with the university, as she related:
I have proposed that we have a strategic goal to get the library-- to commit to indexing
the library budget to the growth in tuition and appropriated funds and to the growth in
research. And to set a reasonable expectation of what the library budget should be and get
to it within three to five years. So we’ve done peer analysis and based on comparisons
with our peers, we should be in a budget of 42.6 million. At the 2012 level for our peers,
so you know it’s higher than that by now but the IPEDS data only goes up to 2012. And
our ’13-’14 funding, already a year past that, was at $30 million. So this was my pitch
that our funding should be indexed to the university funding at least based on tuition
appropriation and research.
Research Question 8
In what ways has the evolution of the virtual library impacted and influenced changes in
the library?
The majority of the evidence for research question 8 fell into the structural frame, as
shown in Figure 4.22.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the global transition to electronic resources during the past five
years created an opportunity for the dean to move the library’s legacy print collections into
compact shelving and offsite storage and devote collection-building resources to electronic items
156

and services. For example, the library established the first digital learning commons in the state,
and recently celebrated the 10 millionth page in their digitized collection.

The library also added hundreds of computers, implemented a technology rental program,
brought in leading-edge technologies (such as 3-D printers) to the library, and opened their
virtual doors to distance learners—a strategic direction of its parent university. The advent of the
virtual library impacted the budget, as the costs for e-resources consistently climbed, while
library funding for expenditures fell or remained relatively flat. The organizational structure of
the library also changed to streamline the reporting roles of technological services under one
assistant dean.

Figure 4.23. Library B: RQ9

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the biggest change in the library’s role involved the change in the
perception of the library as place. This comment from the dean summarizes the change in
perception:
People use the collection, but the reading room was anything but inviting. Now, they're
begging to like, can we have events there? Can we bring speakers in there? You know,
there's many more people there using it. Because instead of grabbing my stuff and going,
it's a wonderful space to stay. But it's really tracking to that academic mission of we have
this collection, we want people to know we have it, we want people to use it.
The library has more than doubled the number of its annual visitors since the renovations were
completed.

158

The library also became a cultural hub, as the dean invented and implemented a variety of
new traditions, rituals, and events to bring diverse constituencies into the library, as described in
the sections above.

Summary and Themes
While the themes for this study were a priori the four frames identified by Bolman and
Deal (2008), nevertheless, six themes emerged in the data analysis which deserve mention. The
dominant theme, with more than 45 related references, involved a focus on student needs. This
was expressed directly in the dean’s comments and the corroboratory documents and
audio/visual materials. A second theme of strategic effort emerged, evinced primarily through
the actions and leadership of the dean, indicated by the dean’s use of the words “we have to” and
“try,” as well as indications of proactive planning.
The dean of Library B also successfully engaged in leading change, primarily through
communication with library stakeholders and patrons. Finally, the dean emphasized the need for
the library to maintain and demonstrate its relevance to the university, as this comment from the
dean illustrates:
But I think it’s part of this story too. I do believe that they absolutely understand that the
services we provide, and the collections that we're building, are not for ourselves. They
are for them, and they are for their faculty, their students, their colleges.
In summary, Library B engaged in reframing across all four frames, as shown in Figure 4.24,
with the majority of the evidence in the symbolic frame.

Figure 4.24. Library B: Summary of Results

Library C
Context: Library C
Library C is situated in a state university located in the state capitol. The university is
one of the oldest in the state, with its beginnings stretching back to the mid-1800s (Florida State
University (FSU) Office of Institutional Research, 2015). It was formally established in 1851
(FSU Office of Institutional Research, 2015). The university enrolls more than 41,000 students,
and its 16 colleges offer more than 275 degrees (FSU, 2014a). The university is currently ranked
43rd among national public universities, and 96th nationwide, by U.S. News & World Report
(Elish, 2015). The main campus spans 475 acres with 220 buildings (U.S. News & World
Report, 2015; FSU Office of Institutional Research, 2015). The university employs 6,158
individuals, and has an economic impact of $3.4 billion (FSU Office of Institutional Research,
2015).
160

Library C consists of 13 libraries, and its total collection includes 2,442, 000 volumes,
nearly 394,000 e-books, 95,299 electronic journals, and 1,047 databases (FSU Office of
Institutional Research, 2015). The director of Library C holds the position of academic dean and
reports directly to the provost. The main library is housed in a six-story building located on one
side of a large green near the east side of the campus, featuring a broad expanse of lawn, trees,
seating areas, picnic areas with tables and chairs, formal landscaping, a central fountain, and
pedestrian walkways. The back of the library faces a parking lot, one side of the library faces an
interior university artery and a parking lot, while the fourth side is adjacent to other university
buildings. The exterior façade is composed of red brick with white stone trim. A set of broad
stone steps and a ramp lead up to the building, where the name of the library is emblazoned in
silver letters atop black granite above the main glass entry doors.
The library is named for a university president who passed away shortly after the building
was constructed in the late 1950s (FSU Office of the President, n.d.). The front of the building
features a wall of windows stretching nearly across its entirety. The main entrance opens into a
large hall, with the security checkpoint and main entrance to the library on the left, and a large
Starbucks café on the right. This excerpt from the library’s brochure provides additional
descriptive information about the library (FSU Libraries, n.d.):
University Libraries are the information hub of [the] University. Our locations in
Tallahassee and beyond offer dynamic learning spaces, research materials, and
technological resources to support all student and faculty academic goals. The Libraries
provide fast, friendly service in a safe environment and ensure worldwide access to a
substantial collection of research materials. (p. 2)

Context: Interview with the dean of Library C.
I conducted my interview with the Dean of Library C on Friday, May 14, 2015, from
3:00 to 4:00 PM. We agreed to meet in her office on the fifth floor of the main library building.
The dean and her assistant voluntarily provided me with free VIP parking in the library’s
designated visitor space. This library is located more than four hours from my home, so I arrived
a few hours prior to the interview to engage in my observation data collection. Here is a brief
excerpt from my researcher’s journal describing a portion of the meeting:
The drive up actually took me longer than expected, but I had run into a lot of
construction traffic along I75 which really slowed me down. I almost ran out of gas
getting there, but luckily found a gas station in time once I entered the main university
town. I arrived around Noon, however, so I had time to park, stretch my legs, and eat my
lunch. I’m really glad I brought it with me! I was able to sit at a picnic table in the park
area directly in front of the library. This was a beautifully landscaped area, with lots of
green lawn space, magnificent old oak trees, and a lovely fountain in the center of the
park. Various traditional gothic brick buildings surrounded the park, but I couldn’t tell
from my vantage point what the buildings housed. I checked my campus map, and the
park was called “Landis Green” and it looked like the physical center of the campus, with
the library at its head. As I sat there eating lunch, I noticed many people in the park.
Some were just walking across it, another group was playing catch with a medium-sized
yellow dog near the fountain, there were students sitting at all the picnic tables nearby,
and dozens of students walking in and out of the main library doors during the hour or so
that I sat there. A truck (sort of like a food truck) with an awning was parked along one
side of the green, near the library, selling school supplies and university tchotchkes. I
noticed clouds building up, and thought it looked like rain, so I took out my camera and
started doing the outdoor area portions of my observation protocol, out of my usual order
of proceeding, because I thought that if it rained, I might not be able to take the outdoor
photos later. This turned out to be the case, so I’m glad I was flexible with my plan so
that I didn’t miss this opportunity to observe the library’s exterior spaces. It started to
rain by about 1:00 PM, so I went inside the library building. I still had two hours before
my appointment with the dean. So, again, I broke my usual protocol and began my
library observation before the interview, instead of after the interview.
When I entered the library’s main doors, there was a Starbucks café off to the right, and a
security check-in desk on the left. In order to enter the library itself, the library requires a
student/faculty/staff key card. Visitors are able to enter only if they give their driver’s
162

license to the security check-in desk attendants, sign in, and then receive a temporary
visitor’s key card. The driver’s license is returned when the visitor’s key card is returned
to the security desk. I gave them my license, signed in, and was given a key card, which
I used to enter the turnstiles around the corner on the left. This high level of security
makes sense in light of the tragic shooting which occurred here in the library this past
November (2014). I later learned that this security process was already in place at that
time, and this security process is generally considered to be the main element that
prevented more people from being hurt, because the shooter could not gain entry to the
main library, only the entrance lobby (personal comment from the dean, May 14, 2015).
I spent the next hour and a half wandering the library, as any visitor might, making my
observations and taking my photos. I was challenged several times during this process,
but in a friendly and polite way. The students working behind the circulation desk asked
me what I was doing and why, and I explained my project and that I was visiting the
dean. About half an hour later, in a different area, a woman who I assumed was a library
faculty/staff member asked me the same question – firmly, but politely. Shortly
afterwards, in another area of the library, a group of students asked me. These were the
only times anyone approached me, in any of the libraries I observed. It makes sense that
students, faculty, and staff in this library are more aware of their surroundings and paying
attention to people who don’t seem to belong.
Finally, it was time to head up to the library dean’s office for the interview. I arrived
about 15 minutes early, in order to have time to sit down, prepare my recorder and my
notepad, and rest from walking around for the past two hours.
The staff in the dean’ office greeted me cordially and politely, but the office was very
quiet. There wasn’t any chit-chat among the staff. Everyone seemed focused on their
own work. The dean’s office door was closed. She came out of her office at exactly 3:00
PM, and walked toward me, and invited me into her office. She indicated I take a seat in
the conversation area on the side of her desk. This consisted of two small sofas with a
small coffee table in between. I sat on one sofa, and she sat on the other one, facing me.
She was extremely polite, but she sat very stiffly and formally, and we did not engage in
much pre-interview conversation, beyond my thanking her and expressing my
appreciation for her time in meeting with me. When she sat down, she was silent and
waited for me to begin. This formality threw me a little, at first. As I looked around her
office, I noticed the décor was very dignified and formal, with contemporary art on the
walls. I immediately revised my approach to meet her where I sensed her personality
would be most comfortable and responsive, and to be more formal in my approach as
well. I re-introduced myself and explained my project, and told her right in the beginning
that a transcript of everything we would talk about today would be sent to her for her
review, as well as the draft of her section of the final report. Then I began my questions,
163

and I started with the question about her background. Once she started to talk about her
past and her experiences, she seemed to relax, and she started smiling as she related some
anecdotes, even laughing occasionally.
Findings: Library C
Two interviews with the dean of Library C resulted in a total of 184 significant
comments, and 141 coded comments. Additionally, 42 institutional documents, 22 news articles,
4 audio/visual media, 76 photos, ad 32 observations, were collected. My researcher’s journal
and analysis of historic and contemporary web pages from the library provided further sources of
evidence. The total data collected for Library A are shown in Table 14. The relative
contribution of each data source to the findings for Library B is displayed in Figure 4.25.

Research Question 1
As defined by each of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) four frames—structural frame, political
frame, symbolic frame, and human resource frame—in what ways have the academic
libraries of these four universities exhibited evidence of reframing during the past five
years: 2010-2015?
Library C exhibited evidence of reframing across all four frames during the past five
years, as indicated in Figure 4.26, with the majority of the evidence falling in the Human
Resource Frame.

Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, when the dean at Library C in 2007, she found an
organization where the human resource frame was not functioning at an optimal level, as she
related in this comment:
I had followed Florida State’s library through the years. The library community is a small
community and I knew that it was not a happy institution. It may sound egotistical, but
my perception was that the leadership of the libraries had not been what it needed to be.
The library had a reputation of not being a good place to work.
The environment had become so tension-filled, in fact, that the library’s strategic plan
specifically mentioned the need to resolve an atmosphere of “internal conflict, lack of trust, and
territorialism” (Chaffin & Colvin, 2008, para. 28).

Figure 4.26

Library C: RQ1

The dean had an extensive background in managing the human resource frame, and she set out to
break the existing frame and reframe the human resource aspect of the organization, as she
indicated in these comments:
One of the things that I’ve thought about and researched during my career is how to
create a productive work environment where people give a hundred percent, but at the
same time enjoy themselves, like coming to work, feel good about their
accomplishments.
How do you find the balance? You can have a sweatshop, you can have slave drivers, and
staff who are miserable. Or you can have a place where people run wild and have a great
time. But how do you create a disciplined, productive workplace with happy workers?
That’s always been a question of mine. So, when I got the search firm’s call about (this
university), I thought, “This job is perfect for me.”
I felt like I could come back here and make a difference. It was a situation where people
were dying for something different.

166

The dean strategically realigned employees to positions where their skills and temperaments
matched tasks and role. She also empowered employees through recognition, supporting
professional development, by involving them in decision-making processes, and growing a sense
of shared ownership of the organization. The following comments from the dean are brief
examples of the many changes she implemented:
I don’t think the staff felt like they had been treated very well in the past. Arbitrary
decisions were made about people and their jobs. People would be in this job one day
and then they’d be told the next day, “You’re going over there,” or “We’re demoting
you.” My approach, which I’d honed in [my previous directorship] is that people want to
be acknowledged and appreciated, and that’s huge. So I set about to create a sense of
stability. I met with every single library employee in my first six months. I made it a
point to know their names, to know something about the work they do, and I’ve tried to
keep that up.
When I looked at the salaries of our classified employees I was appalled. About a quarter
of our classified employees were actually below the poverty level. It’s a problem all over
campus and we weren’t that much worse than other units, but I took a hundred thousand
dollars, worked with HR and the union, and gave almost all classified staff members a
thousand dollar bump in their salary. I think it went a long way towards making people
feel that it was a new day. We started changing the staffing model so that we had people
in place who knew their stuff. There were a number of staff who had been hired and
retained who didn’t need to be here. I’ve done some amount of moving people on. I
probably let about fifteen people go over the past few years, which is a part of the job that
I don’t like, but when somebody just couldn’t do the job for whatever reason, we had to
make the hard decision. Not only did it give us the opportunity to use the resources to fill
a position with a productive employee, but it also sent a message to the staff who are
working hard and giving it the effort it needs. It’s important to do that. In terms of
librarians being involved professionally, I put money into professional development
opportunities, so that staff feel empowered to become involved in the library profession
and increasingly in other areas.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the position of library director was elevated to Dean of Libraries
during the timeframe of this study, due to purposeful lobbying efforts by the dean. The dean

167

indicated this change enabled her to have access to and participation with the university’s top
leadership groups among the faculty and administration:
When I was hired, the name of the position was Director of Libraries. I talked to my boss
about it, and I did a little study that looked at all of the ARL library leaders’ titles. We
looked at titles within the state of Florida. He was convinced by that to change the title to
dean. I had been sitting on the Council of Deans prior to that, but having the title of dean
is better than not having it, both in terms of the way other deans view you but also in
fundraising and activities like that.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the university and the library had changed their mission/vision
statements and strategic plan goals two years prior to the timeframe of this study, shortly after
the arrival of the current dean. The library’s mission/vision and strategic plan goals closely
mirrored the university’s. Another major change in the symbolic frame involved the physical
transformation of the library’s facilities. The first two floors were renovated to become a
Scholar Commons with a Starbucks cafe, student study spaces, technology centers, and other
amenities. More about these renovations is discussed in the next section.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, Library C received a budget cut of more than $300,000 as a result
of the impact of the Great Recession, and the library’s budget remained at relatively the same
level for the proceeding years throughout the timeframe of this study. The dean indicated this
impact resulted in the library having to make choices regarding their collection development, as
the library began to collect more electronic resources over print:
It’s been flat. We have a deficit right now and we’re making noise about needing
additional resources so that we can continue to provide collections at the level that our
faculty have come to expect. We’re getting a lot more involved in the digital scholarship
realm, the scholarly communication piece.

168

We’ve been pulling financial resources out of areas where we didn’t feel like we were
getting the mileage that we needed, and putting funds into things like the scholarly
communication, Islandora development, and into special collections in general.
There just aren’t [going to] be big-budget increases coming to anybody. And so if you’re
[going to] do new things, you have to figure out what old things you’re not [going to] do
anymore. If you evaluate the use of collections, you’ll see that five years from now, 80
percent of the books that you buy today will hardly have been touched -- that’s not a
good stewardship of our resources. So we’re moving much more into DDA [demand
driven acquisitions] – they’re calling it evidence-based collection building now—where
we just get electronic files of bibliographic information to load into our catalog. If people
want a specific book they click [on the record] and they have the e-book on their desktop
immediately. And we’re not buying things that people don’t use, that people don’t want.
Research Question 2
During the past five years, 2010-2015, what was the nature of the relationship between
the libraries and their parent universities and how has this relationship evolved during
this period?
Research Question 3
How have the libraries’ missions changed during the past five years (2010-2015), and
what factors or environmental forces may have been influential catalysts?
For Library C, the results of RQ2 and RQ3 are closely interwoven, so the results of both
questions will be presented jointly, in preference of repeating the same information. Library C
exhibited evidence of reframing across all four frames during the past five years for research
question two, and for every frame except the human resource frame for research question three,
with the majority of the evidence falling in the symbolic frame for both questions, as shown in
Figure 4.27.
Symbolic Frame
In 2008, two years prior to the timeframe of this study, Library C published a new
strategic plan and mission/vision document linking it directly to the strategic goals and direction
of its parent university (Chaffin & Colvin, 2008). This excerpt from the Library’s strategic plan
illustrates the library’s connections to its parent university:

Figure 4.27. Library C: RQ2 and RQ3

Through these goals, the University Libraries are committed to supporting excellence in
teaching and scholarship in innovative ways that anticipate users’ needs and are aligned
with the mission and goals of . . . [this] University.
(Structural Frame)
170

• Foster User-Centered Culture. To be most effective, library collections, services,
spaces, and communication must be responsive to user needs and
preferences. Continuing programs of user studies and assessment are needed to create
and maintain a user-centered focus.
(Political Frame)
• Develop Partnerships and Connections. To maximize access to material and fiscal
resources, efficiencies in operations, and sharing of ideas and information, the Libraries
need to cultivate both internal and external partnerships.
(Symbolic Frame)
• Create Integrated Learning Environments. To create a seamless process of discovery
and use of information resources and services, a variety of virtual and physical
applications should be employed.
(Human Resource Frame)
• Cultivate Employee Excellence
(FSU Libraries Strategic Plan, 2008, para. 1-5)
The university, in turn, published its own new strategic plan—10 years in the making—
and specifically included the importance of the library among its strategic priorities, to “foster
academic excellence” (FSU Board of Trustees, 2009). The university’s strategic plan included
the number of library holdings as one of its metrics to assess fulfillment of the goals. The
university’s strategic plan also identified funding for both the library and research spaces among
its “critical success factors” (FSU Board of Trustees, 2009, p. 30). Both those plans remained in
effect throughout the timeframe of this study. Both plans were published shortly after the onset
of the Great Recession, and included notes referencing the fact that the uncertainty created by the
new economic environment might affect the timetable for the fulfillment of the plan.
In 2014, the state Board of Governors published an update to their strategic plan, and
identified Library C as one of the state’s two “preeminent universities” (State University System
Board of Governors, 2014, p. 6). The plan also designated additional financial support to these
171

two universities, with the goal of increasing their national rankings (State University System
Board of Governors, 2014, p. 6). One of the university’s current mottos—“a great university
requires a great library”—is displayed on large banners hanging on the front façade of the library
building.
The dean indicated the existing library building, constructed during the mid-1950s, was
showing its age by the time she arrived in 2007. One of the dean’s priorities, as indicated in the
strategic plans above, involved renovations to the physical facilities of the library, both to
incorporate new technologies and create student-centered spaces.
By 2010, the beginning of the timeframe of this study, the dean had already completed
the transformation of the main floor of the library, with the renovations expressly linked to
improving student success. The first floor renovations included a Starbucks café, collaborative
classrooms, transitional student study spaces, technology centers, and smart board work areas.
The traditional, large rectangular reference desk area was re-envisioned as a smaller series of
flexible spaces designed to be more approachable by students, and the main library’s operating
hours extended to 24/5 during the academic year (FSU 24/7 News, 2010).
The library also installed security turnstiles, allowing admittance to the library only to
students or faculty with valid ID cards. In my interview with the dean, she said these turnstiles
later became a barrier which contributed to saving lives when a killer went on a shooting spree in
2014 in the library’s lobby, but was blocked from entering the main library by the security
turnstiles (personal communication, May 14, 2015).
The renovated spaces also became draws for the university community to hold events,
classes, and other activities, indicated by comments from the dean as well as in news articles.

172

Political Frame
In the political frame, the university installed a new president in 2010, a few months prior
to the beginning of the timeframe of this study. This individual served for four years, then an
interim president took over while the search for a new president was undertaken. A new
president was hired on November 6, 2014. The individual holding the position of Provost (the
position to which the dean of libraries reports) also transitioned to a new role and a new
individual became Provost.
In this environment, the library engaged in various methods to demonstrate ROI. For
example, the library’s strategic plan specifically charged the library with the goal of improving
the communication of the library’s value to internal and external stakeholders. The library’s
Web site was updated to invite user comments. The library published its own booklet describing
library services and collections (in that order), focused on student success. The amount of the
library’s total collection was featured on university and library fact sheets and recruiting
booklets. The dean also engaged in formal assessment of the library to provide statistical reports
to university administration to demonstrate ROI.
We set up an assessment department to help us understand how faculty and students use
the library and need to use the library. They gather a lot of statistics that show that
student library use has skyrocketed. We point to a lot of the innovative programs that we
have here in the library. …
We’re doing a couple of studies with faculty from key departments to show causality [of
library use to student/faculty success]. We’ve got one study underway with a faculty
member who works closely with one of our librarians to teach a basic criminology course
that is heavily library-oriented. They’ve identified a control group of students, in the
same major with essentially the same SAT scores and same GPA coming into college,
same background, who don’t take the library-intensive course, and then they’re
comparing their academic success with the students who do take this course. They will
track them through four years of college to see if the library-intensive instruction makes a
difference in success throughout the four years.
173

Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the library transitioned its programs and services toward meeting
student and faculty needs, as the dean indicated in this comment:
Well, what are we here to do? What is more important than making the students and
faculty successful? That’s our bottom line, right?
We do all kinds of things to create a cohesive academic support environment here within
the library.
Human Resource Frame
Many of the changes in the human resource frame were discussed in the results from
RQ1, above. However, the dean additionally encouraged her staff to have a “voice” in the
library governance, as she indicated:
The important thing about this was to give the staff a voice and let them say, “This is
what’s important to us and this is how we can create a strong and vibrant organization.”
Research Question 4
How have the responsibilities and duties of the library dean changed during the past five
years (2010-2015)?
The majority of the evidence for research question four fell into the human resource
frame, as shown in Figure 4. 28.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the dean’s own background came strongly into play, as she
is both an alumnus and an employee of her library, and her career—as described above—has
been focused on improving the human resource frame in library organizations. In our interview,
I perceived a sincere aspect of humility in the dean’s leadership style, especially when I asked
her how her role as dean had changed over the past few years, as indicated by her reply:

174

I guess I have a little bit of trouble with that question because I don’t know how much of
it is me evolving as a leader and finding my own style....versus what you can generalize
to library directors and deans across the board.

Figure 4.29. Library C: RQ 5

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the library’s major effort to communicate value involved the
extensive renovations to the library’s physical facilities, as indicated in this comment from the
dean:
The outcome has been that student attendance in the library increased. It doubled, I think,
when we finally opened the space and it’s continued to climb every year.
It has taken some effort, but we’re able to determine from the data we collect that 93% of
students will come to this library at least once during any given semester.
We have eight libraries on campus, but what’s going on here is pulling them in. Because
we have the two-sided Starbucks, they can get coffee without going through the
turnstiles. Therefore the numbers we’re counting are students coming in to do some
something that requires them to be in the library, not just getting coffee. We’re proud of
that.
The renovations also established the library as a cultural hub for events and social activities,
presented by the library as well as other areas of the university, as indicated in this comment
from the dean:
176

One of the things that’s evolved in the Scholars Commons is that we have made it a
haven for interdisciplinary events. We started a lecture series, a symposium series, where
we would have a central theme. They were interdisciplinary and different. One of [them]
was “Genius”. Another was “Coffee,” and yet another was “The nature of evil.” Faculty
from a wide range of disciplines spoke, showing very different angles on these topics.
We do a social for graduate students twice a year. We invite all graduate students to come
in and have wine, beer, cokes, hors d’ oeuvres. And you’ll see graduate students from
vastly different disciplines coming in, hanging out together, getting to know each other. It
creates a nice synergy. And it says that the library’s a place where you can come and
hang out.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the library communicated its value through providing services and
programs strategically designed to meet faculty and student needs, as indicated in these
comments from the dean:
We need to integrate our librarians and our staff more with the STEM faculty, those who
are doing sponsored research in particular, and show our value there. Become part of
those projects and part of the proposal development and so forth. I think it’s so important
right now.
And with the staff who were working with faculty, who were reaching out to faculty, we
developed the concept of the Scholars Commons and then an evolving suite of services
that we thought would make a difference.
Services and programs were also designed to tie into the university’s mission, as illustrated in
this example provided by the dean:
One of the things that we’re working on is creating a new model for information literacy
that fits this university at this time, so that we can make a difference in how students
think critically and use information in an intelligent way.

The library also engaged in formal studies to indicate the library’s value to the university, as the
dean explained:
We’re doing a couple of studies with faculty from key departments to show causality [of
library use to student/faculty success]. We’ve got one study underway with a faculty
177

member who works closely with one of our librarians to teach a basic criminology course
that is heavily library-oriented. They’ve identified a control group of students, in the
same major with essentially the same SAT scores and same GPA coming into college,
same background, who don’t take the library-intensive course, and then they’re
comparing their academic success with the students who do take this course. They will
track them through four years of college to see if the library-intensive instruction makes a
difference in success throughout the four years.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the dean worked with student government and the faculty senate, to
communicate value through action, as indicated by these remarks from the dean:
Before, librarians played a passive role in relation to faculty or graduate students. We
expected our users to come to the library and ask for something, and we’d deliver. Now
we’re meeting them on their own turf and saying, “We can help you do research in new
ways that you never did before. We can help you with your grant proposal. We can help
you wade through these requirements for data management plans. We work with you in
ways you didn’t even know that you needed.” We’re doing a lot more proactively.

Research Question 6
In what ways have the library’s interactions with students, faculty, and the community
changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
The results for research question six indicate the involvement of all four frames, with the
majority of the evidence falling into the symbolic frame, as shown in Figure 4.30.
All Four Frames
When the dean arrived at Library C in 2007, the library did not enjoy a quality
relationship with either students or faculty.
One of the problems was a lack of emphasis on serving the students and faculty. The
faculty, in particular, had a very poor impression of the library, which was an issue that I
had been warned about and knew that I was going to have to address sooner rather than
later. Students take what they get, but I knew work had to be done to align the library
with student success, with student needs.

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the dean addressed many issues, most of which involved
transforming the perception of the library from that of a passive utilitarian resource to an active
partner in the mission of the university. The renovations to the library’s physical facilities,
discussed above, were part of this process, as these comments from the dean illustrated:
The provost was very clear that he wanted to see a turnaround in these areas, making the
faculty love the library again and doing good things for students. He himself had a long
history of creating a safety net for students so that they could be successful, that they
could graduate in a timely fashion, that they would stay past the freshman year, and he
wanted us to be a partner in that effort.
Additionally, the library engaged with strategic university initiatives, such as the QEP (quality
enhancement plan). For Library C, their university’s QEP during the timeframe of this study
was critical thinking. The library engineered their role in that topic by focusing efforts on
information literacy as the foundation for critical thinking, as the dean shared in these remarks:
179

The other thing that I’m kind [of] pushing on is information literacy. Our university’s
QEP for SACs accreditation is critical thinking, and what is information literacy if not
critical thinking? One of the things that we’re working on is creating a new model for
information literacy that fits this university at this time, so that we can make a difference
in how students think critically and use information in an intelligent way.
At the suggestion of the new president, a “Love Your Library Day” celebration was implemented
just a few months following the president’s installation (Block, 2015).
Political Frame
In the political frame, the dean set out to change the faculty’s negative perception of the
library by implementing new initiatives directed toward faculty, such as expanding the liaison
librarian program, and offering $300 worth of library materials of the individual’s choice to
newly tenured faculty members, as the dean recalled:
I needed some early wins with the faculty. Everybody was on board with it and so that
was the initial thing that we did.
The faculty’s relationship with the library had improved by 2013 to the extent that the faculty
senate chose the library as the focus of a fundraising campaign, as reported in the June 7, 2013
Minutes of the Board of Trustees:
The faculty strongly supports the goal of reaching the Top 25 in public universities. To
show support, the Faculty Senate Steering Committee is encouraging faculty giving
through the Library. The fundraising campaign titled “25 for 25,” invites faculty
members to place “25” in their donation to acknowledge the goal of reaching the Top 25.
Examples include $25, $2,500, $25,000 or $100.25.
The participation of the dean and her staff in key faculty leadership groups also helped change
faculty perceptions about the library, as the dean indicated:
I’ve been appointed to several key university committees. [Librarians are] very involved
on campus too. One of our librarians is now, for the second year, on the Faculty Senate
Steering Committee, and that’s big.
We have a budget deficit right now and we’re making a lot of noise about needing
additional resources so that we can continue to provide collections at the level that our
180

faculty have come to expect. We’re getting a lot of faculty buy-in to our plea for that,
because of [Staff Member __] being on the Faculty Senate Steering Committee, because
of the work that I do and several others do with the Faculty Senate Library Committee.
We’re getting a help from our colleagues on the faculty.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the library reversed its service structure from passive response to
faculty and student needs to a proactive approach for anticipating faculty and student needs, as
indicated in the dean’s comments:
Before, librarians played a passive role in relation to faculty or graduate students. We
expected our users to come to the library and ask for something, and we’d deliver. Now
we’re meeting them on their own turf and saying, “We can help you do research in new
ways that you never did before. We can help you with your grant proposal. We can help
you wade through these NSF requirements for data management plans. We work with
you in ways you didn’t even know that you needed.” We’re doing a lot more proactively.
We instituted a delivery service for faculty (and now graduate students) where we deliver
books on a twice-daily basis to all of the academic departments for faculty who requested
them. We also shoot journal articles via email to their desktops. In my rough estimate,
that service saves about 30,000 hours of faculty time a year.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the library strengthened its liaison librarian program.
These librarians became embedded in the arts and humanities during the timeframe of this study,
and the next initiative, already underway, will continue that process in STEM (science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, as these comments from the dean explained:
We need to integrate our librarians and our staff more with the STEM faculty, those who
are doing sponsored research in particular, and show our value there. Become part of
those projects and part of proposal development and so forth. I think it’s so important
right now.
…With STEM, it’s a different kettle of fish, but in the next five years, if we can look
down the road and say, “Yes, we are now considered to be an integral part of at least
some of that activity,” we will have been successful. I think that’s extremely important.
181

Research Question 7
When changes occurred, were they library-led or university directed? If they were
library-led, in what ways did the library persuade its parent institution (and/or other
constituencies) to accept the change(s)?
For research question seven, Library C exhibited evidence of reframing across all four
frames during the past five years, as indicated in Figure 4.31.

All Four Frames
In the case of Library C, the changes which occurred to the library during the timeframe
of this study were, for the most part, the result of action and interaction on the part of both the
library and the university. For example, as discussed above, the university and the library
created integrated mission/vision statements and corresponding strategic plans prior to the
timeframe of this study. The provost expressed the need for the library to change, as described
above, however, while the direction of progress was outlined, the dean utilized her own
182

creativity and initiative to implement appropriate programs and services, as indicated in these
recollections:
Did I have a mental map? I had some ideas, but I have to say that the woman who was
the Associate Dean for Public Services at that time, a brilliant and creative person who is
now running a library of her own—she had figured a lot of it out.
She said, “This is what we can do,” and I added my own mix of herbs and spices to the
soup, and together, with the librarians who worked with faculty, who were reaching out
to faculty, we came up with the idea for the Scholars Commons and then an evolving
suite of services that we thought would make a difference.
The dean also took some risks in enacting change, and encouraged her staff to do the
same, as she indicated:
It’s important in any organization, and in libraries in this day and age in particular, to
create a culture where people are willing to take risks and they know they can take a risk.
They can come up with a wild new scheme and, if it’s not too out of the ballpark, you can
put it in place. If it works, fabulous. If it doesn’t, you learn from it and you move on.
Research Question 8
In what ways has the evolution of the virtual library impacted and influenced changes in
the library?
The evidence for research question 8 revealed change in all four frames, while the
majority of the evidence fell into the structural frame, as shown in Figure 4.32.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, Library C experienced a relatively flat budget throughout the
timeframe of this study. While the library only experienced one year of budget cuts due to the
impact of the Great Recession, the overall library budget only gained $900,000 above its prerecessionary level. This affected the library’s ability to purchase resources, particularly eresources, and required a change in the approach to traditional acquisitions and an increase in eservice delivery, as this comment from the dean reflects:

Figure 4.32. Library C: RQ8

We’ve been pulling resources out of areas where we didn’t feel like we were getting the
mileage that we needed, and putting them into things like the scholarly communication
and Islandora. So, even though we haven’t had an increase in budget, we’ve been able to
shore up some of these areas by investing less in others. And that is a trend in libraries
everywhere.
(Islandora is a free, open source, software package designed to help libraries and other large
information organizations manage their digital resources.) The library also funneled resources
into establishing its own digital repository, as the dean explained:
We’re about to bring up our locally-developed institutional repository -- we’ve had an
institutional repository with BePress Digital Commons, if you’re familiar with that -- and
now we’re about to do our own that will not just be an institutional repository, but it will
also allow us to display our special collections and other digital assets. We were kind [of]
nowhere three years ago, and we’ve put a lot [of] resources into that project.
The library bolstered its online presence through a robust Web site, with added services to
support distance education. The Dean’s Welcome on the library’s Web site indicated:
184

Whether you’re on the main …campus, at one of [the library’s] other campuses, at an
international study center, or taking courses as a distant learner, the Libraries’ Web site
offers you comprehensive access to books and journals; extraordinary collections of rare
and unique materials; information about specialized services, useful technology tools;
and much more. Best of all, we provide around-the-clock access to the superior expertise
of our staff via chat, phone, e-mail or in person.
The library also became more involved in digital scholarship, scholarly communication, and
distance learning, as indicated in these comments from the dean:
Another thing that we’ve been working on with the increase in distance learning is hiring
a librarian, about a year ago, as an advocate for library users who are not on this campus,
whether they’re at our Panama City campus or our Florence campus or an isolated
distance learner in Belle Glade. We want them to have an equivalent library experience to
people who are able to walk into this building and take advantage of our services.
So, that’s another important initiative. [Of] course digital scholarship, scholarly
communication, digital humanities, data management—we’re doing more and more there
and I expect them to expand and grow in the next five years.
Research Question 9
How has the library’s role in the life of the university changed during the past five years
(2010-2015)?
The evidence for research question 9 revealed change across all four frames, while the
majority of the evidence fell into the symbolic frame, as shown in Figure 4.33.
All 4 Frames
When the dean took the helm of Library C, she found “problems had been in place for a
long time.” Her own background, experience, and personal philosophy provided her the
inspiration for enacting change, building on the provost’s directive and the university’s overall
change in direction as one of the preeminent universities in the state, as described above. The
dean indicated she was prepared and ready to lead change:
I knew I had a lot of work on my plate and I had the appetite for it.

The dean also indicated her efforts to enact change were strategic and designed to meet student,
faculty, and institutional needs, as she shared in these comments:
We felt like we knew what faculty wanted and needed, and we put in place programs and
spaces that would address those needs. With the students we’d had an epiphany <laughs>
... primarily by talking to colleagues in the field about doing ethnographic research of
students, doing a lot of assessment, not just surveys, but watching them as they go about
campus, talking to them about where they spend their time and the kinds of spaces that
work for them. We did things like, “Take everything out of your backpack and take a
picture of it and show us.” We did charrettes of what their ideal study space was like.
When we put it all together we had a very different picture of what, I don’t even want to
say a library, but a center for student success, a center for undergraduate student
academic services, of which library services were a part, but there were many other
pieces to it. Then we set about creating it.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame the evidence of the library’s change in its role in the university can
be measured by its increased use as a destination space, a cultural space, and a learning space, as
186

described in the sections above. The evidence also indicated the library’s strategic efforts to
connect to the university’s mission and strategic goals. For example, the September 24, 2010
minutes of the Board of Trustees showed “extensive tutoring is being offered for gateway
courses at [the] Library, . . . (referred to as “Club Stroz” on YouTube).” The dean also explained
that this direction toward increased alignment with the university will continue for the coming
years:
Our university is bound to the Preeminence and the Performance Funding metrics, for
now anyway, until the legislature changes its funding model. In some ways, it’s a
problem because library activities don’t map to those metrics very well. When I talk with
my staff about what we’ll be doing over the next few years, I point to the Preeminence
and the Performance metrics. What’s huge in them is STEM research and STEM
education.
When you think about the changes that we have confronted in libraries, due to
technology, primarily, but other factors as well, how can you not be changing all the
time? How can you not be dynamic and survive?

Summary and Themes
While the themes for this study were a priori the four frames identified by Bolman and
Deal (2014), nevertheless, six themes emerged in the data analysis which deserve mention. The
evidence revealed the majority of the changes to be the result of strategic effort, primarily
through the actions and leadership of the dean, indicated by the dean’s use of the words “work,”
“reaching out,” “creating,” and “talking,” as well as indications of proactive planning, such as
“willing to take risks.” The companion theme to this emerged as leadership, indicated by the
dean’s connection with the strength of her background in leading previous change initiatives at
other institutions, and her willingness to engage in the change process. Many of these examples
are included above, but a summative exemplar is the dean’s statement:

187

I had done a mini-turnaround in Ohio. I knew I had this work on my plate at [my current
university], and I certainly had the appetite for it. I felt like I could come back here and
make a difference.
This ties in to the next theme, expressed by the dean’s passion for her job/career. She is an
alumnus of the university, and actually had her first job working in this library as a student. Her
comments about her personal connection to the university include the words “love,” “wonderful
place,” and “great experience.” However, while she perceived her experience in that first library
as less than wonderful, she explained it added impetus for her passion to turn the library around,
as she related:
I had always liked books and reading, and I could type thirty-five words a minute, so I
got a job typing headings on catalog cards. I stayed for about three years, but it was a
terrible job, it was a sweatshop. A culture that was conservative and strict. It was not fun.
Then [many years later] I got a call from a headhunter that they were looking for a dean
at [this library], and it was compelling to me for any number of reasons, . . . partially
because I had had an unhappy work experience here back in the day.
Another emergent theme concerned the ways in which the library and/or the library dean
engaged in leading change, indicated by the library’s or the dean’s direct actions, such as
“we started,” “we put in place,” “we did things,” “moving,” and “we set about.” The two
additional themes of relevance to the institutional mission, and the impact of the virtual
library, have already been discussed in the sections above. One note
from my observations supports the theme of relevance:
As I walked in, I saw two giant banners hanging down the front of the
library building, with the words: “A great university requires a great
library.”
In summary, Library C engaged in reframing across all four frames, as shown in Figure
4.34, with the majority of the evidence falling into the symbolic frame.

Figure 4.34. Library C: Summary of Results
Library D
Context: Library D
Library D is situated in a young university, founded in 1963, in a major metropolitan hub
in the center of the state, near several major theme parks. Its parent university is the nation’s
second largest university, with a main campus, two satellite campuses, and 10 regional locations,
serving more than 60,000 students (University of Central Florida [UCF], n.d.a). The university’s
12 colleges offer 210 degree programs (UCF, n.d.a). The university “was ranked as the nation’s
No. 3 ‘Up-and-Coming’ university in the 2015 U.S. News & World Report’s Best Colleges”
(UCF, n.d.a, para. 2). The main campus is comprised of 1,415 acres, including 800 acres of
natural habitat, with 180 buildings (UCF, n.d.a; UCF, n.d.b). The university employs 11,074

189

individuals, and has an annual economic impact of $2 billion (UCF, n.d.b). The director of
Library D holds the title of Director of Libraries, and reports to the vice president.
Library D, the main campus library, is a five story building near the center of campus.
The building’s exterior façade is composed of red brick with white cement trim. A tall bank of
windows runs along the entire front façade on the upper story, while four other large window
areas are situated directly below. Inspirational banners hang below each of these windows, with
photos and quotes of university faculty, and messages addressing university research and
strategic goals. The building faces a spacious green lawn area with a large water fountain at its
center. The lawn slopes down to the fountain, which has a rounded “D” shape. Trees, benches,
pedestrian pathways, and lush tropical landscaping surround the green in a circular pattern,
mirroring the circular design of the campus plan. There is a parking lot and a main university
street on one side of the library, while the other side is adjacent to other campus buildings
housing the campus bookstore and credit union. The back side of the library faces more green
areas and pedestrian pathways.
Context: Interview with the director of Library D. I met with the director of Library
D on Thursday, May 21, 2015, at 1:30 PM. We met in his office on the fifth floor of the main
library. He was extremely cordial, and voluntarily extended the time for our interview for over
two hours. I conducted my observation data collection in two sections: some preceding the
interview and some following the interview, due to the travel time involved in reaching Library
D, which is nearly two hours from my home. I could not stay overnight, and needed to return the
same day. Here is a brief excerpt from my researcher’s journal describing a portion of the
meeting:
I arrived at the director’s office at 1:15 PM, 15 minutes ahead of our scheduled meeting
time. While I was waiting, I thanked the director’s assistant for making the arrangements
190

for the appointment for me. The other office staff and I also engaged in casual
conversation about the new Orlando Eye that was recently constructed, the weather, my
research and why I was visiting, and even recipes. The atmosphere in the office seemed
professional, but very relaxed and informal. Everyone was engaged in their work, but
also participating in conversation with coworkers and visitors, like myself. At 1:30 PM
exactly, the director came out of his office and met me and invited me in. He indicated I
sit at his conference table. His office was filled with papers and files and stacks of
things, but everything appeared organized. He joined me, and sat on the opposite side of
the table. His body language was very relaxed – he leaned back in his chair, had his legs
crossed, and leaned on the table. He was dressed formally, with a suit and tie, yet I
noticed a very high quality Disney Mickey Mouse watch on his wrist. This did not seem
too much of a surprise in a university located a few minutes away from Walt Disney
World. The director was friendly, and smiled a great deal, and made me feel welcome.
He also expressed appreciation for my research topic.
I noticed he had a lot of papers in front of him, and as we talked, those papers
turned out to be copies of my interview questions, which I had sent him in advance, filled
with notations about things he wanted to tell me. I was so pleased and impressed that he
had obviously spent a great deal of time preparing for this interview. In fact, he was so
excited to begin that he started talking before I could sit down and turn on my recorder. I
lost a little bit of those initial remarks, but I think that later we covered most of the
content of his remarks during that time.
During the interview, he was quite open about sharing his recollections and experiences,
and evinced a very humble attitude about his achievements. This was balanced by the
depth of his professional experience and accomplishments. His comments also revealed
a very different scenario, in many ways, than the other universities in my study. While
the Great Recession affected his budget in the same way as the other libraries – leaving it
flat for the past five years – his university was very supportive, both financially and
administratively. While he is at the director level, and not a dean, he indicated he did not
have to fight as many political battles as the other directors, so the level of his
administrative role did not turn out to be a factor. I am excited that his story is different
than the other libraries, yet expresses the same strategic momentum to become integrated
with the parent university’s mission as well as to become more of a “diffuse library.”
After about an hour, we had only gone through half of my interview questions. I asked
the director if we could have a few extra minutes to finish up the first half, and then
arrange an appointment for the follow-up interview. He told me he preferred to finish all
my questions, and that he had left his afternoon open to extend the appointment as long
as needed. He encouraged me to continue the interview and ask him all my questions. I
thanked him profusely, and felt grateful that he was giving me so much of his time. We
191

went through all the questions, in consecutive order, exactly according to the interview
protocol. Through it all, he was fun and personable, and demonstrated a high energy
level. He did not seem to tire at all as we talked for a lengthy period, and he expressed
how interesting it was for him to have time to reflect on the past few years, since, as he
expressed it, life seems to always be moving us forward too fast to spend much time
thinking about the past. His exact quote was expressed much more eloquently, and that
will show up in the transcript. He also shared some interesting and unexpected anecdotes
with me. I especially enjoyed the one about the Dracula painting made of him by his
employees. The collegial nature of his library and his organization really resonated loud
and clear in everything he shared with me. He also shared some budget reports with me,
and some artifacts. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to take a photo of the painting at the
time of the interview, because I was too involved in my role as interviewer and taking
notes. I made a note to ask him if I could take a photo of it when we finished, but by the
time we actually did finish, I was exhausted and forgot about it, but even if I hadn’t, I
noticed that he was looking at his watch. He had talked with me for over two hours, and
he had to be pretty tired too. Even though I didn’t get a photo of the painting, I
confirmed it visually, as well as in my notes and in the interview transcript, and in
hindsight I believe it was better to be responsive to the director’s nonverbal cues that it
was time the interview ended.
On the way out, I thanked the director’s assistant again, and said good bye to everyone I
met. Then I finished the remainder of my observation protocol. No one questioned me
about my taking photos in the library, although some students and staff stared at me a
little – but in a curious and friendly way. I finally left the library around 5:30 PM, after
spending six and a half hours there.

Findings: Library D
Two interviews with the director of Library D resulted in a total of 311 significant
comments, and 252 coded comments. Additionally, 12 institutional documents, 7 news articles,
78 photos, ad 32 observations, were collected. My researcher’s journal and historic and
contemporary Web pages from the library provided further sources of evidence. The total data
collected for Library A are shown in Table 15. The relative contribution of each data source to
the findings for Library D is displayed in Figure 4.35.

Figure 4.36. Library D: RQ1

Structural Frame
Prior to the timeframe of this study, the director indicated Library D was in a growth
pattern, paralleling the growth of its parent university. The director had joined the library in
1997, and personally experienced this growth. He explained the impact of the Great Recession
forced a transition from the growth-oriented model to one of rapid downsizing to a “hand to
mouth” existence. By 2010, the beginning of the timeframe for this study, Library D had lost 17
staff positions. The director explained this caused him to reconsider the library’s priorities and
restructure the organization to be more aligned with the institutional priorities:
When we reorganized, it sort of modified the structure a little bit to emphasize the things
that we think are really important. So we wanted to really get out there and become more
194

a part of really what’s going on. I don’t think we really weren’t out there, but we just
wanted to enhance that. That’s one of the things we’re really pushing now, [as we] move
forward.
The library’s budget also had experienced a severe impact, and, over the next five years,
remained at a relatively flat level. In 2014, the library only exceeded their 2007 budget level by
just $200,000. In 2011, the university announced a new fundraising campaign which included,
among its primary goals, the addition of “new technology and more space at the library to
provide our students with a leading-edge library resource” (President’s 2011 State of the
University Address).
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the library renovated its first floor to create a Knowledge
Commons in 2011, using money the university allocated from an increase in tuition and fees to
support research, as indicated in this excerpt from the president’s 2011 State of the University
Address:
Increases in tuition and fees – although not preferable or popular – have enabled us to
avoid layoffs and maintain a high quality of campus life. That money has allowed us to
add as many new faculty positions each year as we can to reduce the size of classes and
to enhance research at the university. … And students, these dollars have enabled us to
build the Knowledge Commons area in the library.
The following year, the university allocated some its Tech Fee money to the library to continue
additional renovations, as the director explained:
Then the Knowledge Commons really started. That was the first year of the Tech Fee
money, and every year since then we’ve [received] money to do some innovative things
as far as physical spaces in the building, or in the Curriculum Materials Center or in the
Rosen Library at the School of Hospitality and Management. We’ve [also] been [able to]
buy a lot of large databases and digital packages.
The library also established its own brand within the university, as the director explained:
195

More recently, maybe two or three years ago, maybe more, we came up with what we
call our brand, which is “Discover, Connect, Create.” That’s kind of a little short thing
that we use on various things.
Additionally, the library updated its formal mission/vision statement, as the director described, to
become more closely aligned with the strategic goals and directions of its parent institution:
There was a mission statement, [and] a few years ago, we completely redid that. We
went back and looked at our Vision/Mission and all that and rewrote that, well really
updated it.
The library also engaged with the university in key university initiatives to become as central to
the academic enterprise as possible, as this comment from the director illustrates:
We also talk about what’s going on that’s important to the University. So, when we see
that there are initiatives that are going on within the university, we want to be part of that
where we can be.

Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the library strategically hired personnel and reallocated role
responsibilities to fit their new priorities and smaller staff size as a result of the impact of the
Great Recession, as the director explained:
We planned for how we could cope and basically people did more with less, really. But,
then as we brought in new faculty into the library, library faculty, we recruited people
that were interested doing the kinds of things that we’re doing here.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the director concentrated his library’s efforts on building
relationships with faculty, as he expressed:
We try to really work closely with the faculty and find out what their needs are. We
asked to be on more of the faculty senate committees, [and] all the university committees
for that matter. So, [for the past] three, four years maybe, our faculty can now serve on

196

just about all the committees, which is really good because it gets them out meeting the
faculty. And then there’s a librarian on the various committees, and that’s helped a lot.
The director and library staff also worked with student government to determine, and respond to,
their needs, as the director explained:
One of the things that we did soon after I got here is we started a student advisory board,
and we try to meet with them at least twice a year, once in each semester but not in the
summer, and that’s worked out pretty well.
Research Question 2
During the past five years, 2010-2015, what was the nature of the relationship between
the libraries and their parent universities and how has this relationship evolved during
this period?
Library D exhibited evidence of reframing across all four frames for research question
two during the past five years, as indicated in Figure 4.37.
Structural Frame
Many of the issues in the structural frame, and the library’s relationship with its parent
university were discussed above in RQ1. However, the director emphasized the impact of the
budget cuts and economic downturn on the library’s overall operations, as he shared in these
comments:
At that time, we began having severe budget cuts and those continued for several years.
…The first year, we [experienced] cuts in personnel and in [our] materials budget.

Figure 4.37. Library D: RQ2

Just to give you an example, the budget prior to 2006/2007 was [approximately] $13.7
million total. The next year, in 2007/2008, it was $12.2 million. So we lost a lot of
money in a very short period of time and, ever since then, we’ve-- well, just to give you
another example, this year [2015] our budget is $13.9 million. So think about it: in
2006/20077, it was $13.7, now it’s $13.9. So, we’re $200,000 [over] where we were
[eight years ago]. And … we’re still down about 10 [positions].
I think everything, the problems that we have now, the issues that we have now, really
started with the budget in 2007 and 2008 [with] … the recession.
The library’s parent university mitigated the Great Recession’s budget impact on the library
whenever possible by providing some funding for library initiatives designed to support the
university’s strategic goals as described above.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the environment for Library D has been relatively stable. The
person the director reports to (the associate provost) has not changed, although the person in the
position of provost has changed several times. The director explained he found a supportive
198

attitude from the university administration and faculty when he arrived at the library in 1997, and
that hasn’t changed in the intervening years, as he expressed in these comments:
The first provost I worked with …was very active in the library and he, in fact, gave us
something called University Specials. In other words, it was extra money the university
had back in the day, and . . . you could send in a proposal for it. It had to meet the
president’s five goals for the university, but they were pretty broad. So if it did, we got a
lot of extra money for that. And, so he was very helpful.
One thing that happened, of course, is that the provost changed, but the person I reported
to didn’t change. He was here a couple of years before I came in, and so that’s been
static, that hasn’t changed. And, now, things have changed with how that’s been
organized and things like that, but for the most part though there’s been very little change
there, other than lack of funding. The only thing, they wish that the library had more
money so we could buy more resources, but there’s an understanding of that. But the
university administration, that’s one of the things I liked about it. And we’ve gone
through several provosts, but they’ve been very supportive.
The library and the director focused their efforts in the political frame on collaborations with
other university areas in order to become more integral to the university’s academic enterprise,
as the dean shared in these comments:
We knew that there was a need to collaborate more with some units on campus, like the
Writing Center. I didn’t have a [permanent] place for them in the building, but we
allowed them to come in and use the group study rooms. And, we’ve done more of that
as time goes on. Lately, …we have kind of a push to do more collaboration and things.
The director also lobbied for his staff to be part of key leadership groups across the university, as
he indicated in this comment:
We asked to be on more of the faculty senate committees, [and] all the university
committees for that matter. So, [for the past] three, four years maybe, our faculty can now
serve on just about all the committees, which is really good because it gets them out
meeting the faculty. And then there’s a librarian [serving] on the various committees,
and that’s helped a lot.
The director made a targeted effort to communicate the library’s value and needs to the
university community, as he explained:
199

We spend a lot of effort making sure that what goes on within the Library is known by
the university administration. We also talk about what’s going on that’s important to the
university. And, I keep my boss informed about everything that’s happening and then I
meet with him every other week too, so that’s always helpful. He tells me what’s going
on and it works well. And that’s where being on those Faculty Senate and other
university-wide committee is helpful because we kind of have a toe in the water, we
know what’s happening, and then we get feedback on some of that.
In turn, the vice president of the university shared the library’s needs and achievements with
other areas of the university, as the director recalled:
In fact, since I’ve been here, the vice president, one of the things that he does—he talks
about this a lot. He … talks to the college deans and so on.
The director also purposefully reached out to students to make connections, build relationships,
and involve them in the decision-making processes of the library, as he expressed:
My philosophy was, it’s for the students. It’s not for us. It’s not for the faculty so much.
It’s for the students and so what do they want? The only way to find out is to talk to
[them], so we did a lot of that. And so they’ve been very supportive. The last few years
we’ve been planning a library renovation and everything. We’ve been involving them in
that. In fact, when we did the Knowledge Commons downstairs, we involved them in
that. …And [we have] the Student Advisory Board, we talk to them, and they really give
us ideas on things that we use.
One of the initiatives the library implemented to reach out to students involved a printed version
of the library’s electronic newsletter—distributed in racks on the back of restroom doors. The
director described it this way:
We call it Installments. It’s a one-sheet newsletter that we put in a little folder in the back
of the stall in the bathrooms. And, the students have told us they really like it. In fact, we
put multiple copies in the little folder, they can pull one out, and so we have students that
have told us they wish that it would come out more often.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the director led the initiative to renovate the first floor of the
library into the Knowledge Commons in 2010, as he described:
200

Now what that floor used to look like, it was mostly reference all back in there. …So we
took all that out. We redid all of that. The lighting stayed the same, but we put in
everything else, new carpet and had some really good designers and it just really took off.
Well, the provost and the president would bring visiting people here to see it, because
they thought it was fantastic.

Following the completion of this renovation, the library worked on developing a plan to relocate
the majority of the physical collection in an automated retrieval center and build a new wing onto
the library, as the director recalled:
So we got the architects who had still been working with us off and on over these years,
so they came back and they put together a proposal and we met with the president’s
council and presented it and they loved it. They said this is fantastic. They liked the
idea. They really liked the automated retrieval center (ARC), the robots going up and
down and bringing the bins out and all this stuff. They really ate that up and we showed
them some automated stuff and so they knew what the areas would look like because they
had seen it.
He also described some of the architectural plans:
This is the site for what we’re going to build: right across over here is the student union.
In other words, this is going to be a totally new entrance. It’s going to be four stories.
This is the ARC building. In other words, this is where the automated retrieval center
will be, the robots. The fourth floor, the top floor of this is going to be a reading room, a
really nice area. In fact it’s going to look kind of like this. It’s going to have clear story
windows and there will be windows all the way around. So it’s really going to give us a
tremendous amount of a lot more space and then we’re going to pick up a lot of new
space in here, but it’s going to be a while.
While the director indicated plans for this renovation were stalled for years due to the budget
situation, news reports in February 2015 announced the launch of the first phase of construction
would begin in 2016.
For students, the library actively worked to create an impression of the library as “one of
the best places to study for finals,” and a new ritual evolved that caught on so well with students
that it was reported in the campus newspaper with that headline. The library also offered a
201

variety of the traditional forms of library events, such as lectures, art exhibits, and exhibitions of
special collections, as reflected on its Web site.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the director expanded and supported staff recognition in a
variety of formal and informal ways. A few examples include potluck celebrations for different
holidays, and employee recognition and achievement events. Plaques recognizing employee
excellence were hung along the wall outside the director’s office. The director also actively
participated in the employees’ informal celebrations, as he described:
We do a lot of kind of fun things. We had some folks in cataloging [who] love
Halloween, so we have a big Halloween party. A lot of people dress up. If I’m here, I
always dress up. I usually don’t stay dressed up all day, but I’ll go down to the party. I’ll
go down to the party and they usually have a theme and the whole staff lounge just
converts into whatever the theme is. A lot of people take pictures and it’s really a big
deal. They spend a little bit of library time putting it together, but it’s a lot of fun for
everybody.
The director explained that this sort of informal and collegial culture helped the library staff
adapt to the changes imposed by the impact of the Great Recession:
We have sort of an informal culture, whatever you want to call [it], within the library that
kind of developed, and people working together. You don’t really have people that are in
silos too much. I mean people sort of jump in and just kind of work together and it works
out pretty well. We had some people we would normally [would have] hired to do
something, [but] we didn’t have that position so we had several people that would get
together on a taskforce to accomplish whatever it was. We did that kind of thing.
When the budget situation enabled new positions to be filled, the director explained they were
filled strategically to reinforce the library’s existing service culture and align with the
university’s overall strategic direction, as discussed above in RQ1. For example, the director
created new positions for department heads for assessment and public relations, and scholarly

202

communication. Additionally, the director encouraged the professional development of his
employees, as he shared in these comments:
Then for the faculty and some of the library staff, depending on what they’re doing, we
do fund travel to conferences. I think that anybody that’s going through the promotion
process needs to have some support to go to conferences and so we have a process that
people go through and I think they’re pretty well funded for the most part.
I think it’s important because it supports people getting out there. It’s good for them. It’s
good for us, good for the university. They bring back all sorts of ideas, meet people,
network, and all of those are things that are important to, I think, the culture of the
organization.
So, we do encourage, we look for people that have some experience that have been
involved that want to be involved in scholarship and service to the profession. So, all of
those things maybe come together with the type of people that we get. So, I don’t know
that it’s any particularly magical... I mean we’re very fortunate and we have a really good
staff, and we really emphasize service.
The director created new positions for department heads for assessment and public relations, and
scholarly communication.
Research Question 3
How have the libraries’ missions changed during the past five years (2010-2015), and
what factors or environmental forces may have been influential catalysts?
Library D exhibited evidence of reframing across all four frames for research question
three during the past five years, with the majority of the evidence falling into the symbolic frame,
as shown in Figure 4.38.
Symbolic Frame
In 2011, the library published a formal mission and vision statement. This document was
updated more recently to closely parallel the parent university’s mission and vision, with shared
themes of excellence, learning, partnerships the library and university as place, research and
discovery, as this excerpt reveals (UCF Libraries, 2015):

203

Vision Statement: The University Libraries, a center for discovery and intellectual
enlightenment, offers outstanding resources and services in support of a large
metropolitan research university. The Libraries partners with academic, professional, and
local communities in sharing and developing resources, and fostering life-long learning
and information skills. (para. 1)

Figure 4.38. Library D: RQ3

The library also expanded its service culture to be more responsive to students and faculty, as the
director explained:
We always have, I think, since I’ve been here, looked at ways that we can improve our
services and what we can do. We really wanted to change how we were doing things,
focusing really on services and expanding those services out into the university
community.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, one of the most visible service culture shifts the library
instituted for faculty was the implementation of liaison librarians (subject librarians), as the dean
described:
204

Another thing that we did just recently too, over the last couple of years, is we started
something we call Subject Librarians, and these are people that actually are kind of the
first responders if you will. They go out and they meet with the faculty, [and] go to the
various departmental meetings. They talk about library issues [and they are] the contact
for faculty to find materials from the library. If there are new things that we’re doing,
like when we get a discovery tool, they talk to the faculty about that.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the library purposefully aligned itself to the QEP for its university,
as the dean explained:
So, what was important I think with that is that the QEP, the idea for the QEP came from
the library. You could set up a lot of proposals, and the proposal that was chosen by the
University to do was our proposal. Ours was Information Fluency. And, so, that was
kind of exciting because we were able to have totally new initiative. We partnered with
the Center for Distributed Learning to design online modules like one on say Plagiarism
or Using Databases or How to Use EndNote, those sorts of things.
Research Question 4
How have the responsibilities and duties of the library dean changed during the past five
years (2010-2015)?
Library D exhibited evidence across all four frames for research question four during the
past five years, with the majority of the evidence falling into the political frame, as shown in
Figure 4.39.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the director indicated his role had changed to include more
involvement in state issues and state politics, as he shared in these comments:
There’s a lot more involvement in state issues. I mean it’s not so much involvement in it,
just that they affect us so much. But I guess I’m involved in a lot of the state thing. Of
course I’m on CSUL and then I’m on a …state library network advisory committee. I’ve
been involved in there forever and then just more things going with FLVC. Now we’re
changing again, and so we’re going another big reorganization and that’s going to-- we’re
kind of concerned about that. So there’s just a lot of things at the state level.

Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the director actively engaged in team building for his
employees, as he shared in this comment:
I think it’s important to encourage that sort of togetherness, esprit de corps, whatever you
call it, because I think it’s important for people to just work together and share things.

Research Question 5
How have the ways in which the library assesses and communicates its value to its
constituencies changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
Library D exhibited evidence across all four frames for research question five during the
past five years, with the majority of the evidence falling into the symbolic frame, as shown in
Figure 4.40.

Figure 4.40. Library D: RQ5

Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the library demonstrated its value in one way by making
connections between students’ library use and student success, as the director explained:
There are several things that we know what the students are doing when they come into
the building and so we are going to look at that and analyze that to see what impact, if
any, it has on retention and graduation rates and things like that.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, Library D continued to collect and communicate traditional
quantitative values about the library. These metrics included the number of volumes, serials, and
government documents, and maps, as well as the extent of its technological resources. However,
while this information was reported on the library’s website, it was not included in the
university’s online fact book. The library also published an annual report, as the director
described:
207

We give them the statistics, of course. We have an annual report that goes over there with
everything in it. We tell them about is the usage of the building going up, are the
consultations going up, is the library instruction going up, all those things. We keep them
involved in that. …So anybody that wants to see it can see exactly what we said and
that’s helpful. So we’re much more involved in that than we were in the past, but it took
a while to get there.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the director focused on a variety of methods to communicate the
library’s return on investment, much of which has already been discussed in the preceding
research questions, however the director added these additional remarks:
We’re working with a professor over in statistics. So that’s going to be really pretty cool
when that comes out because that’s another thing see we can do for the university. You
mention the return on investment. I should have said this, but [that report] is the kind of
thing that they can see. Okay, we did this. They are better because of that. We already
know that information literacy things and … those initiatives have really helped a lot. So
that’s part of it.
Research Question 6
In what ways have the library’s interactions with students, faculty, and the community
changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
Library D exhibited evidence across all four frames for research question six during the
past five years, with the majority of the evidence falling into the symbolic frame, as shown in
Figure 4.41.

The relationship of the library with students, faculty and the community have been
adequately discussed above in RQ2-5, so there is no need to repeat it here, and there is no
additional evidence to discuss.
Research Question 7

library-led, in what ways did the library persuade its parent institution (and/or other
constituencies) to accept the change(s)?

All 4 Frames
The relationship of the library with students, faculty and the community has been
adequately discussed above in RQ2-5, and there is no additional evidence to discuss. In
summary, however, in the case of Library D, the changes which occurred to the library during
the timeframe of this study were, for the most part, the result of mutual consensus by both the
library and the university. As discussed above, changes initiated by one were supported and
reinforced by the other, for an outcome providing benefits to both.
Research Question 8
In what ways has the evolution of the virtual library impacted and influenced changes in
the library?
Library D exhibited evidence primarily in the structural frame for research question eight
during the past five years, as shown in Figure 4.43.

Figure 4.43. Library D: RQ8

Structural Frame
In the case of Library D, the budget impact of the Great Recession influenced the
evolution of the virtual library, as these comments from the director reflect:
The amount of money that we spent on e-resources continued to increase, but our budget
wasn’t going up so something had to give. And, of course, that was … the print material.
In 2007, we spent about 49 percent on e-resources in the budget. …Now it’s 75 percent.
The merger of the College Center for Library Automation with the Florida Center for Library
Automation into the Florida Virtual Campus also negatively affected the library’s budget, as the
director explained:
The Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) and the organization CCLA, the
College Center for Library Automation, were merged into this FLVC, as you probably
know, with … distance ed[ucation] and all of that. Well, that was bad for a lot [of]
reasons, but one of them really hurt us, because we got a lot [of] money from them for
I.T. purchases—about $285- to $290,000 a year—and when FCLA went away all that
money disappeared. The universities will lose about $1.2 million in funding from FLVC
from major databases. Things that we use. So we’re going to have to pick those up.
211

Well, how are we going to pick it up because most of us aren’t getting new money? So
that’s an issue.
The director indicated Library D was one of the first libraries in the state to have an online
catalog, and the library is continuing its forward moment by redesigning its Web site to be more
compliant with a variety of electronic devices and provide increased access to library resources
and social media, as the dean indicated:
We’re redoing our website. We’re doing that, we have a committee that’s working on
that. So, it’s going to be completely different. We do a lot of social media things with
students, Twitter and all those.
We’re getting ready to migrate again. I didn’t really mention we migrated along in here
when we were talking earlier to a new system. We’re getting ready to do that again, a
next-generation library system.

Research Question 9
How has the library’s role in the life of the university changed during the past five years
(2010-2015)?
Library D exhibited evidence across all four frames for research question nine during the
past five years, with the majority of the evidence falling into the symbolic frame, as shown in
Figure 4.44.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the creation of the Knowledge Commons strengthened the role of
the library as a student and faculty destination. The library has more than doubled the number of
its annual visitors since the renovations were completed, and the director indicated students want
to come to the library for a variety of reasons:
The students…want to come to the library. They understand that it’s crowded. We don’t
have enough electrical outlets, so they sit in the stairwells. But they want to be here, and
they tell us that.
212

We have places where [students] can sit together with a screen, with a monitor on the
wall, and all plug in their laptops. There [are] other areas where they can sit together.
There are areas where they can work in teams or a little bit more or less quiet study,
although not completely because it’s a pretty busy area most of the time, and different
types of seating. So that had a tremendous impact.

Figure 4.44. Library D: RQ9
In my interview with the director, he used the word “love” seven times to describe the ways he
perceived students, faculty, university administrators, and library staff felt about different things
in the library. The library’s development of a new mission/vision statement aligned it more
closely with the university’s strategic goals and direction, while the library’s creation of its own
brand identified it as both integral and distinct, as described above in RQ2 and RQ3.
Political Frame
The director indicated that the changes to his library over the past five years are more
important collectively than they are individually. He downplayed the manner in which his past

213

extensive experience with diverse libraries and service in a variety of professional positions may
have enabled him to move his library forward in all four frames.
These are all little minor things, they’re really not [individually] all that important
because it’s all of them together. We planned for how we could cope, and basically
people did more with less, really. But at the same time, I think, overall, everybody
understood, and there was a lot of still looking to the future, and we were still planning
what we were going to do.
I always have liked planning and bringing new things in and exploring new possibilities
about ways of doing things, and [discovering] just what can systems do for us and what’s
out there.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, the library realigned its services and products to be more closely
aligned with its parent university’s mission and strategic goals, as discussed in the sections
above. The library also partnered with its parent institution to implement joint objectives, such
as the QEP and data management, and other strategic initiatives, as discussed in the previous
sections.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the director strengthened the library’s service culture and
overall outreach to the university community, as discussed in the previous sections, however, the
director provided this additional anecdote of how they assess the success of their service and
outreach:
In fact, one of the things that we’ve been doing for several years, particularly with the
public services desk, we use the mystery shopper and you know how that works, I guess.
So they come up and pretend like whatever they are. They call in or whatever and then
we get reports. You have to pay for the service, but … they really assess the levels of
service. Now, we tell the staff this is going to happen, we’re going to do this over some
period of time, but they of course don’t know what is real and what isn’t, but it’s helpful
to us because we feel like service is very important and we constantly strive to adhere to
that.
214

Summary and Themes
While the themes for this study were a priori the four frames identified by Bolman and
Deal (2013), nevertheless, five themes emerged in the data analysis which deserve mention. The
evidence revealed the majority of the changes to be the result of strategic effort, primarily
through the actions and leadership of the dean, indicated by the dean’s use of the words “work,”
“create,” “do/did,” and “try,” as well as indications of proactive “planning.” A companion theme
to this emerged as leading change, indicated by the library’s or the director’s direct actions, such
as “we began to think about other ideas.” The director’s own leadership style was part of this
theme as well, as shown in this example from the interview transcript:
So there were a lot [of] things that I thought I would have done differently after I got
here, just because I had seen [at] other places how you do things or how you don’t do
things.
I always have looked to the future because I always have liked planning and bringing
new things in and exploring new possibilities about ways of doing things. I think it’s fun,
and also [to see] just what can systems do for us and what’s out there.
Two additional themes of relevance to the institutional mission, and budget, have already been
discussed in the sections above. The final theme of relationship with the university incorporates
both the library’s relationship with the institution and the director’s relationship with the
university administration, students, faculty, and staff. As indicated in the sections above, the
director had an open channel of communication to the provost, and, through the provost, to other
university leaders, indicated by use of the words “talk,” “listen,” and “working together.” For
example, the impression the director formed during his initial job interview is representative of
this relationship:
I met a lot [of] the administration and liked what I saw there. I thought they were very
open, accommodating, very … down to earth people and so... Yes, I thought they were
[supportive].
215

The director also related this experience with the former provost:
He came over to the library a lot, and he knew a lot about the Library. In fact, when we
would have calls for CSUL, we had a big debate about dividing up the resources and who
pays for it. …I’d go over there and … be there whenever he needed advice about the call
while it was going on. He’d put it on mute and then we’d talk and then he’d get back in
the discussion. So, he was really good. He kept up. He knew what was going on with
the library.

In summary, Library D engaged in activities across all four frames, as shown in Figure 4.45, with
the majority of the evidence in the symbolic frame.

CHAPTER 5
CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS

Introduction
The purpose of this study was to describe ways in which the academic libraries of the
four top-tier, Carnegie-classed, public research universities in one U.S. state adapted or changed
their role within the university during the past five years (2010-2015). This study examined the
activities, services, and administration of the academic libraries of the four public universities in
Florida identified by the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH” with “very high research activity”
(Carnegie Foundation, n.d.b, para. 5). Data was collected through semi-structured, open ended
interviews with the libraries’ leaders, researcher observation and photographs of the libraries’
facilities, documents, news articles, multimedia materials, artifacts, and the libraries Web sites.
A researcher’s journal, written during the data collection and analysis phase of the study,
provided additional data. Bolman and Deal’s (2013) theory of reframing organizations provided
the framework for analyzing the changes in these libraries during the timeframe of the study to
discover evidence of strategic change.
This chapter is organized into several sections. The first section presents the cross-case
analysis. The next section includes a discussion of the findings, limitations of the study, and
opportunities for future research. Finally, this chapter presents implications for practice and the
conclusion.

217

Cross-Case Analysis
The cross-case analysis of the data for Libraries A, B, C, and D revealed movement
across all four frames, as shown in Figure 5.1. Individual cross-case analysis, by research
question, is presented below.

Figure 5.1. Cross-Case Results: By Frame

Research Question 1
As defined by each of Bolman and Deal’s (2008) four frames—structural frame, political
frame, symbolic frame, and human resource frame—in what ways have the academic
libraries of these four universities exhibited evidence of reframing during the past five
years: 2010-2015?
All Four Frames
All four of the libraries in this study exhibited evidence of reframing across all four
frames.
218

Structural Frame
In the structural frame, all four libraries engaged in reframing their organizational
structure. This reframing primarily involved downsizing, due to decreased budget and
personnel.
Political Frame
In the political frame, all four libraries engaged in increased participation in their
universities’ governance groups. In the cases of Libraries B and C, the position of the director of
libraries was purposefully elevated to the level of an academic dean. In the case of Library A,
while the position of dean of libraries pre-dated the timeframe of this study, it was an academic
leadership position in name only until the dean engaged in a strategic process of engagement
with university administration. In the case of Library D, the position of leadership in the library
was designated as library director with a reporting structure to the associate provost of the
university. However, the director in this case embarked on a concerted effort to build
relationships with university and faculty leaders and establish coalitions of support for the library
throughout the university.
All four libraries also strategically communicated their libraries’ value to internal and
external stakeholders, through formal and traditional reporting mechanisms as well as informal
personal communications and interactions with university and student leadership.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, all four libraries engaged in major renovations to their facilities to
create knowledge commons, library cafes, and more student-centered spaces. All four libraries
are also planning additional renovations in the near future.

219

All four libraries purposefully aligned their strategic goals and directions to their parent
university’s mission and goals. While Libraries A and B did not evolve a formal strategic plan
or mission statement until the later years of the timeframe of this study, due to the ambiguous
landscape created by the Great Recession, they nevertheless followed a strategic direction
established by the libraries’ deans and director. In the case of Library C, a formal strategic plan
and mission/vision statements were developed by both the library and the university two years
prior to the timeframe of this study. However, the dean of Library C purposefully designed and
selected projects and priorities to fulfill those goals throughout the timeframe of this study.
All four libraries established new rituals, ceremonies, events, and traditions to project the
libraries’ central role in the life of the university. All four also became purposefully involved in
university-wide activities to project the libraries’ central role in the university’s academic
enterprise.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, all four libraries engaged in empowering their employees
and purposefully aligning employee skills to tasks and roles. All four libraries encouraged a
shared ownership of the library by encouraging employees’ participation in decision-making
about the library, and supported a team-oriented culture.
Research Question 2
During the past five years, 2010-2015, what was the nature of the relationship between
the libraries and their parent universities, and how has this relationship evolved during
this period?
All Four Frames
All four of the libraries in this study exhibited evidence of reframing across all four
frames.
220

Structural Frame
In the structural frame, all four libraries engaged in reframing their organizational
structures to become active partners in the academic enterprise of the university. While Library
D enjoyed that perception prior to the timeframe of this study, the library’s addition of two new
departments directly connected to the university’s strategic goals expanded its relationship with
the university. In just the opposite situation, Library A was perceived as a siloed institution prior
to the timeframe of this study, but by 2015 its internal reorganization contributed to its
integration with the university’s goal and mission.
Political Frame
In the political frame, all four libraries increased their level of participation in the
university’s governance groups, as described above. The library deans and director also
increased their communication of the libraries’ value to their respective parent institutions, and
successfully lobbied for financial and institutional support for various initiatives.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, all four libraries purposefully aligned their strategic goals and
directions to their parent university’s mission and goals. The libraries’ renovations, institutions
of new ceremonies and traditions, and involvement in university-wide projects also reestablished the libraries’ role as central to the life of their universities.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, all four libraries either established or transformed their
service culture to be more outward reaching and proactive, rather than passively responsive.
Research Question 3
How have the libraries’ missions changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?

221

Symbolic Frame
Bolman and Deal (2008) indicated that activities such as the creation of an organizational
mission or strategic plan are important symbols for an organization and provide a shared “sense
of purpose” (p. 255). All four of the libraries in this study purposefully engaged in reframing
their mission/vision statements and strategic plans. All four also purposefully aligned their goals
and mission to those of their parent university.
Research Question 4
How have the responsibilities and duties of the library dean changed during the past five
years (2010-2015)?
Political Frame
The leadership skills exercised by the deans and director of the four libraries in this study
included aspects from all four frames described by Bolman and Deal (2008): “analysis, design,
support, empowerment, advocacy, coalition building, inspiration, [and] meaning-making” (p.
356). However, the changes in the dean’s/director’s responsibilities and duties fell primarily into
the political frame. All the deans and director in this study indicated an increased emphasis on
political negotiations for scarce resources, such as budget increases and funding, as well as
extended efforts on outreach and relationship-building beyond the university, through
collaborations with statewide library coalitions or through involvement in state governmental
issues.
Research Question 5
How have the ways in which the library assesses and communicates its value to its
constituencies changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?

222

Structural Frame
In the structural frame, all four libraries in this study continued to utilize traditional
assessment and reporting methodologies, such as statistical and budget reports of the total
volumes in the library’s collection, as well as annual reports of the libraries’ activities. Bolman
and Deal (2008) explained that these type of reports, identifying progress to goal, fall into the
structural frame. The dean of Library C also initiated an innovative project/report to demonstrate
correlation of the utilization of the library’s new spaces to the progress of the university’s goal of
student success. The dean of Library B developed a reporting tool comparing the budget of her
library with peer institutions. The director of Library D collaborated with a statistics professor to
demonstrate the use of library services. All four library leaders also engaged in extensive
assessment, formally and informally, of student and faculty needs and desires for the library in
order to refine the libraries’ future direction, products, and services.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the libraries’ transformations of their physical spaces to a more
student-focused purpose implied their value of students as patrons, which in turn elevated the
perceived value of the library by students—indicated by their increasing number of visits to the
libraries—and the library leaders’ perceptions that the students like the new library spaces. The
physical transformations of the libraries’ spaces, financially supported by each of the libraries’
parent institutions, also implied the value of the library to the university as a whole, indicated by
positive comments from university administrators published in various documents.
Political Frame
In the political frame, all four library leaders increased their interactions with upper-level
university administration and faculty and student leadership. Each library leader in this study

223

engaged in a concerted effort to build relationships and become active in decision-making groups
across the university. This participation implied the libraries’ central role in the academic
enterprise of the university. The dean of Library B extended her political role to lobbying for
library support at the state government level. All four library leaders also utilized informal
methods of communication to express their libraries’ value to their universities. For example,
the dean of Library A and the director of Library D brought university administrators into the
library for tours and demonstrations. The deans of Libraries B and C networked informally with
other deans in their institution.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, all four libraries enabled their staff to participate on library
and university-wide committees and governance groups. This participation implied the value of
the libraries contributions to the university as a whole. The libraries’ universal support of
professional development and recognition for library staff implied the value of the librarians to
the academic enterprise of the institution.
Research Question 6
In what ways have the library’s interactions with students, faculty, and the community
changed during the past five years (2010-2015)?
All Four Frames
All four of the libraries in this study exhibited evidence of reframing across all four
frames.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, all four libraries in this study instituted a variety of new services
and products strategically designed to meet the needs of students and faculty, as well as their
parent universities’ strategic goals.
224

Political Frame
In the political frame, all four libraries made a concerted effort to reach out to university
administration to establish relationships and build support for the libraries. The library leaders
also embarked on a campaign to meet with faculty, assess their needs, invite their suggestions,
and innovate new programs and services, such as scholarly communications, to build
relationships and increase the faculty’s positive engagement with the library.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, all four libraries in this study transformed their physical facilities
into places specifically designed to support student learning and access to technology and
electronic resources. In other words, all four libraries in this study established the sense of the
library as place, and library use immediately rose and continued to climb for all four institutions.
In the case of Library A, this transformation was so dramatic that the library evolved from a
“book warehouse,” and a place few students wanted to be, to a place students felt so strongly
about supporting they held a sit-in, as discussed in the presentation of Library A above. In the
cases of Libraries B and C, student government stepped in to pay for the library to be open
extended hours.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, all four libraries in this study shifted their service culture
from inward and passive to outward, proactive, and engaged.
Research Question 7
When changes occurred, were they library-led or university directed? If they were
library-led, in what ways did the library persuade its parent institution (and/or other
constituencies) to accept the change(s)?

225

All Four Frames
All four of the libraries in this study exhibited evidence of reframing across all four
frames. The changes implemented during the past five years resulted from a complex,
interwoven tapestry of university-led, library-led, student-led, and collaboratively-led initiatives
across all four frames, primarily accomplished through mutual consensus. When the library took
the lead, the changes were frequently innovative and pioneering. For example, Library A
implemented a textbook affordability project in partnership with the university bookstore, and
Library B reinvented their historically cloistered special collections to become open resources in
specially-designed spaces for collaboration and research. The dean of Library C established an
environment within the library which encourage staff to explore and try out new ideas.
Research Question 8
In what ways has the evolution of the virtual library impacted and influenced changes in
the library?
All Four Frames
All four of the libraries in this study exhibited evidence of reframing across all four
frames.
Structural Frame
In the structural frame, all four libraries in this study struggled to balance the increasing
costs for the acquisition of digital resources and technologies with budgets that remained
relatively flat throughout the timeframe of this study. For all the libraries in this study, that
balance was reached at the sacrifice of traditional print resources as well as through the
institution of innovative partnerships to share resources or strategies to increase funding from
outside sources, such as grants and gifts from private donors. Library A and Library D
reorganized their technical services departments to accommodate the emphasis on electronic
226

resources. Library C moved to a new open-source software to manage their digital resources.
Library B marked a milestone for digitizing more than 10 million resources by the end of the
timeframe of this study.
Political Frame
The environmental pressure to acquire electronic resources required all the library leaders
in this study to negotiate for increased financial resources from their parent universities, as well
as to engage in collaborative partnerships to share the costs of electronic resources.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, the renovations to all four libraries in this study included
dedicated spaces for technology, as well as the provision of technological tools, such as 3D
printers. The libraries also expanded their computer and tablet rentals, access to their collections
from mobile devices, and increased support for distance and online education.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, the libraries realigned staff roles, provided training for
employees in new technologies, and also created new positions designed specifically to manage
electronic resources.
Research Question 9
How has the library’s role in the life of the university changed during the past five years
(2010-2015)?
All Four Frames
All four of the libraries in this study exhibited evidence of reframing across all four
frames.

227

Structural Frame
In the structural frame, all four of the libraries in this study transitioned into more nimble
organizations with structures geared to respond to internal and external environmental pressures
in a changing environment.
Political Frame
In the political frame, the leadership of all four of the libraries in this study broadened
their outreach to students, faculty, administration, and state leaders. All four of the library
leaders also became more involved in fundraising efforts for their library. The elevation of two
of the library leaders (Libraries A and B) to the position of dean increased their connections with
university leadership and their participation in university governance.
Human Resource Frame
In the human resource frame, all four of the libraries in this study empowered their
employees and matched role to task to increase employee satisfaction. All four libraries in this
study also transformed their service culture to proactively engage with their constituents.
Symbolic Frame
In the symbolic frame, all four of the libraries in this study successfully established the
concept of the library as place among their constituents. While all four libraries in this study
already occupied prominent physical locations on their respective campuses, the changes
engineered in the symbolic frame re-established the libraries in the center of the life of the
university. The libraries’ involvement in university-wide initiatives also established their
perception as a central partner in the university’s academic enterprise.

228

Discussion of Findings
The guiding question for this qualitative, phenomenological, multiple case study
considered “in what ways have the academic libraries of four public, doctoral, research
universities in Florida, identified by the Carnegie Classification of “RU/VH,” adapted or
changed their role within the university during the past five years, 2010-2015, from the
perspective of the Deans of the Libraries?” The literature review in Chapter 2 set the stage for
the necessity of asking this question by providing a brief history of the evolution of academic
research libraries in America, and an overview of the multiple challenges faced by academic
research libraries during the 21st century. In the year since that summary was written, new
literature has emerged to shed more light on the experiences of academic research libraries and a
perspective on what the future may hold. For example, the ACRL recently published a
collection of essays on the outlook for academic research libraries. The sections of that
document were titled: a) framing the road ahead; b) shifts in positioning; c) responding to
opportunity: creating a new library landscape; and d) leadership (Bell, Dempsey, & Fister, 2015,
p. 5). The goal of the ACRL publication was to provide insight into the “ways that libraries
leverage opportunities that lead to a set of new roles for libraries and librarians over time”
(Allen, 2015, p. 8). Many of the issues under discussion parallel the findings in this research
study. For example, Dempsey (2015) wrote “academic libraries are a part of the changing
education enterprise, and the character of that enterprise is what will most influence an
individual library’s future position” (p. 11). All four of the library directors in this study
emphasized the importance of their library’s connection to and engagement with their parent
university’s mission, goals, and strategic direction. Dempsey (2015) also discussed the ways in
which “academic libraries have to make choices about priorities, investment, and disinvestment

229

in a complex, continually emerging environment” (p. 11). All four of the library leaders in this
study described some of the hard choices they have had to make in terms of transitioning away
from legacy print collections toward electronic resources and services. For the libraries in this
study, this transition often involved literally moving the physical collections into the basement or
offsite in order to repurpose the libraries’ physical facilities toward student- and faculty-centered
spaces and services. In 2009, these types of physical changes were identified as “experiments”
(Stuart, 2009, p. 7), and little research existed to document the impact or value of these changes
(Stuart, 2009). In 2015, the American Library Association published a report documenting the
value of the library to student engagement, student success, and the library’s support of the
academic mission, described by Rosa (2015):
Some 59% of chief academic officers rated library resources and services “very
effective”—more effective than on-campus teaching and instruction, online courses and
programs, academic support services, research and scholarship, administrative
information systems and operations, and data analysis and organizational analytics. …
Academic librarians are working largely with reallocated funds to transform programs
and services by repurposing space, migrating collections, and redeploying staff in the
digital resources environment. (p. 6)
The reference in the quote above to “reallocated funds” indicates academic libraries’ continuing
struggle with budget issues. Lowry (2013) explained the flat budget environment for academic
libraries, stalled at nearly the same level for the past five years following the Great Recession, is
not anticipated to increase in the near future, as state budgets for higher education are still feeling
pressure. Bell (2015) indicated national economic arbiters of financial environments, such as
Moody’s, also concur on the financial forecast for higher education. All four of the libraries in

230

this study indicated a similar struggle with their own financial resources. The dean of Library B
described the process as akin to “rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.”
Bell (2015) explained higher education itself is experiencing an “evolutionary moment”
(p. 14) and the roles of library staff are evolving as well, into more highly specialized functions.
For example, Library B in this study hired liaison librarians with degrees in the specific
academic discipline in which they would be working rather than a traditional library science
degree. Library C created a new position and hired a specialist specifically to help faculty
manage big data. Ward (2015) concurred:
Academic libraries are undergoing a public, challenging and frequently contested
transformation. The change and obsolescence of academic libraries as we know them
represents an event of unprecedented magnitude in higher education. Rarely has a core
institutional activity faced such formidable prospects for change. (para. 3)
All four of the library directors in this study indicated challenges and changes on several fronts,
from keeping pace with advances in technology to finding more effective methods of
demonstrating and communicating the library’s value to the institution and its stakeholders.
Dempsey (2015) revealed academic libraries’ use of space is also undergoing an
evolutionary change:
Library space used to be configured around library collections and access to them. Now it
is being configured around experiences—group working, access to specialist expertise or
facilities, exhibitions, and so on.
All four of the libraries in this study demonstrated a similar repurposing of their space to focus
on user needs and a de-emphasis on the physical collections. The libraries’ Web sites also
revealed the promotion of collections transitioned to electronic media. In the case of Library B,

231

however, some of the repurposing of space conversely emphasized special physical collections.
For example, the library’s renovation of the Judaica Suite created a physical space to not only
accentuate the physical collection, but also to serve as a gathering space, event space, and study
space. In another example of this reverse engineering, Library B renovated the historic reading
room back to its original purpose, but with a new mission of opening up previously closelyguarded physical collections to the broader university community.
To counterbalance the flat budget environment, academic libraries around the country are
becoming more involved in fundraising. For example, Brown University recently received a
$1.3 million gift to support digital scholarly publications in the humanities (Brown University,
2015). Notre Dame University recently received a $10 million gift for its libraries to support
renovations to create a center for digital scholarship and a digital research lab (Notre Dame
University, 2015). The University of California – San Diego recently received a $3 million gift
to “transform and revitalize the library’s interior public spaces to meet the evolving needs of
students, faculty, and other users in the digital age” (UC-San Diego, 2015, para. 2). Carleton
College and St. Olaf College recently received a $1.4 million joint gift to support collaborative
efforts in library management systems and staff sharing (Carleton College, 2013). All four of the
libraries in this study demonstrated increased involvement in fundraising activities, especially in
regard to the role of the deans/directors, who indicated they became more personally involved in
communicating funding needs to university administration, lobbying the legislature, and meeting
with donors and potential supporters.
The library as place continued to be an important trend. The University of Scranton
library recently announced a renovation to redesign their library space into a “campus hub”
(Scranton Journal, 2014, para. 1). The Georgia Tech library also announced a “transformational”

232

(Matthews, 2015, para. 6) renovation to meet the 21st century needs of their students and faculty,
the goals of which echo much of what has been presented in this paper:
The Library is and always has been a changing organism. The ability to immediately
browse millions or hundreds of thousands of physical print books within highly valuable
central campus space worked well for research libraries in the 20th century. But, like
many research libraries, we have seen our print utilization rates drop precipitously (from
80,000+ checkouts in 2003 down to under 30,000 checkouts last year), while seeing a
concurrent increase in access to the Library’s electronic subscriptions (with over
1,000,000 clicks to Library e-Resources in 2013), and –interestingly – a marked increase
in physical space utilization over the past decade (we hit 1.33 million user visits last year,
up from 875,000 in 2005).
So it is clear the library needs to evolve to meet the changing needs of users for the 21st
century. More library space for users, and less for underutilized print collections. More
electrical infrastructure, more daylight, more scanning and e-delivery of print materials
when feasible, and – importantly – we are being good stewards of the print materials that
we do have. (para. 11-12)
Among the libraries in this study, the concept of the library as place was expressed as both a goal
and an achievement. Library A’s president called the library the heart of the institution. Library
B’s library was referred to as the DNA of its parent institution. These findings are supported by
the predominance of the evidence in the symbolic frame.
Implications for Practice
The experience of the four libraries in this study may provide direction for the
administration of other libraries, as Ward (2015) noted:

233

The future of our libraries is our own future. Higher education is at a turning point, with
libraries as one of the most visible signs of change. How we choose to recreate libraries
may be a reflection of how we adapt to changing and critical social, political, economic
and environmental issues throughout the world. (para. 20)
Bolman and Deal (2013) disclosed “the power to reframe is vital for modern leaders” (p.
438) in order to successfully adapt to changing circumstances, priorities, and societal and
environmental pressures. All four of the library leaders interviewed for this study indicated they
engaged in a strategic effort to plan and lead the changes in their libraries, either formally or
informally. All four of the library leaders related their experiences in viewing their organizations
through multiple frames, enacting change in all four frames simultaneously, and breaking frames
when necessary in order to innovate. The deans of Libraries A and B had non-traditional
backgrounds with extensive experience in diverse organizations. The dean of Library C and the
director of Library D had experience in academic libraries in a variety of roles in several libraries
around the country. This broad world view may have assisted these four library leaders by
providing them with both the knowledge and intuition to understand their library through
multiple frames. As academic research libraries continue to cope with a rapidly evolving higher
education landscape, an uncertain budget environment, the increasing speed of technological
developments, the demands for a workforce more engaged with the new knowledge economy,
and the pressure to convey value to their parent universities and the community at large, the
leaders of academic research libraries will need to adopt some of the management tactics
described by Bolman and Deal (2013):
We want … to lay the groundwork for a new generation of managers and leaders who
recognize the importance of poetry and philosophy as well as analysis and technique. We

234

need pioneers who embrace the fundamental values of human life and the human spirit.
Such leaders and managers will be playful theorists who can see organizations through a
complex prism. They will be negotiators able to design resilient strategies that
simultaneously shape events and adapt to changing circumstances. They will understand
the importance of knowing and caring for themselves and the people with whom they
work. They will be architects, catalysts, advocates, and prophets who lead with soul. (p.
438)
Nearly 15 years ago, in 2001, at the start of the new millennium, an article in The
Chronicle of Higher Education described the institution of the academic library as an entity in
the last throes of its existence (Carlson, 2001). The article described several academic libraries
as places of “eerie quiet” (Carlson, 2001, p. 2), because the number of students coming to the
physical library building were dropping nationwide (Carlson, 2001). The article questioned
whether libraries were losing connection with their traditional role as “the social and intellectual
heart of campus” (Carlson, 2001, p. 4). This connection of the academic library as the center of
campus life as well as the center of knowledge resonated from Thomas Jefferson’s design for the
University of Virginia in 1819 (Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 2015).
Jefferson situated the library in the most prominent building on campus, in the center of the
campus, and in the central space between the main student residences (Rector and Visitors of the
University of Virginia, 2015). In his conception of a college campus, Jefferson situated the
library as place as well as a source of knowledge (Rector and Visitors of the University of
Virginia, 2015):
For Thomas Jefferson, learning was an integral part of life. The “academical village” is
based on the assumption that the life of the mind is a pursuit for all participants in the

235

University, that learning is a lifelong and shared process, and that interaction between
scholars and students enlivens the pursuit of knowledge. (para. 1)
Lippincott (2015) noted that amid many predictions of the death of the academic library,
librarians have recently taken action in innovative ways to restore the library to its central role in
the academic enterprise:
With the rise of the World Wide Web, Google, and ubiquitous, 24-hour access to
information in a variety of modes, many people predicted the demise of libraries.
However, libraries continue to maintain a vital role in the emerging digital university.
Librarians have proven to be insightful leaders, putting into place the kinds of
technologies needed for teaching, learning, and research. They are often among the early
adopters of new technologies in their institutions. Most academic work in the digital
environment is done by teams, not by individuals working alone. In partnership with
faculty, students, staff, and their communities, librarians will continue to have a strong
role in the digital university. (p. 293)
This research study may shed some light on the ways in which four academic research libraries
adapted to change over the past five years, and may help inform future administrators of both
academic libraries and universities as they plan their own institutions’ futures.
Limitations of the Study
This qualitative case study examined a purposeful sample of the top academic research
libraries in one U.S. state to better understand the degrees of change in these four specific
institutions, in their unique contexts, in order to gain understanding of their “principles of
practice” (Patton, 2002, p. 564). This study is not intended to be generalizable or to imply
similar findings at other institutions.

236

Limitations: Heuristic Inquiry. This research study is the result of heuristic inquiry, in
which the researcher served as the data collection instrument (Patton, 2002). While the
researcher’s background was stated and bracketed in the first chapter of this report, in order to
preserve the rigor of this study, the universal limitation of heuristic inquiry in qualitative
research allowed the potential for the unintentional influence of the researcher’s background and
beliefs in both the data collection and analysis of the findings (Patton, 2002). Several of these
challenges were described in Chapter 4, such as the researcher’s unintentional positive leanings
toward the library situated in the university where the researcher is a student, an alumna, and an
employee.
Another heuristic limitation which emerged near the completion of the data analysis
phase was the fact that the researcher is also the data organization instrument and data analysis
instrument. Any organization scheme must necessarily be guided by the researcher’s experience
and past history with data organization and management. Equally, any analysis scheme must
necessarily be guided by the researcher’s experience with, and understanding of, the concept of
qualitative analysis, in and of itself, as well as data analysis. Patton (2002) explained the
researcher, in this analysis phase, extracts meaning from the data through the filter of their own
knowledge, experience, impressions, and understandings. The resulting interpretation of the
data, if undertaken by different researchers, might have different outcomes. In the procedures
section of Chapter 4, the rationale and procedures were described in detail, to bracket out this
effect as much as possible.
In light of this, a final heuristic limitation is that the researcher is the filter for the data.
This qualitative research study is based on Bolman and Deal’s (2013) theory of organizational
frames and reframing. However, the researcher served as the filter through which the collected

237

data were identified as belonging to the different frames. My understanding of Bolman and
Deal’s theory may not match what the scholars intended, nor the way in which another
researcher might parse the data.
Limitations: Participants and Sample Size. The four libraries in this study were
selected for certain characteristics, described and explained above in Chapters 1-3, in order to
explore the research question for this study. The inclusion of other types of libraries might have
yielded different results. Similar libraries in other locations might also have yielded different
results. The inclusion of private universities into the mix of cases under study might also have
demonstrated different results.
The demographics of the library directors of the libraries under study were not designated
in the proposal for this study, beyond the requirement that the directors needed to have at least
three years of experience leading the library in the study, in order to provide a longitudinal
perspective for the five-year time frame of this study. As described in Chapter 4, the
demographics of these directors turned out to be an equal distribution of male and female.
However, all four directors interviewed for this study were found to be senior-level
administrators, with several decades of experience. If the depth of experience of the directors
interviewed had been more diverse, the results of this study might have had a different outcome.
Additionally, all the library leaders in this study knew each other for many years prior to the
timeframe of this study. Their interactions at statewide library conferences and meetings may
have allowed cross-pollination of ideas and strategies. Finally, all the interviews in this case
study portray a single perspective—the perspective of the library directors. The inclusion of
multiple perspectives, from other library stakeholders such as university administrators, faculty,
and students, might have provided greater detail or alternative outcomes. I considered these

238

options when planning this study, however, as a novice researcher and graduate student engaged
in a study for a dissertation, I believed the inclusion of more libraries or more interviewees was
outside the bounds of practicality for this study.
The sample size for this study was limited to four cases, and the rationale for this
selection was explained in Chapter 3. Patton (2002) confirmed that the sampling strategy for a
research study must “fit the purpose of the study, the resources available, the questions being
asked, and the constraints being faced” (p. 242). A similar research study with a larger number
of cases may yield different results.
Limitations: Interviews. Patton (2002) explained there are several limitations for
interview data, including “recall error, reactivity of the interviewee to the interviewer, and selfserving responses” (p. 306). In this study, I asked the library directors to recall five years of their
experiences and to relay it in a timeframe of approximately two hours. Most of the directors’
comments matched the confirmatory data collected from documents and artifacts, however some
of the directors’ comments expressed a fluid timeline and the directors sometimes included
events years prior to the timeframe of this study. I tried to clarify these recollections through
follow-up questions during the interviews. Additionally, the interview transcripts and draft of
the final report were provided to the library directors for their review and correction (membercheck). My role as a novice researcher, interested in their field of expertise, may also have
influenced the information the directors shared with me.
Yin (2014) noted issues of reflexivity may also emerge as a threat during qualitative
interviews. The researcher and the researched may form a relationship during the interview in
which “the conversation can lead to a mutual and subtle influence between you and the

239

interviewee” (p. 112). Yin (2014) also explained that awareness of this threat can help reduce it.
I also followed a structured interview protocol to further mitigate this limitation.
Limitations: Observations. As Patton (2002) indicated, the most obvious limitation of
observation data is their external nature and the brief amount of time a researcher can spend in
the field. For this study, I was only able to spend two to three hours in each library for the
observation data collection, as explained in detail in Chapter 4. The dates of my visits to the
libraries were selected, for the most part, for the convenience and availability of the library
directors rather than for a more formal purpose of the study. In hindsight, a similar observation
time for all of the libraries might have yielded additional data. For example, in one library, my
observation took place at the height of final exam week, while in another library, my observation
occurred in the most quiet week between the spring and summer semesters. While my
observation data collection protocol primarily involved observations about library facilities,
some of the observations required noting the number of staff or students visible in the library.
As a result of the timing of my observation periods, this information differed greatly among the
four libraries, however, I noted this effect in the procedures section in Chapter 4.
Limitations: Documents. I collected two main types of documents: institutional
documents (produced by the respective libraries or their parent universities) and news articles.
Documents, overall, carry the limitation that they may contain errors or missing information
(Patton, 2002). Institutional documents carry the limitation that they may present a biased
perspective that is favorable to the institution (Yin, 2014). News articles may also provide only
one perspective, that of an “outsider” (Yin, 2014).
Limitations: Electronic Data. One of the benefits of studying public institutions is the
public availability of data, especially electronic data. However, one of the drawbacks of

240

studying electronic data is its instability. For example, in the procedures section of Chapter 4, I
explained how the URL for The Internet Archive changed midstream during my data collection
process. The Web site for two of the libraries also changed. I had saved the URLs of documents
collected for my Document Collection Protocol, however those URLs were non-functional once
the Web sites changed. For the remainder of my data collection, I transformed each Web page
into a PDF document, but in many cases the previously identified documents were unable to be
recovered.
Limitations: Length of Time in the Field. By necessity, due to the distance of each of
the libraries under study from my home university, my limited financial resources, and lack of
ability to be away from my full-time job for extended periods of time, the length of time I spent
in the field was relatively brief. The rationale for the length of time in the field was explained in
Chapters 3 and 4. If I could have spent a longer time at each university, perhaps a week, I might
have been able to increase the depth of my observation data collection. I might also have been
able to increase the richness of my document collection by gaining extended access to the
library’s physical archives and reviewing historic artifacts.
Opportunities for Future Research
While this descriptive, multiple case study examined the ways in which four top-tier
academic research libraries adapted or changed their role over the past five years, it revealed
only one view of the full panorama of the evolution of academic libraries and their responses to a
barrage of institutional, environmental, and societal pressures. More research is necessary to
determine the impact of these four libraries’ activities, and to assess the perceptions of the
libraries’ various stakeholders. Future research is needed to understand whether these four
libraries may be the precursors of a national trend, or if they are exceptional cases or outliers.

241

The forces enacting upon and within academic research libraries are complex and intertwined,
and further studies are necessary to understand if the changes in the libraries in this study
represent the inception of a major evolutionary process.
For example, future studies might use this report as a springboard to examine the
situation at other top-tier academic research libraries in other U.S. states. Additional studies
might examine other types of academic libraries. Also, while this study focused only on the
academic libraries at public universities, future research might examine the situation at private
universities, baccalaureate institutions, community colleges, and other higher education
institutions. Future studies focused on gathering the perspectives of university administration,
students, or library staff other than the director would offer additional perspectives on the impact
of the changes in academic libraries. Additionally, the use of multiple researchers to collect the
data, rather than a single researcher, as in this case, might also provide a richer depth of data than
would be possible for a sole researcher. Further, deeper analysis of the backgrounds of the
library leaders themselves might explore connections between leadership styles and the pace of
change, and discover how or if leadership traits or skills influenced the ways in which the library
changed or adapted its role.
While the examples above take a macro perspective for future studies, there is also the
possibility of engaging in a micro examination of individual libraries’ experiences through
individual case studies, where the researcher’s time in the field could be extended. These studies
could provide more in-depth background of the activities in each of the frames, especially with
the addition of multiple perspectives from university administrators, students, faculty, and other
library staff. This picture would further clarify and document the experiences of academic
research libraries in the 21st century. These micro-studies might also be designed as

242

chronological or longitudinal studies, rather than case studies, to further illustrate a timeline of
changes and responses over a period of time.
Conclusion
This study grew from a seed planted by Wendy Lougee (2002, 2009). Lougee (2002,
2009) called for academic research libraries to become “diffuse libraries,” to move away from
their passive role as storehouses of information to more a more active role as strategic partners in
the academic enterprise of the university. The results of this study indicate these four libraries
more than fulfilled Lougee’s prediction. They adapted to changing environments and
strategically changed direction to, as Chapter 1 described: a) address severe financial cutbacks;
b) embrace new technologies; c) reorganize the organizational structure and retrain staff; c) find
ways to demonstrate effectiveness to meet new external and internal metrics; d) more closely
align their mission to their respective university’s overall institutional mission; e) explore and
meet rapidly changing user expectations; f) redesign their physical facilities; and g) reassess and
redesign their role within higher education (Association of College & Research Libraries
[ACRL], 2010; Brinley, 2012; Lowry 2010). Additionally, rather than making patchwork
changes in response to specific environmental stimuli, these libraries demonstrated engagement
in strategic changes across all four of the frames of Bolman and Deal’s (2013) theory of
reframing organizations.
Bolman and Deal (2013) explained organizations engage in reframing when their
“environment shifts” (p. 86), when “technology changes” (p. 86), when the “organization grows”
(p. 86), and/or when there is a transition in leadership (p. 86). Library A experienced all these
impacts simultaneously. The onset of the Great Recession caused a major environmental shift
for the library, resulting in the permanent loss of nearly three dozen professional positions and a

243

budget which remained nearly flat during the entire timeframe of this study. Library A
underwent a transition in leadership, both when the current dean took over in 2008 and when the
loss of so many staff positions as a result of the Great Recession left library employees in a
situation of uncertainty. Library A was forced to adapt to rapid technological changes when the
demand for electronic resources, multiple platforms to access those resources, and the use of
mobile technology became intrinsic in higher education as well as in general society – all areas
identified as emerging trends by The New Media Consortium’s 2012 Horizon Report (Johnson,
Adams, & Cummins, 2012). Finally, Library A experienced the conflicting forces of both
downsizing and growth as it lost nearly two-thirds of its staff and yet was asked to provide more
services and products to wider audiences across the university and cement its place in the
academic mission of the institution.
For Library B, the situation exemplified the difference between managing change and
“creating change” (Bolman & Deal, 2008, p. 310). Creating change involves leadership that
integrates all four frames (Bolman & Deal, 2008). “In other words, change agents fail when they
rely mostly on reason and structure while neglecting human, political, and symbolic elements”
(Bolman & Deal, 2008, p 394). Bolman and Deal (2008) explained creating change is “a
dynamic process moving through time, though not necessarily in a linear sequence” (p. 394).
Library B’s dean had experience leading change at the national level and therefore was wellprepared to take on the challenge of leading change at her library. She was the first woman and
the second librarian to serve as the Superintendent of Documents with the Government Printing
Office, where she successfully led one of the earliest transitions from print to electronic
resources. The university purposefully recruited her as a change agent for their library. Her
diverse background and wide-angle perspective of the issues affecting libraries nationwide

244

provided her with the ability to break the traditional frames of the university’s century-old library
and envision and enact creative solutions in all four frames.
Bolman and Deal (2008) revealed the successful management of “complex
organizations” requires “collective endeavors” (p. 7). In the case of Library C, prior to the
timeframe of this study, evidence indicated the library was a siloed organization within the
university, perceived negatively by faculty, underutilized by students, and with little involvement
in the governance or direction of the university as a whole. During the past five years of the
timeframe of this study, the dean transitioned the library’s role in the university in all four frames
into an active partner in the university’s academic enterprise, a vibrant resource for students, and
a central place for access to resources as well as university experiences. In this, the dean
exhibited characteristics of an “artistic manager…[able to] frame and reframe experience fluidly,
sometimes with extraordinary results” (Bolman & Deal, 2008, p. 13). She drew on her own
background as both an alumnus of the library’s parent university and a former employee of the
library, as well as her long experience working in various positions in diverse academic libraries,
to break frames and imagine new outcomes in all four frames for her historic organization.
Bolman and Deal (2008) explained the measure of effective leadership in all four frames
includes “analysis, design, support, empowerment, advocacy, coalition building, inspiration, and
meaning-making” (p. 356).
Bolman and Deal (2008) explained good leaders often rely on professional intuition
resulting from extensive experience and an ability to understand the environment. The evidence
from this study indicated the director of Library D was a leader of change within his library and
his university. The library’s proposal for the university’s QEP is just one example. However, in
keeping with the director’s role as a humble “servant-leader” (Bolman & Deal, 2013, p. 401), he

245

indicated the changes to his library over the past five years were more important collectively
than individually. He downplayed the manner in which his past extensive leadership experience
with diverse libraries, and service in a variety of professional positions, enabled him to recognize
the importance of moving his library forward in all four frames. The director of Library D
demonstrated an inherent capacity to see both the forest and the trees. In the early years of his
leadership of the library, he directed its forward momentum and growth. Following the Great
Recession, he engineered not only the library’s ability to survive extensive change, but also its
ability to adapt to its new environment and to become a driver of further change. Bolman and
Deal (2008) indicated there are few leaders who are able to successfully direct an organization’s
expansion as well as its down-sizing. Bolman and Deal (2008) explained “effective restructuring
requires both a fine-grained, microscopic assessment of typical problems and an overall,
topographical sense of structural options” (p. 97). The director of Library D demonstrated both
of these skills. Overall, the director employed an understanding of all four frames to improve the
library’s quality of services and products, reduce expenditures through creative strategies, and
increase the library’s intrinsic and implicit value to its parent university.
The guiding question for this research study asked, in summary, how the roles of four
academic research libraries have changed over the past five years. This question was inspired by
Lougee’s (2009) question: “How does a library conceive or re-conceive its role?” (p. 610).
Lougee (2002) explained “seizing opportunities for more diffuse roles will require investment in
both tangible components and in intangible elements such as leadership and organizational
development” (p. 22). Bolman and Deal’s theory of reframing organizations provided the
framework from which to view these elements in four discrete arrays: through the structural
frame, the human resource frame, the political frame, and the symbolic frame. In other words,

246

Bolman and Deal’s theory allowed this research study to systematically break apart a seemingly
chaotic process, then enabled the analysis of the activities within each of the four frames, and
subsequently provided the opportunity to reconnect all four parts into a cohesive whole which
provided a clear picture of the experience of change and change management within these four
organizations. The picture which emerged showed these libraries moving well beyond historic
boundaries, engaging in innovative practice, connecting with constituents and the academic
enterprise in far-reaching ways, envisioning new roles within the academic enterprise through
clearly defined mission statements and goals, actively partnering with their parent universities,
building services designed around faculty and student needs, and directing all these activities
strategically. The evidence from this study revealed these four libraries demonstrated
engagement in strategic changes across all four of the frames of Bolman and Deal’s (2013)
theory of reframing organizations to become innovative, agile, pro-active organizations closely
involved in the academic enterprise of their parent universities, and with a reimagined sense of
place, and purpose, as the symbolic heart of the campus. A clear understanding of the activities
of these four libraries in reframing their organizations may better inform the future evolution of
academic libraries in higher education.

APPENDIX A
TOP TRENDS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES 2010 – 2014

1

2

2010
Patron-driven Demand
for Change
Academic library
collection growth is
driven by patron demand
and will include new
resource types. (p. 286)

Budget Cutbacks
Budget challenges will
continue and libraries
will evolve as a result.
The proportion of state
budgets spent on public
colleges and the
proportion of college
budgets that come from
the state were already
declining, with the
recession exacerbating a
trend whereby state
spending on higher
education failed to keep
up with enrollment
growth and inflation. (p.
287)

2012
Communicating Value
Academic libraries must
prove the value they
provide to the academic
enterprise. (p. 311)

2014
Data:
New Initiatives and
Collaborative
Opportunities
Increased emphasis on open
data, dataplan management,
and "big data" research are
creating the impetus for
academic institutions from
colleges to research
universities to develop and
deploy new initiatives,
service units, and resources
to meet scholarly needs at
various stages of the research
process. (p. 294)
Data Curation
Data:
Data curation challenges
Cooperative Roles for
are increasing as standards Researchers, Repositories,
for all types of data
and Journal Publishers
continue to evolve; more
The discovery and re-use of
repositories, many of them small and large data sets
cloud-based, will emerge; require high-quality metadata
librarians and other
and curation, and libraries
information workers will

collaborate with their
provide this expertise. (pp.
research communities to
294-295)
facilitate this process. (p.
312)

263

Changing Role of the
Academic Librarian
Changes in higher
education will require
that librarians possess
diverse skill sets. A
recent OCLC report calls
for academic libraries to
“reassess all library job
descriptions and
qualifications to ensure
that training and hiring
encompass the skills,
education, and
experience needed to
support new modes of
research.” (p. 287)
Accountability
Demands for
accountability and
assessment will increase.
(p. 287)

Digital Preservation
As digital collections
mature, concerns grow
about the general lack of
long-term planning for
their preservation. No
strategic leadership for
establishing architecture,
policy, or standards for
creating, accessing, and
preserving digital content
is likely to emerge in the
near term. (p. 312)

Data:
Partnerships Related to
Discovery and Re-use of
Data
While this provides new
research opportunities, it
may also bring renewed
pressure on library budgets
to provide access to "big"
journal packages to support
these types of dataharvesting investigations. (p.
295)

Higher Education in
Transition
Higher education
institutions are entering a
period of flux, and
potentially even turmoil.
Trends to watch for are
the rise of online
instruction and degree
programs, globalization,
and an increased
skepticism of the “return
on investment” in a
college degree. Shifts in
the higher education
surround will have an
impact on libraries in
terms of expectations for
development of
collections, delivery of
collections and services
for both old and new
audiences, and in terms of
how libraries continue to
demonstrate value to
parent institutions. (p.
313)

Mobile Environments:
Device Neutral Digital
Services
It is no longer enough for
libraries and their partners to
design digital services for
only desktops or mobile
phones.
A solution growing in
popularity is responsive
design, which facilitates
having only one website that
automatically adapts to the
size of a visitor's screen. (p.
295)

264

5

Transition from Print
to Electronic Resources
Digitization of unique
library collections will
increase and require a
larger share of resources.
(p. 288)

6

Mobile Environments
Explosive growth of
mobile devices and
applications will drive
new services. (p. 288)

Information Technology
The key trends driving
educational technology
identified in the 2012
Horizon Report are
equally applicable to
academic libraries:
people’s desire for
information and access to
social media and networks
anytime/anywhere;
acceptance and adoption
of cloud-based
technologies; more value
placed on collaboration;
challenges to the role of
higher education in a
world where information
is ubiquitous and alternate
forms of credentialing are
available; new education
paradigms that include
online and hybrid
learning; (p. 313)
New publishing
paradigms, such as open
content, challenge the
library’s role as curator
and place libraries under
pressure to evolve new
ways of supporting and
curating scholarship. (p.
314)
Mobile Environments
Mobile devices are
changing the way
information is delivered
and accessed.(p. 314)
An increasing number of
libraries provide services
and content delivery to
mobile devices. (p. 314)

265

Open Access
There continue to be
significant efforts to support
and incentivize open access
to research and to the
benefits of higher education
more generally. (p. 295)
Following the National
Institutes of Health and
National Science Foundation
mandates for open access to
research, there is further
emphasis on national
legislative and executive
activity to promote open
access to taxpayer-funded
research outputs, including
data, articles, and
educational resources. (p.
296)

Open Education
In addition to supporting
payment or reimbursement
for open access publishing
fees, academic libraries are
beginning to provide
financial support for and
promotion of open
educational resources
(OERs). (p. 296)

7

Collaboration
Increased collaboration
will expand the role of
the library within the
institution and beyond.
(p. 288)

Patron Driven E-book
Acquisition
Patron-Driven Acquisition
(PDA) of e-books is
poised to become the
norm. (p. 314)
A report on the future of
academic libraries
identifies PDA as an
inevitable trend for
libraries under pressure to
prove that their
expenditures are in line
with their value. It notes
that academic libraries
will jettison “large
collections of physical
books in open stacks with
low circulation,” in favor
of licensing agreements
with e-book vendors that
will enable libraries to
purchase only those books
that are in high demand.
Although PDA is partly
about efficiencies, it also
is about aligning a
library’s offerings with
the demonstrated needs of
its constituencies. (p. 314)

Student Success and
Assessment
An emphasis on student
success outcomes and
educational accountability by
states, accrediting bodies,
and individual institutions, as
well as a shift in some states
from public higher education
funding based on enrollment
to funding based on
outcomes, such as retention
and completion, have
implications for academic
libraries. These changes in
the higher education
environment necessitate that
libraries engage across the
institution to contribute
broadly to student success as
well as articulate and
demonstrate their impact
through assessment.

8

Scholarly
Communication
Libraries will continue
to lead efforts to develop
scholarly
communication and
intellectual property
services. (p. 289)

Scholarly
Communication
New scholarly
communication and
publishing models are
developing at an everfaster pace, requiring
libraries to be actively
involved or be left
behind.(p. 315)

Demonstrating Value
The increased focus on
outcomes (e.g., student
learning, retention,
persistence, and completion)
over inputs (e.g.,
enrollment,) and the ongoing
emphasis on demonstrating
these outcomes, will have an
impact on academic libraries
going forward. (p. 297)

266

9

Impact of Continuing
Changes in Technology
Technology will
continue to change
services and required
skills. (p. 289)

10

Redefining the Role of
the Library
The definition of the
library will change as
physical space is
repurposed and virtual
space expands. (p. 289)

Staffing
Academic libraries must
develop the staff needed
to meet new challenges
through creative
approaches to hiring new
personnel and
deploying/retraining
existing staff. (p.315)
Continuing education,
professional development,
strategic and creative
approaches to hiring for
vacant or new positions,
retooling existing
positions, and retraining
the staff currently in those
positions are some of the
ways libraries can “grow”
the staff they need.
(p.316)
User Behaviors and
Expectations
Not only is immediate
access to electronic
sources a critical
component of meeting the
information needs of
students and faculty, but
access to human sources
also is important.(p. 316)
Librarians, too, are
making themselves
available to students and
faculty through a number
of channels, including
social media, chat, IM,
and text reference, as well
as making themselves
physically available or
embedded within
academic departments,
student unions, and
cafeterias. (p. 316)

Altmetrics
The expanding digital
environment drives changes
in the criteria for measuring
the impact of research and
scholarship. As the web
matures and the researchers'
works are referred to or
published on the web, it is
important to have a method
for tracking the impact of
their work in these new
media, Altmetrics, short for
alternative metrics, is a
quickly developing
methodology for measuring
the impact of scholarly
works and research
published on the web. (p.
298)
Digital Humanities
DH (digital humanities) can
be understood as the place
where traditional humanities
research methodologies and
media/digital technologies
intersect. Academic libraries
can play a key role in
supporting humanities
faculty in their research by
creating partnerships and
collaborations and helping to
connect with other campus
units needed to implement
and carry out digital
humanities research. (p. 299)

APPENDIX D
E-MAIL REQUESTING INTERVIEW
From:
Sent:
To:
Subject: Request for Interview from USF Doctoral Student Recommended by Dean
____________

Dear Dean ____________,
Good morning! My name is Victoria Stuart, and I am contacting you at the
recommendation of Dean ___________ at USF. He has let me know that you would be willing to
be interviewed for my dissertation. I would be very grateful for your time and participation.
The interview would only take an hour, scheduled at your convenience, in your office, or
a location of your choice. I plan to visit your campus on the day of our appointment, and also
explore your library.
To give you a brief background about myself, I am currently a doctoral student at USF,
embarking on my dissertation. I earned my MLIS in Library and Information Science, and my
doctorate is focused on higher education administration. My dissertation combines both these
interests.
Just about five years ago, the CLIR report, No Brief Candle, and other articles, such as
Wendy Lougee’s call for “diffuse libraries,” identified an urgent need for strategic change in
academic libraries. I plan to do a multiple case study of four academic research libraries to
document their changes over the past five years, from the perceptions of the library directors.
(continued)
276

If you are still willing to allow me to interview you, please let me know a convenient
time for the appointment. I will send you my initial questions by e-mail two weeks prior to our
interview, but since my study will be qualitative, our conversation may evolve beyond these
guiding questions. Depending on our conversation, I may also request a follow-up interview by
phone, a few weeks after our initial appointment.
The interview will be audio-recorded, and professionally transcribed, and I will send you
a copy of the transcription for your review, in order to catch any errors or inconsistencies.
If you decide to do the interview, please let me know if I may have your permission to
share your name with my professor, or if you would prefer complete anonymity. I will also send
you a draft copy of the transcription for you to review, as well as a final copy.
I am so delighted that Dean __________ recommended you and your library! I very
much look forward to speaking with you! Please feel free to call me or e-mail me, at your
preference.

Sincerely,

Victoria Stuart

Information to Consider Before Taking Part in this Research Study
IRB Study # _Pro00021541_
You are being asked to take part in a research study. Research studies include only people who
choose to take part. This document is called an informed consent form. Please read this
information carefully and take your time making your decision. Ask the researcher or study staff
to discuss this consent form with you, please ask him/her to explain any words or information
you do not clearly understand. We encourage you to talk with your family and friends before you
decide to take part in this research study. The nature of the study, risks, inconveniences,
discomforts, and other important information about the study are listed below.
We are asking you to take part in a research study called:
Reframing the Academic Research Library in the U.S.: Perceptions of Change from
Library Leaders
The person who is in charge of this research study is Victoria Stuart. This person is called the
Principal Investigator. However, other research staff may be involved and can act on behalf of
the person in charge. She is being guided in this research by Dr. Kathleen King, USF College of
Education.
The research will be conducted at USF, but your interview will occur in your own campus’ mail
academic library or your own office, whichever is most convenient for you.

278

Purpose of the study
The purpose of this study is to: to document changes in university academic libraries over the
past five years to identify transformational changes and strategic administrative strategies to
manage those changes.
This research is being conducted by a doctoral candidate for her dissertation.

Why are you being asked to take part?
We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are the dean/director of one of
the academic libraries selected for the study, and may have experienced these changes firsthand.
The libraries were selected because they are the top four public doctoral research universities in
Florida identified by the Carnegie Classification RU/VH.

Study Procedures: What will happen during this study?
If you take part in this study, you will be asked to: participate in two short interviews with the
researcher. The list of interview questions will be sent to you via e-mail prior to the interview.
The procedure of the research involves asking you about your perceptions of the changes in your
university’s academic library over the past five years (2010-2014) and the administrative
strategies employed to manage those changes. There will be two interviews: the first interview
will occur in person, in your office or wherever it is most convenient for you, and will last one
hour. The second, follow-up interview will be conducted by phone, and will last approximately 1
hour or less. This second interview will be to enable you to provide clarification or additional
detail to your responses to the initial interview.
These interviews will be digitally audio recorded, with your permission, and professionally
transcribed. You will be able to review the transcripts of both interviews and make
changes/corrections. These files will be kept on a private password-protected drive for five years.
Only the research team will have access to these files during this time. At the end of five years,
the digital files will be permanently deleted, and the paper transcripts will be shredded.

Total Number of Participants
About 1 individual will take part in this study at USF. A total of 4 individuals will participate in
the study at all sites.

Any occasion when the
library dean indicated
engaging in a purposeful (not
necessarily formal) plan of

Library Science)
Any occasion indicating the

experience with technology
or in technical services.
Any occasion when the
budget was mentioned.

From Northwestern I moved to
Stanford University.

Any occasion in which the
library is a participant in or

collections and services should be a
central element of the campaign.

So the commitment was to try to
come up with a better solution this
year that would give us some
reccurring funds.

Any occasion when the
library demonstrated or
attempted to demonstrate
ROI or implicit or intrinsic
value to the university.

They know what it is we're doing

So the way this kind of works is we
will work with a publisher and say
"Okay, give us your e-books."

A
So if you use the catalog, you find
one of these, you don't know that
we don't own it, so you click
through, you get access to it, and
then the publisher will basically say
"Okay, so now that's bought.
You've now bought this because it
was used."

We not only need information
literacy, we need digital media
literacy. How are they going to get
that when they don't have a place to
learn it? So that's where we jumped
in.

A
For far too long, libraries have been
reactive rather than proactive. And
as much as I can do it, I try to be
proactive.
A
The provost who was then in place
who was the one who actually hired
me had contracted a sort of an elite

when they go out, they've got more
marketable skills.

What I'm going to say comes from
some focus groups that we've done
with students.

Bolman & Deal's definition
of the causes of
environmental shifts.

So from '08 to '11, the library lost
35 positions, just gone, which
amounted to way over a milliondollar budget cut

Any occasion when the
budget was mentioned, in the
context of an environmental
shift.

At least initially the library did not
receive direct dollar cuts.

A
So now the students, the general
student body can come here. You

video camera. We'll show them
how to use the audio equipment.

Dean: And so the other
thing that happened along
with that was that it
forced us to really look at
every single thing we
were doing from top to
bottom. Do we need to do
this? Are we doing this in
the most efficient and
effective way? How are
we going to continue to
move forward? How are
we going to just make it
work so that we're doing
things as efficiently and
effectively as we can?
