ABSTRACT
Examination of developments in technology, access, and policy reveals that American
librarianship and the wider system of information provision underwent profound and farreaching changes—a transformation—during the 1930s. With regard to technology, the 1930s
saw the widespread adoption of microfilm, heralded by its advocates as a revolutionary tool that
would transform information preservation and dissemination. The number of outlets for library
services increased markedly as information was brought to more people, often in creative ways,
and on an enlarged scale. Finally, policymaking for libraries, and information provision more
broadly, assumed greater prominence. New federal agencies were established, new statistical
series offered, and existing information programs were expanded.
Librarianship has a long history of critical engagement in times of crisis. Using archival,
primary, and secondary sources, I examine the 1930s using the system of information provision
as a lens. While the 1930s’ US has been well-traversed by many scholars, no one has
foregrounded the system of information provision as a site of transformation. I consider the
system in its entirety, using technology, access, and policy as the key vectors of evidence of this
transformation. The role of librarians is consistently foregrounded. Many librarians of the 1930s
eagerly embraced visionary approaches with regard to imagining the future of libraries, and they
were not afraid to act boldly on a range of economic, political, and cultural issues.
“Transformation” alludes to different things depending on the context: sometimes it
meant redefinition, sometimes it meant expansion, and sometimes a bit of both. The “system of
information provision” includes but is not limited to librarianship. Although deeply concerned
with the pursuits of libraries and librarians, my dissertation research reveals how library work
intersected with that of historians, archivists, documentalists, and with other activities involving

ii

access to and preservation of information resources. “Information provision” is intended to
gesture at this wider range of associated precepts and practices.
Historians make some room for the 1930s, but leave pressing questions: what were the
relationships between changes in technology, access, and policy in librarianship during the
1930s; and how were librarians agents in this overall process? This dissertation is an attempt to
engage directly with these questions.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I could not have completed this dissertation without the considerable support of family
members, friends, and colleagues. There were many times when I felt unable to see this task
through, and I am profoundly grateful to everyone who helped me along the way.
I entered the Graduate School of Library and Information Science in the fall of 2006 with
the sole intention of earning a master’s degree, yet here I sit on the other side of a dissertation. I
had the good fortune of working with Dan Schiller throughout. Were I to describe all the ways
that Dan excels at his job as a scholar—as a researcher, writer, instructor, and mentor—I would
not have room for anyone else in the acknowledgments. We need more scholars of Dan’s caliber
in higher education.
My committee members Alistair Black, Christine Jenkins, and Joanne Passet are all
formidable scholars whose research on the history of libraries and information has inspired and
enhanced my work. I am thankful for their invaluable feedback and support.
I am also grateful for the support of current and former GSLIS faculty, particularly
Pauline Cochrane, Leigh Estabrook, Bonnie Mak, Kate McDowell, Rae-Anne Montague, and
Linda Smith. The GSLIS support staff are essential to the School’s success, and were of great
help to me. I especially want to thank Penny Ames, Sally Eakin, Candy Edwards, Linda Meccoli,
Kathy Painter, and Julie Smith.
I am very grateful for the generous financial support I received from GSLIS, including
travel awards for research and conference attendance. I am honored to count myself amongst the
inaugural cohort of the Information in Society specialization, funding for which came from the
Institute of Museum and Library Services.
I would like to thank the many librarians and archivists I have worked with throughout

v

the course of this project, including those at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the
Library of Congress, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, the National
Agricultural Library, and the National Archives. They made the research process infinitely more
manageable and enjoyable.
The doctoral dissertations of GSLIS alumnae Ellen Knutson, Joyce Latham, and Cindy
Welch were instrumental in helping me model my dissertation. I also wish to thank Lucy
Moynihan for sharing her seminar paper with me about 1930s’ libraries.
I am grateful to and for the Graduate Employees Organization, the union for graduate
employees at the University of Illinois. Having a union has made a positive difference in my life
and the lives of thousands of other graduate students. Solidarity forever!
To Carol Baxter, Laurie Gilbert, and Lisa Haake: thank you for helping me keep my
spirits up. To the baristas of Espresso Royale (especially at Sixth and Daniel) and Café Kopi:
you helped me keep my momentum going. One of Champaign-Urbana’s finest features is the Art
Theater, as of this writing the only cooperatively owned movie theater in the country. Many
thanks to Austin McCann for keeping the marquee bright, and interesting.
I am lucky to have a vast network of friends. Some of you I see regularly, others far less
than I like. Much gratitude to Julie “Dog” Adamo, Julie Allen, Doris Andrechak, Abby
Anzalone, Dan Bassett, Emilie Bess, Beth Blauer, Doris Bonnett, Patrick Brennan, Christina

I am grateful to my mother Mary Nappo, my sister Meaghan Nappo, my brother Vinnie
Nappo, and my future sister-in-law Jo Heinan. During graduate school I became an aunt twice
over thanks to Jo and Vinnie, and my twin nephews Adrian and Jackson are purely delightful.
My father Frank was a great source of intellectual inspiration whom I miss every day. My
unfailingly sweet dog, Samson, has been my beloved companion for nearly a decade. I am also
grateful for the love and support of my many aunts, uncles, and cousins in the McDonald and
Nappo families. Alla famiglia!
Tim Hayden: I love you. Thank you for your love, positivity, culinary dynamism, and
being Pure Michigan. You’re number one, baby. I am so excited to see where we go next.
Finally, the dedication page reads “For Joe Cali.” Joseph John Cali was a long-time
librarian at Antioch College, working there for 50+ years until his death in 2007; Joe literally
worked for the library until the day he died. His passion for librarianship and the humanities
inspired generations of Antiochians to become librarians themselves, or at least to engage more
deeply with libraries and librarians. I attended a special memorial service held by the College
shortly after he died, and his sister closed the eulogy by saying: “My brother’s life was not a life
of the headlines. His was a life of the heart.” Joe, here is to living a life of the heart.

CHAPTER ONE:
INTRODUCTION
Background
In June 2014, library and information science made the Forbes list of the “worst master’s
degrees for jobs.”1 This assessment is based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where
projected job growth for librarians is 7.4%, whereas job growth for all occupations averages
10.8%.2 With the national unemployment rate at 5.9% in September, 2014, economic conditions
are looking up somewhat, especially when compared to three years ago when the national
unemployment rate was at 10%.3 In essence, the Forbes piece and the BLS statistics tell us that
job growth is slow, and even slower for would-be librarians. Not entirely surprising, considering
the economy is in a deep recession—the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In
October 2014, a study published by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman found that
the wealth held by the top 0.1% is almost as high as 1929 levels.4
Meanwhile, in addition to sluggish job growth, librarianship also faces charges of
irrelevancy. As more information migrates online or is born digital, with the proliferation of
online technologies in the form of handheld devices and personal computers, and the growth of
information technology giants such as Google and Apple, many ask: when everything is online
and we can find information ourselves anytime, why do we need libraries and librarians?

Sluggish job growth combined with the growth of information technologies have also
prompted many to ask why public dollars should be spent on libraries. This comes amid an
ongoing dismantling of public services.5 Perhaps we live in a digital age, but more importantly
we live in a neoliberal age, where deregulated or unregulated market forces are deemed to be the
most efficient arbiter of economic productivity. Why fund public library services when people do
not need them? According to the logic of neoliberalism, why fund public library services when
the private sector can provide better services at reduced costs?
This dissertation looks at major changes in technology, access, and policy that
characterized American librarianship during the 1930s in order to demonstrate the importance of
library services amid an economic crisis. With the United States in the worst economic slump
since the 1930s, it becomes all the more important to reexamine this period. The current
prevailing attitude toward economic recovery—that it is best achieved by incentivizing the
private sector—is one alarmingly similar to that of the 1920s. The 1930s was a significant
moment in American history, for it saw a unique and innovative response to economic crisis—
the New Deal. The creation of new government agencies in the 1930s, meant to curb the
excesses of the previous decade that were blamed as the cause of the Depression, helped usher in
an unprecedented expansion of the federal government into public life.
To say that the whole of society and all social structures underwent a transformation in
the 1930s is not an overstatement. Economic, political, and cultural life were all changed by the
events of the 1930s, first by sharp economic decline and then by reinvigoration thanks to the
New Deal. That American society was transformed by the events of the 1930s is not a new
observation, and indeed many scholars have described in thorough detail how political,

Public Philosophy (Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited, 2003).

economic, and cultural life were reshaped. This is evident in a number of works on varied
aspects of the period including Lizabeth Cohen’s Making a New Deal and Robert Zieger’s CIO;
in Nick Taylor’s American-Made and Frank Freidel’s Franklin D. Roosevelt; in Robert
McElvaine’s The Great Depression and Alan Brinkley’s The End of Reform; and especially in
Michael Denning’s The Cultural Front.6
Alongside the creation of new agencies such as the Social Security Administration
(SSA), the New Deal also created more than 8 million jobs through its various relief agencies,
the largest being the Works Progress Administration (WPA).7 New jobs were created by
practicing deficit spending: borrowing large amounts of money against the Treasury. Using this
money to create jobs, the idea was that job creation would stimulate consumer spending, which
would revive the economy. It was not left to the private sector to turn around the economy, the
government attempted this, in collaboration with communities nationwide.
A literature review of what has been written on the history of librarians in the 1930s can
be found in this chapter and the next. While the events of the 1930s’ United States are welldocumented, we do not have a full account of the contributions of librarians. This is imperative
because librarians and information workers are an important part of the recovery story. This
dissertation aims to reveal the vital contributions of librarians in the response to economic crisis
in the 1930s; it attempts to emphasize the importance of libraries in economic crisis. The
literature in the history of librarianship and that of cultural history lacks a unified account of the

many inventive and innovative activities of the profession in the 1930s. A close investigation of
primary sources coupled with analysis of secondary sources allows us to elucidate profound and
concurrent changes around technology, access, and policy. The 1930s was one of the direst
periods economically; yet as historians Michael Denning and others have shown, it was also a
time of exciting, dynamic cultural production. I mean to show how libraries and the system of
information provision were central parts of this process.
With regard to technology, the 1930s saw the widespread adoption of microfilm, heralded
by its advocates as a revolutionary tool that would transform information preservation and
dissemination. At the 1939 meeting of the International Federation for Information and
Documentation, Arthur Berthold declared that “the development of union catalogues is closely
connected with the present economic crisis... the successful application of micro-photography
has simplified the compilation of union catalogues to such an extent that this method is now the
unchallenged basis for all union catalogues work to be under-taken in the immediate future.”8
Microfilm also interlocked with other significant advances in the automation of document
retrieval.9
The number of outlets for library services increased markedly as information was brought
to more people, often in creative ways, and on an enlarged scale. Packhorse libraries expanded
services to rural users while “open-air” libraries in public parks enhanced access for urban
users.10 Finally, policymaking for libraries, and information provision more broadly, assumed

greater prominence. New federal agencies were established, new statistical series offered, and
existing information programs were expanded. The long-planned National Archives and Records
Administration became a reality and state appropriations steadily increased during the Great
Depression, while the American Library Association initiated its campaign for permanent federal
support.11
Some historians have already flagged the 1930s as an important decade with regard to
activities around information provision. Kathleen Molz has written extensively on policy work in
1930s libraries, and has rightly claimed that the 1930s was a decisive decade in the advancement
of library policy.12 A special issue of Libraries and the Cultural Record published in 2011 gives
attention to libraries in the Depression.13 Historians such as Stuart Leslie and Irene Farkas-Conn
have described the development of information technology in the 1930s.14
The most common theme in library history studies of the 1930s is the involvement of
libraries and librarians, particularly women, in WPA efforts. Donald Boyd’s article on pack
horse libraries and Mary Mallory’s biographical article on Tennessee Valley Authority's librarian
Mary Utopia Rothrock describe some of the creative efforts to expand services for rural users.15
The essays in Daniel Ring's 1982 edited volume describe WPA projects in several rural and
urban areas.16 Martha Swain has published both broad and specific treatments on this topic, the

latter being her biography of WPA director of women's programs Ellen Woodward; as library
work was initially classified under the women's program, Woodward oversaw several WPA
library endeavors.17 Jane Pejsa's biography of Gratia Countryman chronicles the life and career
of the director of the Minneapolis Public Library who also served as an ALA president in the
1930s.18 Like her contemporary Mary U. Rothrock, Countryman was also a passionate advocate
for WPA programs in libraries and argued in favor of national library planning. While aspects of
policymaking for libraries emerge from time to time in these histories of libraries and the WPA,
one must look elsewhere for more details on policy work by and for libraries.
A combination of description and analysis can be found in some contemporary library
histories on the relationship between librarianship and the Great Depression. Margaret Herdman
published such a statistical study in 1943, and Edward Stanford's doctoral dissertation from the
University of Chicago's Graduate Library School (published as a book in 1944) broadly surveyed
the topic.19 In addition to being some of the earliest research on 1930s’ US librarianship, these
works are valuable starting points for several reasons. Both works present copious references to
statistics on library services, usage, and funding. They also provide extensive descriptive
sections of these aspects and offer some analysis. Although not an historical piece, the 1932
study “The Public Library and Depression” published in The Library Quarterly also is
significant as a primary source — it provides useful contemporary data and also suggests that

scholars attempted to draw meaningful connections between librarianship and the Depression
very early on.20
Although scholars have explored some of these changes in a piecemeal way, much more
can be said about the depth and breadth of these initiatives. My dissertation undertakes the task
of more fully describing this transformation and analyzing its impact, relating it to broader
currents of American history, and serves to augment the work already done in the history of
library and information science by examining some little-known but vital and formative activities
of the period.
In describing the expansion of cultural programs in the 1930s, Michael Denning and
others have shown that the decade witnessed not only social upheaval, but also unique and
vibrant cultural production and social change.21 The system of information provision likewise
became more dynamic in the 1930s, yet the LIS literature lacks a unified account of the many
inventive and innovative activities that occurred around technology, access, and policy. Without
a more comprehensive treatment, we cannot sufficiently appreciate the extent to which the 1930s
constituted a watershed in American information history. The creation of new information
services, expansion of existing services, and the growing consensus that local services required
reliable, federal support are all vectors of this transformation.
“Transformation” alludes to different things depending on the context: sometimes it
meant redefinition, sometimes it meant expansion, and sometimes a bit of both. The “system of
information provision” includes but is not limited to librarianship. Although deeply concerned
with the pursuits of libraries and librarians, my dissertation research reveals how library work

intersected with that of historians, archivists, documentalists, and with other activities involving
access to and preservation of information resources. “Information provision” is intended to
gesture at this wider range of associated precepts and practices.
What evidence do we have that such a wide-ranging transformation occurred during the
1930s? Part of it lies in the pronounced expansion that occurred around the collection of
statistical data for policymaking. Some of the statistical indicators were established prior to the
Great Depression, such as the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the decennial collection
of Census data. Yet the establishment of new programs suggests a fresh awareness of which type
of information was collected and how. For example, census data underwent modification in
response to the Great Depression, with questions about unemployment first asked for the 1940
census. Likewise, we see evidence of the transformation in the collection of new categories
devoted to economic information. To understand and combat the economic crisis, policymakers
began to institute new information generating and analyzing programs both to prevent a
recurrence and to stabilize the economy.22
Transformation is also clearly evident in the expansion of the librarian workforce during
this period. Denning notes that librarians formed one of two occupational categories that almost
quadrupled between 1920 and 1950 (the other was college professors). While the workforce as a
whole during this thirty-year period grew by 40 percent, from 42 million to 59 million, the

number of librarians grew by 280 percent, from 15,000 to 57,000.23 Edward Stanford’s study on
libraries in the Depression showed a 1021.7% increase in the number of library assistants and
attendants between 1930 and 1940.24 These disproportionate increases on their own warrant
closer investigation.
In this dissertation I look at the 1930s using the system of information provision as a lens.
While the 1930s’ US has been well-traversed by many scholars, no one has foregrounded the
system of information provision as a site of transformation, as a pivotal area. I am considering
the system of information provision in its entirety, using technology, access, and policy as the
key vectors of evidence of this transformation. Histories of the system of information provision
have typically explored these aspects in isolation from one another. Even more curiously, many
histories of technology, access, or policy in the 1930s have sidestepped the role of information
provision in economic crisis.
I am personally interested in telling this story because I wish to counter some of the
contemporary rhetoric about libraries and crisis. A cursory glance at the professional literature
reveals the perspective that librarians are too risk-averse, reluctant to adapt to the changes
wrought by life in the so-called information age. I am wary of making generalizations about
librarians in the twenty-first century. However, many librarians of the 1930s eagerly embraced
visionary approaches with regard to technological possibilities in the future of libraries. They
were certainly not afraid to act boldly on a range of economic, political, and cultural issues.

Denning, The Cultural Front, 49. Denning writes in the notes on pages 505-06 that he arrived at these figures by
calculating numbers published in Historical Statistics of the United States Colonial Times to 1957, “Detailed
Occupations of the Economically Active Population: 1900-1950”, Series D 123-572. I consulted the same tables,
and confirmed that in 1920, there were 15,000 librarians; in 1930, there were 30,000; in 1940, there were 39,000;
and in 1950 there were 57,000. In the source notes for Historical Statistics, David L. Kaplan and M. Claire Casey’s

Librarianship has a long history of critical engagement in times of crisis.
Methodology and Sources
A close investigation of some under-used historical records may enhance our
understanding of how and why information activities of the 1930s unfolded as they did. As an
historical project, my dissertation involved intensive examination of primary sources, including
several archival collections. Using these primary sources, I discuss the motivations of key
actors—to ascertain not only why they thought information organization, access, and policy
warranted more robust support, but what considerations influenced their strategies. In cases
where motivations are unclear, I describe what happened and put those actions in the context of
historical scholarship on the New Deal, the Great Depression, and library and information
science.
In the broadest sense, historical research entails looking at records with the aim of
illuminating the past. While this may sound like a fairly mundane practice, historical research is
not a neutral endeavor. In the most recent edition of The Pursuit of History, John Tosh writes
that “how the past is known and how it is applied to present need are open to widely varying
approaches.”25 As with all historical research, my own project incorporates those approaches
which I find most compelling and useful. Michael Denning's landmark work on cultural
production in the 1930s, The Cultural Front, is one benchmark, one used already by Joyce
Latham to clarify changes in contemporary library principle and practice.26 Denning's work
informs how I examine and interpret the available sources, in particular his definition of the
cultural apparatus. Drawing on sociologist C. Wright Mills, Denning describes the cultural

apparatus as “the organizations... in which artistic, intellectual and scientific work goes on, and
of the means by which such work is made available to circles, publics, and masses.”27 This
definition is consonant with the approaches advocated by some historians of library and
information science such as Alistair Black, Michael Harris, Joyce Latham, and Wayne Wiegand,
who might agree that there is a relationship between information provision and the cultural
apparatus, and that libraries are part of this relationship.28 The nature of the relationship between
the Cultural Front and information provision largely remains to be determined, but we may assert
on the basis of Latham's work at the very least that this connection exists. This relationship may
or may not turn out to be the fundamental point of the dissertation, but it is valuable in looking
for traces of the strong reformist impulse that motivated the Cultural Front in the changing
system of information provision. As Joanne Passet has noted, a reformist impulse has long been
part of librarianship.29
My approach to historical research is also informed by scholarship in the political
economy of information. In How to Think About Information, Dan Schiller argues for a political
economy of information because “information itself is conditioned and structured by the social
institutions and relations in which it is embedded.”30 At the most basic level, I wish to clarify the
relationship between dollars expended and the initiatives around technology, access, and policy.
Besides entreating us to observe where the money goes, political economy also invites us to

think about the ways in which economic decisions—amounts expended, who participates in
determining what money goes where, who benefits from the outcomes—shape social life.
Vincent Mosco writes that “one can think about political economy as the study of the social
relations, particularly the power relations, that mutually constitute the production, distribution,
and consumption of resources.”31 Political economy is a useful method “because it asks us to
concentrate on a specific set of social relations organized around power or the ability to control
other people, processes, and things, even in the face of resistance. This would lead the political
economist of communication to look at shifting forms of control along the circuit of production,
distribution, and consumption.” Although Mosco refers here to the political economy of
communication, his definition has obvious relevance for library and information science. One
can also see this relationship between political economy, communication, and information in the
work of Herbert Schiller, who wrote that “the generation and provision of information and
entertainment, and the technology that makes it possible, are among the most dynamic elements
of the economy. How these are put together profoundly affects the character of the national
information condition.”32 It would be impossible to look at the system of information provision
during the New Deal without considering the negotiation of economic power.
This dissertation is an historical study and as such draws from numerous archival sources.
I consulted the American Library Association Archives and the Graduate School of Library and
Information Science Archives, conveniently located at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign. I also had the pleasure of consulting four collections in the Washington, D.C. area.

the Joint Committee on Materials for Research. The National Agricultural Library Archives are
located in Beltsville, Maryland. Finally, I spent several days with the Works Progress
Administration papers at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. These collections
contained letters, manuals, meeting minutes, memoranda, reports, press releases, and news
clippings. The archival sources I used are not wanting for consultation—they have been used by
other scholars, many of whom I have cited in this dissertation. What I have done is re-examine
these sources with an eye to inter-relatedness of people and institutions involved overarching
changes around information technology, access, and policy.
I also used primary sources published in the 1930s and 1940s, including books,
periodicals, and pamphlets. ALA publications of the period were helpful, as were articles from
professional and scholarly literature including Library Journal and The Library Quarterly.
Dissertations and reports published in the 1930s and 1940s were also valuable primary sources.
All of these non-archival primary sources were accessible through the University Library at
Illinois, some digitized and most in print. Finally, I consulted dozens of secondary sources, some
of which have already been referenced in the introduction. The many books, reports, web sites,
and dissertations about the 1930s were key for gaining a better understanding of not only the
events of the period, but the prior causes that led to the Great Depression. Secondary sources
were also helpful for seeing some approaches to studying the 1930s and the sources used.
Government web sources such as the Consumer Price Index’s Inflation Calculator also came in
handy—I appreciated being able to use a decidedly twenty-first century tool for historical
analysis.

Organization
In this dissertation I explain why it is important to devote further study to the programs of
this period. I review the relevant literature on librarianship and library-related information
agencies in the 1930s, as well as key works on the Great Depression, the New Deal, and the
WPA. Substantial gaps in knowledge are identified and assessed. Using my research questions as
guiding themes, I have organized my dissertation around the transformation of technology,
access, and policy in the US system of information provision.
In Chapter Two, The System of Information Provision in the 1930s’ United States, I
introduce transformation, information provision, technology, access, and policy as key terms and
explicate meaning and context. The literature review will show synthesis of secondary sources
on a broad range of areas, including US librarianship in the system of information provision. I
address the relationship between the events of the 1930s and the system of information
provision, some of the overall changes around technology, access, and policy, and the political
economic conditions which enabled these changes. Specifically, I will explore what we miss
about the history of the 1930s without including information provision, and what we miss about
the history of information provision without paying attention to the 1930s. This chapter will
provide the rationale for why librarianship needs to be addressed as a more important piece in the
system of information provision, by identifying how librarians simultaneously engaged with
technology, access, and policy.
Chapter Three, Technology and the System of Information Provision, focuses on
technology-related changes in the system of information provision. Although I pay particular
attention to microfilm, I will also look at other technological advances in data processing and
information retrieval, such as human computers and tabulating machines. I show that librarians

14

were eager to adopt microfilm, and for a wide range of purposes beyond enhancing access to
scientific information. I also highlight the ways in which cooperation amongst a range of actors
made these activities possible. I address the ways developments in information technology
affected the system of information provision, the extent to which New Deal librarianship
reorganized around information technology, and how information technology was applied for
purposes including but not limited to the organization, preservation, and dissemination of
scientific information.
In Chapter Four, Access and the System of Information Provision, I look at how efforts to
enhance to the standard of living and expand the notion of social welfare related to improving
information access. Expansion of access manifested in numerous aspects of librarianship,
including services for schools, rural areas, and African Americans. I describe how the American
Library Association’s commitment to the expansion of access related to broader shifts in
thinking about information access. Namely, the severity of the Great Depression led to a
deepened appreciation for the importance of having publicly-supported access to timely and
accurate information. I look at the ways expansion of access affected the system of information
provision, address how there could be expansion of access in the midst of the Great Depression,
and describe other agencies and institutions besides libraries that prioritized expansion of
information access.
Chapter Five, Policy and the System of Information Provision, looks at the ways in which
information policy was newly visible and effectual in the 1930s. Attention to policy is evident in
the government initiatives and ALA activity, particularly in the ALA’s campaign for permanent
federal funding for libraries. I describe examples of how the Roosevelt Administration
prioritized the collection, dissemination, and preservation of information. I also look at how

15

ALA campaigned for federal and state funding for libraries, and the ways in which ALA
cooperated with the federal government in New Deal programs. I describe the ways in which
librarians and other information professionals engaged in policymaking, expenditures for library
projects, and why information policy was prioritized in the 1930s. Evidence that the system of
information provision underwent a transformation lies in how government leaders, scholars, and
practitioners reprioritized or more vigorously prioritized activities related to the generation,
collection, organization, dissemination and preservation of information.
In the conclusion, I summarize the evidence from primary and secondary sources and
show how changes in technology, access, and policy in the 1930s’ United States transformed
librarianship and the system of information provision. The conclusion will also discuss the
implications of my findings and avenues for future research.

CHAPTER TWO:
THE SYSTEM OF INFORMATION PROVISION IN THE 1930s’ UNITED STATES

Introduction
In this chapter, I examine the overall status of the US system of information provision in
the 1930s and broadly sketch the changes that occurred around technology, access, and policy in
libraries.1 Here I will engage with research questions on the relationship between the history of
the 1930s and the system of information provision, and how these activities were significant.
Specifically, I will explore what we miss about the history of the 1930s without including
information provision, and what we miss about the history of information provision without
paying attention to the 1930s. The background provided in this chapter provides a basis with
which to investigate issues around technology, access, and policy more closely in the subsequent
chapters. Sometimes information provision is considered broadly, but libraries are at the center
of this history. “Information provision” is a term meant to capture the wider range of associated
precepts and practices related to the systematic generation, collection, organization, dissemination,
and preservation of documentary and scientific records.2

I elaborate on the “system of information provision” providing additional context for its
particular conceptualization and manifestation in the 1930s and during the Great Depression.
Included in this further contextualization is a more detailed background on events of the 1930s in
the United States. I describe major individual and institutional actors, why they are significant,

The terms “information provision,” “transformation,” “technology,” “access,” and “policy” are defined later in this
chapter; the latter three terms are discussed in greater depth in their respective chapters.
2
This concept of “information provision” is somewhat narrower than the one developed by Alistair Black and Dan
Schiller. See Alistair Black and Dan Schiller, “Systems of Information: The Long View,” Library Trends 62, no. 3
(2014): 628-62.

and how they fit into the story told in the following chapters. We are then able to interrogate the
ways in which American cultural agencies and institutions defined and valued documents and
how information services changed in the 1930s, and to appreciate the significance of this change.
In the 1930s, the federal government’s information provision activities were primarily driven by
economic crisis.
The American experience of that decade was largely shaped by cataclysmic economic
recession and subsequent attempts at recovery: the Great Depression and the New Deal. While
this may seem an obvious statement to make, not all histories of library and information science
in the 1930s address the role of the Great Depression. Therefore, we cannot just assume that the
Great Depression was a major event—we must acknowledge it explicitly.
Part of this dissertation’s purpose is to put libraries and information provision at the
center in looking at the 1930s’ United States. In doing so, we have another access point through
which we can engage with fundamental questions and themes of what remains today the most
devastating and economic crisis in US history. The lessons we can still learn have yet to be fully
uncovered, for this period characterized by economic deprivation is rich in history that we may
still share. At this point, a general overview of the 1930s will be useful.

Background on the 1930s’ United States
The Great Depression
The 1930s was a decade of extraordinary change in the United States and the world, as
people struggled with catastrophic economic conditions. Such a grave and unprecedented
economic collapse found a bold response, in thirty-second President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s
New Deal. Because this dissertation looks at events of the 1930s’ United States, acknowledging
18

the Great Depression and the New Deal is unavoidable; however, this is not a dissertation about
the Great Depression and the New Deal per se. These form an important backdrop, but at the
center is the system of information provision.
The system of information provision and its transformation pivoted on economic crisis,
economic recovery, and political crisis. These are not the only experiences or lenses through
which to explore the United States in the 1930s; however, they were arguably the most pervasive
experiences of the decade. Everyone felt the effects and impacts of the Great Depression.
Americans did not all experience the Depression or recovery in the same way, however, and
there were numerous divergent opinions as to the cause of and cure for economic crisis. This also
holds true for the global political crises that loomed ever larger at the close of the 1930s and on
the eve of the Second World War. There was a palpable feeling that whatever was considered the
“American” way of life was in crisis and in a fraught period of change.
The causes and the impact of the Depression and the Roosevelt administration’s response
and plan for economic recovery have been subject to debate for nearly eighty years. Some
historians contend that too much can be made of the 1930s. For example James Cortada observes
that “it is almost obligatory for historians of the interwar period to treat the Great Depression as a
topic worthy at minimum of its own chapter, but in reality it represented a link between
prosperous times and war days.”3 In this dissertation, I am more inclined to agree with Michael
Denning, who claims that the 1930s reshaped American culture.4 The system of information
provision was both shaped by and part of shaping this cultural transformation. Furthermore, it is

important, as Lizabeth Cohen argues, to examine the events of the 1930s “for what they meant at
the time.”5
First, some general indicators of what made the Depression a cataclysmic event.
Economists have argued that given the cyclical nature of markets, occasional dips and declines
are normal. Such patterns can be identified as having occurred with some regularity long prior to
the 1930s, and this attitude largely accounts for the Hoover Administration's initial response to
the Great Depression. In June 1930, Hoover dismissed any cause for panic and “cautioned the
country that statements about the severity of unemployment were not based on solid data.”6
Although initially perceived as an ordinary plateau, the economic decline that followed the stock
market crash of 1929 was in fact quite extraordinary. Between 1929 and 1932 the gross domestic
product plummeted nearly in half, from $103.6 billion to $58.7 billion, and whereas
unemployment was at 3.2% in 1929, it had skyrocketed to 24.1% in 1932.7 By that time, a
growing consensus had begun to emerge that the strategy of Hoover and the Republicans (the
Congressional majority) was deeply inadequate, and that the market was not going to correct
itself. More and more people believed that direct federal intervention was needed.
Where historians of the 1930s diverge is in how they interpret the causes, contour lines,
and outcomes of the Depression. When they focus on the 1930s, historians typically provide
background on the social, political, and economic events that preceded the stock market crash of
1929, the moment generally considered to be the start of the Depression.8 Of course, it is only in
retrospect that we can claim October 1929 as a start date. No one knew that a global economic

crisis was about to persist for more than a decade. At the time, indeed, some contemporaries
anticipated that the crash would be a minor setback. President Herbert Hoover steadfastly refused
to consider federal relief, and Hoover's lack of effective intervention with the Depression
ultimately cost him the 1932 election. Robert McElvaine offers a compassionate portrayal of
Herbert Hoover, whom he describes more as a victim of circumstance rather than a heartless or
inept leader.9 While historians do not necessarily exonerate Hoover for his actions (or lack
thereof), most agree that the events that led to the crash of 1929 were set in motion long before
Hoover's election in 1928.

Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal
It is impossible to make sense of the 1930s without looking at Roosevelt and his
Administrations. First elected in 1932, the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt lasted through
1945 and through the end of World War Two. A well-heeled cousin of former President
Theodore Roosevelt, FDR had enjoyed a long career in politics prior to his first presidential win.
Biographical treatments of FDR are profuse, and tend to be critical yet respectful appraisals of
his political life.10 As previously suggested, biographical information on FDR is also embedded
in histories of the Great Depression. Historians have tried to ascertain to what extent the
administration's policies bore FDR's personal imprint, what motivated him to act as he did, and
which people had the greatest influence over him.
Economic policies congruent with—or later, originating in—the work of influential
economist John Maynard Keynes assumed an instrumental role in the recovery process.

Keynes had warned of long-term and catastrophic consequences for the global economy in 1919
following the Treaty of Versailles. Keynes argued that going along with the business as usual
boom and bust cycles was too dangerous, that the possible consequences were too great, and
indeed that the 1930s proved how disastrous the bust could be. As the devastating effects of the
Depression wore on, mainstream policymakers embraced a Keynesian approach: the
amelioration of economic crisis through counter-cyclical deficit spending. Keynes was the most
important economist whose work was explicitly engaged in the latter part of the 1930s.11 As they
were embraced, his doctrine ramified throughout much of the US political economy—including
the system of information provision.12
Information provision and cultural projects of the 1930s figure in here because they were
also prioritized and deemed in need of greater support and expansion regardless of their revenuegenerating capabilities—because the expansion and enhancement of cultural life was actually
good for a society overall. In a time of protracted economic crisis, in turn, people were brought
more public goods and services based on government investment and federal programs.
Historians differ in their motivations for looking at the New Deal and in how they
decipher its outcomes.13 While the New Deal did not overthrow the capitalist system, that it
produced positive, far-reaching changes has been disputed. Written after the “Reagan
Revolution” of the 1980s, Alan Brinkley’s The End of Reform is an attempt to explain “why
modern American liberalism has proved to be a so much weaker and more vulnerable force” by
examining the years between the recession of 1937 and the end of the Second World War.14

Some New Deal liberals had initially argued for a fundamental overhaul of the economic order
so as to ensure a more equal distribution of wealth and sweeping regulation of industry. By the
end of the Second World War, liberals had abandoned the idea of fundamental change and a
more skeptical critique of capitalism. Instead of framing economic problems in terms of
overproduction, the emphasis shifted to the problems of under-consumption. As a result,
economic reforms were geared toward stimulating the economy by helping Americans buy more
consumer products. This approach gained further momentum in the expansion during and after
the Second World War. Brinkley also argues for a reading of the New Deal as an evolving set of
policies shaped by people who in turn made strategic decisions in response to contingencies. In
the end the New Deal wound up being an exercise in extreme compromise, albeit one that did
affect some lasting change. However, because these changes did not completely alter the
economic structure, historians like Brinkley have argued that the subsequent impact has been
muted. Brinkley concludes that it is not possible to “create a just and prosperous society without
worrying about the problems of production that structure the economy.”15
Some critics of New Deal policies have portrayed FDR as a radical socialist determined
to undermine the economic order,16 yet Brinkley and several other historians would vehemently
disagree with such an assessment. McElvaine notes that Roosevelt was not a radical by any
means, but a strategic politician who “sought recovery and more limited reform,” and contends
that Roosevelt’s “commitment to substantial - although certainly not revolutionary - change was
genuine... the federal relief effort [did not pose] a serious threat to existing power relations.”17
Like Brinkley, he argues that the economic policies of the New Deal were shaped by the belief

York: Threshold Editions, 2008).

16

23

that consumer purchasing power needed increasing. McElvaine suggests that New Deal policies
were shaped directly by the experiences of Roosevelt and the people in his inner circle, many of
whom felt a personal responsibility to alleviate the suffering of the poor.18 Although radical
sentiment heightened in the early 1930s, he says that “no organizational structure existed to
translate the changed attitudes into political power.”19 Roosevelt constantly sought to strike a
balance between the interests of the poor and working class, whose votes he needed, and those of
the business community, whose financial support and political connections he also needed.
Of particular significance is the extent to which the Roosevelt administration prioritized
information provision. One way this is evident is in how information provision was integrated
into or made an essential part of new agencies created in the first hundred days. The Federal
Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) were two
such agencies created through legislation passed in March 1933. FERA maintained a research
library, while the TVA provided comprehensive library services for its workers. Typical of
agencies and projects of the 1930s, they each maintained meticulous records for the purposes of
reporting.
Historians generally concur that the military buildup for World War Two eventually
ended the Depression. This is not to suggest that the Depression could not have ended without
war, “but that it took the danger to convince Roosevelt and the Congress to spend at the level
necessary to bring about recovery.”20 Again, throughout the 1930s Roosevelt and his

administration pushed the New Deal reforms not to undermine capitalism, but to save it.21 Some
members of the Roosevelt administration—not to mention significant segments of the population
at large—had hoped for more radical changes to the US economic system. Even supposing that
Roosevelt himself personally supported such fundamental changes—and again, sources argue he
did not—Roosevelt and the Democrats nevertheless had to balance any zeal for reform with the
wishes of corporate America. Even at the height of the Depression, business leaders still wielded
great influence over the American political economic system.
By the end of the Second World War, the United States was poised to reposition itself as
a major economic and military power. It is difficult—if not impossible—to speculate how
economic recovery would have proceeded without the aid of New Deal programs. What we do
know is that the New Deal and the Works Progress Administration had an enormous impact on
American political, economic, and cultural development, including the system of information
provision. Historian Michael Bernstein writes that “the unprecedented crisis of the Great
Depression brought an interventionist regulatory economics to center stage... the thirties and the
New Deal agendas of the Roosevelt presidency served to legitimize regulatory economics in
ways that had hitherto been unimaginable.”22 More recently, Jefferson Cowie and Nick
Salvatore have argued that the Great Depression disrupted the previously set trajectory of social
relations. The New Deal and the rise of the welfare state could only have occurred because of the
cataclysmic Great Depression.23

The Works Progress Administration
Although some relief effort began during the Hoover Administration, the New Deal
refers to the unfolding and, for some, disorganized array of relief and recovery programs enacted
under the Roosevelt Administration. Capitalized at $500 million and permitted to issue notes up
to $1.5 billion (roughly $8.5 billion and $26 billion respectively in 2014),24 the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation (RFC) was established in January 1932 to provide loans for governments
and businesses; however, the bureaucracy of the loan process made this early version of the RFC
insufficient for stimulating the economy. Roosevelt continued the lending efforts of the RFC,
increased its funding, and expanded its charge to include provision of direct aid in the form of
grants rather than loans. The RFC went on to form one of the core agencies of what became
known as the New Deal.25
Historians refer to the programs implemented in 1933 as the “First New Deal,” while the
“Second New Deal” encompasses the period from 1934 to 1936. New Deal programs aimed to
revive both the economy and the human spirit, while several pieces of New Deal legislation
sought to strengthen financial regulation, improve working conditions, and establish permanent
sources for poor relief. These amounted to more than two dozen initiatives, some of which have
persisted into the twenty-first century, such as the Social Security Administration, the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal
Communications Commission; other programs still exist in a modified form, such as the Surplus
Commodities Program, the Farm Security Administration, and the Federal Crop Insurance
Corporation. Other programs were established as temporary initiatives, such as the Civilian

Conservation Corps, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, and the Works Progress
Administration.26
With the passage of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, President
Roosevelt was authorized to allocate nearly $5 billion for work relief, making it “the greatest
single appropriation in the history of the United States or any other nation.”27 This appropriation
underwrote the creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a massive job creation
effort meant to employ as many people as possible as quickly as possible. For this reason, some
have dismissed the WPA as having provided for a lot of people “to do useless work poorly.”28
However, the efforts of WPA laborers produced changes of lasting utility and significance. This
is evident in diverse ways, from the murals on post office buildings and archived recordings of
former slaves’ narratives, to the “more than 2,500 hospitals, 5,900 school buildings, 1,000 airport
landing fields, and nearly 13,000 playgrounds” built.29
Whereas previous New Deal agencies such as the Public Works Administration focused
on physical infrastructure, the WPA employed a great number of cultural laborers. Much of the
scholarship on these cultural projects has focused on the arts programs generated through Federal
One: theater, music, visual art, and writing.30 Programs initiated under the WPA led to the
eventual creation of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the
Humanities. Yet the arts projects are only part of the cultural labor utilized by the WPA. The

WPA supported several white collar projects devoted to both access to and preservation of
information.31 There is scant scholarship on the Historical Records Survey, the Federal Records
Survey, the American Imprints Inventory, the Research and Records Program, and the numerous
indexing, cataloging, and bibliography projects generated by the WPA—each and all crucial
developments in the emerging redefinition of information provision. A related problem is that the
existing scholarship does not situate these projects within the larger transformation of the
American system of information provision during the 1930s.
As has been emphasized by other scholars of the 1930s, the primary goal of the WPA
was to put people back to work. In other words, the main point of the WPA was not to paint
murals, build roads, or sew mattresses. But in putting people back to work through these
projects, the projects then served as demonstrations of how and why those activities were needed
and valuable. They validated the importance of public art and public works. In creating these
structures and generating these resources, the Depression itself seems to have revealed a dearth
that the public did not even realize had existed. During the Depression programs and resources
were generated that arguably were needed and could have been built on a sound economic basis
during prosperous times. It is therefore all the more remarkable that so much was built during a
time when people had so little. Paradoxically, at the end of the decade, they came away with so
much more.
On its face, the WPA accomplished what it set out to do: put millions of Americans back
to work. It was phased out during the 1940s, when the mobilization of World War Two provided
jobs on a scale not seen since the onset of the Depression. During its lifetime, the WPA

Robert Binkley defined “white collar workers” as “the people who work with paper rather than machinery, who
deal with the public rather than with raw materials.” See Robert C. Binkley, “The Cultural Program of the W.P.A.,”
in The Collected Works of Robert C. Binkley, ed. Max Fisch (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1948),

employed 8.5 million people and created 1.5 million projects.32 That so many people were put
back to work is a striking accomplishment on its own. A related consequence of the size of the
workforce employed through the WPA was that it allowed for the development of unique, largescale projects. Thanks to the steady employee pool, visionary cultural laborers were able to
translate big dreams into reality, even if only momentarily. Beth Kraig writes how Douglas
McMurtrie, director of the American Imprints Inventory, had long found catalogs of American
printing to be incomplete and inadequate, but he “recognized that he could not hope to remedy
the flaws by working alone; accordingly, he began to develop plans for a nationwide survey
employing hundreds of workers. A network of surveyors would stretch across the country,
visiting libraries, archives, and historical institutions.” Kraig goes on to acknowledge that “in any
decade but the 1930s, McMurtrie's notions might have been nothing more than pipe dreams, but
the development of work relief programs... offered a means of breathing life into such
schemes.”33
Of all of these projects, the Historical Records Survey is probably the most welldocumented. Edward Barrese devoted his dissertation to the subject, and William McDonald's
epic treatment of WPA arts projects has a chapter on the HRS.34 We know that the HRS began as
a project under the auspices of Federal One; but it was moved out and given its own independent
status. Historian Luther Evans, who oversaw the HRS from the beginning and through most of
its existence, succeeded Archibald MacLeish as the Librarian of Congress. This last detail

perhaps demonstrates the potential greater connection between WPA information projects and
librarianship. However, the full extent to which libraries and library workers participated in these
projects is not yet well recognized. This void is evident in both the literature on the Great
Depression and the New Deal as well as the literature on the history of librarianship.
Collaboration and cooperation are recurring themes in my dissertation. White collar work
projects were highly collaborative efforts and accomplished through the cooperative efforts of
state and local institutions and federal agencies. City governments, historical societies, museums,
libraries, newspapers, hospitals, and of course the WPA served as co-sponsors depending on the
kind of project, not only pooling together the needed financial capital and material resources and
professional expertise, but allowing organizations to cooperate who previously did not realize
their potential for fruitful collaboration. WPA projects helped organizations tap into the creative
possibilities for new types of projects, highlight common goals through innovative programming,
and generate useful informational resources. Often these were not obvious projects.
Organizations who may not have seen their overlap refreshed their perspectives and enlarged
their thinking thanks in part to the opportunity afforded through the WPA. The WPA was in this
way a unifying effort in the obvious sense through the realization of, for example, union
catalogues, but also indirectly in that it helped unify work across what were more isolated
organizations and agencies. They could accomplish more together due to shared finances and
resources, but also a heightened awareness and appreciation of one another and their work. The
nature of shared responsibility here had other important implications. One was that the federal
government could provide a generative and organizational impulse and assured funding. This
was necessary in the 1930s after Hoover’s inaction on the Depression convinced many
Americans that federal action was crucial for stimulating all economic sectors.

30

WPA reports of course serve as promotional materials for the work of the WPA, for they
not only document the efforts and achievements, but also argue for their importance. WPA
reports never merely describe; they also embellish, emphasizing the size, the professional
authority, and the high standards of these projects. One press release touts “the largest indexing
job in history” while another boasts that “21 WPA workers finish huge clerical task for
hospital.”35 This is in part meant to downplay the “boondoggle” critics, who alleged that WPA
projects were glorified busywork that produced inferior results. WPA detractors were
particularly skeptical of the white collar projects. In his history of the WPA, Nick Taylor
concedes that “building work and disaster response were obvious jobs for the WPA. Some other
jobs were not. But [Harry] Hopkins needed to put men who were not laborers, and women other
than teachers, nurses, and seamstresses, to work, and so across America the WPA paid people to
copy old records that were moldering to dust, repair toys for poor children's Christmas stockings,
rebind books for libraries, index newspapers, compile lists of historic buildings, and record folk
songs.” This labor, Taylor argues, was as vital to economic recovery as the building projects, yet
“much of this work never would have been done had the WPA not needed to create jobs for these
segments of the population; with it, the WPA was helping to preserve the country's past even as
it was helping to build for the future.”36 The detailed documentation of WPA projects also helped
to serve another purpose: to galvanize similar projects into being. By describing how to do what,
other localities and organizations may not only haven been inspired to do it, but also find a
blueprint for how, going into the post-Depression future.

Definitions
Information Provision
How do we characterize the system of information provision? Information provision
activities relate to the systematic generation, collection, organization, dissemination, and
preservation of documentary and scientific records. The system of information provision in the
1930s’ United States therefore includes libraries and librarians but also includes the work of
allied professionals in government research, media, higher education, archives, history, and
documentalism. “Information provision” is intended to gesture at this wider range of associated
precepts and practices.
“What is information?” has been debated in library and information science (LIS)
literature for decades, mostly within information science.37 Scholars identify Claude Shannon’s
mathematical model of communication as the first attempt to define information as a unit of
scientific measurement. More recently, Bates has defined information as patterns of matter or
energy.38 Definitions of information have also piqued interest outside LIS: like Bates, historian
Daniel Headrick has defined information as “patterns of energy and matter that humans
understand.”39 In the 1960s and 1970s postindustrial theorists assigned information a
fundamentally economic role, arguing “that information itself had become the transforming
resource of social organization,” and that “knowledge was supplanting capital and labor as the
decisive factor of production.”40

See for example: Michael Buckland, “Information as Thing,” Journal of the American Society for Information
Science 42 (1991): 351-60; Brenda Dervin, “Chaos, Order, and Sense-Making: A Proposed Theory for Information
Design,” in Sense-Making Methodology Reader: Selected Writings of Brenda Dervin, ed. Brenda Dervin, Lois
Foreman-Wernet, and Eric Lauterbach (Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, 2003), 325-40.

As Bates and others have done, it is important to acknowledge that Shannon did not
develop the mathematical model to explain human communication, but to explain signal
transmission within electrical systems. Bates expands the definition by allowing for scientific
and social dimensions of information; however, Bates’ (and Headrick’s) definition is so inclusive
that it does not provide a clearer sense of what information is. The postindustrialist definition of
information is reductionist—it says that information is intrinsically an economic unit.
I would argue that the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy
can help generate a useful definition of information. In the DIKW model, information
necessarily follows data and precedes knowledge.41 Data is raw, unprocessed signs and symbols;
once data is interpreted and described it becomes information (similar to Brenda Dervin’s
“information as sense-making” thesis.)42 I would then augment this definition with Dan
Schiller’s description of information as a resource that is “conditioned and structured by the
social institutions and relations in which it is embedded.”43 Thinking of information as a cultural
resource used to organize, interpret, and communicate provides us with a working definition to
use in the context of the system of information provision. The system of information provision is
the aggregate of activities and services that organize, interpret, and communicate information
resources.
During the 1930s in the United States, this system was changing. Existing services and
programs were being enlarged, with cases in point including books in Braille, expanded census
data, and the enlargement of librarianship’s mission to include intellectual freedom. The 1930s
also saw new services like the Social Security Index, microfilm, and the National Archives and

Records Administration. These services and programs will receive more thorough treatments in
later chapters.
In the 1930s, the system of information provision was in part characterized by
interdependency. There is evidence of collaboration, cooperation, communication, and overlap.
The evidence is present from correspondence between the Library Services Division of the
Works Progress Administration and the American Library Association. In a letter dated
November 2, 1939, ALA Executive Secretary Carl Milam invited the director of the division,
Edward A. Chapman, to visit ALA headquarters in Chicago in order to discuss “the need of a
unified program for the A.LA.”44 ALA leaders such as Milam were in frequent contact with
WPA officials such as Ellen Woodward and Edward Chapman. This overlap is also seen in the
appearance of other associations’ materials in WPA archives, such as correspondence with the
American Documentation Institute and the Joint Committee on Materials for Research. Writing
in the 1970s, historian Peggy Sullivan observed that “de Tocqueville and other general
commentators on American society have been cited to explain the great interest that librarians
have shown in coming together in diverse organizations.”45
The state (principally the United States federal government) occupied a central role in the
system of information provision of the 1930s. The relationship between information and the state
has a long history, therefore making the US government’s growing role in the 1930s less
surprising. States have historically been, and are still heavily invested in the generation,
collection, management, and suppression of information. Peter Burke writes that “governments
have been interested in collecting and storing information about the people under their rule from

the time of the ancient Assyrians, if not before,” and Daniel Headrick notes that “governments
had long known that knowledge is power.”46 Various agencies of the 1930s’ US saw the need to
more effectively harness the information they had while finding new ways to collect information
relevant to addressing the economic crisis.
Scholars continue to debate the extent to which states become involved in information
provision for purposes of social control. Colin Burke has cautioned against “imposing sweeping
concepts on evidence” in order to prove the existence of “deterministic forces such as social
control.”47 Edward Higgs argues that the state’s interest in information provision cannot be
entirely explained by a motivation for social control, and that there are likely both “utopian and
dystopian” explanations.48 I would not argue that state actors only use information provision for
purposes of coercion or surveillance; on the other hand, it seems unlikely that the state would
knowingly promote a system of information provision that would undermine its power. In the
1930s, the state’s information provision activities were primarily reinflected by economic crisis.
This is not to say that the expanded and newly created services and programs could not or would
not be exploited for other reasons; however, this is not a focus of my dissertation.
This dissertation is not a survey of all activities that can be included under the system of
information provision. Broadcast media, for example, are left out.49 Its focus is not-for-profit
agencies and institutions concerned with print media—therefore, while the newspaper industry
qualifies as a print medium, as a commercial venture it is not included. Finally, as fascinated as I

am by postal history, and as important as I believe it to be, the post office as a means of delivery
and information transfer is not discussed much in this dissertation. Its core concern is the
production and distribution of information for use by people in scholarly and everyday
communication through governmental and non-profit agencies and organizations. The choice to
focus on a handful of government agencies and services, plus select scholarly societies and
libraries is in part a practical one—a dissertation by nature must be bounded in some way. The
other reason is that the story of these organizations and institutions has not been discussed in the
context of the system of information provision and its transformation. This must be corrected.
To sum up: the system of information gestures at the range of precepts and practices that
provide information services through scholarly organizations, libraries, federal agencies, and
research centers. An information service, simply put, describes an activity that collects,
organizes, distributes, and/or preserves ideas in a systematic way. An information service may do
so in fixed, permanent format and/or in an unfixed format. Files that are recorded in some way
(e.g., monograph or sound recording) are fixed, while unrecorded oral transmissions (e.g.,
conversation, in person reference interview) may be impermanent yet are nevertheless a type of
information service.
How was the system of information provision transformed in the 1930s? It would be hard
to imagine how anyone or anything could have endured the experience of the Great Depression
without being changed by it. A scan of library literature in the early 1930s indicates a feeling of
profound change on the horizon. Jesse Shera wrote in 1933 that social conditions were
undergoing a fundamental metamorphosis, and that librarians needed to respond accordingly.50

opened his address by bluntly stating “there is no point in describing to you the problems of the
last few years...The only way out must entail a remolding of our social institutions.”51
This social transformation necessitated changes at the most mundane and bureaucratic
levels of record-keeping. The old ways of managing information simply would not do. Writing
about the Office of Budget Management, Frederick Mosher argues that “the Great Depression,
the multitude of New Deal programs, and finally World War II made the original routines of
budgeting and auditing impracticable if not impossible.”52 The Social Security Administration is
one New Deal agency whose creation required a complete overhaul of record-keeping practices,
particularly in the management of vital statistics. In his history of archives and record-keeping,
Richard Cox states that “federal recordkeeping is a twentieth-century development. It was not
until after 1930 that even 90 percent of births and deaths in the United States were recorded.”53
From record-keeping to economic regulation, the experience of the 1930s made clear that
business as usual was at best inefficient and at worst disastrous.

Information Workers and American Labor
Another term that requires explication is “information worker.” I talk about librarians a
lot in this dissertation, but I also talk about people who were engaged in library work at some
level, but technically were not librarians. It would be inaccurate to say this is a dissertation on
librarians in the 1930s, because I am writing about allied professionals as well. “Librarian” is

sometimes too specific a term, and we therefore require one that is more comprehensive and allencompassing. I use “information worker.” For this concept I like the definition provided by
political economist of media and communications scholar Vincent Mosco: “A broader definition
of knowledge work encompasses the labor of those who handle, distribute, and convey
information and knowledge. This includes school teachers at both the elementary and secondary
levels, most journalists, librarians, media technicians such as telecommunication and cable
television workers, as well as those who work in the postal services... These are considered
knowledge workers because an increasing amount of their work involves making use of
information or information technology to efficiently and effectively deliver a product whose
value is intended to expand a recipient's knowledge. In essence, they represent a middle class
within the knowledge sector.”54
The professionals who labored in the host of information environments described in this
dissertation were middle class, white-collar workers. Primary and secondary literature on
emergency relief in the 1930s repeatedly describes the deliberate effort to employ white-collar
workers. Close reading of archival documents reveals that when describing relief workers
engaging in information labor, they were commonly referred to as white-collar workers. Relief
administrators such as Harry Hopkins believed that putting white-collar workers to work in fields
for which they were unsuited or untrained would be inefficient and wasteful: “Hopkins and his
staff saw no sense in forcing artists, writers, and musicians to become third-rate laborers when
they had skills that could be used in other ways.”55 Instead, relief agencies acknowledged the
importance and value of white-collar projects and were flexible in allowing their creation in
many forms. Information labor was part of this process. Expansion and articulation of

professional identity was certainly underway in the 1930s. The labor movement and its own
power surge in the 1930s is readily acknowledged in the historical literature, yet this typically
limits itself to only include industrial or blue collar workers.
It is useful to situate the notion of the information worker in the broader context of labor
in the 1930s. Indeed, the struggles of the 1930s were informed by a rearticulation and resurgence
of class consciousness. The subject of organized labor demands attention on the basis of numbers
alone. Union membership doubled in under a decade, going from 11.6% in 1930 to 22.6% by
1937.56 The extraordinary decline in the standard of living wrought by the Great Depression
reinvigorated organization of the working class. Another reason for focusing on the labor
movement in this period is that its ideas about redistribution generated a powerful influence on
economic policymaking. Labor activists such as Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America
head Sidney Hillman focused on working class consumption as a way of stabilizing the
economy.57 Commissioner of Labor Isador Lubin likewise believed “that underconsumption
resulting from inequitable distribution of income had been a major factor contributing to the
Great Depression.”58
Likewise, one cannot appreciate the political economy of the 1930s without looking at
the labor movement, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations in particular. A number of
scholars have produced laudable works foregrounding these topics. The labor movement was one
of the most powerful influences in the early twentieth century. This is especially true of the
Depression years, when it found a new focus: the formation of the Congress of Industrial
Organizations. Organized labor was also a major constituency for the Democratic Party; in the

1930s, Hillman and others in the CIO played a significant role in bolstering support for FDR and
in the New Deal political coalition. While some policymakers were adopting a Keynesian
approach to try to end the Depression, the CIO and industrial labor were arguing for
redistribution as a class project. These are not opposing versions—there is overlap in the New
Deal, and it is not clear in any moment which was the guiding spirit. At the same time,
contingents within the labor movement disagreed over the precise role of state intervention in
economic life; this is demonstrated in the formation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations
(CIO) and its concomitant tensions with the American Federation of Labor.59
The CIO formed at a critical moment in American labor history. Its formation was, to
some extent, a response to the conservatism of the American Federation of Labor. But its
formation also signified the transformation of working class culture in the United States. The
dire economic conditions brought on by the Great Depression and the federal government's
initial weak response galvanized rank and file movements into militant action. An obvious
indicator of labor's power and new economic policies in the 1930s was the passage of the
National Labor Relations Act, which established state-sanctioned protections for unionization.
In the 1930s, the CIO was on the forefront of radical working self-organization in the
United States. Robert Zieger argues that the transformation of the working class and the global
economy in the pre-World War Two era enabled the conditions in which the CIO formed.60
Other historians such as Lizabeth Cohen and Michael Denning have emphasized the importance
of mass culture in this transformation of the working class.61 Although terms like “working
class” and “industrial” may be taken to exclusively mean blue collar workers, white collar

workers, including librarians, responded to and participated in this transformation, as evidenced
in the establishment of white collar unions. Likewise, New Deal programs played a dynamic role
in this transformation. Whether or not information professionals were radicalized by the
experience of the 1930s, however, is not the subject of this dissertation.62
Information worker is a useful term because there were people in the 1930s whose work
crossed and straddled boundaries across otherwise discrete professional identities. Robert
Binkley was at times an historian, librarian, archivist, and educator. This breadth of professional
skill is evident from glancing at titles in the table of contents for the posthumous collection of
Binkley writings published in 1948, eight years after his untimely death from lung cancer at age
42. It would certainly be accurate to refer to Binkley as an historian, but a more apt description
would be information worker or even better information activist. Binkley and others were deeply
committed in the 1930s to identifying connections across types of information work and taking
concrete steps to standardize and modernize processes of collection, organization, distribution,
and preservation.63
Is “information worker” an anachronistic term? Perhaps only inasmuch as using “library
and information science” is an anachronistic term. This too was not used in the 1930s, but has
been used in contemporary literature when talking about the 1930s. Information worker, like the
system of information provision, are terms meant to capture the breadth of activity. Finally,
although my dissertation is not only about librarians, they are certainly part of the story I am
trying to tell.

Joyce Latham’s 2006 dissertation addresses this topic in the context of the Chicago Public Library. See Joyce M.
Latham, “White Collar Read: The American Public Library and the Left Led CIO; A Case Study of the Chicago
Public Library, 1929-1952” (PhD diss., University of Illinois, 2007).

Part of situating and articulating what constitutes the system of information provision in
the 1930s’ United States involves identifying key institutions and individuals. I would also like
to address which experiences are not addressed but are nevertheless important, and can perhaps
be set aside as topics for future research.

Individuals and Institutions in the System of Information Provision
As mentioned in the introduction, this dissertation seeks to synthesize existing
scholarship on interrelated topics. This dissertation looks in depth at the American Library
Association, the Joint Committee on Materials for Research, Science Service/American
Documentation Institute, the National Agricultural Library, the Works Progress Administration,
and the National Archives and Records Administration. I am primarily concerned with
professional associations, scholarly societies, and government agencies/services; however none
of these will be explored across its full range of activity. The Works Progress Administration,
even to narrow to its activities involved in the system of information provision, would form the
basis of an entire dissertation. Thus here I am only considering a few key aspects that allow us to
get a better grasp on how these services and agencies were part of the transformation and were
interconnected. The importance of collaboration and cooperation is emphasized throughout. With
the WPA, the in depth consideration encompasses the various library projects overseen by
Women’s and Professional Projects. For the American Library Association, I am chiefly
interested in the National Plan for Libraries, federal aid, and library extension. For the work of
the JCMR, Science Service/American Documentation Institute, and the National Agricultural
Library, I am mainly interested in the Bibliofilm Service. The Bibliofilm Service is an obvious

42

choice because it was an information service that involved the close cooperation of several
institutions.
What is the value of looking at the system of information provision vis a vis institutions
and their principal figures? Surely the Bibliofilm Service, to use but one example, is an
overlooked topic in historical scholarship, as is the contribution of Claribel Barnett, the NAL
librarian. These subjects could and should form the basis of a research project. Yet a key reason
for structuring this dissertation as I have is to emphasize the interconnectedness. The Bibliofilm
Service should be given more sustained attention and focus, but it will not occur here. Not
because it is unworthy, but because it is but one part of a larger whole. This dissertation is about
emphasizing the parts and the whole, and their relationship to one another.
What is left out? For one, this dissertation does not focus as much on user populations,
but more on information providers. This dissertation is not a history from the bottom up. In the
afterword to the second edition of The Cultural Front, Michael Denning notes that “This book
has been a tale of that ‘New Deal order,’ though I have not, for the most part, looked at the
dominant political and economic forces, the ‘corporate’ or ‘multi-national’ liberalism of
Roosevelt’s historical bloc, that won the struggles of ‘1934.’”64 Similarly, Lizabeth Cohen’s
Making a New Deal focuses on industrial workers in Chicago.65 In this sense Denning’s and
Cohen’s works are examples of history from the bottom up. My dissertation on the other hand
takes a macroscopic view, looking at institutions and agencies in the system of information
provision. My approach is useful because I am connecting activities and actors in a new way that
allows for a better understanding of the transformation that occurred. Users are discussed
inasmuch as I try to identify intended or targeted user groups for services. For example, when

discussing the American Library Association’s campaign for library outreach for spreading
library services to rural populations, I focus on ALA’s efforts as opposed to looking at how users
saw these efforts.
This is not to say that focusing on users is less important or interesting than looking at the
providers. To some extent, it is a matter of perspective to divide people into such categories of
users and providers, it is certainly not a matter of users versus providers. Providers themselves
are users in certain contexts, and vice versa. The everyday people who provided personal and
demographic information were vital to designing programs for economic recovery that were
meaningful and accurate and more likely to have an impact. In a way then it is a bit crude to
make such a distinction between users and providers. Nevertheless, in this dissertation I am
making a case for the sake of argument that agencies, institutions, and their high-ranking
officials and leaders were the information providers.
Wayne Wiegand has critiqued American library historiography for privileging the library
in the life of the user versus the user in the life of the library.66 Extrapolating from Wiegand’s
point, this dissertation is arguably more about the system of information provision in the life of
the user rather than the other way around. Wiegand has also argued that American library history
makes too much about libraries as a democratic force.67 By incorporating the views of library
leaders, who certainly believed in the library as a democratic force, my dissertation adds a

dimension more in line with Sidney Ditzion’s Arsenals of a Democratic Culture or Jesse Shera’s
Foundations of the Public Library.68 I appreciate Professor Wiegand’s perspective, especially in
how he challenges dominant theoretical and methodological paradigms in library history. I agree
with him, even though in this dissertation I am perhaps perpetuating the very kind of library
history (or information history) that he finds less compelling. In fact I see my dissertation as
helping to diminish the “tunnel vision and blind spots” found in mainstream accounts of library
history. Of course, as Donald Case points out, “one scholar’s ‘tunnel vision’ may be another
scholar’s microscope.”69 My project synthesizes many narratives and in doing so shows how
they talk to one another in ways that were previously unidentified. One way that my dissertation
makes a contribution is in the way that I connect library history to other interrelated historical
narratives, which broadly may be characterized as information history.
Why is focusing on leaders important and how is it a useful approach? One practical
justification is that people in power tend to leave extensively documented records of official
business. The recordkeeping practices of professional organizations and government agencies
have generated a wealth of archival documents. Consider that the National Archives’ holdings of
the Works Progress Administration alone is estimated at more than 7300 cubic feet and includes
159,302 items.70 Finally, users do not exist until there are systems and services for them to use.

Expansion and Crisis in the System of Information Provision
Crisis and expansion are common themes in histories of the various agencies and
institutions that constitute the system of information provision in the 1930s. In some cases,
however, the secondary literature barely acknowledges the 1930s, suggesting or outright
claiming that not much of note occurred at all during the Great Depression. For this reason, I will
cite some of this research and I argue that a) the experience of economic crisis powerfully
influenced the trajectory of the federal government, and b) that expansion occurred often, both
because of and in spite of economic crisis. In the following section, I will specifically review
these with regard to libraries, government information, and scholarly societies.

Libraries
What was the specific role of the library in the 1930s in the transformation of the system
of information provision? As the library is a public information institution, excluding it from any
modern information history would be shortsighted. The public library assumed an important role
in economic recovery while the initial projects of the New Deal were still emerging; libraries
were nicknamed “Depression College” as early as 1933.71 Circulation statistics reported in
January 1933 showed an average 37% increase in 33 cities between 1929 and 1932. Circulation
increased 173% in Hammond, Indiana.72 In the 1930s, libraries seized the opportunity to not only
emphasize their value as an institution, but the importance—even the necessity—of public
institutions and social welfare programs more broadly. This is emphasized repeatedly in the
professional and scholarly library literature of the 1930s, both with regard to economic recovery

and democratic culture. There can be no question that libraries were shaped by and responsive to
events of the 1930s.
Yet as James Carmichael observed in the introduction to a special issue of Libraries and
the Cultural Record in 2011, “the literature of library history devoted to the Great Depression is
sparse.”73 Perhaps some scholars barely acknowledge the 1930s in the attempt to write
comprehensive histories of libraries spanning decades (or even centuries). Writing in 1995,
Verna L. Pungitore devotes a page and a half to the Great Depression in her book Innovation and
the Library. Pungitore’s book is not exactly a history of innovation, though that is part of the
narrative. Pungitore is more concerned with theorizing innovation in organizations and then
looking at how this has occurred at the public library level. She does highlight some important
points, like how library circulation went up nearly forty percent between 1929 and 1933, and that
“public libraries began to forge alliances with the federal government during the
Depression...federal aid contributed some forty percent of the amount of funding normally
available to public libraries.” She concludes that while public libraries made some attempts to
make big changes in the 1930s, “public libraries in the 1930s had not moved very far from their
turn of the century traditions.”74 Arguing in a similar vein, Michael Buckland writes that “the
visions of the European documentalists appear to have been largely absent from library science
in the U.S.A.”75 Buckland’s assertion was based on frequency of topics published in The Library
Quarterly, and he is quite right that the journal focused on more traditional library topics to the
exclusion of documentalism. Yet when considering the 1930s in its entirety—the actions of

government agencies, the committees created by librarians, the collaboration between
documentalists and librarians—a different picture emerges.
Library history scholars such as Michael Harris have addressed the 1930s to some extent.
In earlier works published in the 1970s, Harris mentions the 1930s in connection with
intellectual freedom, but on the whole he regards the decade as a less significant period in library
history. Harris claims that “from roughly 1920 to 1940….the profession focused increasingly on
the management of libraries, and ignored both the question of the library’s role in society, and
the librarian’s personal obligation to behave like a professional.”76 In “The Role of the Public
Library in American Life” Harris writes that “in the 1930s a few librarians began to sense the
mindlessness of public librarianship in the United States.”77 He elaborates on how international
political events of the 1930s helped redefine the library “as an institution which could play a vital
role in promoting and preserving democracy in America…”78 In his more recent publication,
History of Libraries in the Western World, Harris acknowledges the role of the Great Depression
in library history, noting that public libraries continued to grow throughout the twentieth century
“despite the intrusion of financial crises like the great depression of 1929,”79 and for his section
on academic and research libraries, Harris points toward themes developed in this dissertation.
He discusses the importance of federal aid, WPA, and the “search for new and efficient means of
providing library service” in the form of microfilm, cooperative acquisitions, and union
catalogs.80 On school libraries he offers that “there was still some progress in the 1930s in spite

of, and partly because of the Depression.”81
Harris’ inclusion of the 1930s is helpful, but does not go far enough in describing how
libraries were affected by the Great Depression. Turning to other sources, we find plenty of
indicators that libraries in the 1930s felt the impact of economic crisis deeply. One way to
measure this impact is to examine library budgets, while another way is to look at services
demanded versus library resources available. The latter has been covered in Robert Scott
Kramp’s 1975 dissertation, recently printed as a monograph by Library Juice Press. 82 Kramp
found that while library budgets shrank in the 1930s, library use increased. Yet his findings also
revealed a growth in scholarship produced about libraries. In a review of the literature produced
about library services during the 1930s, he concludes that “the studies of library services during
the depression were perhaps more numerous than studies of any other phase of library
activity.”83 The experience of the Great Depression hastened the need for research on libraries,
triggering an expansion in scholarly production. This spike in research was found in scholarly
journals like The Library Quarterly and in trade publications like Library Journal. From its
inaugural issue in 1931 through the end of 1939, The Library Quarterly published nearly 30
articles related to economic crisis.
Library annual reports accounted for most of Kramp’s analysis. In addition to library
budgets, another means of gauging the impact of the Depression on the system of information
provision is to look at library education. The annual reports of the Library School at the
University of Illinois in the 1930s are an indicator of how libraries felt the impact of and
responded to economic crisis. For the report for academic year 1928/1929 produced in May

1929, on the eve of the Depression, the Annual Report glowingly states that “The number of
students enrolled in the Library School this past year has been the largest in the history of the
school.”84 Director Phineas Windsor also notes the continuation of successful job placement,
writing “One hundred and forty-eight positions in libraries were filled during the year, partly or
wholly as a result of recommendations from the School offices. Of these, eighty-seven were in
university, college and reference libraries, thirty-two in public libraries and twenty-nine in high
school, teaching or other positions.”85
Even in May 1930, when the annual report for academic year of 1929/30 was released,
the state of the school seems by this account to be in good stead, with Windsor reporting “Due to
the large increase in the Library School enrollment, it has been necessary to add two new
members to the faculty this past year... The Library School enrollment in steadily increasing each
year.”86 He goes on to note that “One hundred and eighty-two positions in libraries in thirty-six
states were filled during the year, chiefly on recommendations from the Library School office.”87
It is not until May 1932, when the annual report was released for academic year 1931/32,
that the toll of the Great Depression is first chronicled in the pages of the Annual Report.
Assistant Director Amelia Kreig reported that “The number of students enrolled in the Library
School was almost as large as that of the year 1930/31 which had been the largest enrollment in
the history of the school up to that time,” yet “a larger number of first year students had been
accepted but at the last minute an unusually large percentage of them found that adequate funds
were not available and they were obliged to postpone their admission.”88 It appears faculty

workload increased with the worsening of the Depression, with Krieg noting that “The increase
in the number of advanced students was the cause of a great increase in research work which
developed into a heavy burden for faculty members already carrying heavy schedules.”89
Although Kreig reported that enrollment had not decreased significantly, she does
acknowledge that “The year was an unusually harassing one from the standpoint of financial
difficulties. Many students started their training with insufficient funds hoping to obtain
employment or student loans to eke out their money. The situation became more distressing as
banks all over the country continued closing their doors.”90 Furthermore, “while the class of
1929/30 was placed without difficulty, a definite reduction in the number of vacancies reported
became evident in the placing of the class of 1930/31.”91
Kreig’s report indicates that the severity of the Depression had not been well understood
until that academic year: “Unfortunately the great part of the class of 1931/32 had been accepted
for admission before the Library Schools and the profession had become cognizant of the
potential unemployment disaster they faced.”92 Looking at the annual reports for the Library
School at Illinois is one entry point for understanding how one part of the system of information
provision responded to economic crisis. Just as Kramp’s analysis of the annual reports of large
public library systems in the 1930s demonstrated that the impact of the Depression was not
immediately felt in libraries, so can we infer the same from the annual reports of the University
of Illinois’ Library School with regard to library education. Much as the general nadir of the
Depression did not come until 1932, so it was in libraries and library schools.

Similarly, Roger Geiger concluded that “research universities comparatively unscathed by the
effects of the Depression until 1932, almost three years after the initial crash of the stock
market.”93 From 1932 on, however, libraries and library schools became more preoccupied with
finances and budgets. One example can be found in that of librarian Jeannette Howard Foster,
who left her position at Antioch College in 1933 after being informed her pay would be reduced
from $1,500 to $952 per year. Foster opted to accept a fellowship for doctoral study at Chicago’s
Graduate Library School.94 These cuts were felt by various types of libraries, with ALA member
Paul Howard writing in 1939 that “public libraries received their greatest budgets in 1931 and
their smallest budgets in 1933 and 1934.”95 Foster’s experience is also consonant with the
findings of the Pratt Institute’s Josephine Adams, whose 1934 triennial questionnaire “showed
that 63 per cent of our graduates had suffered salary cuts between 1931 and 1934.”96 The
following triennial survey of 1937 found that employment conditions for librarians had improved
considerably.97
But if we take 1932 as the low point, and historians are generally in agreement on this
given the rate of unemployment, it is all the more remarkable when we consider the evidence of
expansion in the system of information provision in the early 1930s. In 1931, the University of
Chicago’s Graduate Library School began publishing The Library Quarterly, a journal which
would be an important source of library research throughout the decade. Just a few years earlier,
in 1926, the University of Chicago had become, with funding from the Carnegie Corporation, the

first to offer a doctoral degree in library science.98 Research published in The Library Quarterly
by Leon Carnovsky, Carleton B. Joeckel, and Louis Round Wilson went on to help ground
arguments for the federal funding for libraries made in the 1930s (see Chapter Five).
This evidence of expansion in the midst of crisis can be found elsewhere in the realm of
library education. Librarian job appointments were a regular feature in Library Journal during
the 1930s, as they are today. Each issue (which in the 1930s appeared biweekly) listed recent job
appointments in various types of libraries. Beginning in 1936, Library Journal also published an
annual list of library school appointments.99 This feature listed graduates by school and identified
each graduate’s job title and place of employment. One may infer that this new feature was
meant to showcase the viability of a career in librarianship. And if the number of new library
school programs that began in the 1930s is any indication, there was a demand for library
training. The years between 1930 and 1939 saw the establishment of eleven new accredited
library schools, including programs at the University of Denver (1931), the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill (1931), and the University of Kentucky (1933).100
Library cooperation became more popular in the 1930s as individual libraries sought to
maintain or even increase services while managing decreases in funding. This kind of
cooperation occurred across and between various types of libraries, including public, academic,
and special (e.g., governmental agency libraries). One example of how this cooperation took on
new vigor in the 1930s was in the establishment of the Association of Research Libraries in
1932.101 I am not arguing that the ARL was established because of the Great Depression, but that

it is reasonable to consider that its having been established during the Depression may have had
an impact on its formation: in how it set priorities and went about accomplishing them. Certainly
there were examples of inter-agency cooperation or professional associations prior to the 1930s.
But that so much of it seemed to bubble up in the 1930s and particularly in the system of
information warrants further consideration. It says quite a lot about the importance of
information provision and cultural production in response to economic crisis, and reimagining a
post-crisis world.

Government Information
It was not only libraries that demonstrated the correlation between economic decline and
the upsurge of information investment. Information provision at various levels of government
become more important during the crisis. This manifested itself in the creation of new statistical
programs and expansion of existing information collecting activities.
Policymakers have long seen the relationship between accurate statistics and adequate
planning. This is evinced in the creation of the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Systematic collection, compilation, and dissemination of demographic information
was seen as necessary for the proper functioning of government and commerce.102 This type of
information activity was seen as a means of properly assessing social conditions, which in turn
allows the electorate, employers, and policymakers to make informed decisions. The basic early
function of census information was to properly apportion votes and allocate the number of
representatives each state should have in Congress. However, although this information was
collected by the government, it was of use to the private sector as well. Employers used census

54

information in deciding how and where to provide commercial services. Both the census and the
Bureau of Labor Statistics expanded their information services during the 1930s. The economic
crisis of the 1930s brought to bear an information crisis through which people realized how
much they did not know, and how much they did not know that they did not know about vital
issues of the day.
Both the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and their roles in economic crisis in
the 1930s have received some treatment by scholars, and I do not mean to reiterate those
findings.103 What I mean to do by calling attention to these events is to situate the work of the
Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the wider system of information provision.
As with other aspects of this system, entities such as the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor
Statistics have been examined in isolation, cut off from their place within the larger framework.
What happened in these agencies is part of the broader transformation of American society and
particularly in the system of information provision; they will be addressed in greater depth in
Chapter Five.
The urgency of economic crisis drove the creation of new information-dependent federal
agencies such as the Social Security Administration. In order to establish and determine
eligibility, the federal government required more stringent development and management of vital
statistics. Social Security required systematically organized and readily accessible records. Until
the 1930s, vital statistics in many localities were handwritten and disorganized, making it all but
impossible to validate access for millions of Americans eligible for Social Security. Similar
problems became evident in other agencies that furnished proof of age information. A 1939
report about WPA workers and the Census Bureau describes some of these problems in detail:

103

Margo J. Anderson, The American Census; Goldberg and Moye, The First Hundred Years of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.

55

“under the old system, the records were preserved in the same volumes in which they had been
originally compiled by the house-to-house canvassers. They were not alphabetically arranged.
They were not even arranged numerically according to street and house number...two years after
the Social Security Act was passed, the Bureau was completely swamped by requests for age
data. Persons desiring this data had to wait as long as six months before their requests could be
handled.” The report goes on to state emphatically that “the modernization of our census records
became imperative.”104 Verifying age information under the previous system took up to six
months, while the new indexing system was purported to take only three minutes. Information
workers were essential for modernizing federal and local record-keeping in the 1930s.
Similar initiatives occurred in other government locations. As the country plunged into
the depths of the Depression in 1931, Congress passed the National Archives Act. In her
Chronology of American Librarianship, Josephine Metcalfe Smith notes that such legislation had
been proposed “as early as 1878,” first by President Rutherford B. Hayes. Beginning in the late
nineteenth century with the rise of the research university and establishment of the historical
profession, historical researchers had argued for a national depository for American records. Yet
it was not until the Great Depression that the National Archives came into being. In the 1930s,
the National Archives played “a leading role in establishing a recognized archival profession in
the United States complete with training and publication programs and a professional
organization.”105
As with the ARL, I am not arguing that the National Archives was established because
there was an economic crisis, but that because the National Archives were established during an

economic crisis, its early formation was shaped by that experience. When Donald R. McCoy
writes that “from its earliest days, the archives aimed at being a coordinated organization dealing
with federal records in diverse ways and providing an unusual range of services for government,
researchers, and ordinary citizens,” we can see that systematization as well as institutionalization
transpired in this context as well during the Depression decade.106 As with library services,
advocates claimed that archives were crucial for political engagement. Robert Binkley wrote:
“The objective of archival policy in a democratic country cannot be the mere saving of paper; it
must be nothing less than the enriching of the complete historical consciousness of the people as
a whole.”107 The development of the National Archives as an institution and the formation of
archival policy are another indicator of a dynamism during the crisis years.
Still another prominent and rapidly changing federal information agency of the 1930s
was the National Agricultural Library. The NAL of the 1930s was a focal point of the system of
information provision’s transformation, at the intersection of librarianship, government
information, and documentalism. In the mid-1930s, the NAL “entered into a far-reaching
cooperative arrangement with the American Documentation Institute and the Science Service.”
This cooperative agreement launched the Bibliofilm Service, “the first experimental center for
supplying microfilm and photocopies of articles on a large-scale to scientific workers.”108 In the
next chapter I will offer some explanations for why the NAL became the site for such
groundbreaking work. For now it is enough to emphasize that the projects initiated under the
NAL were emblematic of the kinds of broader changes occurring on the federal level in the
1930s. The NAL of the 1930s also underscores once more the importance of cooperation

between different types of organizations. Outside of libraries, the Joint Committee on Materials
for Research and the American Documentation Institute were arguably the most pivotal nongovernmental and non-commercial organizations in the larger system of information provision.

Scholarly Societies
The Joint Committee on Materials for Research (JCMR) was established in 1929 by
members of the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) and the American Council of Learned
Societies (ACLS)—hence the “joint committee.” The SSRC and ACLS established the JCMR as
a means of exploring methods of reproducing research materials. They wished to determine the
best possible methods, with best in this case meaning long-lasting and easily shared. They set out
to establish uniform standards for reproducing research materials, including but not limited to
monographs, periodicals, pamphlets, photographs, slides, and sound recordings. An article from
a 1937 issue of Library Journal describes the purpose of the JCMR as “the enlargement,
improvement and the better preservation of materials for research.”109 Leadership of the JCMR
primarily fell to historian Robert C. Binkley of Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
Notable JCMR board members included Harry Lydenberg, director of the New York Public
Library, Solon Buck, second Archivist of the United States, and eminent archival theorist T.R.
Schellenberg. Together these men represented the interests of librarians, historians, archivists,
and the emergent area of documentalism, forerunner of information science. Binkley and the
Committee published two key texts in the 1930s: Methods of Reproducing Research Materials in

Materials for Research initially focused on these problems of scholars and libraries, with
emphasis on the possibility that the new technologies of reproduction, in both paper and
film, could solve them by creating a new pattern of communication. They could, Binkley
envisioned, diffuse among libraries the source materials for research, and then
inexpensively disseminate the results of the scholar's work, even assist in the note taking
and document gathering inherent in the process.111

Binkley was a key figure in hastening the transformation of the system of information
provision in the 1930s, with obvious evidence being his simultaneous involvement in WPA
library projects, the American Documentation Institute, and the Joint Committee on Materials for
Research. His death in 1940 from lung cancer ended what was by all accounts an extraordinary
life cut short. As a strong advocate for microfilm in libraries and other institutions, Binkley also
played a role in the transformation of technology, access, and policy in the 1930s, which I
discuss in subsequent chapters.
Other scholars have identified Binkley’s significance, including Irene Farkas-Conn, who
discusses Binkley’s contributions in the context of documentalism and the history of information
science.112 Farkas-Conn has written a definitive account of the origins of information science in

the 1930s, chronicling how the American Documentation Institute evolved into the American
Society for Information Science (later the Association for Information Science and Technology,
or ASIS&T). She devotes a significant portion of her study to events and people of the 1930s,
when microfilm was heralded as an extraordinary breakthrough. Colin Burke agrees that
documentalists saw “microfilm as the basis for a data and information revolution.”113
Insufficient research exists on the documentalist/information science projects incubated
by the WPA, but the available scholarship suggests that such endeavors were as imaginative and
large in scope as other information projects. The Math Tables Project employed “human
computers”—people who mass-produced mathematical calculations for research applications.
David Alan Grier writes how the Math Tables Project “reflected the idealism of President
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,” although he adds that “the Math Tables Project... succeeded as
a computing organization because it was led by two highly motivated scientists who were
determined to see it succeed.”114 This point could be made more broadly about WPA projects.
Just as Arnold Lowan and Gertrude Blanch were determined to see the Math Tables Project
succeed, the same could be said of Luther Evans and the Historical Records Survey, or Douglas
McMurtrie and the American Imprints Inventory.
It is essential to keep in mind that none of these agencies functioned in isolation from one
another. As already mentioned, part of what characterized the system of information provision
and the general experience of relief efforts in the 1930s was a spirit of cooperation. Sometimes
this cooperation was financial, such as in the way the WPA provided federal funds while
requiring the host community to contribute a portion. The cooperation could involve the sharing

of physical resources, such as documents or equipment. Cooperation also meant sharing of labor
across agencies and institutions. There were many examples of this, some of which are described
in this dissertation.
We would be hard-pressed to find an information agency or institution for which the
Great Depression was an outright boon. Yet, because of the spurred creativity and innovative
ways of organizing, collection, using information, revival and reimagining form a part of the
experience of the Great Depression was the story of.

Information and Culture in the 1930s
What is the relationship between the system of information provision and cultural
projects of the 1930s? The relief projects of the 1930s in their diversity hearkens back to the
early twentieth century labor slogan “Bread and Roses”: there was a simultaneous call for
economic relief as well as a restoration of human dignity. In his history of the CIO, Robert
Zieger argues that the 1930s saw a resurgence of radical activism in the labor movement which
had not been seen in the United States since before the onset of the First World War.115 During
the 1930s activists fought against both impoverishment of the economy as well as the spirit. The
system of information provision did more than offer data in service of economic recovery, it also
nurtured the human spirit. No less than Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins herself said of
libraries: “It is fortunate that at a time when the practical rewards of effort are at their low point,
the opportunities for men and women to expand their mental outlook are better than ever
before.”116 Libraries were needed, it was argued, to meet innate human needs for intellectual

stimulation, political engagement, and recreation.
The cultural projects supported by the WPA presumed a similar lofty purpose, as it was
felt that access to a shared culture was part of a healthy functioning democratic society. This is
demonstrated not only in the number of cultural projects but also in their variety and diversity,
and especially, as Michael Denning has extensively documented, the radical political character
that coursed through so many of those projects, whose influence has reverberated and been felt
through subsequent decades. The system of information provision was asked to contribute to this
broader commitment to cultural enhancement.
In the 1930s’ United States, the need for a differently organized and enlarged system of
information provision became urgent. Toward the end of the decade, this urgency was further
heightened by the rise of totalitarianism abroad. Information provision was then emphasized not
only as a means of mitigating economic crisis but a sustaining factor in public participation and
democratic governance and civic life. Shortly after assuming his post as Librarian of Congress in
1939, Archibald MacLeish declared that “those of us who are concerned, for whatever reason,
with the preservation of the civilization and the inherited culture of this nation find ourselves in a
situation in which time is running out, not like sand in the glass, but like the blood in an opened
artery.”117 In a special issue of Libraries and the Cultural Record on the history of libraries and
information institutions in wartime, Michèle V. Cloonan writes that
The twentieth century, a time of maturation for the fields of preservation and
conservation, was also perhaps one of the bloodiest centuries on record. It is ironic that
the period that fostered new technologies to aid conservation for paper records in danger
of deterioration or damage was also the century that hosted two world wars and many
other world conflicts. The number of items destroyed over the last hundred years
probably exceeds the number saved.118

62

Here Cloonan argues that there is a moral impetus toward cultural preservation, though
precisely defining morality depends on context and therefore can be difficult. This moral
imperative to preserve acquired mounting importance in preservation as well as generation,
collection, organization, and dissemination. Cloonan writes about “the notion of cultural
stewardship.” This impetus to cultural stewardship animated the activities of workers in the US
agencies in new and innovative ways.
Much as the wartime mobilization of the 1940s was seen as a culmination of WPA
projects and the full realization of Keynesianism, so too could the efforts of the 1930s be seen as
a necessary precursor to the many successful wartime information projects. One example of this
relationship is that Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish went on to direct the War
Department’s Office of Facts and Figures and serve as assistant director of the Office of War
Information.119 New information services were established to meet the needs of American
defense efforts. While it could be argued that the war helped spur the renewal of information
services, it is more accurate to say that American officials in the Second World War were able to
take needed advantage of a system of information provision which had already been newly
reorganized, systematized, and expanded.120 By the start of World War Two, federal information
provision had already been reintegrated into everyday life, and a flourishing system had been
prioritized as being in the national interest. While wartime information needs highlighted gaps, it
also demonstrated how many had been filled through the many projects undertaken throughout
the 1930s.
While there is evidence of interagency cooperation before the 1930s, it is clear that
cooperative efforts accelerated during the Great Depression as a response to economic crisis.

This cooperative approach was encouraged and facilitated by the federal government, but it is
likely that even without government incentive, economic crisis would have spurred interagency
cooperation. This cooperation extended not only to the organizations themselves, but to the goals
within and amongst them. This is made manifest in the overlaps between technology, access, and
policy.

Conclusion
The experience of the Great Depression forced Americans from all walks of life to
grapple with severe economic deprivation. At the same time, it also served to propel an
expansion of cultural enrichment, of which the system of information provision played a central
role. In the 1930s there was a dual concern for how to effectively manage information and
harness it to ameliorate the economic crisis. I argue that the 1930s was more than a period of
time between the Roaring Twenties and the Second World War. The decade was a period of
transformation, and while these changes have been sometimes glimpsed, they have yet to be fully
understood.
A number of scholars have identified different facets of the 1930s that are important for
this dissertation. Yet we have lacked a synthetic account of the system of information provision
during this decade. Seen separately from one another, these changes seem perhaps no more than
that - changes. Taken in aggregate, we can identify a bigger and more profound shift. Scholars
have covered technology, access, and policy in the system of information provision in the 1930s,
albeit in a fragmented way. The following chapters will more closely examine these core vectors
of transformation and set them in relationship to one another.

CHAPTER THREE:
TECHNOLOGY AND THE SYSTEM OF INFORMATION PROVISION

Introduction
That libraries and other information organizations devised and employed technologies in
the pre-computer era has long been known. JoAnne Yates’ Control Through Communication
demonstrates how the invention and application of such innovations as the typewriter and filing
cabinet enabled the rise of the modern corporation, emphasizing the vital importance of
information management, while Wayne Wiegand’s biography of Melvil Dewey contains
extensive descriptions of how libraries at the turn of the last century used numerous devices to
more efficiently access, store, duplicate, and deliver materials. The modern library of the late
nineteenth century employed vertical files, card catalogues, and typewriters.1 David Alan Grier
has pointed out that human computers worked out elaborate calculations both by hand and with
the aid of tabulating machines before the invention of the electronic computer.2 Michael
Buckland wrote in 2006 that although “it is widely assumed that information science and modern
information technology were developments that followed World War II…a wide range of
developments in information technology, including radio, television, movies, punch cards,
microfilm, digital circuitry, and photoelectric sensing devices, were already well developed by
1945.”3 Elsewhere, Buckland has claimed that while libraries were innovative in the late
nineteenth and late twentieth centuries, there was a lag in between. In this chapter, I provide

evidence for why I think libraries substantially engaged with “technical and technological
experimentation and innovation” in the 1930s.4
In this chapter, I will focus on technology-related changes in the system of information
provision. Although I will pay particular attention to microfilm, I will also look at other
technological advances in data processing and information retrieval, such as human computers
and tabulating machines. Items from the papers of the Joint Committee on Materials for
Research will figure prominently in this chapter. Because of its involvement in the Bibliofilm
Service, I will also focus on archival materials from the National Agricultural Library. I highlight
the ways in which cooperation amongst a range of actors made these activities possible. I
consider the ways that developments in information technology affected the system of
information provision, and the extent to which New Deal librarianship was reorganized around
information technology.
With the advent of industrialized processes in the nineteenth century, information
technologies became more ubiquitous, as well as faster and more efficient. As machines for
producing, disseminating, and storing information became more sophisticated, some advocates
suggested that judicious application of these technologies could usher in a more humane society.5
This enthusiasm exploded again in the 1930s, with the adoption of a much-heralded new
technology: microfilm. Librarians and other scholars sought to adopt microfilm because of its
potential to better organize materials and enhance access. But perhaps more compellingly, some
of these early adopters harbored utopian aspirations for microfilm, and considered it the most

significant technological advancement since the invention of the printing press.6 They foresaw a
network of libraries equipped with microfilm readers where users would be able to rapidly access
an extraordinary array of information.
Scholars such as Irene Farkas-Conn and Kenneth Carpenter have already documented
some of the ways that information technology changed, and changed libraries, in the 1930s.
These works suggest that there was a transformation around technology. In her history of the
origins of documentalism and the American Documentation Institute/American Society for
Information Science (today the Association for Information Science and Technology, or
ASIS&T), Irene Farkas-Conn observes “The early years of the ADI coincided with the period
when dissemination of documents and the organization, communication, and retrieval of
information were undergoing critical changes. Technologies opened opportunities for delivering
research materials to users. Libraries and information services had to reevaluate their functions.
Newer and more powerful technologies allowed institutions to offer services merely envisioned
earlier but which users soon came to expect.”7
As business historian James Cortada noted in 1995, “it is becoming increasingly obvious
that too little is known about the role of technology on the economy during this period. What
little is known indicates that technology was more significant than previously understood.”8
Technology intertwined with access and policy changes in the system of information provision.
Second, and perhaps most critical in terms of how my work contributes to the history of LIS and

social histories of the 1930s more generally, I also emphasize how scholars and practitioners
pushed for these changes in direct response to the crisis of the 1930s. I do not mean to suggest a
simple cause and effect relationship: i.e., because of the Great Depression, scholars and
practitioners pushed for changes in the system of information provision. Many of the changes
pushed for in the 1930s had precedents. The Great Depression did not cause microfilm,
automated processes, or other technological innovations to become widely embraced in the
1930s. Rather, scholars and practitioners discerned opportunities that had not existed before.
They saw that technological innovations provided possible creative solutions to dire problems
created by economic collapse.
Closely related to these issues concerning technology are others pertaining to
“organization.” Organization may refer to the actual structures of organization (e.g.,
classification schemes), and it may also refer to the means of organization, such as information
technology. Formal US classification schemes did not undergo any fundamental shift in the
1930s, which is why they are not a central component of my research. Nevertheless, questions of
organization and how they could be addressed via appropriate technical applications/solutions
assumed great importance during the decade.9 The growth of the research university and of
industrial research in large hi-tech corporations saw an accompanying growth in scientific and
scholarly publishing. As a result, professionals became more concerned about how to manage the
ever-growing body of new publications.10 At the same time, this expansion in the volume of

the first volume until 1940. The BBC never supplanted more established US classification schemes (Dewey and
Library of Congress), and has enjoyed greater popularity in the UK. See Alan R. Thomas, “Bibliographical

contemporary material also highlighted the extent to which historical holdings lacked full
documentation. One of the central solutions to the problems of efficient information storage and
retrieval in this context was microfilm.
Microfilm (also referred to in contemporary literature as “microphotography” or
“microphotographic processing”) is a process by which images are captured and stored on 16 or
35-millimeter film reels for use with a projecting apparatus. First invented in 1839, its utility as a
means of information storage accelerated in the 1920s. Microfilm was arguably the most
enthusiastically promoted information technology of the 1930s, particularly in libraries. The
most comprehensive history on microfilm is Susan Cady’s 1994 dissertation. Cady chronicles the
history of microfilm from its invention in 1839 through its more tenuous status in the early
1990s.11 All histories of microfilm concur that enthusiasm and advocacy soared in the 1930s,
especially amongst librarians and information workers. The overall social transformation of the
1930s likewise spurred great changes in technological innovation. This became all the more
crucial with the implementation of the New Deal, the creation of which necessitated the more
efficient management of vast quantities of information.

Works Progress Administration and Technology
Several projects initiated under the Works Progress Administration demonstrated that
modern information technology—including microfilm but also automated processes, tabulating
machines, indexing methods, and card files—was not only useful but crucial, and that old
methods of organizing information and information retrieval were becoming at best inefficient.

University, 1994).
11

69

Proponents argued that the complexity of modern life instilled growing requirements for rapid,
efficient record-keeping, access, and retrieval.

Computing Technology
The urgency of more timely and reliable information was brought home by New Deal
attempts aimed at ameliorating the economic downturn. An existing agency, the Census Bureau,
also took a pioneering role; by the end of the 1930s the Census Bureau “was a leader in the new
technology of automated analysis of statistics. This position resulted from the use of punch card
equipment developed earlier by Herman Hollerith, a former employee of the Census Bureau...in
the 1940s the Census Bureau played a major role in developing the earliest electronic digital
computers.”12 Government agencies and libraries, therefore, and not only corporations, placed
value “on control and feedback mechanisms derived from the better management of
information... institutions valued information-handling tools even in the most difficult times,
both in depression and in war.”13 Technological transformation in the system of information
provision was especially noteworthy in the case of the Works Progress Administration.
The 1930s saw significant innovations in computing developments, both human and
machine. The WPA employed human computers: people who performed elaborate large-scale
mathematical calculations. David Alan Grier writes that three important computing machines
were developed in the 1930s through WPA-sponsored projects, and that “the three machines
show how inventors adapted new technologies and new devices to the operations of computing
laboratories.”14 One of the computing machines originated in the Iowa State Statistical

Laboratory, and by 1937 “it received $35,000 a year to do tabulations and analyses for the WPA
and for the U.S. Department of Agriculture... Its staff processed data on farm production,
analyzed crop experiments, and identified the trends in agricultural markets.”
The largest and one of the most successful human computing projects was the
Mathematical Tables Project, also a WPA-sponsored endeavor. Grier attests that by 1940, “it
stood as the largest scientific computing organization in the United States, dwarfing the
combined staff of the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the American Nautical Almanac, the Thomas J.
Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau, and the mathematics division of Bell Telephone
Laboratories. The WPA computing floor was home to three hundred computers.”15

Modernization of Records
Modernization of records was another site of technological transformation in the 1930s.
WPA projects on local, state, and federal levels converted handwritten, disorganized records to
ones that were typed and indexed. The creation of New Deal agencies such as the Social Security
Administration made quick access to these records crucial. WPA projects indexed several
million public records. Indexing the 1920 census alone produced more than 57 million cards;
indexing Ellis Island’s records produced records for 18 million immigrants.16 Press releases
boasted that prior to the indexing projects, records requests could take up to several weeks to
process; after indexing systems were put in place, the necessary information could be located in
three to five minutes.17 A “gigantic” nationwide indexing project of 21 million immigration

records was described as being “geared to quick search.”18
Changes in indexing technology provide further evidence of how government records
were modernized under the WPA, specifically in how the WPA embraced the Soundex system.
First introduced in 1918, Soundexing is probably best known today by people who conduct
genealogical research. As a method, Soundexing attempts to accommodate variations in spelling.
With the influx of immigrants and therefore “foreign sounding” names in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, this was seen as a needed innovation for indexing census records from
1880-1920. In a press release issued by the WPA in 1939 entitled “WPA-Alphabetized Census
Will Save Time and Money,” the use and value of Soundexing is described as though it had been
thoroughly tested and proven to be a superior indexing system: “The first task, that of
alphabetizing the 1900 census under the modern Soundex code system, was completed in St.
Louis last year. This city was selected because it had available at the time one of the largest
pools of unemployed white-collar workers.”19 Because of the success of the St. Louis project,
Soundexing of the 1920 census followed in short order: “The second and even larger task, of
alphabetizing the 1920 census, is now under way in New York City. It is said to be the largest
alphabetizing job in the history of the world.”20 Soundexing was not implemented as a uniform
method for all indexing projects undertaken in the 1930s: it was specifically applied for the
indexing of census records to optimize search and retrieval. However, it was illustrative of both
the scale and innovation with regard to information organization in the 1930s.

Microfilm and the WPA
Microfilm figured into WPA-sponsored records projects as well, especially those projects
co-sponsored by libraries. In a press release publicizing a Toledo newspaper indexing project,
Florence Kerr emphasized the practical advantages of microfilmed sources: “The indexes and
films will be of unusual value to research workers, historians, high school and college students,
lawyers, newspapermen, statisticians and economists. Reels of film only require 1/200 of the
space used by cumbersome volumes now in use and thus will be better protected from fire and
water hazards. Estimates show that 6,500 rolls of film in 546 reels were used a day. The film, a
cellulose acetate fine-grain safety type, will last a few hundred years.”21 Advocates embraced
and promoted the practical advantages of innovation in information technology. Press releases
for WPA projects frequently mentioned the integral role of efficient information retrieval and the
need for efficient accompanying technical systems. An illustrative example is the Union Index to
Medical Lore. This Boston-based project involved 75 libraries “cooperating to provide a union
catalogue covering nearly a million volumes of medical lore contained in these libraries. This
catalogue is the first devoted solely to scientific works and will prove of inestimable value to
those who constantly refer to medical literature—particularly to physicians.”22
The Boston project was the fourth of its kind instituted under the WPA. Florence Kerr,
assistant director of the WPA, wrote that

“The first of the series was launched in Philadelphia. That project set the mould and developed
the techniques. For in the Quaker City relief workers copied and indexed some four million
volumes. This union catalogue, widely used by scholars and by the public in general, is now at
the Pennsylvania Historical Society. A second project followed at Cleveland, Ohio. There WPA
workers produced a catalogue of some three million volumes. Still a third was set up in the
nation’s capital to concentrate at the Library of Congress all records of volumes scattered
through public, private, and government libraries.”23
Kerr emphasized the role of cooperation, stating that “Like all others, this project is
sponsored by local city and state institutions. Among them are the Massachusetts State Library,
which is the principal sponsor, the Boston Medical Library, the Massachusetts Medical Society,
the City Hospital, and the State Departments of Public Health and of Mental Diseases.”24
Microfilmed records were also part of this massive indexing project, with Kerr writing that “in
some cities the motion picture camera has been used to speed up part of the operations. This was
the case in Washington, D.C., where whole library catalogues were run through
microphotographic machines.” With or without microfilm, WPA records projects of the 1930s
were undertaken on an unprecedentedly large scale. By 1938, WPA workers had “catalogued a
total of eighteen and a quarter million volumes for various libraries, and for all institutions they
have indexed a total of a quarter of a billion items.”25
New Deal labor helped improve and modernize cataloging practices in libraries. “The
most important work of all” began with the involvement of the CWA and the Civil Works
Service (CWS) at the Boston Public Library, where relief workers made it possible for the card
catalog to undergo a “complete overhauling.”26 Similarly, the Iowa State College Library
benefited greatly from CWS labor on updating their catalogs, including making the transition
from Dewey to Library of Congress Classification. Thanks to the work of the CWA assistants,

the Library reported they accomplished more on the conversion in one year than they had in the
previous eight.27 Relief workers helped more libraries update their catalogs

Libraries and Technology
Interest in technology characterized libraries of the 1930s as much as interests in access
and policy. While much of librarians’ technological enthusiasm centered on microfilm, other
technological innovations were embraced and promoted as well. Librarians had long been
interested in how automated processes could make their work more efficient, and this continued.
The growth of interest in radio, union catalogs, indexes, filing systems, and automated processes
were all aspects of the technological transformation in libraries of the 1930s. Cooperative
cataloging is discussed more in depth in the chapter on access (Chapter Four).

Microfilm and Libraries
We see some evidence of the American Library Association suggesting the use of
microfilm in libraries in the 1920s, but it did not become a regular feature in Library Journal
until the 1930s. Advocates promoted microphotography for use in a variety of library
applications. One librarian demonstrated how microfilm could be used as a means of verifying
authenticity of rare materials.28 Librarians also mentioned the importance of adopting new
technologies in order to keep pace with the ways young people used and accessed information,
and the necessity for libraries to be cutting edge—similar to the twenty-first century

preoccupation with accommodating the technological habits of young patrons.29 More often than
not, microfilm was touted as an inexpensive means of preserving and storing print materials.
Efforts to streamline the use of microphotography and automated processes in libraries
and related information organizations were already underway prior to the onset of the Great
Depression, and indeed before anyone knew how long the technologies might persist. Key
visionaries seized the crisis decade as an opportunity to explore technological applications,
including in light of arguments that information poverty existed, and had real economic and
political consequences. Increasingly, lack of access to information in the 1930s was framed as
deprivation which inhibited people from full economic and political participation in American
society. Economic justifications for microfilm preceded the Great Depression; however, once the
economic crisis set it, the economics of microfilm assumed even greater importance.
Libraries were ideal demonstrations sites for the promoting the adoption of microfilm.
Librarians such as the New York Public Library’s Louis Fox called microfilm a “miraculous
accomplishment.”30 They held large collections of scholarly and popular resources (e.g., rare
books, manuscripts, magazines and newspapers). Libraries struggled to balance frequency of use
with the needs of preservation. Printed works are more likely to deteriorate the more frequently
they are used, yet the modern library of the 1930s (as opposed to during earlier periods) was
distinctive in its openness to access. How might libraries circulate items as much as users desired
without destroying them—especially in the case of fragile or rare works. Microfilm was seen as a
boon to libraries in that the original source material could circulate far less frequently, if at all.

Proponents saw in microfilm the achievement of the twin aspirations of maximizing access and
preservation. Microfilm also enhanced access because it often could be duplicated and shared
more economically than paper. The size of microfilm and the amount of information that could
be stored on a reel made shipping more manageable in terms of weight and size. For these same
reasons, microfilm was also touted as an ideal medium with regard to storage. Scholars were
concerned moreover, that, with the surge in scholarly production, libraries would face imminent
storage problems.
Thomas Augst describes how “the advent of microfilm helped to speed a transformation
already under way of academic institutions into centers for the advancement of learning, bound
by specialized standards of training and inquiry, disciplinary associations and professional
organizations, and the dissemination of a common research archive.” In this assessment we
perhaps see shades of the kinds of contemporary re-imagined library spaces such as “information
commons.” Augst says microfilm was appealing because of the seemingly endless possibilities
for enhancing access, it “would preserve and make accessible newspapers, periodicals, card
catalogues, and scholarly publications, but also manuscript materials, images, and imprints that
had been preserved by libraries because of their uniqueness or rarity.”31
Brown University librarian Rozelle Parker Johnson wrote in 1935 that when she began
exploring the application of microfilm in libraries earlier in the decade, she had encountered
skepticism and discouragement from some scholars. At a 1932 meeting at the American
Philological Association, Johnson said “the majority” of those in attendance saw microfilm as
having “peculiar drawbacks.”32 When Johnson inquired about bringing a camera into libraries

and making her own negatives, she encountered similar difficulties, writing that she “gained no
encouragement from some of the leading scholars with whom I discussed the problem.” Yet it
seems that by the end of the 1930s, librarianship had thoroughly warmed up to microfilm.
Herbert Bruncken of the Milwaukee Public Library proclaimed in 1938 that “microphotography
is no longer a theory or an experiment; it is now regarded as a practical and sole solution for the
preservation of printed matter.”33
If not outright opposing microfilm, some advocated caution in how to proceed with its
adoption. These words of caution came from even the most enthusiastic proponents of microfilm.
They feared that if microfilm were incorporated hastily without regard to technical
standardization or specification, it would risk obsolescence. Thus as early microfilm advocate
Verneur Pratt argued in 1936: “we should study deeply the problems involved and not permit
ourselves to adopt methods which analysis will prove are either basically unsound or at best
temporary expedients.”34 Pratt noted that previous advances in general film techniques could and
should be taken into account with the adoption of microfilm. However, he was also concerned in
part that previous specifications could hinder microfilm’s structural development, noting that
“some city streets are narrow and crooked because they follow former cow-paths.”35 Pratt felt
that microfilm was early enough in its infancy that standards had not become entirely fixed, and
that this was a good thing. It was an opportunity to ask whether previously set film standards
were optimal for the microfilming of books and periodicals. Pratt asked, for example, whether 35
millimeter or 16 millimeter widths were ideal or even appropriate. Pratt commanded some

authority in the field of microfilming print materials, as he was founder and President of the
International Filmbook Corporation.
The integration of microfilm into library collections also raised question about how to
organize microfilmed items and make them accessible, as traditional cataloging rules did not
precisely apply.36 There were other constraints in the way besides technical concerns. Any
enthusiasm for microfilm’s adoption had to be tempered by the realities of copyright law.37 For
items in the public domain, this was obviously a moot point; however, one of the chief interests
of microfilm proponents was the reproduction of current scholarly publications, i.e., copyrighted
materials. While the technology existed to cheaply reproduce, share, and store microfilm, the
ability to do so raised questions about what constituted fair use in the context of the new
medium. Copyright was one of the many issues tackled by the Joint Committee on Materials for
Research and the American Documentation Institute, the two most visible institutional advocates
for microfilm’s adoption in the 1930s.

Charting the Course of Technology: Joint Committee on Materials for Research and the
American Documentation Institute
Vigorous promotion by libraries and by the Joint Committee on Materials for Research
aided the process of incorporating microfilm widely into WPA labor programs. Members of the
Social Science Research Council (SSRC) and the American Council of Learned Societies
(ACLS) established the Joint Committee on Materials for Research (JCMR) in 1929 as a means
of exploring methods of reproducing research materials, and it became the first concerted and

organized effort in support of microfilm. They wished to determine the best possible methods,
with best in this case meaning long-lasting and easily shared. They set out to establish uniform
standards for reproducing research materials, including but not limited to monographs,
periodicals, pamphlets, photographs, slides, and sound recordings. In retrospect, this was not an
auspicious moment to inaugurate or pioneer such an ambitious endeavor, as outcomes were
uncertain in terms of the viability of microfilm in both technical practical terms and general
attitude. Would information professionals and users want to use microfilm, either in addition to
print formats or as a substitute?
An article from a 1937 issue of Library Journal describes the origins of the JCMR,
identifying the impetus to its creation as being “the enlargement, improvement and the better
preservation of materials for research.”38 Librarian and historian Robert C. Binkley of Western
Reserve University in Cleveland chaired the committee.39 Using contemporary terms, the JCMR
sought to better support scholars, scientists, and librarians through the information lifecycle with
the aid of paper and film reproduction technologies. Incorporating microfilm into libraries,
government agencies, and research groups would aid scholars in research, dissemination, and
preservation. Information would become more widely available and expenses would be reduced.
Binkley and Lydenberg first met when Binkley reportedly sent his large first-year English
class to the New York Public Library (NYPL) with the directive to use available primary sources
for a report on the Spanish Armada. While Lydenberg was pleased that an instructor felt so
strongly about having students engage directly with primary sources, he was dismayed by the
overuse. Several items in the NYPL’s Elizabethan documentary collections were destroyed after
being repeatedly handled in a short space of time, and Lydenberg consequently felt obliged to

impose restrictions on use by undergraduates. Lydenberg spoke with Binkley directly, and
although Lydenberg was distressed about the deterioration of the NYPL collections at the hands
of Binkley’s students, Binkley himself made a positive first impression on him. Binkley also
came to see through this incident “the librarian’s problem of reconciling maximum use of
research materials in the present with their preservation for future generations.”40 Kenneth
Carpenter wrote that “Binkley was, along with Lydenberg, his closest colleague on the
committee, a pioneer in concern about preservation.”41 Irene Farkas-Conn also discusses the
importance of Binkley’s contributions to the development of documentalism in the 1930s, and on
the subsequent development of the field of information science.42
The origins of information science and the genealogy of the Association for Information
Science and Technology (ASIS&T) have been well-documented.43 Science Service, begun in
1921 as a scientific research news service, was the fore-runner to the American Documentation
Institute (ADI). Watson Davis served as director of Science Service before founding the ADI.
Having an organization devoted to the development and promotion of microfilm was the key
motivating factor for Davis in starting the ADI.

Microfilm, the JCMR, and the ADI
Binkley and the JCMR were directly involved in the development of the ADI, with
Binkley serving as vice president. As such, Binkley was regularly in touch with founding

president Watson Davis. In a letter from Binkley to Davis dated April 13, 1937, Binkley suggests
all filming projects needed a central registry, “an informational clearinghouse.”44 This
information clearinghouse would serve two functions: demonstrate the applied use of microfilm,
and provide information about microfilming applications. Binkley writes “I would suggest that
we do not now indicate to the public that we contemplate explorations in the bibliographic
field… that would give us more enemies than friends.”45 What did Binkley mean? Binkley and
other JCMR members imagined that microfilm could do more than provide supplemental access;
they envisioned a future where monographs would be printed and distributed on microfilm.
Binkley anticipated that publishers might not warm to this idea immediately. Therefore, in order
to ease print bibliophiles into a microfilm future, Binkley suggested promoting microfilm
initially for producing out of print books.
Engendering positive attitudes toward microfilm was on the minds of its proponents.
Emanuel Goldberg, a pioneer and early proponent of microfilm, imagined that entire books could
be stored on the space of a square inch.46 People like Binkley and other evangelists for microfilm
were simultaneously enthusiastic about the utility of microfilm yet aware that users (lay users
and scholars alike) might not immediately embrace microfilm as a medium, let alone as a
substitute for original texts. It seems that Binkley and others foresaw, if not a paperless future,
then one in which reliance on print information was drastically reduced. Yet, they were sensitive
to the idea that users might find microfilm aesthetically distasteful. Thus proponents sought to
improve physical aspects of microfilm access at first through research, experimentation, and
standardization. This cohort of technology innovators sensed that still other formidable issues

might impinge on microfilm’s implementation. In a letter from Binkley to Robert Crane of SSRC
dated April 17, 1937, he writes “the more successfully we develop auxiliary channels of
publication to clear the bottle-neck of publication, the more definitely we must face the problem
of establishing some kind of psychological reward to replace that which book authorship has
hitherto given to book authors.”47 This suggests that microfilming will transform the very
landscape of scholarly publishing and somehow displace monograph publishing. However, the
efficiency, utility, and superiority, and perhaps also the personal advantage of microfilm as a
medium had to be clearly demonstrated first. Once people could see the practical upsides of
microfilm, they would be more open to letting go of any sentiment for or emotional attachment
to print. Similarly Ralph Carruthers acknowledges that “to make the fullest use of the new
techniques we must also change our attitude toward them and their products.”48
Sentimental association with print might constitute a barrier to the adoption of what was
seen as the far more practical and useful platform—microfilm. However frustrating or irritating
or illogical sentiment might seem, microfilm proponents recognized that it was a real issue that
needed to be addressed thoroughly in order to advance the widespread adoption of this
information technology. They looked ahead of contemporary developments in order to forecast
that a real crisis in scholarly publishing would eventually come, at which point output would
overwhelm traditional production formats and methods of organization, storage, and retrieval. A
thoughtful intervention was required which would not only solve immediate problems of
production, access, and storage, but also adapt to and support the ongoing evolution of academic
publishing.

Microfilm was heralded as the most revolutionary information technology of its time, the
most significant advance since the invention of Gutenberg’s press, with one librarian speculating
in 1937 that microfilm “may prove to be as important to the dissemination of knowledge as the
invention of movable type.”49 Klaus Musmann wrote in 1993 that “many of these early
predictions equaled, if not exceeded, the current trend for extolling the virtues of the computer
and its impact on the future of libraries.”50 While microfilm was often lauded with great
hyperbole, there are writings from the period that more soberly emphasize its practical
applications. JCMR Executive Secretary T.R. Schellenberg identified three main reasons why
microfilm offered “the greatest possibilities of serving library needs:” cost, preservation, and
access.51
Microfilm was seen as not only the technology for the information of the future, but for
archiving information from the past as well. In what sounds like a harbinger of Google Books
and other contemporary mass digitization efforts, Library Journal reported that publishing house
Edwards Brothers “sent out an invitation to the principal libraries in this country and abroad,
signed by the librarians of Yale, Harvard, Michigan, and the New York Public Library, to
participate in a project consisting of copying on 35 mm. film all books printed in English before
1550 to be found in libraries which will permit them to be copied.”52 Library Journal also
reported on a similar initiative launched in 1937 by “Science Service in cooperation with the
newly formed American Documentation Institute” to issue classic science texts on microfilm,
with works by Charles Darwin to comprise the first two slots.53

One of the obvious attributes of microfilming rare books was that users could access
information without fear of corrupting, damaging, or destroying the source material. Advocates
touted microfilm as the cheaper, more durable, compact alternative to print. For this reason,
historians were amongst the strongest advocates of microfilm.54 In the interest of preservation,
access to original prints of rare books had to be limited. With microfilm, one did not have to
choose between access and preservation, since microfilm was inherently geared toward both.
Microfilm had another application for rare books. Photographic reproduction was praised
as a means of authenticating rare documents. Fake copies circulated out of ignorance or deceit
could be exposed as counterfeits in a cost-effective and easy way. This was not merely a matter
of lining up a photograph of an original next to the purported authentic copy. Photography was
used to magnify and then enlarge key identifying aspects for comparison. Microphotography
could enhance images and show much finer detail than could be detected with the naked eye.
Furthermore, projection equipment allowed the enhanced and enlarged images to be viewed
simultaneously. Theoretically a user could apply an apparatus such as a magnifying glass for a
similar purpose, but could not view more than one item at a time. In an article published in a
February 1938 issue of Library Journal, Dr. L. Bendikson wrote that any number of goodlooking forgeries could be in circulation, and they could be of such a high quality as to fool even
scholars and seasoned collectors appraising scale copies.55
Another argument in favor of microfilm was its usefulness as a backup for printed works.
Binkley wrote to Professor James T. Shotwell of the American National Committee in April
1937 that “The Historical Records Survey photographed 200,000 pages of the oldest local
archives in Indiana. Then came the flood, which destroyed all the originals. The micro-copies are

safe in the State Historical Society. This, it seems to me, is a lesson.”56 Apparently this was to be
of use in demonstrating practical utility and perhaps urgency of microfilm to Europeans. The
looming threat of war in Europe spurred microfilm advocates into action. In a March, 1937 letter
from William Warner Bishop of the University of Michigan Library to Waldo Leland:
“Personally, I am very seriously concerned with the effect on the great libraries of air raids,
should war unfortunately break out in Europe. I found many of my English friends equally
apprehensive. I am quite sure that we can’t begin by stressing the possibility of insurance against
this type of loss, which is inherent in the whole film project.”57 Microfilming was heralded as a
way to make collections less vulnerable to the destruction wrought by war. States-side, Library
Journal reported in 1937 that “the Historical Records Survey of the WPA has recently made a
beginning on what is hoped will develop into a nationwide plan to microfilm important state and
local public records which deserve preservation.”58

The JCMR, the ADI, and Cooperation
Promotion of microfilm was not just limited to the ADI and the JCMR. Nor was this a
purely science-driven endeavor, or one concerned solely with scientific information provision.
Watson Davis wrote in December, 1936 that “microphotographic duplication (placing of reduced
size photographic images of books, documents, etc., upon film) has been demonstrated as a
practical and economical aid to scholarly research and publication. There is a need for a broad,
energetic and intellectually-motivated development of all phases of documentation, particularly

microphotographic duplication and its ramifications, in the fields of the physical, natural, social
and historical sciences and the general sphere of libraries and information services.”59 The JCMR
and ADI worked steadily and closely with leaders from the Library of Congress, the American
Library Association, and the newly established National Archives. Microfilm was also put into
direct service of New Deal agency information provision. In 1935 JCMR filmed nearly 300,000
pages of Congressional hearings on the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural
Adjustment Administration. Library Journal wrote that these hearings “in this compact form will
be of continuing use to students in every branch of social science for many years to come.”60
In a letter to ADI Director Davis dated June 12, 1937, Binkley makes direct reference to
cooperation with libraries: “Congratulations on your success in the Library of Congress. Let us
put 70mm. paper direct by Photo-Record on our agenda… I have a telegram from W.W. Wood
referring to a new microfilm trade paper, the first edition to be printed and distributed at the
American Library Association meeting.”61 This quote also suggests that ALA was already being
harnessed to develop commercial market opportunities for the contemporary information
technology industry—a forerunner of postwar trends around computers.
Cooperation was fundamental to the mission of the ADI, as clarified in a letter from
Watson Davis to Waldo G. Leland, secretary of ACLS dated June 10, 1937. Davis emphasized
that “By having members of American Documentation Institute named by national organizations
and institutions in scholarly and scientific fields, it is believed that the Institute will be a
democratic organization responsive to changing needs and capable of performing cooperative

functions as and when required.”62 At the ADI’s organization meeting held in March, 1937,
attendees included, among others, representatives from the American Association of Museums,
the Library of Congress, the Society of American Archivists, and the American Library
Association.63
In a similar vein, the ADI’s articles of incorporation and by-laws dated May 15, 1937,
specify the organization’s role in part “to assemble, classify, reproduce, and distribute documents
of all sorts in all fields of human activity… The American Documentation Institute has been
incorporated on behalf of leading national scholarly, scientific and informational societies to
develop and operate facilities that are expected to promote research and knowledge in various
intellectual fields. The first objective of the new organization will be to develop and apply the
new technique of microphotography to library, scholarly, scientific and other material.”64
In the 1930s, the most visible way that the ADI promoted the application of microfilm
was through the Bibliofilm Service, an interlibrary lending service on microfilm operated in
cooperation with the National Agricultural Library (NAL), the library of the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA). In 1935 Watson Davis explained in a letter to USDA
Secretary Henry A. Wallace’s office that “so important seems the development of photographic
methods in the distribution of science that Science Service is lending its efforts in this
direction.”65 By 1937, the Bibliofilm Service had been judged such a success that Davis

identified its replication nationally and even internationally as one of the core functions of the
nascent ADI. Davis believed that the ADI could foster multiple “Bibliofilm centers so that the
research worker in any field can secure promptly at low cost microfilm of any book or document
in any library.”66 Davis and other documentalists were confident about the broader appeal of the
Bibliofilm Service because of both “the development of microfilm utilizations of various sorts in
many libraries during the past few years” as well as “the experience of the Bibliofilm Service
operated by Science Service in the Library of the Department of Agriculture.67 When the ADI
was still in the development stage in late 1936, the “Plan for Documentation Institute”
envisioned the Bibliofilm Service as the “nucleus” of the proposed institute.68

National Agricultural Library and the Bibliofilm Service
The Bibliofilm Service was important not only because it was innovative in itself, but
also because it contributed to a more encompassing transformation in the system of information
provision by highlighting a necessity for increased cooperative endeavors. I mean cooperation to
describe not only that different groups work together in a mutual interest or common purpose,
but also that a project of this magnitude in order to be successful required a variety of types of
stakeholders. It could not have been accomplished by librarians or documentalists or agricultural
engineers working on their own. The story of the Bibliofilm Service characterizes the
cooperative spirit of information work in the 1930s, a trait it shared with other New Deal
projects. It is unclear what Henry A. Wallace’s role was in the success of Bibliofilm specifically

or the NAL more generally, although the authors of his biography noted that “Under him, the
department’s library became —and remains—the largest agricultural library in the world.”69 We
do know that the earliest conversations about the Bibliofilm Service occurred at the Cosmos
Club in late 1934.70 A few months later in August, 1935, Wallace’s assistant Paul Appleby was
in direct contact with Watson Davis about officially establishing the Bibliofilm Service in 1935.
Appleby wrote that Claribel Barnett was “much interested” in the “very important project.”71
Before further discussion of the Bibliofilm Service, it would be helpful to provide some
background on the NAL and its parent institution, the USDA.

The NAL and the USDA
Claribel Barnett was an important figure whose role in regard to microphotography has
been all but neglected. For over four decades until her retirement in 1940, Barnett served as the
Librarian at the NAL, the official depository of the USDA.72 As Christine D’Arpa has argued,
the USDA has a long history of leading efforts to improve the provision of agricultural
information.73 The NAL located outside of Washington, DC in Beltsville, MD was a central
component of these activities. The NAL collected and disseminated information on a range of
agricultural activities and provided reference services for scholars, practitioners, and politicians.

They collected information on a range of subjects from forestry to entomology to dairying, from
agricultural engineering to economics. They provided information and reference services at the
main library and remotely at experiment stations. The Library regularly published catalog
information and maintained a comprehensive and highly active interlibrary loan service. “It can,
it is believed, be safely said,” wrote Librarian Claribel Barnett in 1919, “that no other collection
is no strong in the local, state and national official publications of American and foreign
institutions and organizations which have to do with agriculture and the related sciences.”74
As required by law, the librarian submitted annual reports to the Secretary of Agriculture.
The nearly forty years’ worth of reports authored by Claribel Barnett provide strong indications
that the NAL actively sought continual expansion of services. Arguably, in terms of circulation
and production, it was one of the most important federal libraries in the early to mid-twentieth
century. As documented in the Library’s annual reports, which are discussed below, library
services grew throughout the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s the NAL had demonstrated a commitment
to enhancing access to scientific and technical information for agriculture.
As was also true for other agencies and organizations, it was not evident that the
Depression decade would hold much opportunity for the NAL. Yet as also proved true for some,
the 1930s not only saw the NAL expand existing services but pioneer new ones as well.
Circulation of held items went up in the main library and there was a spike in interlibrary loan
activity. Reference services on site and for users in remote locations also expanded. The NAL
functioned well enough prior to the Depression, yet seemed to thrive during the Depression.
What could account for this growth? One obvious explanation is that USDA overall grew
dramatically under Henry A. Wallace’s leadership. USDA staff grew from 40,000 people in 1932

to 146,000 in 1940. Appropriations during that same period more than quadrupled; the
Department went from receiving less than $280 million in 1932 to $1.5 billion in 1940.75 The
New Deal prioritized agricultural support through the creation of relief agencies specific to
farmers. The policy choices that allowed US agriculture to expand in the 1930s likewise allowed
for the NAL to grow in size and scope. This enlargement of scope is perhaps best demonstrated
by the NAL’s role in the Bibliofilm Service.

Growing the NAL and the Bibliofilm Service
The Science Service and the NAL officially entered into a cooperative arrangement to
run the Bibliofilm Service on January 1, 1936.76 Then, as already mentioned, the ADI was
established in 1937 in Washington, D.C. The Bibliofilm Service continued to operate without
issue amid the transition from Science Service to the American Documentation Institute. In the
1939 Annual Report, Claribel Barnett wrote that “cooperation of the library with the Bibliofilm
Service has continued as before. The library has procured the books, carried on much of the
necessary bibliographical work, and furnished the office and laboratory space for the Bibliofilm
Service.” She also highlighted the increase in Bibliofilm’s popularity, noting a “great increase in
the number [of orders] received.”77
Prior to 1939, all Bibliofilm orders were sent directly to the NAL for processing,
regardless of whether or not the NAL itself could fill the order. It was determined that the
process would be more efficient and streamlined if orders were first sent to directly to
cooperating libraries that could fill the orders instead of having the NAL sort orders.

After this change was implemented, Barnett noted that the Bibliofilm Service received a total of
11,510 orders, with 9,715 sent to NAL and the rest (1,795) sent to other cooperating libraries.
This was an overall increase of 58 percent from the previous year, when 6,117 orders were
placed. Thus, the NAL still filled the vast majority of Bibliofilm Service orders, more than 80
percent, even after this change.
Barnett’s annual reports are replete with meticulous detail about the total number of
services rendered each year by the NAL. The NAL kept precise records on all transactions
conducted by and through the NAL. This is notable for a few reasons. One is that in recent years,
there has been an emphasis on the need for libraries to systematically maintain and provide such
internal statistics in order to demonstrate quantifiable evidence of the value of library services,
and that this is the primary reason for such a practice. Yet, the information provided by Barnett
in her annual reports shows that libraries were providing such information as a matter of course
in the early twentieth century. The annual reports of the NAL originated in the nineteenth
century with the creation of the USDA. One publication from 1930 explained the origins of the
NAL: “The library of the department is as old as the department itself, for the need of a library of
scientific works to facilitate the work of the department has been felt from its very beginning.”78
These reports took assumed greater significance in the 1930s, when libraries were under pressure
to demonstrate their worth and value to its constituent community. This perhaps attests to a wider
trend toward scientific management in libraries.79

We can infer that these records and the annual reports were integral for securing ongoing
funding for NAL operations, and certainly in persuading Congress to approve any requested
appropriations. Internal statistics demonstrated that the library satisfied its users, and also offered
proof of any need for expansion. Barnett’s reports frequently made mention of how the NAL
required greater financial appropriation in order to satisfactorily meet user needs and to improve
on them. The information provided in the annual reports suggested that the NAL provided
crucial services, and that they needed to improve upon and expand the range of services. They
allowed the library information required to assess the quality of services and how they might
tailor them even further to meet user needs. In this context, users included scientists, researchers,
legislators, and farmworkers. The NAL of the 1930s is a premiere example of the library as a
responsive institution that evolves in response to user needs.
At the same time, although such records were kept and the information subsequently
provided in the annual reports, there are detectable changes in the character of the annual reports.
When Claribel Barnett first assumed the role of Librarian of the NAL, her reports typically
numbered an average of about four to five pages. This is relatively brief when compared with her
reports from the 1930s, which typically numbered closer to 30 pages. This rise in volume
suggests that perhaps more detailed records were kept, but also that the range of services
increased significantly. With the exception of 1934, when appropriations were unusually low, the
NAL added staff each year. Total NAL staff numbered 120 in 1939; the library had started the
decade with 96 staff.80
Legislative reference services increased during the 1930s as well, with the Librarian’s
Report of 1934 describing the legislative reference work of that year as “exceptionally heavy.”

Ibid.; United States Department of Agriculture, Library, “Report of the Librarian, 1930,” National Agricultural
Library Special Collections, Beltsville, MD.

The increased need for legislative reference services was attributed, understandably, to the
proliferation of relief measures.81 Increase in services also included more library staffing and
resources for various USDA bureaus. By 1939 the Agricultural Research Center, a 12,000 acre
field experiment site in Beltsville, had added library services for the Division of Bee Culture, the
Bureau of Dairy Industry, and the Bureau of Animal Industry. Culver and Hyde note that during
Henry A. Wallace’s tenure, “the department’s research center at Beltsville, Maryland, became
the largest and most varied scientific agricultural station in the world.”82
Circulation statistics also suggest increased demand for NAL services. Books borrowed
by the library, for example, saw the greatest increase in the 1930s. The NAL had maintained
records of books borrowed by the library since 1911, starting in 1935 it began keeping statistics
on the number of books it lent. The Social Security Board, the Farm Credit Administration, and
the Works Progress Administration were among the top ten largest borrowers.83 That three of the
top ten largest borrowers were New Deal agencies provides further evidence of the importance of
cooperation in the system of information provision.

Changing Seasons at the NAL: Close of the Bibliofilm Service and the Retirement of Claribel
Barnett
The end of the 1930s saw the end of both the Bibliofilm Service and the retirement of
Claribel Barnett. The Bibliofilm Service had been beset by several problems, including questions
of copyright and duplication. They had also lost the backing of one of their original supporters,

the Army Medical Library, over concerns that the Bibliofilm Service “looked out for its own
interests and was more like a commercial undertaking than a scientific institution.”84 The
Bibliofilm Service did not suffer, however, for lack of interest in microfilm. Instead, one of the
main reasons for its decline was that libraries wanted to house their own microphotography
operations instead of using a central service. In 1941, ADI ceded most of its Bibliofilm Service
work to the NAL, which was now under the direction of Ralph Shaw following the retirement of
Claribel Barnett.
Barnett appears to not only have been a capable and forward-thinking librarian, she was
also extremely well-liked by her colleagues. In March, 1940 she announced her retirement in a
letter to Henry A. Wallace. More than a dozen of her colleagues at the NAL responded with a
petition to Wallace in the hope he would persuade Barnett to reconsider.85 Although Wallace
declined to take such action, it was acknowledged that her retirement presented “a real loss to the
Department.”86 In response to Barnett’s retirement announcement, Wallace himself wrote “You
have left a definite mark upon the Department’s work and it is a mark of distinction.”87

Conclusion
In the so-called digital age or information age, “technology” has become shorthand for
highly sophisticated electronic devices such as computers, mobile phones, e-book readers.

profession fail to incorporate these technologies, the implication being that libraries are
technologically backward. The notion, however, that libraries are technological laggards that
have only recently begun to move away from the book-centered services, is historically
untenable. During the 1930s, in the depths of economic depression, some visionary information
workers seriously considered on whose terms and to what ends new information technology
could be integrated into librarianship.
Microfilm and other changes around information technology resonated in both the private
and public sectors, with business, government, and nonprofit organizations embracing new ways
to more efficiently manage ever-growing quantities of information. Prior to the onset of the
Great Depression, microfilm’s most widespread application had been in banks. With its most
reliable customer all but devastated in the 1930s, microfilm’s popularity could very well have
dried up.
As it turns out, enthusiasm for microfilm reached its zenith in the 1930s, thanks in large
part to librarians, the Joint Committee on Materials for Research, the American Documentation
Institute, and the New Deal. Librarian Claribel Barnett of the National Agricultural Library was
especially instrumental in the promotion of microfilm for scientific research purposes,
particularly because of her groundbreaking work with the Bibliofilm Service. The NAL was
already a highly productive and important information agency prior to the Depression, and its
significance grew during the 1930s. The interest in expanding access to the Bibliofilm Service
was one of the primary justifications for the establishment of the American Documentation
Institute in 1937.

97

Microfilm and technological innovations around filing, indexing, and cataloging were
part of librarians and information workers’ interest in making information more widely
accessible. How librarians, scholars, and New Deal agencies worked to increase access, and why
access assumed such urgency, is the subject of the next chapter.

CHAPTER FOUR:
ACCESS AND THE SYSTEM OF INFORMATION PROVISION

Introduction
In 2014, the American Library Association defines access as “providing the full range of
information resources needed to live, learn, govern, and work” to “people of every age, income
level, location, ethnicity, or physical ability.”1 In the most recent edition of the Encyclopedia of
Library and Information Sciences, access is described in relation to the concept of universal
service: “Exploring the egalitarian concepts at the heart of universal service facilitates
understanding of the rationale for access...Universal service arises from the firm belief that some
services are foundational because they supply the knowledge necessary for self-government and
because informed citizens are essential to the maintenance of a democratic government. Support
for universal service emerged through the nation’s experiences in founding four historic systems-postal and telephones services, education, and broadcasting. Today, this translates into a strong
national belief in universal access.”2
This definition therefore was a consequence of a long history. It also exhibits distinct
facets. As opposed to previous approaches to librarianship, the modern public library sought to
foster inclusivity. This is evident in the development of open stacks and the notion of the free
library, open to all residents of a community. This support for access is also evident in the
expansion of remote user services. When users did not have immediate geographical access to

library holdings, they could potentially access library materials through interlibrary loan,
traveling libraries, or bookmobiles.
Inequality of access to information existed prior to the Great Depression, and inequalities
existed at the end of the 1930s. That information provision serves as a democratizing force is a
long-held ideal that has often fallen short in practice. While Wayne Wiegand and others have
shown that the democratizing function of libraries can be overstated in library history literature,
it is important to remember that many librarians have endowed librarianship with important
democratizing potential—New Deal librarians certainly did.3 What makes looking at access in
the 1930s interesting is that there was such effective expansion and promotion of access
throughout a protracted economic crisis. This expansion frequently occurred in innovative and
creative ways. While this creativity and innovation must be in part attributed to financial
constraints which made “business as usual” infeasible, this creativity and innovation was also in
the spirit of the 1930s in which some people saw possibility in the economic wreckage and
devastation to rebuild something better. Thus, though the Great Depression had the potential to
exacerbate pre-existing inequalities and reduce access for those who had previously enjoyed it,
many information workers and their allies instead saw opportunities to improve information
access. They were not looking to merely restore access to what it had been in 1929, they were
looking to make it what they felt it should be. Access, it turns out, encompassed numerous and
expansive initiatives, from building libraries to developing services for the visually impaired. Of
course, real limits continued to characterize this process, as we will see, for example, in
expansion of access for African Americans.

In the 1930s, enhancing access was important for libraries, government agencies, and
scholarly societies for several key reasons. One was the perceived connection between access to
information and economic recovery. Government agencies required more efficient, accurate, and
timely access to, for example, unemployment statistics in order to respond effectively to
economic crisis. Another was the widely held relationship between access to information and
democracy. This hearkens back to the role of public education and how libraries fit into this
mission, and even the creation of the post office and government involvement in promoting
access to information—that if people were properly informed regarding local and national civic
affairs, they could then make informed decisions at the ballot box. Access to information also
strengthened communities. A community can mean the people living in one’s neighborhood,
scholarly communities, and perhaps even imagined communities. By community I mean there is
a sense of shared connection with cultural heritage and the past. The creation of the Historical
Records Survey, Federal Archives Survey, library cataloging and indexing projects, and the
National Archives reflects this sense of shared connection with cultural heritage and the past.
Finally, transformation of access was manifested in improved efficiency amongst and between
the employees who formed the community of government agencies.
Evidence suggests that the 1930s were a watershed in expansion of information access in
academic libraries, with the founding of Association of Research Libraries, the Joint Committee
on Materials for Research, and efforts to improve scholarly communication. Enhanced access
was prioritized in government agencies, with changes in the Bureau of the Census, Bureau of
Labor Statistics, and Department of Agriculture. The federal government also prioritized
enhancing access to the past, with the creation of the National Archives and Records
Administration. This emphasis on historic preservation also was evident in the founding of the

101

Society of American Archivists and in the many WPA programs dedicated to documenting
historical records. Library access was prioritized by libraries and library supporters, as evinced in
the increased appropriations for library budgets, creation of new types of library services, and
successful efforts in library extension. The application of WPA funds “meant that libraries could
spend more of their meager budgets on materials and books, remain open longer, and inaugurate
new services, particularly to isolated areas...Urban libraries benefitted too, as WPA workers
made permanent contributions by reworking card catalogues, compiling union lists, indexing
urban newspapers, initiating special collections, and expanding services to hospitals and shutins.”4
In this chapter I will address what access means, including: how did the definition of
access change during the 1930s? What were the specific organizations and agencies concerned
with access, and how did they prioritize it? What role did the federal government and the WPA
play in enhancing access? What other agencies and institutions besides libraries prioritized
expansion of information access, and why? What accounted for expansion of access in the midst
of the Great Depression?
Finally, it is important to keep in mind that enhanced access was part of simultaneous
efforts to integrate modern technological processes and promote legislation in support of
improved access in and to the system of information provision. We cannot thoroughly
understand or appreciate the story of access without acknowledging the concomitant roles of
technology and policy. In this chapter I show how for 1930s’ librarians and information workers,
access was neither merely physical nor merely intellectual: it is social and political.

Historical Efforts to Improve Information Access
Unfettered access to information as a prerequisite for perpetuating an enlightened citizenry
has long been a purported aim of the federal government, as evidenced by the establishment of
the postal system. Postal networks were established through ongoing government subventions.
These subsidies underwrote the building of post roads, the construction of post office buildings,
and the salaries of postal employees. The post office’s commitment to access is also
demonstrated by the subsidies for newspapers, which were meant to encourage nationwide
circulation and exchange of information. As a result, newspapers and periodicals circulated
easily and freely—to a point. Legal policies reinforced by racist, sexist, and classist attitudes
made it so that only some people were permitted to read, and in some cases there were reading
materials deemed inappropriate or even dangerous in the wrong hands. Nevertheless, even with
its limitations, the postal system has endured as a public network and demonstrates a longstanding interest in information provision by the US government.5 Thus, expansion and
enhancement of information access was a priority before the 1930s and the onset of the Great
Depression. The inauspicious circumstances of the 1930s significant were seized upon to pursue
expansion on a large scale. By large scale, I mean to gesture at national initiatives as well as
community-led initiatives.
The previous chapter explored the role of technology in the 1930s system of information
provision. The interest in applying technology to better organize information stemmed, in part,
from some librarians' commitment to improving access. Expansion of access is also evident in
the growth of different types of libraries (e.g. special libraries, school libraries, and federal
libraries) and outreach aimed at underserved populations (e.g. African Americans, youth

103

services, rural users, and itinerant workers). The American Library Association’s Library
Extension Board as well as the Works Progress Administration helped extend access where there
had previously been little or none. Commitment to expansion of access is further demonstrated in
the growth of library cooperation and regional library systems in the 1930s, including the
establishment of the Association of Research Libraries in 1932.6 As we saw, it was evident as
well in the expansion of scientific resource sharing networks such as the National Agricultural
Library's Bibliofilm Service. Expansion of access extended beyond current information. The
creation of the National Archives and Records Administration in the early 1930s and the
numerous inventory projects in state archives indicates a concern for providing access to past
records.7
Most noteworthy are the explosion in resource-sharing across institutions and the
numerous user populations targeted for outreach. That such expansion occurred during a
Depression decade suggests that a considerable number of people, including policymakers,
freshly prioritized information access, and that the depth of the crisis bolstered rather than
diminished their commitment to this process.

Scholarly Communication and Access
American researchers were deeply concerned with scholarly communication in the 1930s,
particularly with respect to access. In 2014, the Association of Research Libraries defined
scholarly communication as “the system through which research and other scholarly writings are

created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future
use. The system includes both formal means of communication, such as publication in peerreviewed journals, and informal channels, such as electronic listservs.”8 In the previous chapter,
scholarly communication was discussed in relation to technology and specifically to microfilm—
because of its potential to enhance access.
New organizations concerned with scholarly communication were founded in the 1930s.
These are important not only as historical instances of dynamic expansion, but also as enduring
advocates for scholarly communication. One was the Association of Research Libraries (ARL).
The ARL’s establishment in 1932 is emblematic of a commitment to enhancing access through
cooperation. Another was the American Documentation Institute (ADI), today known as the
Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T) (discussed in the previous
chapter). It is worth mentioning that when Science Service was reorganized as the ADI, its
letterhead stated that it stood for “the promotion and development of documentation in scholarly
and scientific fields” and that its members were “nominated by scholarly and scientific
agencies.”9 This statement demonstrates once again the interest and commitment to crosscollaboration between institutional actors.
What drove the development of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research (JCMR),
the ARL, the Bibliofilm Service, and the ADI? By the early 1930s, many scholars and scientists
had begun to observe the growth of scholarly publications with concern. Without clearer
mechanisms for managing scholarly publications, they feared that access would become more
difficult.

Dissertations and Theses
Access to theses and dissertations was one aspect of the wider drive to reorganize
scholarly communication during the 1930s. Science published a list of dissertations in 1898 in
the pages of the journal, although the list was limited to dissertations in natural and physical
sciences. From 1912 until 1938 the Library of Congress published its annual List of American
Doctoral Dissertations Printed. This approach was also limited because a printed dissertation
was not required by all universities, and of those printed, not all of them were deposited with the
Library of Congress. As a result, “this left buried in obscurity more than half the dissertations
accepted each year in the United States.”10 Furthermore, these lists only covered dissertations
and not theses.
One of the JCMR’s projects, in cooperation with the Professional and Technical Press,
was “to establish somewhere in the United States a central-loan library for the better theses and
dissertations produced in our colleges, universities, professional schools, technical schools, and
other institutions of higher education conferring advanced degrees,” as described in the “Outlines
of the Proposed Central-Loan Library for Theses and Dissertations.”11 This document was
circulated to institutions which expressed interest in participating in such an endeavor as well as
to those identified as potentially having interest or a stake. The use of the qualifier “better”
suggests that the JCMR did not see the collection of all dissertations and theses as a reasonable
goal. Limiting by some measure of quality was perhaps a way to make the proposed collection
manageable.
Although scholars were chiefly in dialogue with one another as to how to preserve and

106

enhance access to scholarly publications, they also saw their efforts as being in service to a wider
public. In a letter to Binkley dated January 10, 1934, Elbert Boughton of the Professional and
Technical Press relayed the following position on the theses and dissertations collection: “the use
of the library is not to be restricted to people connected directly with education but will be
available to all research workers in all fields.”12 He listed several participating organizations in
the project, listing the American Library Association first (not in alphabetical order), the
American Council of Learned Societies, the Association of American Universities, and the
National Education Association.
What does the creation of such a project in the 1930s tell us? That scholarly production
did not slow in the 1930s, as indicated by Roger Geiger when, speaking of American research
universities, he wrote “The rapid pace of scientific advance and the latent competition between
institutions further assured that university research would continue to expand despite persistent
financial difficulties. The result was a paradox of a sort: university research tended to prosper
during the 1930s despite the severe pressures felt elsewhere in the universities.”13 Perhaps if
anything the slowing down in the US economy allowed a time and space for reflection and
revision. Binkley observed rising volume of scholarship at a time of economic crisis, and
foresaw that this would only increase in the coming years. In “Outlines of the Proposed CentralLoan Library for Theses and Dissertations,” they wrote “In recent years there have been many
thousands of these documents presented to the institutions of higher education in part fulfillment
of the requirements for degrees. In 1933, there were 1,343 doctorates conferred in sciences alone
in American universities…in a vast majority of cases, only a few copies of the finished work are

made and, in very few cases, are they printed and sold or otherwise widely distributed.”14
Scholars were attempting to imagine more efficient system of organization and access.
Interest in better organization of theses and dissertations was also indicative of scholars’
commitment to fostering access beyond monographs. The “Outlines” bluntly states that “It goes
without saying that society at large will be appreciably benefitted if the best of these are made as
available as books of the same quality.” This reference to “best of” once again indicates an
interest in setting priorities with an eye toward collection manageability, though it is ultimately
unclear what is meant by “best of” and “better” dissertations and theses. They commended
previous efforts by the US Office of Education to create an annotated (if incomplete)
bibliography of education theses and dissertations, noting that funding and support were
inadequate and the result was limited use of this pamphlet. They also cited similar efforts by the
Library of Congress, which “has a file of 225,000 of such documents, but only a small part of
these are available for loaning and only to a limited extent and for brief periods.”15 The report
notes that while some universities and colleges make their own theses and dissertations available,
such a system provided limited circulation and access.
In order to fund the establishment of the central loan library, they planned to petition the
Carnegie Corporation to provide funds “at least for the first two years until it is well established
and its usefulness demonstrated.”16 This support would fund the creation of a catalog. They
wanted to provide copies to libraries and other research repositories for free, as they did not wish
to rely on catalog sales to recoup expenses. They anticipated participation from “at least 500
colleges, universities, and professional and technical schools. They noted that “it has been

suggested that all applicants for degrees shall, in addition to their theses and dissertations, be
required to furnish abstracts of them.”17 Although they wanted to have a large central database,
they did not plan to include every single thesis or dissertation produced by an institution of
higher education in the United States: only those deemed to possess sufficient quality. They
wrote that “the custodian of the library should probably be authorized to return any of these
documents to the institutions where they originate provided he considers them of insufficient
value to justify their being included. In this way, the borrowers will not be spending time on
contributions of little value, and the expense will thereby be reduced.”18 In this way lofty
ambitions were tempered by some fiscal restraint, which they resolved by imagining a system of
inclusion based on quality. They also considered the possibility of a ranking system for the
included theses and dissertations, which would indicate “the rank of excellence or other desirable
fact…There is a growing demand for such a rating.”19 Although there is no further explanation of
the cited growing demand, we can speculate that given the emphasis on volume, the ratings
system would have helped catalog users identify the most useful items more quickly—perhaps
an early instance of relevancy ranking.
While the JCMR was working on developing such a list, the ARL expressed similar
interest in the organization of dissertation and theses. Founded in December, 1932, during the
midwinter meeting of the American Library Association, the ARL was established by
participants from 42 university and research libraries who “recognized the need for coordinated
action and desired a forum to address common problems.”20 ARL members first identified access
to doctoral dissertations as a priority in 1933, having also recognized that while dissertations

were a potentially useful scholarly resource, lack of organization inhibited more robust access. 21
In 1935, the ARL became aware of a Northwestern University librarian who was
compiling a bibliography of dissertations and theses. A letter from ARL Executive Secretary
Donald Gilchrist to Robert Binkley dated September 19, 1935, relates that Gilchrist is “anxious
to get on with the matter of the doctoral dissertations bibliography being compiled by Mister
Coleman,” noting that ARL’s proposed list “covers all fields and all institutions and includes
only doctoral dissertations, not master’s theses.”22 It seems the work of Northwestern first
became known to the JCMR when Northwestern’s Thomas Palfrey sent a letter to Binkley dated
September 8, 1935, in order to solicit his interest, stating “It has occurred to us that your
committee might be interested either in publishing our bibliography or else in contributing at
least a part of the cost of its publication.”23 On September 24, 1935, a letter to Binkley from
Palfrey clarifies that their work is not a bibliography of dissertations, but a list of lists. He writes
it is “a bibliography of lists and abstracts of theses…Naturally we made several inquiries in
various quarters in order to ascertain whether or not a similar enterprise had been undertaken by
others. The ALA assured us that no such project had been reported.”24
Microfilm went on to play a central role in providing access to dissertations and theses.
Eugene Power established University Microfilms, Incorporated (UMI) in 1938, which sold
microfilmed copies of dissertations. UMI provided a list of its microfilmed dissertations in its

In 1952, UMI in cooperation with the ARL began offering access to Dissertations Abstracts, a
microfilmed bibliography of American doctoral dissertations and some master’s theses.25
It is worth mentioning that the rise of UMI occurred while the Bibliofilm Service
declined. As described in the previous chapter, the Bibliofilm Service did not cease due to lack
of interest in microfilm. This is all the more obvious when we take into account the success of
UMI. The success of UMI likely has much to do with that it was founded for a very specific
service: microfilming and preserving access to dissertations and theses. The Bibliofilm Service,
on the other hand, was overwhelmed by its role as a general microcopying service.

The National Agricultural Library
The National Agricultural Library’s place in the story of access in the 1930s is interesting
because it encompasses more than libraries. The NAL is a special library, and in the 1930s it was
significant in the rise of documentalism. Keeping with the trend of increased circulation that
characterized libraries generally in the 1930s, Alan Fusonie notes that likewise the size of the
collection and the scope of services grew at the NAL. Its expansion necessitated more space, and
in 1932 the NAL moved to a larger and more centrally located site in Washington, DC.26 Was
the NAL’s expansion distinctive? For further insight we may consider the NAL’s relationship to
its host, the United States Department of Agriculture.
As discussed in the previous chapter, the USDA of the 1930s was headed by Henry A.
Wallace, a man renowned for his extensive scientific interests and agricultural knowledge, as
well as his commitment to redressing economic inequality. His zeal for research and belief in its
necessity for improving agricultural processes were reflected in how research activities and the

NAL fared under his tenure. We already know that the NAL became the largest agricultural
library in the world, and that the agricultural research center in Beltsville “became the largest and
most varied scientific agricultural station in the world.”27 Part of the growth under the NAL
included its involvement with the Bibliofilm Service, which “became the first experimental
center for supplying microfilm and photocopies of articles on a large-scale to scientific
workers.”28 Central to all of this activity was the leadership and stewardship of Claribel Barnett.
We can perhaps consider Barnett as a pioneer of information science, though she is never
credited as such in the information science literature. Claribel Barnett (who deserves a more
thorough biographical treatment for this and other reasons) remains the longest-serving NAL
librarian, having worked in that position for nearly 40 years. While Wallace should be
acknowledged for his commitment to scientific research and library services, the day to day
operation of the NAL itself was Barnett’s purview. Fusonie himself credits Barnett specifically
for how NAL came to partner with the ADI in the Bibliofilm Service, stating it was “under
Barnett’s leadership.”29
As described in the previous chapter, Claribel Barnett’s internal recordkeeping and
annual reporting shows a steady and progressive increase in circulation at the NAL during the
1930s. The popularity of the Bibliofilm Service furnishes further evidence that some information
workers were not only committed to increasing access to information generally, but also to
expanding and enhancing the means access, and to providing new points of access. Scholars and
scientists felt that there needed to be other more suitable ways to access and share information
more easily, and libraries were a central part of this process. Better search and retrieval became

urgent due to economic crisis; this is demonstrated in the emphasis that WPA projects placed on
improving information access.

Works Progress Administration and Access
The WPA routinely provided access about its programs in order to gauge effectiveness.
Therefore, the research information functions of the WPA played a key part in providing access
to information about the work of the WPA itself. Looking back on the 1930s, former WPA
director Colonel Harrington described how research was an intrinsic component of WPA
programs and had been so for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). He notes
that “when the FERA began operations in 1935 the Federal Government had very little
information about the relief problem other than the number of persons receiving aid.”30 FERA
was begun as an emergency relief program under the Hoover administration, but for the
electorate these efforts were too little too late. But it seems that in Harrington’s assessment, the
FERA inherited by the Roosevelt administration was ill-informed to thoroughly serve its
purpose. Harrington goes on to describe the research program undertaken by FERA: “In order to
administer the program properly, therefore, the FERA called upon its research group to
enumerate the relief population in October 1933. Data were collected on the nature of the relief
problem. For this purpose facts were gathered for the first time on the age, sex, color, residence,
and family size and composition.”31 FERA would ultimately provide work for 20 million people,
and in order to do so the agency generated specific information about the unemployed, their

Division for the Congressional Investigating Committee,” April 27, 1940, WPA Papers, National Archives at

communities, and an assessment of existing and needed programs and services. This awareness
of the importance of such information gathering also infused FERA’s successor, the WPA. By
the end of the 1930s, this information gathering served a wider purpose. Colonel Harrington
declared that “through the research activities of the successive federal relief agencies, we know
more about unemployment and relief than ever before.”32 Harrington also took pains to clarify
that the WPA Research Division conducted unique research in service of the WPA, and did not
overlap with research conducted by other federal agencies or programs. Here Harrington argued
that the WPA and the federal government’s information gathering activities were comprehensive
in scope yet distinctive in focus. Furthermore, information acquired by other agencies likewise
would enable them, he believed, to operate more efficiently.
Some in Congress challenged the need for dedicated research divisions for each agency:
could not research agendas be set and supervised from a more central location within the
government? Harrington and others argued that without specialized research divisions,
information gathering would be less relevant and applicable to the problems and issues at hand,
in turn rendering the agencies less efficient in administering their programs. Whereas Congress
saw the existence of several research agencies as redundant and therefore in need of
consolidation, Harrington and others countered that on the contrary without research divisions
tailored to each agency, information gathering could potentially become redundant and
inefficient. Having several research divisions in different government agencies was what made
the programs so effective.33
Criticism dogged WPA projects throughout the 1930s. These criticisms typically took the
form of charges of inefficiency or political impropriety. The Federal Theater Project, which was

32

114

shut down before the end of the 1930s, was one such political casualty, after Congressional
hearings tainted the project’s credibility. WPA information projects and information workers of
the 1930s took pains to respond to allegations of inefficiency in the attempt to dispel such
criticism. In 1936, National Director of the Survey of Federal Archives Philip Hamer released a
memorandum to Regional Directors and Assistant Directors entitled “Need for Accurate Work.”
Hamer advised the directors that while they should ensure “there be no loafing” they were to
“emphasize quality rather than quantity.”34
Philip Hamer had a similar professional pedigree to that of his contemporary Robert
Binkley. Hamer was trained as an historian, earning his PhD in history from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1918. After completing his doctorate he spent the next 17 years as an academic
before joining the newly-established National Archives in 1935. In January 1936 he became the
Director of the Survey of Federal Archives while retaining a position in the Division of the
Library with the National Archives.35 Like Binkley, Hamer was an historian with interests in
libraries and archives with a particular focus on preservation of and access to historical
documents.
A number of WPA projects put people to work improving access through better
organization and management of government records. At the 1932 annual meeting of the
American Library Association, A.F. Kuhlman stated that

“Government documents have acquired a new significance as indispensable for
research…Today, in government documents inventions, discoveries, and the birth, growth,
and operations of our social institutions are to no small extent recorded. Hence, it is from
these sources that the historical process and social research must emerge… Research now
means the use of primary source materials in the search for sound principles, rather than a
recasting of secondary materials. It means reference to data rather than authority.”36
WPA workers typed, indexed, and organized several million public records in the latter
part of the 1930s. The indexing project at Ellis Island allowed access to records for 18 million
immigrants who had come through the Port of New York.37 Access to vital statistics was crucial
for the implementation of Social Security, with WPA workers employed in hundreds of cities to
organize and index birth records, marriage licenses, and death certificates.38 WPA workers
indexed police department files, census records, and hospital records. These projects have not
been studied, they were large-scale endeavors worthy of attention.39
Press releases for each of these projects tended to emphasize both the size of the task and
the quality of the work, as indicated by titles such as “21 WPA Workers Finish Huge Clerical
Task for Hospital” and “Gigantic Card Index Set Up By 3000 WPA Workers.”40 Modernization
in records management was also mentioned frequently, as records tended to be disorganized and
handwritten before getting the WPA treatment. The New York Alphabetical Index Project was
“the largest indexing project in history.” It employed 3,600 people to index the 1920 census,

which generated nearly 58 million index cards over an eighteen month period.41
Organization and classification methods pioneered by librarians, and that were wellestablished and reputable before the Depression, helped validate these methods in records
projects under the WPA. They were demonstrations of efficiency and effectiveness through
cooperative cataloging and federated databases.

Library Services Division
In addition to improving access to public records, the WPA also supported information
access through library extension. The Library Services Division was a subset of Women’s and
Professional Projects. Ellen Woodward was appointed the first director of Women’s and
Professional Projects. In 1938 she tapped Edward Chapman of the Indianapolis State Library to
head the Library Services Division. A national library consultant, Chapman was brought in to
serve as a central point of contact for all library projects within the WPA.42
Ellen Woodward was selected by Harry Hopkins to head Women’s and Professional
Projects after her work with the Democratic Party in Mississippi. Hopkins had established a
women’s division under FERA because he knew that women were being turned away from jobs
on emergency relief because employees felt men should have priority in a job crisis. Hopkins felt
“that FERA should have a women’s program as soon as a suitable division head could be
found.”43 With the support of Democratic Party leadership, including Molly Dewson and First
Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Hopkins announced Woodward’s appointment to head the Women’s
Division of FERA in August, 1933. Reflecting the turmoil of the times, Woodward’s job

description changed almost immediately with the creation of Civil Works Administration and
Civil Works Service. Upon their expiration, Woodward assumed control of the Division of
Women’s and Professional Projects (WPP) under the newly created Works Progress
Administration.
Woodward had a history of civic involvement before a special election in 1925 made her
the third woman to serve in the Mississippi legislature, after her husband the state legislator died
of a heart attack, serving out the remainder of her husband’s term. She agreed to be put on the
ballot after the urging of friends, and handily won the special election. Woodward was not
entirely a stranger to civic life, having long been active in public and social organizations in
Mississippi. The remainder of her husband’s term for which she was elected ended in January,
1928, and she made it known she had no interest in running formally for political office. After
the end of her term, she joined the staff of the Mississippi State Board of Development. During
her stint with the MSBD she proved herself to be engaged and adept in fundraising and research
in support of social welfare for Mississippians, and further acquainted herself with state political
figures and civic leaders. Her commitment only deepened as the Great Depression engulfed her
state. In the wake of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Woodward was appointed the sole
woman on the board of Mississippi’s first State Board of Welfare. In the meantime, Woodward
actively campaigned for Roosevelt in 1932. Her biographer writes that in the seven years after
she won the seat in the Mississippi legislature, “Ellen Woodward had demonstrated a growing
ease and expertise in working with professionals in the field of social services. There were signs,
too, that she had the makings of a first-rate public administrator.”44

44

Ibid., 34.

118

The Women’s Division provided what were considered “traditional” jobs for unemployed
women. These included sewing, nursing, teaching, and library labor. In her oversight of library
projects through the WPP, Woodward worked closely with librarians and ALA leaders. Swain
writes that “Woodward’s commitment as a clubwoman and a state legislator to library expansion
and education accounted in large measure for her interest in the projects her division developed
under FERA and CWA. Julia Wright Merrill, chief of the American Library Association’s Public
Library Division, hit it off well with Woodward...one historian of these programs has concluded
that ALA and work-relief proposals meshed so closely that it is difficult to determine their
origin.”45
One of the most popular and controversial components of the WPA’s library work was
bookbinding, which repeatedly faced challenges by commercial publishers. As Ellen Woodward
frequently had to defend the necessity and utility of the bookbinding projects, it is worthwhile to
mention them here. Commercial publishers alleged that relief bookbinding took business away
that was rightfully theirs, and that WPA labor furthermore produced inferior bindings.
Woodward regularly addressed these claims and defended WPA bookbinding, while Library
Journal often showcased WPA bookbinding in their pages, occasionally punctuated by a
complaint from commercial bookbinders. The stated functions were as follows: “The library
projects are grouped under three distinct headings: book circulation, book repair, and cataloging
and indexing. Library extension projects are designed to establish library service in communities
where such service has been discontinued or has never existed.”46 The WPA itself also released
notices as the one cited above as positive promotion in support of bookbinding projects.

45

Park, MD.

119

However, it would seem that over the course of the 1930s the book repair program was one that
could be chalked up to a loss in terms of successful projects.
The problems around bookbinding however should not be taken as condemning evidence
against the utility of library projects under the WPA as a whole. Consider how much had been
accomplished by 1941: “WPA project workers had repaired and put back into circulation
98,622,000 volumes belonging to school or public libraries. By the end of 1940 they had typed
almost 40,000,000 book catalog cards. By the end of 1939 they had transcribed almost 4,000,000
pages for Braille books for the blind.” Also by 1941,
“The WPA had purchased over 260,000 new books for use in library service
demonstrations, and had assisted approximately 150 different counties in obtaining
bookmobiles for extending library service to rural areas. During July, August, and
September, 1941, over 1,700 or more than half of all the counties in the United States,
were receiving some library assistance from the WPA... These WPA-operated library
services had a combined book stock of nearly 8,000,000 volumes, and they were serving
an estimated total population of almost 14,000,000 persons… Thus, in summary, the
most important single fact concerning WPA assistance to libraries is its magnitude.”47
When we consider this magnitude of WPA library projects, the bookbinding’s alleged
inferior quality proves the exception rather than the rule. We can extrapolate from here to apply
this assessment to all relief efforts of the 1930s. Was every single one of them unilaterally
professional and successful? No, of course not. But on the whole, the work undertaken by the
WPA was by and large more useful than not. Bookbinding put books back into circulation and
therefore improved access.
Woodward remained head of WPP until late 1938, when she was appointed to the Social
Security Board. In her final year with the WPP she also headed Federal One. This offers
evidence to suggest a correlation with regard to mission and purpose between library work and
“other” types of cultural labor.

WPA Library Extension
One of the most iconic WPA projects, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), is also
significant for its incorporation of library services for its laborers as well as its agency
employees.48 Led by Mary Utopia Rothrock, TVA library services functioned, in a general sense,
as they might for any public library population: library workers noted which items circulated
most frequently and attempted to provide books in line with the users’ expressed interests, for a
broad range of reading interests including fiction and nonfiction, and for a wide age range. The
means of access is what makes the story of TVA library services interesting. The first library site
at Norris Dam is especially noteworthy for the innovative ways in which library services were
provided for employees and their families. Clearance employees, who were charged with
clearing the reservoir, were living and working quite literally off the beaten path. Their location
made it difficult but not impossible to access library services. The clearance workers of Norris
Dam and their families had access to a rotating collection that could hold more than 800 books.
The books were kept in waterproofed boxes adjacent to the toolboxes, where men would have
visited on a daily basis. The books were replenished weekly.
Harry Bauer was the librarian with the TVA’s technical library, the purpose of which was
“to provide a reference, research, and information service for the employees of the Authority.”
Bauer writes how “the need for such a library was recognized from the start for in Washington
early in 1933, a Division of Information, Research, Reference and Library was organized...in
March, 1934, a librarian was employed to take charge of the Technical Library.”49 Bauer boasts
that in its six years of existence, this collection grew from 800 books to “approximately 10,000

volumes, 500 periodical titles, and 85,000 newspaper clippings.”50 Cooperation was once again
affirmed as beneficial: “Since the collection is highly specialized and purposely limited in size
and scope, it is imperative that we rely on other libraries for help.”51
The article goes on to describe in detail the various functions, tasks, and services
performed under the auspices of the TVA Technical Library. But the TVA Technical Library did
more than provide access to collections for its immediate user base, its workers also prepared
bibliographies and checklists of information about the TVA, which were updated regularly, and
Bauer noted were “always in demand.”52 The TVA Technical Library was also responsible for
maintaining monthly progress reports required of each TVA department. These, presumably,
could be used to deflect criticisms of WPA and New Deal projects as boondoggles with little to
no accountability and oversight. In many WPA projects, accountability and oversight were built
in.
The TVA Technical Library was not unique in its providing library services for agency
workers. By 1934 nearly a dozen such libraries had been organized in response to the New Deal.
In addition to the TVA Technical Library, there were library services offered for agency
employees through the Farm Credit Administration, the Public Works Administration, the
Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Federal Housing Administration, and the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation.53 The TVA’s library services are, perhaps, unique in that it
provided dual services for both TVA workers and agency personnel.

Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps also enjoyed access to library services.
Library services to CCC camps were one of the more enduring library activities tied to
emergency relief, as the CCC was one of the first programs. As the decade wound down so did
the number of CCC camps. By 1937 there were just over 2000 camps and a year later in 1938
there were just over 1600. CCC camp library services consisted of a permanent collection, a
traveling library, and donations. CCC library services like other library services were tailored to
user needs and user feedback was assessed regularly. Services were therefore dynamic, and
intended to be responsive to user needs.54 Cooperation, once again, was also key, with the author
of one article noting that CCC camps needed “all the cooperation the state and county libraries,
as well as other nearby libraries, can give them.”55 In 1934, when FERA established a Transient
Bureau in Atlanta, a library was established as well. In explaining the need for a library, the state
transient director expressed his belief that there was “a mental as well as physical aspect to
consider” in providing relief. In October of 1935, when the library had been open for nearly
eighteen months, there had been more than 25,000 visitors.56
Traveling libraries were another notable example of library extension under the WPA.
Claiming that “library extension has become one of the outstanding functions of the Division of
Women’s and Professional Projects,” one WPA press release noted that “more than 5,800
traveling libraries are carrying books into sparsely settled rural areas.” “These traveling libraries
are a picturesque feature of the extension program,” continues the press release, and goes on to
describe how “Books are carried by pack-horse to the mountaineers of Kentucky, by houseboat

to remote communities along the Yazoo River in Mississippi, and by motor truck and car in rural
sections of several other states.”57
The packhorse libraries of Kentucky have endured in the popular imagination. They are
the subject of Donald Boyd’s 2007 article in Libraries and the Cultural Record, and in Nick
Taylor’s exhaustive chronicle of the WPA, his section on library projects devotes the most
attention to packhorse libraries.58 The packhorse libraries were unique means of delivering
library services in a period of economic deprivation. At a time when library services might have
been cut, instead they were expanded to the poorest and most desperate people: ways were found
to enlarge access.
The same press release describes how “as many as 32 mountaineers have been found
waiting at a sub-center for the packhorse carrier.” The sub-center was a church, general store,
post office, school, or even someone’s home. The packhorse libraries were a popular and
distinctive demonstration of what library extension would look like. Of course, the packhorse
libraries, like the WPA itself, were not meant to be permanent solutions. They were temporary
solutions—stopgap measures to provide emergency relief until more long-term solutions could
be established. In the case of the WPA, the optimal situation was full employment, with
temporary employment provided in the meantime. For libraries and ALA, WPA projects such as
the packhorse libraries were immediate actions to provide access until the ideal solution—full
library service—could be achieved. Packhorse libraries and other WPA projects served as useful

demonstrations of the popularity of library services, demonstrating the demand for library
services. Edward Chapman characterized packhorse services as “operating under the most
unfavorable topographical and social conditions” in order to extend library service to the
remotest parts of Kentucky, and that “before the inception of the WPA pack-horse libraries in
some twenty mountain counties of Kentucky, there was almost no library service except in the
larger centers of population, and here the libraries were mainly church and club libraries,
privately subsidized.”59
Chapman believed that one reason packhorse libraries were successful is that they were
staffed by members of the community. He wondered whether the idea of public tax-supported
library service would have been embraced by rural Kentuckians “if the WPA pack-horse library
carriers had not been native women, familiar with the social usages of the section.” He goes on
to claim that library extension in Kentucky “has been and still is, largely, a house to house
selling campaign, with substantial help afforded by word of mouth endorsement of the services
to neighbors by families whose resistance to and distrust of ‘foreign’ helps has been
overcome.”60 Chapman also stresses that without federal assistance in the form of the WPA,
library extension of this intimate nature would not likely have emerged on its own, asserting that
“the form of the service is entirely too expensive to operate on local budgets. It is difficult to
visualize by what other method this almost uniformly necessary door to door service could be
rendered.”61
The provision of WPA information services in rural areas amid mistrust toward the
federal government was also an issue for the Federal Writers’ Project (FWP). Jerre Mangione

Park, MD, 7.

wrote that in Wyoming, for example, “there was deep resentment that the government should be
using taxpayers’ money to pay salaries to writers. The term ‘writer’ coupled with ‘WPA’
connoted everything that New Deal haters considered scurrilous about the Roosevelt
Administration.”62 Hostility toward the Roosevelt Administration and the New Deal was not just
confined to rural areas, as Mangione wrote that in Chicago one FWP employee “found it
expedient not to identify himself with any government agency but to represent himself as a
researcher for the University of Chicago.”63
A mainstay of WPA library programming was library demonstration projects, temporary
displays meant to show what adequate library service or library extension might look like. In
areas where library service was previously unavailable, WPA library demonstration projects
showed users and legislators what library services could do. Often, the idea was that local and
state allocations would be made to support library services on an ongoing basis. As Edward
Chapman said, “the statewide service project is a means to an end and not the end itself.”64
Cooperation was essential for library extension—cooperation between the federal
government, the American Library Association, civic organizations, and libraries themselves
(addressed in the next chapter). Part of what makes expansion of access and the success of
library extension so remarkable is that success was not hindered by the participation of multiple
stakeholders, but was aided by it. The success of library extension it seems pivoted on
cooperation. With the assistance of people like Ellen Woodward and Edward Chapman, ALA
nurtured relationships with WPA administrators, ensuring that libraries would be given priority.

As a result, “through contact with the A.L.A. headquarters, the conviction of the national
administrators of WPA in regard to the need and desirability of well-organized library service
projects was strengthened.”65
Through this cooperative process different agencies surveyed and determined needs, best
practices, and protocols. Cooperation then meant assuring proper adherence to state and federal
guidelines. Guidelines for establishing WPA projects, including library services, were precise.
Likewise, library laws differ from state to state. Establishing library extension required
developing programs in accordance with these laws while also considering how to expand and
improve upon existing services. In other words, library projects, whether or not under the
auspices of the WPA, could not just be brought into being on a whim. As tax-supported
institutions, libraries are bound by the local, state, and federal laws that govern them. In the
1930s there was the added consideration for establishing library service projects in accordance
with emergency relief. Establishing library services required forethought, planning, and means
for sustained support.

Libraries and Access
There are several important examples of how librarians themselves directly enlarged and
expanded access. I will introduce the section by describing some of the more creative ways
librarians transformed access. Then I will turn the focus to ALA and the Library Extension

Board, followed by access in the context of state library agencies, library buildings, and African
American communities. This allows us to take a broad view of access by looking at institutional
actors, physical infrastructure, and users.
Library access was transformed in the manner of going from the inside out, by innovating
“outdoor” or “open air” libraries. Expansion of access in this manner was not unique in terms of
bringing library services to new places, as traveling libraries and bookmobiles had been in
service for decades prior to the Depression. However, the fully outdoor library does seem to have
been a 1930s invention. What made accessing libraries in the out of doors an appealing means of
access?
Gerald S. Greenberg claims the first outdoor library started in the summer of 1905 at the
New York Public Library’s Rivington Street branch, when a rooftop reading room opened to
attract patrons who would otherwise patronize the library but wanted to enjoy the precious fresh
air and daylight of summer. While Spain began building dedicated open air libraries sometime in
the early twentieth century, such a model did not take root in the United States until the 1930s.
Open air reading rooms of the 1930s included sidewalk libraries, park libraries, and even
beachfront libraries.66
There was a practical element. As in the case of Montclair Public Library in New Jersey,
the sidewalk book stalls opened on May 1, 1933, were meant to attract and engage passers-by,
bringing library service to people. But this was also a practical move, in that having outdoor
library service helped draw attention to older books and to “relieve the over-crowded main
building.” Hugh Grant Rowell of Columbia University’s Teacher’s College asked “how may the

library, an indoor institution, make a vital contribution to this outdoor side of the community
life?”67 Rowell urged libraries to offer outdoor access to library services, yet acknowledged that
“it may seem strange to urge to greater and broader service an institution which statistics prove is
having greater and greater demands put upon it in these days of wide-spread [sic] enforced
leisure.”68 Why should the library go outdoors when library usage was extraordinarily high
already? For libraries of the 1930s, the commitment to access attempted to broaden beyond
existing models. The goal was to reach as many patrons as possible, and also to demonstrate the
importance of the library in the community. Bringing library access to the outdoors not only
fulfilled an extension mission, it also indicated to the person on the street—who quite literally
may have been living on the street—that they too were part of the user base, and could and
should benefit from library services.
Another popular type of traveling library of the 1930s was the “library of the high seas”:
library services for the United States Navy and merchant marines. The American Merchant
Marine Library Association provided reading materials “to American merchant marine vessels,
marine hospitals and asylums, lightships, lighthouses, Coast Guard stations and cutters.”69 The
program was established in 1921 following successful ALA involvement in providing library
services to soldiers during the First World War. In 1936, a study was commissioned by the
American Merchant Marine Library Association to evaluate its effectiveness and determine
whether it was providing a valuable service. The study, funded by a grant from the Carnegie

life.”70

Library Extension Board: Background
One of the most active efforts to enhance library access was the work of ALA’s Library
Extension Board. The work of the Library Extension Board is significant and warrants more indepth discussion because of its vigorous efforts to promote access, and for how it not only
articulated and coordinated federal library policy but also promoted relief projects. The Library
Extension Board’s role has not been fully acknowledged (if at all) in this regard.
ALA had been officially involved in library extension since the early 1920s, however the
Great Depression seems to have reinvigorated the Board’s activities. The Library Extension
Board’s Executive Assistant was Julia Wright Merrill, a prominent figure in ALA leadership.
The Library Extension Board sought to make access to library services a reality for each and
every person. In June 1931 at ALA Annual, the state library extension agencies of New England
were invited to present on how widespread library services were. The reports indicate how farreaching ALA staff and members of the Library Extension Board envisioned that access could
be. Using a “town” as a unit for service, New England was deemed to have more “complete
service than any other section of the United States,” with Massachusetts reporting a library in
every town and Rhode Island having only two towns without a library. New Hampshire,
Vermont, and Connecticut all had 15 towns or less without libraries; Maine was the outlier with
regard to lack of library service with 175 towns without libraries.71

When the Library Extension Board met again at ALA Midwinter at the end of December,
1931, budgetary issues came to the fore. This makes sense considering that 1932 was the nadir of
the Great Depression. ALA and the Library Extension Board felt the economic desperation, yet
this did not discourage staff and committee members from moving forward with existing library
projects and developing new ones. The December 1931 meeting was nevertheless a kind of
reality check, a sobering meeting perhaps, where members had to prioritize agenda items in light
of projected severe budget constraints going into 1932. This is reflected in the list of suggestions
generated at the meeting, including “do a few things well rather than attempt too much” and
“work with state library extension agencies.”72 These suggestions seemed aimed at achieving the
practical while working toward the ultimate ideal goal of universal library service through
cooperation.
Much work was done which became useful for establishing library service projects under
emergency relief later on, especially with the establishment of the WPA in 1935. The ALA could
not know in the early 1930s that its work would become so useful. Indeed, it seems we must
attribute the WPA library projects’ success in part to the thorough and attentive work undertaken
by ALA in the first half of the decade. There were likely so many successful library extension
programs under relief because the ALA had been envisioning and planning for what full-bodied
library extension would look like and what it would require. This is an important detail. The
existing scholarship on library extension in the 1930s seems to address either the WPA or the
ALA, but not both.73 Yet this is one of the more convincing and important examples of
cooperation between libraries, library associations, and the state.

Library Extension Board: 1932
Minutes from the business meeting of the Library Extension Board’s December 1932
meeting show that regional demonstration projects were under consideration in Michigan,
Vermont, Tennessee, and the Southeast. There was also a presentation by Louis Round Wilson,
then of Chicago’s Graduate Library School (GLS), on conducting studies under the auspices of
GLS in service of the work of the Library Extension Board.74 In addition to its business meeting,
the Library Extension Board also held a joint meeting with the Board on the Library and Adult
Education, where the main topic of discussion was “The State Library Extension Agency and
Adult Education.” The presentation by Julia Wright Merrill observed that opportunities for
extension and cooperation were ripe “in light of present interest in social, economic and
governmental problems.” Meeting participants observed increased interest in reading in their
libraries, which they found heartening; at the same time they wanted to understand what
prompted this interest, in order to better formulate plans for library extension.75
The enthusiasm and dedication on the part of ALA leadership at the end of 1932 was not
naive. They did not know, of course, that library extension would proceed or develop as they
hoped. Carl Milam acknowledged the realities of economic crisis and their effect upon
maintaining existing libraries, let alone on the creation of new library services via library
extension, saying soberly “I myself do not see very much promise in an effort on our part to
extend the geographic limitations of any library unit, or the establishment of any new library.”
While Milam noted his concern, he also emphasized that ALA was getting “innumerable
questions” about how to manage libraries in economic crisis, that “there has come a demand such

as we have never felt before at Headquarters, for advisory service on public library budgets, or
what we might term the public administration of public library service.”76 Alice Tyler of the
Library Extension Board described the relationship between ALA and state library agencies as
one of “first aid.”77
At the very core of these Library Extension Board discussions was identifying the
overarching purpose and mission of the library, which in turn would guide the efforts of the
Board. J.O. Modisette, a vocal library advocate and longtime member of the Louisiana Library
Commission, asked which was the more important focus of the Library Extension Board:
directing reading, or educating people about the importance of libraries? Modisette argued that
“the American Library Association ought, above all else, to try to blaze forth this campaign of
education, of teaching the public what library service means.”78

Library Extension Board: 1933
An important part of the Library Extension Board’s work involved collaborating with
various library committees and other allies in extending library services. This collaboration was
driven by a mutual commitment to similar goals and a belief that no one agency or group of
people were likely to accomplish these goals on their own. At the October, 1933, meeting in
Chicago the Library Extension Board was looking to the Southern United States for such fruitful
collaboration. Regional Field Agent Tommie Dora Barker offered that “the joint meeting of the
Southeastern and Southwestern Library Associations” would be meeting in the fall of 1934, and
that “seems to offer an opportunity for developing long-time programs for the whole section.”79

This federated structure of which ALA was the nucleus was similar to what would be put into
place in the 1930s for federal emergency relief. The ALA could serve as a touchstone for various
library agencies and organizations, but ALA did not dictate how they should function. What
made this model work was that each group operated independently while receiving guidance and
support from ALA. After all, each community would know what was best for itself. The
participation of state and regional organizations in the Library Extension Board helped provided
needed evidence on what worked, and in turn the Library Extension Board could fine-tune their
efforts to be more effective.
The October, 1933 meeting was also significant for members’ discussion of the New
Deal. Board members were keen to address how emergency relief could accelerate library
extension, including the idea of demonstration projects as part of emergency relief. From this
discussion it was agreed that there was a need for “strong state leadership” and “studies of the
population and wealth required for a unit of rural library service.”80 Again, this shows ALA did
not merely wish to extend library service, they wanted to do so in a scientific way.
Finally, the October, 1933 meeting was also important for the resolution on state library
agencies and library extension in economic crisis sent by the Board to ALA Council. The
resolution emphasized that “this time of flux and rapid change” necessitated “a reaffirmation of
the importance of the state library extension. Council was asked to reaffirm
Its faith in the fundamental economy and effective results of adequate support and vigorous
functioning of state library extension agencies in the advance of library services to meet
these rapidly changing conditions. We urge all friends of culture and popular education to
cooperate in the efforts to provide for all citizens easy access to books by the establishment
of coordinated large-scale systems of public libraries, the development of library service
under trained and expert leadership, to the end that our common life may be enriched by
universal education and all other cultural means.81

Library Extension Board: 1934
That the Library Extension Board held a special meeting in April, 1934 in Knoxville,
Tennessee indicates a continued interest in library extension efforts in the South, with special
attention to the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Library Extension Board saw the TVA as a
planning model that could be extrapolated for library planning. TVA head Arthur E. Morgan
spoke at the meeting about what he saw as the possible role for libraries in everyday life and his
organizational philosophy in guiding the TVA.
Also present at the special board meeting was longtime proponent and activist for
Southern library extension, and Library Extension Board member and TVA librarian Mary
Utopia Rothrock. With Rothrock, Tommie Dora Barker, and J.O. Modisette on the Board,
Southeastern librarians were well-represented. It is reasonable to infer that the relatively dire
state of library services in the Southeastern United States spurred librarians of that region to
action.
In his opening remarks to the Board, Arthur E. Morgan acknowledged that his planning
philosophy was congruent with his approach to his previous work as President of Antioch
College. Whether planning an educational curriculum or a rural electrification project, Morgan
believed in a holistic approach in which no “single factor of development” should be pursued,
but that there needs to be “a sense of proportion in which we develop all factors and all elements
of the situation in good relation to one another…”82 Morgan saw how this approach also
extended, as it were, to library extension, acknowledging that “the discussion of library policy is
not at all aside from what I see to be our job.”83 He waxed nostalgic about his own boyhood

library and how its collection of “great literature” was a highly influential factor in his own
development, and sought to generalize to a wider process of cultural uplift. Morgan speculated
that appreciation for “great literature” requires dedication and does not merely happen. He stated
his belief in the possibility that “through design we could build up a hierarchy that would lay a
basis for good reading - there would be almost a science of learning to read.” To which Carl
Milam responded “I think we ought to admit we know very little about that science, but that
during the last three or four years we have made a beginning which may some day tell us about
that.” Milam’s remark seems possibly related to the formal establishment of graduate education
and research in library science at the University of Chicago.
Embedded in this question was access for whom. Morgan contended that the library’s
purpose was to promote good taste in reading, and disapproved of including lowbrow materials.
Morgan’s position would later be echoed by the findings of the Public Library Inquiry, which
suggested libraries cater to exceptionally bright and engaged users. Milam and Modisette were
skeptical of this approach, as they believed that libraries should serve the widest range of people.
Modisette tied this perspective on access to economic crisis when he declared “to me it is much
more important from an economic cultural standpoint to have all our people educated and
developed to a sense of responsibility, to a certain level, let it be high or lower, than it is to have
a few privileged classes educated to the limit of responsibility and the masses far down in the
valley.”84 Some ALA leaders seemed to believe, therefore, in equality of access. Mary Utopia
Rothrock told Morgan directly that he was “challenging some dearly held convictions of
librarians when you bring up the idea of a few leaders versus the mass of the community.”85

84
85

136

Morgan, however, insisted that libraries should have books that make people think, and he
intimated that it is better to have no reading at all than to read “trash”.
Identifying the source of funding was crucial to any systematized enlargement of access.
Modisette cut right to the chase about securing federal and state funding for libraries, asking
“Don’t you think we ought to go to Congress and the Legislature? There are so many people who
are apologetic when it comes to asking for appropriations - they are afraid to ask for what they
need - they go back home and they are supported out of the funds of the Community Chest and
box suppers, instead of standing out as strong representative men and women in a fundamental
educational movement.”86 In a similar vein, Mary Utopia Rothrock spoke to the relationship
between New Deal agencies and library extension, and how this might serve as an argument in
support of federal aid for libraries: “You spoke of the possible strategy of getting appointments
in the Office of Education—of developing this national aspect. We library people have been
watching with much interest the New Deal educational enterprises - the CCC camps, the CWA,
and the TVA, and others, and we wonder if it might be possible for us to get some sort of library
activity into the federal set-up in the way in which adult education has gotten into the CCC
camps.”87 Morgan affirmed that even the most difficult or abstract of ideas can be successful
provided there is good leadership; with able leadership and a vision, broader support will follow.
Then as Morgan was about to depart, Modisette asked “If the American Library Association saw
fit to get behind a movement to get Congress to appropriate one hundred million dollars for
library development, they could get it over if they really wanted to start it?” To which Morgan
responded encouragingly “Yes—they will find some crack in the door.”88

After Morgan’s departure, the meeting recommenced with Milam making an observation
about cooperation in library extension and other types of planning: “...there is an inevitable
overlapping of interests in state planning, regional planning, and that the only thing you can do is
coordinate…”89 Milam went on to identify libraries as being positioned to be part of the
emerging interest in cultural planning: “In all the national planning the emphasis so far has been
on the economic and physical, and we feel that some of these days cultural planning will come
into the picture equally, and we want to be as nearly ready for that as we can.”90
The Board discussed the possibility of the TVA as a site for demonstrating both what
economic relief and library services could do, with H.A. Morgan91 saying “I think it is of
tremendous interest to library people to know why this area is a good area in which to conduct
these experiments.” H.A. Morgan believed that if a TVA library program was going to be created
“that is going to be of national interest,” this necessitated an understanding of why the South was
the most suitable site for such a demonstration. Morgan stated that “The Valley was selected as
an exceptional area in which to place the yardstick on our civic, economic and social
problems.”92 Milam echoed some of Arthur Morgan’s previous statements, saying “We are
almost as interested in the whole educational program as we are in the library program, because
we are convinced that no educational institution can prosper until the whole thing prospers.”
Attendees at the meeting discussed how regional and state library organization might or might
not fit with the organization of the TVA, which was a multi-state operation. How could different
states cooperate under a central library agency, considering different states had different library
laws? They also discussed the possibility of the creation of a state educational body that also

92

included museums and libraries. Modisette warned against this idea, that there was still the
likelihood that libraries would be overlooked in such a scheme, unless it could be ensured that
the director of such a body would be a person familiar with and appreciative of library services.
The following day after some deliberation over wording, the Library Extension Board
voted to “authorize and instruct Miss Barker and Miss Rothrock to make a study of the region
and formulate a library project for the proposed TVA demonstration area and submit it to the
Board.”93 The Board also voted to send a communication to the TVA encouraging the TVA to
support library demonstration in a specific area of the Valley as part of the “general social and
educational experiment” being undertaken.
Board Chairman C.B. Lester mused that “library relations with the TVA might be an
entering wedge for federal aid” while Mary Utopia Rothrock “suggested that library service to
CCC camps might be a ‘crack in the door.’”94 Milam confirmed he had already been in talks with
CCC leaders. Meanwhile, Modisette wondered if “a popular campaign [were] needed to organize
support of various organizations and press associations behind a movement for large scale
federal aid, and then a direct approach to leading senators and representatives…that it would not
go through in one administration, but would ultimately.”95 Board member and ALA President
Gratia Countryman responded by telling of her work talking to local Congressmen about federal
aid for libraries.
Action was swift with regard to library extension and the TVA. At the June, 1934 Board
meeting held during ALA Annual in Montreal, Mary Utopia Rothrock “reported that the library
situation in the TVA had advanced since the April meeting,” with more library staff, more books,

and improved library space.96 Mary Mallory’s article describes what followed with Rothrock and
the TVA. Meanwhile, ALA Council passed a resolution affirming the value and utility of relief
projects in and with libraries, and urged “that the services of greater numbers of the more able
professional workers be made available even if they are not completely destitute.”97 It is
interesting that this was resolution was attached to the minutes of the Library Extension Board,
as this is an indication of how Library Extension work was making headway in ALA more
broadly, and was also a harbinger of how the Library Extension Board was moving in the
direction of writing and influencing federal policy. Because the subsequent work of the Library
Extension Board in the 1930s is policy-related, I will leave further discussion of the Library
Extension Board to the next chapter.

State Libraries: Archives and Issues of Access
State libraries and archives were closely intertwined, and in the 1930s we see examples of
how archives were prioritized at all levels of government: federal, state, and local. We also see
involvement of local libraries in the development of archives. First, when we speak of archives,
we are not talking about information management within private institutions, but government
archives—which were seen as a necessary and important government function, one important
enough to warrant funding during a protracted economic crisis. The importance of archives is
demonstrated in the founding of the National Archives and Records Administration (1934) and
the establishment of the Society of American Archivists (1936).98

The Illinois State Library opened a new State Archives building amid much fanfare in
October, 1938. The new building, which cost nearly one million dollars, was opened during a
joint convention of the Society of American Archivists and the Illinois Library Association. Here
is another example of collaboration and cooperation: this time between archivists and librarians.
Margaret Norton, the Illinois State Archivist, said of the opening: “This is the third building in
the United States devoted exclusively to the preservation and storage of archives, the other two
being the National Archives at Washington and the Maryland Hall of Records at Annapolis.”99 In
her detailed description of the Archives building, Norton made a point of mentioning that the
most modern methods were used, including the presence of “a photographic laboratory for
microphotography and photostating.”100 The new building also housed the editorial offices of the
Historical Records Survey. Norton concluded by saying “the State of Illinois is justifiably proud
of the forward step it has taken in the protection of the records upon which the legal rights of its
citizens and its government depend.”101 Here we can infer a direct relationship between state
archives and democratic participation. Perhaps the intensive promotion of state archives in the
1930s was part of a demonstration of government transparency, provided as a contrast to
political authoritarianism abroad.
Many WPA projects took place in archives and focused on preservation. The commitment
by state legislatures to erect permanent archival infrastructures was important, because WPA
projects were meant to be temporary. If there was to be ongoing effort to maintain state archives
and to initiate new projects, the state would have to make this a priority. This point was driven
home by Dorsey Hyde of the National Archives: “the information made available by the WPA

surveys presents merely an OPPORTUNITY which must be properly capitalized if the
advantages gained are to be made permanent. There is little use in listing records whose location
is not definitely fixed or which are stored in a temporary or inadequate depository.”102 Sadly, this
is precisely what came to pass in states which did not prepare for permanent archival
infrastructure or figure out how to integrate WPA archival inventories surveys into ongoing
archival programs. One archivist writing in 1974 found that “with the exception of one state, or
possibly two,” all of New England’s Historical Records Survey records “had disappeared.”103

Library Buildings
One of the obvious physical manifestations of expansion of library services was in the
tangible form of library buildings. Construction of new library buildings, as we have already
seen, did not halt in the 1930s. It is important to acknowledge that the construction of library
buildings under the New Deal was not just about providing aid to libraries, but also about
providing employment for construction workers. Nevertheless, the construction of library
buildings was not just “make work” projects; they both demonstrate that libraries are
infrastructure as well as the success of library advocates for expansion of access.
In some cases, real urgency hastened the construction of new buildings. Fire destroyed
Oregon’s Capitol in 1935, which also housed the State Library. In the planning to rebuild the
Capitol, it was determined that two buildings would better suit the needs of Oregonians.

The new Oregon State Library opened in 1939, “a beautiful building erected by the state with
WPA aid.”104 WPA aid helped erect 1,000 new libraries in the 1930s, but an important part of
this story is that the commitment to expanding access also shows in the ready appropriation of
state funding for libraries.105 State library agencies were successful in garnering state financial
support in the midst of the Great Depression. Library extension in the 1930s was possible
through both increased federal and state appropriations. The former came in the form of WPA
funding, while the latter was often the result of focused legislative campaigns to increase state
library funding. Since campaigns for library funding are more properly in the “policy” category,
the specifics of these funding campaigns will be discussed in greater depth in the next chapter.
Suffice to say that such campaigning and articulation of library policy was crucial for library
extension and enhancement of access to library services in the 1930s.
State library agencies were active in variety of ways, and not just within their own
buildings. Like the Library of Congress, state libraries began as collections in service to
legislators, but then branched out to serve a great many more users in a variety of contexts. Field
representative John Henderson described how the California State Library promoted library
extension services, in part, through its support of the establishment of county libraries;
Henderson noted that “there is a particularly close relationship between the county libraries and
the State Library.”106
Extension in California involved reaching out to geographically remote populations, but
also meant serving patrons who had other access needs. For example, reading for users with

visual impairments (referred to as “the blind”) was an area where libraries sought to improve and
enhance access. The California State Library began reaching out to blind users in 1905. Blind
users had access to “a comprehensive collection of books” that could be mailed from the State
Library free of charge thanks to government frank. In-home adult education services for blind
patrons were also available, with teachers visiting “private homes, public and private charitable
institutions, soldiers’ homes, county hospitals, and poor farms.” It is of note that “the California
State Library was designated a western depository for blind publications” but especially so that
this designation was made through “an annual Federal appropriation voted in the 1930-31
session of Congress.”107 As the nation was plunging into economic depression, Congressional
appropriations were being made to enhance access for people with visual impairments! In 1936
the California State Library began sending out talking-book machines to patrons, which were
“sent out on indefinite loan to blind persons unable to purchase them.”108 The talking-book
machines and the talking-books (records) were circulated free of charge for blind patrons who
requested them.
Striking examples of library expansion could be found across the United States. In
Berkeley, California the prosperity of the 1920s supported the construction of three branch
libraries, under the stewardship of Carleton B. Joeckel, one of the key figures involved in the
transformation of the system of information provision in the 1930s. Joeckel served as the director
of the Berkeley Public Library until 1927 and presided over its expansion. In that time the main
branch outgrew its facility and required a larger building. The new main branch of the Berkeley
Public Library was dedicated in January 1931, with money provided by a city tax levy. This
suggests that the full impact of the Depression was not felt evenly and at the same time.

It is possible that the Berkeley Public Library was able to open a new main branch in early 1931
not in spite of the Depression but because the Depression had not yet wrought its destruction.
Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that library construction was not stalled or
halted, indicating that users valued their libraries, not to mention that there was strong federal
support for putting construction workers back to work. This is made all the more clear when
considering that Berkeley opened the new North Branch Library in October, 1935, funded in part
by a PWA grant and a surplus in the library building fund.109 Yet Berkeley Public Library users
were not the only ones to benefit from this prosperity—it appears to have been shared and
distributed in the spirit of cooperation that characterized the system of information provision and
libraries in particular of the 1930s. Catalog Department Chief Lolita Carden reported in 1939
that “work with the schools has been continuous. Guidance in adult education activities for clubs
and individuals has been increasing. Branch library collections have been growing more flexible
and have been aiming to interpret more fully the needs of their particular reading public. A
program of interlibrary loan service and cooperative book selection for the whole Bay district has
been considered… In brief, the Library is looking beyond its four walls in the realization that
there are further voyages of discovery and roads of experimentation in a broader service,
individual and cooperative, in this Metropolitan area.”110
Farther south near Bakersfield, WPA funds supported the building of adobe style branch
libraries in Kern County.111 WPA funds helped convert an historic church building into a space
for the new Pensacola Public Library, and also paid for the book repair and cleaning.112 In
Brooklyn, ground for a new central library was first broken in 1912, yet it was not until the

1930s that sufficient funds were available to complete construction on the new building.113
On the other side of the country, Librarian Eleanor Leonard described how library
expansion became a priority in northern Virginia’s Arlington County with the formation of the
Arlington County Library Association in 1936. The Library Association was able to secure its
first county library appropriation for fiscal year 1936-37. Leonard notes her work as county
librarian was “varied and full” and that she had “been librarian, counselor, janitress, painter,
carpenter, fireman, and beggar.”114 Leonard said that she had, just the same, insisted on “high
standards with no half measures.”115
In Texas, the Fort Worth Public Library opened the doors to its new building in June
1939. Staff and the Board of Trustees began arguing for a new building in 1926 because they
needed more space, but a new building did not take off until the 1930s, with the help of the
Public Works Administration. Librarian Harry Peterson acknowledged that “there has been
frequent comment on the excellence of the construction. This is due in no small measure to the
splendid cooperation given by George M. Bull, Regional Director of the Public Works
Administration...The total cost of the building was approximately $400,000, of which $180,000
was PWA grant and $220,000 city loan.”116
There are many examples of new buildings for academic libraries in the 1930s. The
Friedsam Library at New York’s St. Bonaventure College opened in 1938.117 Goucher College’s
new library, a “center of modern educational effort,” and the Mother Irene Gill Memorial Library

Brown University, Westminster College, and Drew University.119
Building a new library offered the opportunity to incorporate modern points of access.
When Drew University’s Rose Memorial Library opened in June, 1939, it included a “forwardlooking photography department” based on the sense that “photography has become so closely
related to the current library program and is likely to occupy a greater place in the future.”120

Cooperative Cataloging and Access
Initiatives to improve access also developed around cooperative cataloging, and they
originated prior to the Depression. According to “A Restatement of the ALA Plan for the
Promotion of Research Library Service by Cooperative Methods,” ALA’s Committee on
Bibliography first introduced a cooperative cataloging proposal to ALA Council in March, 1926.
At that meeting Council voted to authorize funds to continue and extend “union card lists of
books, manuscripts and special collections available in libraries throughout the world…[and] for
funds to organize such aspects of the problem of research books as cannot be handled by the
Library of Congress…”121 A pamphlet published in August 1926 suggested a five year plan,
which included recommendations for creation of an “association of research libraries under the
auspices of the Executive Board of the American Library Association for the cooperative
purchase of books…”122 The updated 1930 report restated that “main objective of the ALA plan”

was the “Union Finding List of Printed Books in American Locations.” They projected that “the
number of works existing in America which might be quickly located by inexpensive methods of
cooperation, copying and pasting, was estimated at 6,000,000.”123 Although microfilm was not
mentioned in the 1930 report, it is clear that these goals dovetailed with those of the nascent Joint
Committee on Materials for Research.
This initiative was not swept aside by the Depression. Seeded with a grant of $13,500, the
ALA Cooperative Cataloging Committee was established in June, 1931 to “investigate the
possibilities of cooperative cataloging among libraries dealing with research material.” In the fall
of 1931 Paul North Rice, Executive Assistant to the Committee and Librarian of the Dayton
Public Library, visited 43 large Midwestern and east coast libraries to discuss cooperative
cataloging plans. In a September, 1932 report submitted to the General Education Board, the
Cooperative Cataloging Committee stated that Rice found “the attitude of almost every one with
whom he talked was very encouraging.”124 He also highlighted the “great value of the Union
Catalogue” of the Library of Congress, “and urged the importance of the Catalogue’s
continuance and enlargement.”125 Cooperative cataloging was seen as being more efficient
because it eliminated the unnecessary duplication of records. Whatever initial investment would
be required to start an effective cooperative cataloging system, and however much it cost to
maintain it, would be more cost-effective and efficient in the long run than continuing a
dispersed cataloging system. Cooperative cataloging was also seen as a revenue generator, as
cooperative cataloging would be an opt-in system. Thus, while a library would pay something for

items in the shared cataloging system, it would still cost less than if they had to catalog the item
on their own.
Cooperative cataloging was a means of combatting unemployment, according to a New
York Times piece published in late 1932 by Library of Congress consultant, Ernest Cushing
Richardson. Stating that “the outstanding economic situation is joblessness. Every one meets this
situation—even a librarian,” Richardson proposed putting people back to work on creating a
union catalog for all of the United States. One of the virtues of such a project was that it required
“not only unemployed librarians but untrained workers in large numbers of precisely the type for
which it is hardest to invent really useful employment in depression times…126 Again, creating a
union catalog not only would enhance access to libraries, but also put people back to work. The
creation of a union catalog for 146 Philadelphia-area libraries, for example, employed hundreds
of typists, stenographers, and file clerks.127

African American Communities and Access
Studies about library services for African Americans tend to focus specifically on the
Southern United States, such as David Battles’ 2009 book The History of Public Library Access
for African Americans in the South.128 Battles draws extensively from Eliza Gleason’s 1941 book
The Southern Negro and the Public Library, which was based on her doctoral dissertation at the
University of Chicago’s Graduate Library School.129 Another key source on library services for
African Americans in the 1930s is Ann Shockley’s 1960 study, A History of Public Library
Ernest Cushing Richardson “Union Library Catalogues Suggested to Aid Jobless: Project Would Give
Employment to Many Untrained Workers and Increase Service,” New York Times, December 18, 1932.

Services to Negroes in the South, 1900-1955.130 This may reflect the fact that until the early
twentieth century, African Americans still lived disproportionately in the South. All of these
works address the 1930s to some extent, but not within the larger context of the transformation
that occurred.
Once again, with respect to library services to African Americans, some efforts had been
made before 1930 to improve access. Julius Rosenwald, a founder of Sears and Roebuck, first
began pledging money for African American causes in 1911, and he established the Rosenwald
Fund in 1917.131 Again, the Depression did not curtail these initiatives. Battles says of the
Rosenwald Fund that “part of the tremendous blow of the Depression was softened by a
$500,000 gift by the Rosenwald Fund to southern states for libraries.”132 The gift was granted in
1930 and spread out over five years. The Southeastern Library Association, formed in 1920,
would go on to play an important role in library extension generally and specifically for African
Americans in the South. By 1931 the Southeastern Library Association, which included
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,
and Virginia “had written into its resolutions that ‘library service to Negroes should be part of
every library program.”133 That was a forward-thinking position in this period of entrenched Jim
Crow.
Efforts were made by ALA members to improve access for American Americans, though
not without struggle. The Work With Negroes Round Table was created in 1922 at ALA’s
annual meeting. The Round Table met exactly once more, in 1923, when it was disbanded due to

controversy—Shockley writes that the work ended “disastrously when it developed into an intersectional and inter-racial feud.”134 The American Library Association’s Committee on Library
Extension, the forerunner of the Library Extension Board, published a study in 1926 on public
library services to African Americans—just one year after its establishment, suggesting this was
a priority.135
A significant moment for African American librarians in the 1930s was the 1936 ALA
Annual Conference held in the segregated city of Richmond, Virginia. In the May 1, 1936 issue
of Library Journal, in advance of the Richmond conference, Edith Snow wrote “I understand
that colored librarians are to be segregated at the Richmond meeting...Is this the best the A.L.A.
can do? I am shocked to think so… I think the A.L.A. can do no less than refuse to meet in such
states until they progress a bit.”136 A letter published two weeks later explained how segregated
facilities would impact attendees at Annual. Library Journal asked for member comments “from
those who feel that, if it was impossible to find a meeting place where such conditions could be
avoided, announcement should have been made in the official Bulletin of the American Library
Association accompanied by an expression of regret at its inability to extend to all members the
full rights and privileges which its acceptance of their membership dues tacitly promised.”137
The conference was held in Richmond that month, and in the June 1, 1936 issue of
Library Journal the letters began pouring in. A member named Beatrice Winser wrote “I am
perfectly aware of the feeling toward the Negro in the South and that the A.L.A. could not be
expected to change conditions. I wish, however, to protest against the A.L.A. holding a meeting
in any section of the country where all its members of whatever race are not welcome.

We certainly betray our profession if we do not maintain libraries, and all their ways, as the most
democratic and human institutions in the world.”138 Frederick A. Blossom wrote even more
forcefully, calling ALA “a pusillanimous organization” that “weakly yields to medieval bigotry”
and concluded by saying “I have heard it said that that Richmond discriminations were
‘degrading’ to our Negro fellow members. This is incorrect. It is not they but our association that
has suffered degradation.”139 The letters filled a page and a half of comments in another June
issue of Library Journal, a large amount considering the letters typically took up just a couple of
paragraphs per subject. The conversation continued into the next issue, when Wallace Van
Jackson asked his fellow members to support African American librarians “in the endeavor to
have the association hold its annual conferences in cities where all of its members may
participate equally in the meetings, sessions, and round table discussions.”140
The postmortem of the Richmond conference as it played out in the pages of Library
Journal can be viewed as a barometer of member attitudes toward equality for African American
members. Most of the letters to Library Journal were from writers who believed that ALA had
acted wrongly to hold a conference in city that enforced segregation. The backlash against
segregation at the 1936 Annual is a far cry from the controversy that erupted amongst
membership in 1923 in response to the Work With Negroes Round Table. It seems that in a little
over a dozen years, support for greater access had increased. Something about ALA member
attitudes had changed by 1936. ALA had held conferences in cities with segregated facilities
before Richmond. Just four years prior it had the Annual Conference in New Orleans.141

Why was segregation so disturbing to membership in 1936 Richmond? One possible explanation
is the growing activist momentum for African American equality in the 1930s, and that
librarianship likewise reflected this consciousness around race.
Jean Preer’s 2004 article shows how it is impossible to talk about the Richmond
conference without addressing race.142 Her article also points to how the 1936 Annual
Conference can be remembered as a landmark event for other reasons, namely for the emphases
on technology, advocacy, and federal aid. It was in Richmond where ALA voted to endorse
federal aid for libraries, though this endorsement was hard-won and not without vigorous debate.
The contours of this debate will be more closely examined in the policy chapter. Hand in hand
with the emphasis on federal aid was an emphasis on the need for librarians to be vocal
advocates for library support in their communities and states. Federal aid would come more
readily to libraries if librarians demonstrated their own commitment while also enlisting users to
advocate for libraries.
The Richmond conference is also memorable for its sessions about technology in
libraries. A Library Journal article from 1936 predicted that a “thorough demonstration of
microphotography” would be “an outstanding feature of the Richmond conference” and “an
illuminating experience for everybody.”143 Preer writes “The 1936 conference itself
demonstrated how librarians could use new communication media to reach larger audiences of
library users and supporters.”144 These media included radio, film, and microphotography, with
“a daylong symposium on microphotography.”145 In addition, engineer David Cushman Coyle

delivered a speech entitled “Technology and Culture” during the conference’s first general
session. Had the conference not occurred in segregated Richmond, perhaps it would have been
remembered for being an historic moment for its emphases on technology, advocacy, and federal
aid—positive harbingers of transformation of the system of information provision. Instead the
Richmond conference in the history of librarianship is more of a notorious and embarrassing
event in ALA history. However, it is possible to see the way race was discussed as a positive
harbinger. In the past ALA had held conferences in locations with segregated facilities. The
outcry over segregation at Richmond can be seen as a change of consciousness. By 1936, much
of ALA’s membership felt that its claim to promote democracy was incongruent with holding a
conference in a segregated city.
Attempts to encourage or perhaps show support for greater access for African Americans
are found with some frequency in publications from the 1930s. A typical example is a May 1936
short piece in Library Journal entitled “Reading for Negroes.” The piece reports that in March
1936 “to make reading a part of Negro community life in Texas, and to make the slogan of ‘The
right book to the right person at the right time’ a reality to Negroes in Texas, were the two
objectives named by colored librarians at their second annual conference…” The article goes on
to report the resolutions that African Americans should be included in state library extension
services, and that there should be African American representation in the Texas Library and
Historical Commission. The resolution called for “at least one” African American trained
librarian to be involved. Finally, the resolution asserted that outreach to African American
library users of Texas should be “of interest to every educator, regardless of race.”146

154

Others too felt the 1930s were an auspicious period for African Americans in libraries, as
users and workers. In 1939 one writer optimistically characterized the decade: “During the last
few years great interest has been shown by the Negro in the library movement in the United
States. In many large cities branches have been opened for Negroes, and Negro colleges have
added materially to their libraries… A recent study disclosed the fact that by 1938 over 200
Negro librarians had completed the first year course in library science at accredited library
schools in the United States and Canada.”147 The author goes on to emphasize, however, that
African Americans have long “held an important place in the development of libraries in the
United States,” noting that African Americans were pioneers “in the branch library movement in
the East and the South.”148
Sadie Peterson-Delaney’s 1938 article for Library Journal, “The Place of Bibliotherapy
in a Hospital,” describes the therapeutic properties possible in reading, written from the
perspective of a fellow librarian engaged in such an approach. For example, Peterson-Delaney
describes how her library serves “the mental patients who come from the closed wards...Here
they are aided in the development of their dormant qualities through books, and are given
individual attention and sympathetic direction.”149 She also paid daily visits to patients confined
to bed rest, and assisted other users with developing leisure interests or working toward
educational goals.
At the same time, Peterson-Delaney’s article is also a sketch of library services for
African Americans in the Deep South in the 1930s. She writes that “the atmosphere of the library
is conducive to reading. Its green walls are hung with maps, paintings, and pictures of Negro

leaders and authors of books as well as other outstanding persons who have attained great
heights through books. There are nearly 6,000 volumes in the general collection, and a separate
collection of books by and about the Negro.”150 Here we see that access for African American
veterans meant not just the provision of general reading materials and other general sources of
information, but information of potential interest specifically to African American veterans. The
library itself was decorated in such a way to emphasize the contributions of African Americans.
In this way, African American library services provided the sort of moral uplift that is commonly
associated with outreach efforts during the 1930s.151
As an historically marginalized group, African Americans bore a disproportionate burden
during the Great Depression, with half of the African American population out of work in 1932
as opposed to the national rate. Nevertheless, more room was made in the 1930s for African
Americans to use and work in the system of information provision. With financing available
from the Rosenwald Fund, growing pressure from ALA members for equal services, the work of
the Library Extension Board and the Southeastern Library Association, and emergency relief,
access to library services for African Americans expanded in the 1930s.

Conclusion
Efforts to enlarge and expand information access were robust in the 1930s. Increased
attention to archives followed with the creation of the National Archives in the 1930s, and the
various federal programs under the Works Progress Administration devoted to archival work.
Access to scholarly resources was emphasized in the creation of organizations such as the Joint

Committee on Materials for Research and the American Documentation Institute. With the
passage of Federal Emergency Relief Act in 1935, the promise of emergency relief for libraries
was close at hand, galvanizing many librarians into action, advocating for an allotment of funds
for their libraries while offering detailed proposals for how such funds could be spent. In May
1935, director of the Pennsylvania State Library Gertrude MacKinney provided an outline of
how an emergency relief project would play out in Pennsylvania. While the plan overall sought
to improve upon existing or traditional library services in Pennsylvania, MacKinney’s plan also
sought “to enable libraries and [the] state library agency to participate helpfully in federal
programs of emergency education, youth activities, student aid, rural rehabilitation, subsistence
homesteads, CCC camps, transient centers, et cetera.”152 MacKinney notes that she based her
proposal on the “ALA Federal Project.”
It appears, then, that the National Plan for Libraries and proposals for emergency and
permanent funding for libraries struck a chord with many librarians. Likewise, the increased
attention to archives, government records, and scholarly communication deepened in the 1930s.
In this case librarians’ desire and conviction turned into political action. One the marked features
of the 1930s system of information provision was the many ways that information policy was
articulated. These things could be achieved or made stronger because they were part of a policy
framework.
What are some possible explanations for this multiform trend to enhance access? One is
that the federal government was extending into the political economy nationwide—including
library support. There was also persistent and successful lobbying and networking by librarians
and professional organizations like the American Library Association. At the same time, the

152

157

growth of adjacent activities in scholarship and science led to a strong need for improved library
service. Finally, the self-organization of the working class and anti-racism activities of the era
contributed to the push for increased access.
This is not to suggest that information access was total in the 1930s. There were barriers
to access preceding the 1930s that persisted into the decade and beyond. Moreover, it is beyond
the scope of this dissertation to ascertain the extent to which enlargement of access helped public
library users become more politically informed or active, improved the quality of scholarly
research, or made economic decision-making on the federal level. Nevertheless, it was the belief
of the various institutions described herein that broader access was a good thing, and it was
possible.
In some cases, as with MacKinney, ALA’s efforts inspired librarians to act and create a
vision as to how federal funding could be put to work in their libraries. ALA’s federal funding
proposals also rankled some librarians who found the idea suspect at best and reprehensible at
worst. While ALA had previously been engaged in some policy work prior to the 1930s, and
libraries themselves are fundamentally political institutions, the efforts on the policymaking
stage accelerated during the Great Depression. This more energetic foray sparked the
imaginations of some for what federal funding could do, while igniting heated debate. The role
of policy in libraries and the system of information provision is the subject of the next chapter.

CHAPTER FIVE:
POLICY AND THE SYSTEM OF INFORMATION PROVISION

Introduction
Information policy is the third and final site of transformation considered in this study.
As this chapter will show, information policy efforts intensified significantly in the 1930s. This
expansion is particularly evident in the activities of the federal government and the American
Library Association (ALA). For one of my primary research findings is that during the 1930s,
policymakers made financial support for libraries a top priority in their wider modernization of
the system of information provision. Libraries and librarians therefore took a central place in the
New Deal’s modernizing overhaul and expansion of the system of government and public
information provision—serving both internal/administrative and external/societal functions—in
technology, access, and policy.
Evidence suggests that the Roosevelt administration prioritized information provision by
creating and enhancing policies for the generation, collection, preservation, and dissemination of
information. Demonstrably affected were the sorts of information the federal government
collected and used, particularly in respect to the economic crisis. ALA’s policy efforts in the
1930s have been described and documented to some extent, most thoroughly by Kathleen Molz,
but she does not emphasize the significance of the Great Depression.1 The 1930s were, however,
a watershed decade in ALA’s history. The organization’s rising involvement with information
policy took hold alongside the profession's embrace of social science research at the
organizational and educational levels. The University of Chicago's Graduate Library School

(GLS) produced several reports throughout the 1930s in support of federal and state aid for
libraries. At the height of the Depression, ALA was able to rally considerable support using data
generated from these studies, frequently invoking the statistic that 40 million Americans were
without access to library services. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) library projects
then served as demonstration sites for what expanded access might look like and how valuable it
could be. This momentum for library expansion, amplified during the Depression, continued into
the 1940s and 50s. The Public Library Inquiry, still the most exhaustive study of the public
library in the United States, was published in 1950, but ALA Executive Secretary Carl Milam
and grant makers at the Carnegie Corporation had begun discussing the possibility of such a
study in the 1930s. Finally, it is worth reiterating the growth in librarian positions in the 1930s as
described in the first chapter. Michael Denning notes that librarians formed one of two
occupational categories that almost quadrupled between 1920 and 1950 (the other was college
professors).2 In addition, the government spend upwards of $100 million in support of library
services under the WPA.3
I have already tried to correct the view, exemplified by Michael Harris, that the 1930s
was a rather dull decade in library history save for the profession's embrace of intellectual
freedom.4 This was no mean feat in itself, however, and the ascendance of intellectual freedom
as a central tenet of librarianship has rightly been the focus of studies by library history scholars

including Evelyn Geller, Christine Jenkins, Joyce Latham, and Rosalee McReynolds.5 The
assertion of intellectual freedom policies was a major shift in the profession during the 1930s.
However, the 1930s were a watershed in the history of librarianship more generally. In an article
on Singapore's library development, Brendan Luyt quotes a contemporary mentioning as if it
were common knowledge that “the very great contributions to all fields of librarianship which
emerged in the United States of America in the 1930s and which have since developed to such a
peak that American librarianship and American library training have led the world ever since in
virtually every field,” (emphasis mine).6 In a different article, Luyt charges that prior histories on
libraries and the Depression focus on either “individual librarians” or “how the federal
government came to the rescue” at the expense of focusing on “the library as a social institution
constituted by a set of economic, political and cultural relationships in wider society;
relationships that during the turbulent years of the Depression were under considerable need of
revision or repair.”7
In this chapter, I want to look at the ways in which information policy was newly visible
and effectual in the 1930s. Attention to policy is evident in the government initiatives and ALA
activity; thus I focus on materials from the National Archives and ALA Archives. I will gesture
at the wider system of information provision by briefly looking at some of the ways in which the
federal government prioritized the collection, preservation, and dissemination of information.

Most of the chapter is devoted to how librarians and the American Library Association engaged
in policymaking. The dedicated policy efforts of librarians in the 1930s shows how librarians and
ALA were a central part of the transformation of the system of information provision.
All these signs of libraries’ growing importance gave prominence to information policy.
Let us consider what is meant by “information policy” and its role prior to the 1930s.
Information policy refers to the laws, rules, and procedures that govern information provision:
“creation, processing, flows, and use.”8 The federal government had prioritized information
provision well before Roosevelt took office. To enumerate all of the ways that the federal
government did so would be beyond any one scholar, as entire books and dissertations have been
written about numerous single agencies. The previous chapter discussed government information
policy in the context of access, looking at the Post Office and the Department of Agriculture. In
the 1930s the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics also enlarged and
expanded the range of public information collected, analyzed, and disseminated in service of
federal decision-making in response to economic crisis. Although these are but two agencies,
some discussion of them will gesture at the wide range of what falls under the system of
government information provision.

Government Information and Policy
The Census
By the start of the 1930s, numerous government agencies relied on the collection,
management, and use of information. I will focus here on the Bureau of the Census and the
Bureau of Labor Statistics because they are particularly illustrative of the breadth of changes that
government agencies underwent during this time.
The Bureau of the Census is an important example of the nexus between information
management and government policy. The first census was taken in 1790 and has been conducted
every ten years hence. The census is such an established feature of everyday life that the work
and intention that are required to perform it are often invisible. It is perhaps for this reason that,
according to Margo J. Anderson “Census data are taken for granted. They seem to most of us
given, obvious, uncontroversial—part of the background information we all absorb in our
everyday lives.”9 Census data is “some of the most reliable information the nation has.”10 Yet the
collection, analysis, and management of census data is not accidental or incidental, but policydriven. Federal statistical analysis is a long-standing feature of the federal government. Census
data is used for apportioning funds and Electoral College votes. It is the primary source of
demographic information about the United States population.
The perceived lack of action on the part of the Hoover administration to combat the
Depression was reflected in its indifference to census policy. The 1930 census could have been
revised in some way to collect data that would yield information to help understand and alleviate
the economic downturn. On the one hand, Hoover dismissed concerns about unemployment in
the early days of the Depression and “cautioned the country that statements about the severity of

163

unemployment were not based on solid data.” With the 1930 census scheduled to be taken April
1, just five months after the stock market crash, it could have been tweaked to better gauge
information about the economy and unemployment. Anderson writes that “the public naturally
looked to the responses to the inquiries on the 1930 census to clarify the unemployment
situation...Unfortunately, despite Hoover's statement of 1930, the decennial census was not
planned to address such concerns.”11 Thus it appears that the 1930s census was a missed
opportunity. The Hoover Administration’s unconcern, however, “began a controversy about the
collection and reporting of unemployment and other population data that raged for the next ten
years. In the process, the Census Bureau went through an institutional restructuring that
transformed it into an agency to serve Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.”12 What did this
transformation of policy and practice entail? Anderson writes: “By the early 1940s, then, the
Census Bureau had achieved most of the goals set forth in the early days of the Roosevelt
administration for the nation's population statistics. Its personnel had changed, and the Statistical
Research Division of the bureau stood at the cutting edge of probability sampling and survey
research. Broad new initiatives had been made in the decennial census.”13 In summary, like so
much of the system of information provision in the 1930s, “The Census Bureau and its programs
were restructured to meet the new realities.”14
The 1940 Census, tellingly, introduced more elaborate and detailed questions about
employment status. Questions about employment were added to include those employed through
emergency relief programs. Questions for recipients of emergency relief employment were asked
if they had worked with the WPA, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the National Youth

Administration, or some other relief agency. A new question was added about income. Questions
also reflected the upheaval of the 1930s by asking about people living in camps and other
temporary dwellings. Census questions attempted to assess internal migration by asking where
the subject lived on April 1, 1935, and whether that had changed by 1940.15
The 1940 census was the first decennial census to employ statistical sampling methods.
In addition to the regular forms, a smaller segment of the population (the sample) was asked to
answer additional questions. This was done in 1937 and applied to unemployment data. After the
limited use of statistical sampling in 1937, it was broadly used for the first time in the 1940
decennial census.16 The incorporation of statistical sampling methods in the 1930s is further
evidence that the information policy of the crisis decade widened.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) existed prior to the Great Depression (indicative of
a previous acknowledgement of the importance of economic information), but its activities were
transformed in the 1930s—expanded in size and scope. After July 1933, when Isador Lubin
became the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, the BLS underwent a transformation, with
Goldberg and Moye writing that “The Bureau expanded greatly during his tenure, first to meet
the needs of the New Deal agencies set up to deal with the emergency and then to provide the
information needed for guiding the economy during the war years.”17

Lubin’s philosophy on the relationship between government and economic life was
consistent with that of many of his contemporaries, in that he believed that a healthier economy
required increased government involvement and oversight. Lubin also believed that one of the
key causal factors of the Great Depression was economic inequality which resulted in lack of
consumption. A policy of increasing the government’s role in economic life would help ensure
income was distributed more equally, resulting in more purchasing power for a greater number
of people. Lubin further believed that information was a key component of this policy
reorientation, indeed that “more and better information on employment and unemployment was
of vital importance.”18 He and Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins were eager to expand the
statistical work of the Department of Labor.
Under Lubin’s leadership during the 1930s, the BLS made several improvements and
adjustments to its information work, including moving beyond employment statistics. The
Bureau expanded the national cost-of-living index to adjust for food prices and population, while
improved analysis yielded more detailed and specific information about wholesale commodity
prices. The Bureau also began producing its monthly series on average hourly wages and average
weekly hours in 1932, and separate data specific to women was collected beginning in 1937.
Overall, as Goldberg and Moye attest, “The Bureau's employment statistics were of crucial
importance in assessing the extent of the industrial recovery from the Great Depression and,
later, in monitoring the defense and war programs.”19 The Bureau’s work thus was key for
recovering from economic crisis and had lasting impact beyond the 1930s. More importantly, the

166

Bureau’s many improvements were part of a larger policy of attempting to expand and improve
information management in service of public life.20
The Great Depression made it clear how badly the information system needed
reorganization, not only in government statistics but in science and research across the board. As
Dupree argues “The Roosevelt Administration, like nearly all its predecessors, developed no
over-all policy for or against science. The essentials of the New Deal rested on other bases than
research and its results.” Burton Adkinson made a similar observation in Two Centuries of
Federal Information, writing that “For the most part, federal agencies and departments
established sci-tech information services to serve specific programs” and that “no attempt was
made to coordinate these until after World War II.”21 At the same time, Dupree acknowledges
that “on a pragmatic level, the government in the New Deal years threw off the blight of the
depression and raised the scientific establishment to unprecedented opulence. The more
consistent inclusion of the social sciences added a new dimension to the government’s research
effort, while the coupling of science with planning increased its effectiveness.” Dupree added
that “the concept of research as a national resource served well in the crisis. The techniques such
as the use of contracts for joining federal and nonfederal research were valuable in setting up an
emergency organization.”22
The New Deal and its constellation of programs necessitated policies to generate new
kinds of government information. Programs such as the Historical Records Survey also spurred
the inventorying of local, state, and federal records. These New Deal initiatives served to

simultaneously demonstrate the new expansion of records generated by government activity and
the previous neglect of such records. The Social Security Administration (SSA), for example,
required the generation and management of more kinds of information about the population.
Existing records were sometimes available, but they were disorganized. The creation of the SSA
urged the creation of an information life cycle data chain of reporting between the local and the
national levels.23

Central Statistical Board
Unnamed as such, information provision and its various interdependent components were
actually seen as vital to economic recovery and the realization of democratic participation. The
government required accurate and timely information about the population and the economy in
order to provide the most appropriate policy response. When creating relief agencies, the
government required those agencies to regularly collect information and generate analytical
reports about their activities. This helps counter the arguments made by some that relief agencies
were a “boondoggle,” or a hastily made band aid with no accountability or purpose.
The New Deal typically attempted to formulate and study the problems at hand to design
relief responses, and to create the infrastructure needed for evaluation. The Letter of Transmittal
from the Central Statistical Board illustrates the larger practice. The Central Statistical Board
was charged with coordinating all federal statistical services. In this first annual report submitted
on April 15, 1935, the director described the origins of the Central Statistical Board: “this Board
was established by Executive order to plan and promote the improvement, coordination, and

Unemployment Insurance, and the Minimum Wage (New York: Anchor Books, 2010).

168

economical operation of the statistical services pertinent to the recovery program.”24 He goes on
to acknowledge the precedent in such information gathering activity at the federal level:
“As early as 1908 an interdepartmental committee was established to investigate the
problem. During the war an effective coordinating agency was established, but it was
subsequently allowed to lapse. The coming of the depression made the need for a
statistical coordinating agency far more urgent than it had previously been. The
formulation and administration of policies directed toward economic recovery and the
stabilization of revived business activity brought demands for more extensive and for
better organized statistical data and at the same time for a more economical conduct of
statistical work. The number of Federal agencies engaged extensively in statistical work
was already large in 1929; that number has since been materially increased. The Federal
Statistics Board, established in 1931 with somewhat limited powers and without a staff,
was inadequately equipped to cope with the problem, and in August 1933 it was
replaced by the Central Statistical Board, five members of the old Board becoming
members of the new Board. During the year and a half since its establishment the
Central Statistical Board has been able to record continuing and substantial
accomplishments in the coordination, improvement, and economical operation of the
statistical services.”25
The Central Statistical Board and other informational projects, including library projects,
developed during emergency relief were considered white-collar jobs. I turn now to the WPA
Library Services Division.

WPA Library Services Division
How did policy function or how was it operationalized in a practical way? One important
instance may be found in the information projects and services of the WPA. The WPA and its
multitude of projects were subject to rigorous documentation procedures, all of which generated
a voluminous paper trail (and now a rich historical record). Recordkeeping is one of the core
features of information policy. Government agencies are required to document, maintain, and

Park, MD, 1.

distribute records describing transactions within and between agencies. The Library Services
Division shows what these recordkeeping practices looked like. At the highest level of that
division, director Edward Chapman was required to write and submit reports on the visits he
regularly made to state library projects. The library services division was part of Women’s and
Professional Projects (later the Professional and Service Division), so he submitted these reports
to the head of that project (Ellen Woodward for most of its existence). The head of Women’s and
Professional Projects would generate reports on all of its projects, including the Library Services
Division, based on the reports submitted by division heads, and submit that cumulative report to
the head of the WPA, which for most of the 1930s was Harry Hopkins.
This recordkeeping also holds true with regard to permanent federal bureaus and agencies
of the 1930s, both the previously existing and the newly established. But even the phrase
“generating reports” only makes the vaguest of statements and does not get at the specifics of
this recordkeeping. Let us return to the Library Services Division for further insight into this
process. Edward Chapman, as previously mentioned, made regular visits to states to advise and
assess state library projects, and wrote reports for all of these visits and field trips. Chapman
also, as a matter of course, submitted monthly reports of his division’s activities. This cumulative
report would include but was not limited to many state library project visits. Chapman also made
visits to city projects, as evidenced by reports of trips to Baltimore or Indianapolis. It seems more
common for Chapman to have made generalized state reports when visiting places with few to
no urban centers. Chapman as director also oversaw the generation and distribution of general
guidelines and manuals for WPA library projects. Statewide or regional projects were
responsible for generating guidelines and manuals specific to their projects, e.g. Robert Binkley
and the newspaper indexing projects. At Chapman’s level, the kinds of manual and guidelines he

170

was responsible for were meant to clarify the state-federal relationship, as well as the
responsibilities and obligations of both, including expectations and requirements for financial
contributions. Statewide projects were required to provide 25% of costs.
Women’s projects started as a way to provide dedicated relief work for women. When
men and women were competing for relief jobs, men (and particularly white men) were more
likely to find employment. Women were discriminated against because they were seen as being
less needy than a man looking for work. Ellen Woodward wrote to Carleton Joeckel in March,
1935 about women’s projects being accomplished through the Federal Emergency Relief
Administration (FERA).26 Joeckel replied five days later, thanking Woodward for her efforts and
following up with a query - could ALA count on Woodward to be an ally in advocating for a
library relief program? “Surely” Joeckel implores “it is one of the most effective ways in which
to secure employment of women.”27
Emergency relief helped libraries in its many forms. Library services were expanded
through the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), the Civil Works Administration
(CWA), the Public Works Administration (PWA), and the WPA. ALA was keen to support this
and encourage libraries to be part of emergency relief. A feature in a March 1934 issue of
Library Journal profiled more than twenty libraries that had benefited from civil works support,
including libraries in Boston, Brooklyn, and Chicago.28 These projects employed people with a
variety of skills, such as clerical, artistic, building, and professional. That so many projects were
underway to go to press in March of 1934 shows how quickly libraries seized the chance for

emergency relief. One of the most common program assessments shared was that emergency
relief not only allowed libraries to continue providing their usual services but also to embark on
projects they otherwise would have been unable to. Another article in a 1934 issue of Library
Journal described how PWA and CWA funds built five new libraries in Nebraska. “The
depression has been hard on libraries,” wrote librarian Sibyl Jarrett,” both in increased demands
for their services and in restricted resources, yet the depression has borne fruit…”29
ALA threw its support behind emergency relief from the start and added weight to the
policy of providing new—though modest—federal funding for libraries. In October 1933
Council approved a resolution endorsing “work relief projects for unemployed librarians in
connection with state and community adult education and leisure time programs for the
unemployed.”30 The resolution explicitly called on the Library Extension Board to “take
immediate steps to further such a program; and request prompt action on the part of the state and
local library and educational agencies to cooperate…”31
ALA was in touch with other library programs besides those under the Library Services
Division, as not all WPA libraries were administered under the Library Services Division. For
example, the CCC camps’ library services fell under the “Library Advisory Service for CCC
Camps,” and the CCC itself came under the US Army. ALA was in contact with CCC camps
about their library services. A letter from Jed Taylor of the CCC Camps’ Library Advisory
Service suggests ALA surveyed and reported on all types of WPA library services.32 As Harmon
Chamberlain described in a 1938 article for Library Journal, when the Library Services Division

of the Office of Education was first established, one of its first tasks was surveying the library
services in 24 camps located throughout six eastern states.33 The survey revealed that camps
were served by three types of collections: permanent, traveling, and donated. An issue identified
in the survey and discussed in letters with Joeckel was the lack of trained librarians at every
camp. It was not enough to have a collection, adequate library service also meant having trained,
permanent, and reliable library personnel.
Library services, it was argued, were needed in order to navigate the increasing
complexity of modern life. In a July 1937 letter from Mary Rothrock to Carleton Joeckel, she
writes that “such federal legislation as the AAA and the Social Security Act, as well as the
implications involved in the rural electrification and the national planning movements, clearly
point to the need for better machinery for developing informed and alert public opinion than may
have seemed necessary when the national government was more remote from our daily lives.”34
The extent to which library extension actually developed informed and alert public opinion is
unclear, nevertheless it was a stated aim of Rothrock and many others in ALA leadership.
Much as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) brought electrification to rural areas and
electric utilities, the policy of expanding access to library services was predicated on viewing
libraries as a social utility. A utility in this sense is a resource that has been harnessed and
organized for distribution because it is seen as providing indispensable benefit. Rothrock urged
Joeckel to put greater emphasis on the TVA and its implications for federal library
administration. She wrote “I am inclined to think that the corporate nature of the TVA, its
objectives, and its techniques of cooperation with other agencies--local, state, and national--call

for an analysis of its library activities from the viewpoint of their possible significance in later
developments of nation-wide library service.”35
For understanding the size and scope of federal emergency relief library projects, there
remains no better source than Edward Stanford’s Library Extension Under the WPA published in
1944 by the University of Chicago Press.36 Subtitled An Appraisal of an Experiment in Federal
Aid, Stanford’s exhaustive study can be read as a demonstration of how extensive library access
could be made under the aegis of federal support. Absent from Edward Stanford’s otherwise
comprehensive study of WPA library projects, however, is an acknowledgement of the role of
the American Library Association. The success and spread of library extension via the WPA
library projects was undeniably assisted by the support and involvement of ALA leadership and
active members. In describing the value of library projects before 1935, Stanford writes “neither
relief authorities nor librarians were ready with carefully thought out programs when federal
relief was begun on a nation-wide scale in 1935.”37 It is true that librarians and the ALA did not
have an immediate plan. At the same time, given the uniqueness of such a massive program of
federal emergency relief, it is doubtful that any organization was prepared for such a project. In
that sense, with its planning in the early 1930s, not to mention its emphasis on extension work in
the previous decade, ALA was relatively well-positioned in 1935 to make use of federal relief
funds.
Let us look at the numbers. Stanford writes that all told, the amount spent on library
projects under the WPA was significant: “From its establishment, in 1935, the WPA alone spent
nearly $100,000,000 of federal funds on library service projects, or almost double the amount

174

usually spent in support of public libraries throughout the entire United States each year.”38 This
perhaps helps to account for the dramatic growth in librarian jobs as described by Michael
Denning.39 Since Stanford only discusses WPA funding of public libraries, this does not include
funds made available for public libraries that were not emergency relief, such as through state
and regional appropriations, nor does it include funding for other types of libraries such as
academic or school.
At the same time, Stanford acknowledges that there are several ways to quantify the
scope of WPA library projects: “Expenditures on library projects are but one measure of the
extent of the library assistance rendered by the WPA. Statistics on employment and on selected
aspects of project achievement also help to describe the scope of the WPA’s library program.
Library project employment fluctuated considerably from month to month each year. In 1938,
when the WPA program was at its peak, library projects were providing full-time work for over
38,000 persons, or more than the number normally employed as ‘librarians and library assistants’
throughout the entire nation.”40 Stanford uses the census data from 1930, which showed 31,478
people employed as librarians and library assistants.
The following excerpt was used in the fourth chapter, but bears repeating here. By 1941,
“WPA project workers had repaired and put back into circulation 98,622,000 volumes belonging
to school or public libraries. By the end of 1940 they had typed almost 40,000,000 book catalog
cards. By the end of 1939 they had transcribed almost 4,000,000 pages for Braille books for the
blind.” Also by 1941

The WPA had purchased over 260,000 new books for use in library service
demonstrations, and had assisted approximately 150 different counties in obtaining
bookmobiles for extending library service to rural areas. During July, August, and
September, 1941, over 1,700 or more than half of all the counties in the United States, were
receiving some library assistance from the WPA... These WPA-operated library services
had a combined book stock of nearly 8,000,000 volumes, and they were serving an
estimated total population of almost 14,000,000 persons… Thus, in summary, the most
important single fact concerning WPA assistance to libraries is its magnitude.41
State library agencies played a crucial rule in the success of WPA library projects,
specifically “the existence of a strong and active state library agency, ready to plan and supervise
a sound library assistance program.” This combined with “a popular and articulate citizen
interest in the state-wide extension of tax-supported public library service” had a measurable
impact on the success of library extension, with Stanford concluding that “states in which these
factors were present naturally tended to benefit proportionally more from the program than
others lacking in active, organized professional and lay library leadership.”42 A strong state
agency and popular support were the key factors in the success of a library extension program.
Another way of putting this is that successful library extension necessitated a strong policy base political infrastructure (state agency) and the consent of the electorate (popular support). And, it
must be added, powerful library advocacy groups such as the American Library Association. The
1930s and the introduction of federal relief in libraries made policy work crucial and central in a
way it never had before.
Similarly, in the report “WPA and Rural Libraries,” Edward Chapman addresses library
extension in South Carolina and attributes its success in part to public support and enthusiasm,
writing “The strongest supporters in the popular movement were, and are, the organizations of
farm women. Because of the insistence of rural women and the citizens’ committees, many

41

county appropriating bodies are beginning to give partial support from local tax sources to the
WPA organized county libraries. The activity of the county citizen library committees, the
endorsement and aid of various groups, and the ever expanding demand of new readers, insure
the continuance of this library service aided by WPA.”43 Also writing about South Carolina and
the WPA, Robert Gorman said that although library conditions were “daunting” prior to 1935,
the state had steadily taken actions to improve library services in the run-up to the Depression.
These actions, including the creation of regional library systems, had positioned South Carolina
libraries to become greatly improved, with the WPA being the “galvanizing force that could
provide funds and central leadership.”44

American Library Association and Policy
Library expansion falls under policy in the 1930s for two main reasons, one broad and the
other specific to the decade. The first reason is that as public institutions, the establishment or
expansion of a library makes it a policy issue. Public libraries, academic libraries in public
colleges and universities, and special libraries operate on public funds and are accountable to the
communities they serve and rely on their support. In order for a library to grow, it must have the
institutional support of the constituency it serves. The second reason, specific to the decade, is
that in the 1930s the American Library Association (ALA) focused its sights on establishing a
federal library agency that would ensure permanent funding for libraries.

when the organization sought legal changes at federal and state levels that would provide
ongoing financial support for libraries. These efforts arguably laid foundations for the later
passage of the Library Services Act of 1956. Of course, ALA did not accomplish this on its own.
In addition to lobbying at the federal level, ALA personnel worked strategically alongside local
librarians, politicians, and community groups to bolster the cause. Postwar changes were
prepared during the 1930s.
One of the most prominent examples of how ALA sought to influence policy for libraries
was in the campaign for Librarian of Congress. When Herbert Putnam was forced to retire in
1939, he had held the position for forty years. Seeing an opportunity to have a supporter of
federal library funding appointed, ALA tried to convince President Roosevelt to select ALA
Executive Secretary Carl Milam. Although unsuccessful—Roosevelt appointed Archibald
MacLeish instead—the campaign nevertheless demonstrates ALA's interest in influencing
policymaking, particularly at the federal level.45

State Aid
The push for increased allocations for libraries from state governments was a major thrust
of ALA’s policymaking efforts in the 1930s. State library aid was considered necessary
complement to federal aid. A 1936 report by ALA’s Public Library Division entitled “State
Grants to Libraries and in Related Fields” provides an overview of the evolution of state aid to
American libraries of different types. The report begins by pointing out that state aid for public

libraries was not entirely without precedent, as states began making small grants for public
libraries beginning in the 1890s. The provision of these grants was contingent upon certain
requirements, similar to the requirements on which Carnegie library money was provided. There
had to be proven a means for continuing local financial support, and there had to be
demonstrated need. In Maryland, for example, libraries receiving $1,000 or less per year were
eligible to apply for annual grants of an admittedly paltry $20-$30. As of 1929, eighteen states
provided similar grants for school libraries.46
The report goes on to describe efforts for provision of state aid for “large unit libraries,”
meaning in this instance county or regional libraries. That “bills calling for generous state grants
for county libraries were introduced in 1928, 1929 and 1930 in Louisiana, New York and
Virginia” suggests that library extension efforts at the centralized level of ALA during the 1920s
were also active at state levels.47 Pennsylvania succeeded in 1931 in securing “an appropriation
of $20,000 to encourage the establishment of county libraries.” This amount was reduced to
$17,000 per year from 1933-35, but nevertheless showed a successful effort in the fight for state
appropriations. In the spirit of the Cultural Front, in paying tribute both to what was imagined as
well as what was accomplished, the same report describes efforts to secure state appropriations
that although unsuccessful, were still important. Looking at failures served a couple of purposes.
One, they could be instructive. Library advocates could consider what worked and what did not,
and use this analysis when developing future campaigns for state funding. Two, they could be
encouraging for other campaigns. Even when such campaigns failed, the very example made by
states with focused attempts to legislate state aid could be inspirational.

In the interest of providing practical guidance in advocating for state funding, the ALA
publication includes examples of bills, letters, and applications used by advocates in states that
had organized around state aid for libraries. These examples provided possible templates for
other libraries to use in drafting language for legislation, for soliciting support from librarians
and their other allies, and imagining how such state aid could be distributed. Importantly, the
sample literature included sample texts used in Ohio, where campaigns for state aid to libraries
had been resoundingly successful. This helped librarians think about the follow-through of a
successful campaign - what would come next.
Information about state aid to public schools was also furnished, presumably so that
library advocates could think about the piece of the pie that could or should be allocated to the
library in the school. But the information about allocation to public schools makes no specific
mention of libraries. So perhaps the information about state aid to public schools is provided as
additional argument or justification for why states should provide aid to libraries. The logic
being that if states provide, as a matter of course, aid for public schools, because education is the
responsibility of the state, and libraries provide an educational function, therefore it is natural
and logical for states to provide aid to libraries. In the continental United States the average
contribution from the state in grant money to public schools in 1933-34 amounted to 23.4 percent
of the school’s budget. Delaware outpaced all other states in terms of state aid to public schools,
with 92.9 percent of total school expenditures funded by the state. In second place at 64.9
percent is North Carolina. The average state contribution was in the 20-30 percent range, and the
states of Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming brought up the rear with less than 1 percent of total
school expenditures coming from state aid.

Robert Scott Kramp called Judson Jennings “the foremost proponent of state aid”
amongst directors of the country’s largest libraries in the 1930s.48 As director of the Seattle
Public Library, Jennings was one of the most prominent library leaders of the time. He wrote that
“in its legislation for libraries the state should not fail to establish beyond question the principle
that the library is an educational concern of the state.”49 Jennings argued that libraries, like
schools, were a public good that required government subsidization: “the federal government and
the state government are both interested in education, and since for this reason they render
financial assistance to the schools, they should for the same reason render financial assistance to
libraries.”50 The traditional means of funding libraries were insufficient, and equal service could
not be provided if local tax base was the sole means of providing library service.
Was such an argument—that where local resources were scant the state should
supplement funds—unprecedented in the system of information provision? As Jennings argued,
certainly not. Public schools were one example. Compulsory education signified that the state
government had to contribute funding, because if building a school drew solely on local tax
funding, then schools would not get built. But that was against the law, so education was
considered a public good. Another precedent was the postal system. The federal government
provided consistent and often large subsidies for the development of postal infrastructure in
order to make long distance communication more accessible. In places where there was not a
local urban infrastructure in place to support the building of post offices, the federal government
took steps to bring postal services to the people.

One of the more illustrative and useful examples for the purposes of ALA’s library
extension campaign of the 1930s was the development of Rural Free Delivery at the turn of the
twentieth century. While postal services were ubiquitous in urban areas, rural populations more
often than not had residences located miles away from the nearest post office. Access to the post
office was a burden for these people. Without intervention, they would continue to suffer from
lack of service. Rural Free Delivery was organized around the principle that geographic location
should not mean unequal service, that rural residents should enjoy access closer to the level of
city dwellers. Providing mailboxes and mailing addresses for rural residents, however, required
massive government intervention. After concerted struggles to achieve this result, federal support
was won. The new norm became because postal services were a public good, geography should
not prevent unequal service.51
Using state and federal funding for schools and postal services—for education and
communication—as examples, libraries had precedent to use in arguing for a policy of
government aid. Government funds has historically been used to support the expansion of access
to the system of information provision, of which libraries are a part.

State Aid in the Midwestern United States
Many state library agencies were successful in garnering state financial support in the
midst of the Great Depression. This was especially true of Midwestern states, which Joeckel
observed were likewise disproportionately targets of federal aid.52 James Foutts of the Ohio State
Library wrote about 1935 that “only one dissenting vote was cast when the Ohio legislature

passed the law appropriating $100,000 for State Aid to libraries on the fifteenth of last May.”53
State aid was specifically allocated for library extension to rural and underserved populations in
Ohio. How did they come up with this figure and how did they convince the state legislature to
appropriate these funds for library extension in the midst of the Great Depression? First, a
statewide survey was undertaken to assess the character of library access in Ohio, and ascertain
its strengths and weaknesses. Conducted in 1934, the survey assessed library services up until
1933. In January 1935, a follow-up survey was administered to see if any noticeable change had
taken place in 1934. Survey results mirrored the experience of the rest of the country: resources
and support kept diminishing, while circulation kept going up. The survey revealed that nearly
500,000 Ohioans in twenty counties were without libraries. However, the 500,000 was just the
beginning. It was determined that an additional 1.5 million people had only nominal library
service, meaning they lived in an area with library service, but none that was close by, requiring
them to travel several miles to visit the nearest library. Therefore, the survey underlined,
“although there were only half a million people in the state without nominal library service, there
were approximately two million people without actual service.” The State Library presented its
case to the Ohio Library Planning Board and was aided by Julia Wright Merrill of the ALA,
herself one of the most active ALA staff in the 1930s, alongside Carl Milam, in pushing for
library extension and federal aid for libraries.
While a bill for libraries went to Ohio’s State Assembly, the State Library wasted no time
enlisting political support from allies, contacting “every organization in the state known to be
friendly to libraries.” The State Assembly received hundreds of letters urging them to approve
the bill for increased library appropriations. After the bill was signed by the Governor, the State

53

Library joined forces with the Ohio Library Association to create committees responsible for
drafting policies for how to administer the funds. Libraries were then invited to submit
applications for state appropriations, and the State Library worked with libraries individually to
help them as needed and learn about specific issues. They also appointed a State Organizer to
conduct additional surveys and administer funds accordingly. Paul Noon was optimistic for a
$500,000 appropriation in 1937.54
And what of it—was Ohio successful in this regard? State Librarian Paul Noon affirmed
the continued support poetically, writing in 1937 “While rivers and streams were swelling the
Ohio River to unprecedented flood stages during January, another more quiet flood in Ohio went
unnoticed. This second flood was a constant stream of letters pouring into the legislature--letters
from members of the Ohio Library Association, the Ohio Library Trustees Association, The
Citizens Library Committee of Ohio, the Ohio Federation of Women’s Clubs, the Ohio Congress
of Parents and Teachers, the American Legion Auxiliary of Ohio, the Ohio Branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Ohio Federation of Business
and Professional Women’s Clubs, the Ohio League of Women’s Voters, the Ohio Conference for
Social Work Among Negroes, the Ohio Probation Association, the Ohio Public Health
Association, the Ohio State Grange, and the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. These letters urged
support for House Bill Number 14, appropriating $200,000 to aid the public libraries of the
state.”55
This recounting is striking in part for in part how it emphasizes the cooperative aspect
and the coalition-based organizing campaigns libraries and library organizations were doing in
the 1930s. This also demonstrates the importance of cooperation with diverse interest groups—

clearly Ohio sought to work with and enlist the support of African Americans, women, and rural
populations together to expand library service. Paul Noon goes on to describe how $150,000 was
approved, and rightfully so, for “the library program of the state would suffer a terrific blow, if it
were deprived of these funds. Less than two years ago there were nine libraries in the State
which were giving county extension service. Today, libraries in thirty-eight counties are
extending book service to all residents of those counties by establishing branches, deposit
stations, and book truck service.”56
Ohio’s existing library infrastructure paved the way for WPA library projects. This
infrastructure gave WPA workers something to plug into without having to create a state network
from scratch. Ohio benefited from WPA library projects as well. WPA workers helped expand
library services as mandated by the changes made in Ohio state law in the 1930s. Edward
Chapman wrote in 1938 that “Since public libraries in Ohio are obliged to give county library
service, WPA is supplying the additional personnel to man the new units needed for such a
service. Because of the increased demands for reading created by an enhanced county library
service aided by WPA workers, the appropriation for state library support in one county jumped
from $3,000 to $13,000 per year.”57
Michigan was another state that pushed for state appropriations for libraries. Beginning in
1932, the nadir of the Depression, the Michigan Library Association and its Planning Committee
began actively campaigning for professional leadership in the State Library, increases in state
aid, and increased cooperation between libraries and other Michigan organizations. Here
Michigan provides a useful example of the different ways state libraries may be organized.

185

Although a State Library existed, in the 1930s Michigan did not have a State Librarian. The
Michigan Library Association felt that in order to fully and adequately advocate for state aid for
all Michigan libraries, they needed professional library leadership in the State Library itself.
These efforts ultimately resulted in two laws being passed in 1937, one of which established a
State Librarian position, while the other “set up a continuing appropriation of $500,000 per year
for State Aid to public libraries, with a ten-year plan to equalize public library opportunities and
stimulate the organization of library service on a county or regional basis, where practicable.”58
Michigan library leaders encountered trouble with full implementation of the laws. Existing state
laws made it complicated to immediately establish committees and appoint a State Librarian,
while fluctuations in the economy made appropriations of the full amount impossible. The
governor vetoed full allotment, and by early 1939 the future of continued appropriations for
Michigan libraries hung in the balance. Nevertheless, proponents felt that “State Aid had the
desired effect” of stimulating “local interest and responsibility in libraries.”59
Illinois librarians embarked on campaign similar to that of Ohio’s for state aid, through
legislative action. Like Ohio in 1935, the Illinois Library Association lobbied alongside civic
organizations and with the assistance of ALA, for an appropriation of one million dollars; they
ultimately secured $600,000. In 1936 Anna May Price of the Illinois’ Library Extension Division
wrote “The influence of the appropriation on the legislature will be more or less lasting. No
matter how the personnel of the two Houses may change, there remains the record that the 59th
General Assembly appropriated $600,000 to the public libraries of the state for the purpose of
books and periodicals.”60

Missouri was another site for focused organizing around expansion of information access
and library extension in the 1930s, and where access for rural populations was a critical issue. A
1936 survey revealed that nearly 1.5 million people were without library service: nearly half the
state’s population. In an interesting contrast it was noted that, “almost 95 per cent of the rural
population receives no public library service although more than 95 per cent of the urban
population is served.”61 What helped stimulate this commitment to expansion of access in
Missouri? The sensitization and awareness-raising of the Great Depression was itself an
overarching factor, with Sarah Moloney of the Missouri Library Commission Extension Library
noting this paradox: “Our years of prosperity gave little impetus to the organization of libraries
while the depression seems to have encouraged their development.”62 Related to that was the
availability of federal funds for this purpose, and Moloney credited CWA, FERA, and WPA with
creating new libraries and library services, and she held that their success and popularity
indicated “that the need for library service is being felt and that the demand for it is being
made.”63 Like other states in the 1930s, Missouri library leadership, in this case the Missouri
Library Commission, seized the opportunity for federal funds to make specific allocations for
libraries. It was the altered federal policy that was decisive—here, as in other ways. As federal
money became available beginning in 1934, Missouri appointed a State Planning Board.
Determined to have a seat at the table, the Missouri Library Commission successfully lobbied for
the creation of a State Library Planning Committee in 1935. Meanwhile, throughout the 1930s
the Missouri Library Commission continued to identify gaps in library services and to propose
ways of closing those gaps. Moloney talked about the importance of requiring certified

librarians, expanding school library services, and even considered alternative or additional
taxation schemes for ensuring ongoing and adequate funding for Missouri libraries. So for
example, in addition to the traditional local property tax model, the Missouri Library
Commission also saw sales tax revenue as a possible funding source for libraries. Making these
changes involved amending Missouri state laws. What is also interesting about Missouri is the
emphasis on informed decision-making, which seems to have infused so much of the thinking
about libraries in the 1930s: “Needs must be known before they can be satisfied.”64

State Aid in Southern Libraries
Library advocacy was also strong in in the Southern United States. With a staunch
advocate in J.O. Modisette, it is perhaps not surprising that the Louisiana Library Commission
endorsed a $2 million plan in for statewide library improvement and extension in April 1934.65
Louisiana Library Commission Executive Secretary Essie Culver argued “If we can afford to
spend fourteen million for public education, colleges and universities, why not place two million
in library service?”66
Mississippi was another Southern state enjoying robust library advocacy. Federal aid in
the form of emergency relief brought library services to places where none had existed. James V.
Carmichael writes that “in 1933, Mississippi Library Commission Secretary Elizabeth
Robinson...organized a state-wide library project under CWA which provided 43 counties with
their first free public library service.”67 Robinson explained in 1935 that the application of

federal aid for libraries in that state was nurturing “a vision of a more democratic and universal
service.”68 In 1937 the Arkansas Legislature voted for state aid for libraries, with an
appropriation of $100,000. The appropriation allowed for library extension to the “154,449 rural
residents of Arkansas who have been without library service.”69
In addition to being involved in the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Southeastern Library
Association, and the Library Extension Board, Mary Utopia Rothrock also chaired the Tennessee
Educational Commission’s Subcommittee on Libraries. The Commission’s recommendations
included a request for an appropriation of $625,000 for libraries, based on a charge of 25 cents
per person in the state, with an anticipated increase to fifty cents per person. Another one of the
Commission’s recommendations in 1935 was to place public libraries under the Department of
Education. Anticipating criticism of such an organizational scheme, Rothrock wrote “if the
public libraries cannot demonstrate the essential importance of their peculiar contribution to
general education, they may as well be gobbled up now…”70 In retrospect, the Tennessee plan
seems a harbinger of ALA’s proposal for a library agency in the Office of Education.

Struggles for State Aid
Some librarians wished for greater state aid but had a more difficult time securing it. In
May of 1935 the president of the South Dakota Federation of Women’s Clubs, Lois Severin,
described conditions in South Dakota as being similar to that of rural areas generally, with
seventy percent of South Dakota’s rural population being without access to a public library.

The State Library Commission was cooperating with the State Planning Board to allocate
resources for libraries.71 Yet by July 1936 it seems that although many residents may have
desired library extension, the funds were not made available. South Dakota librarian and State
Library Commission member Lora Crouch wrote that her experience had convinced her that “the
population is too thin in most of the counties in this state to ever develop the best kind of library
service with purely local support.” Crouch felt that due to the state’s overall poor financial
situation, libraries were not likely to see any increased appropriations, writing that “the present
outlook for state aid is very dark and becoming rapidly darker… It seems that our only hope in
the near future is in the development of Federal Aid.”72 The positive results of state aid for
libraries were promoted as evidence of the need for permanent federal support for libraries, as
was the problem of unequal distribution. State aid had been secured in some but not all libraries
that needed it. ALA, like Lora Crouch, believed that the only way to guarantee sufficient funding
for libraries was through federal aid. This campaign to swing policy decisively toward federal
aid was introduced as the National Plan for Libraries.

National Plan for Libraries and Federal Aid
The National Plan for Libraries was a campaign initiated by the American Library
Association in 1934 to establish permanent federal funding for libraries. The campaign
dovetailed with concurrent New Deal projects that supported the creation of new libraries and
library services as well as expansion of existing programs. The National Plan for Libraries

capitalized on this support by highlighting the gap in library services for the United States
population. The genesis of the National Plan for Libraries deserves closer attention for two
reasons. First, it was ALA’s first serious mobilization for a federal library policy. Second, ALA
attempted this during the worst economic crisis seen before or since.
Two ALA endorsements, passed at conventions in 1919 and 1921 respectively, are the
earliest recorded efforts in support of federal aid for libraries. In 1919, ALA Council
unanimously endorsed support “for the creation of a Federal Department of Education, which
would have included a bureau of libraries.”73 In 1921 council members “urged members of
Congress” to create “a governmental division devoted to stimulation of library activities in the
United States.”74
Then, in 1929 the Committee on Library Extension passed a resolution in support of
federal aid for county library service.75 Kathleen Molz writes that “with the advent of the
economic depression of the 1930s, leaders of the ALA became increasingly preoccupied with the
question of federal aid to libraries” and that the efforts of the 1930s were a more forceful
outgrowth of the previous attempts to establish federal aid.76 The campaign for federal support
made gains in the 1930s, the most significant being the creation of a library agency in the Office
of Education in 1937. Although what Joeckel and others actually wanted was a national
headquarters for library affairs with its own funding and staffing and the appropriate status of a
federal agency, the formal establishment of any sort of library agency, particularly during a

depression decade, was a major victory for the American Library Association and library
supporters.

The Need for Federal Aid
The central argument for federal library aid was that the traditional funding structure of
the local tax base could not and would not ensure adequate and comprehensive library services,
especially for advancing cooperative projects and initiatives like those described herein. This
was doubly true for rural areas which had neither the funding base nor the municipal structure for
establishing and maintaining library services. Although ALA’s national plan was not just for
rural libraries, leadership repeatedly made reference to the statistic of 45 million people lacking
library services, predominantly located in rural areas. Statistical evidence became increasingly
important to ALA in the 1930s. The interest in evidence-based research in support of library
extension is reflected in the publications produced by the University of Chicago’s Graduate
Library School, such as those by Carleton Joeckel, Leon Carnovsky, and Louis Round Wilson.
What drove the National Plan for Libraries? As Molz has stated, there was the very idea
of planning itself, of using scientific approaches to inform the development of library services.
This perspective is made clear when looking at ALA committee minutes from the era. Carl
Milam distributed “Notes for a National Plan for Libraries” at a meeting of the ALA Planning
Committee and Executive Board on April 2, 1934. The National Plan was to be about more than
securing additional funding for libraries. Also encompassed was to be a reconceptualized
purpose and structure. He wrote in his notes that “to meet America’s needs there must be a new
conception of the organization, functions and activities of the agencies which contribute to
educational, social, cultural and recreational interests. It is not enough that existing agencies

192

simply be provided with additional funds. They must be expanded, coordinated and adequately
financed to provide for every person from childhood to old age the opportunity and continuous
encouragement for the fullest possible development of personal ability, and social
understanding.”77
A “national plan for libraries” was based on the idea of lifelong access to knowledge: that
a democratic citizenry required more comprehensive access to information. Milam describes in
his notes the proper role of the federal government in extending library service: that “the Office
of Education should be extended to include responsibility toward libraries comparable to that
which it now has towards schools…”78 The National Plan called for the organization of a library
agency in each state, mandating that those agencies should receive “increased appropriations”
and “more trained library personnel.”79 The document also emphasized the importance of
cooperation and coordination amongst and between libraries. This included different library
types. The national plan wished to encourage greater cooperation between, for example, a
college library, a school library, and a public library should all of those types of libraries be
located in the same community. In cooperating these libraries could share resources, thereby
promoting economic efficiency, but also extending improved library services to a greater number
of people in that community.
The National Plan also called for “a national study of the personnel needs of the library
profession with a view to determining as accurately as may be the aptitudes, traits, education and
special training needed for service in all kinds of libraries.”80 Perhaps this anticipated the

research questions that would inform the Public Library Inquiry. In any case, again it
demonstrates the importance of scholarly production of evidence-based research in order to
better advocate for libraries. This advocacy angle was foregrounded in the national plan as
“publicity” for the library. Although this was not spelled out extensively, there is the suggestion
that a library should heighten public awareness of the resources it offered by “continuing
publicity for its books and services, through newspapers, radio, moving pictures, distribution of
reading lists and reading courses, through book discussion groups, lectures and other meetings in
the library.”81 In the twenty-first century this kind of advocacy is often inappropriately called
“marketing” and libraries have been charged with not realizing its potential.82 As emphasized in
the National Plan, however, successful publicity is about more than getting people to use the
library. Statistics have shown time and again that they do.83 Library publicity is about turning
library users themselves into advocates for a policy of democratized institutional support and
access.
ALA sought input on the National Plan from library leaders throughout the country. The
Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, shared his perspective in a letter to Milam in January,
1935. Milam had asked Putnam to weigh in on whether the responsibility for library planning
should rest with the Office of Education or become an added responsibility for the Library of
Congress. Putnam felt that Education was a better fit, as the proper role of the Library of
Congress was to focus on its existing programming.84

Instances of Opposition to Federal Aid
There was some vocal opposition to the National Plan, which had echoes of broader
opposition to the expansion of the state into economic and cultural life that some disliked about
the New Deal. Versions of this opposition also appeared in some Southern libraries, where critics
feared federal aid would encroach on states’ rights.85 The publication of the National Plan in the
pages of the main library periodicals in turn inspired a critical response. Joeckel’s “Federal
Relations to Libraries,” a reprint of a statement made before Council at the Midwinter meeting of
December, 1934, appeared in the same issue of Library Journal with a skeptical letter from
librarian C. Seymour Thompson at the elite University of Pennsylvania. Titled “Do Others Share
These Views?” Thompson wondered “With millions of Americans facing starvation, and with
the federal government--and hence the American people--struggling under the tremendous
burden which the emergency has forced it to assume, how, in the name of American citizenship,
can librarians ask the government to appropriate from fifty to one hundred millions annually for
library service?”86
Instead of seeing federal aid for libraries as a necessity in the midst of economic crisis,
critics saw it as wasteful spending that would exacerbate the crisis. Thompson elaborated further
in a full-length article published in the May 1, 1935 issue of Library Journal. Thompson bluntly
stated “I maintain that it will be better for the American people to do without the desired
extension of library service than to incur the evils which will come with federal aid. If the
national government begins to pour millions into the states for library service it will expose our
libraries to inevitable political influence, far worse than any which the most unfortunate cities or

states have ever experienced.”87 Thompson also misleadingly likened federal aid to libraries as
likely to repeat the effect of quickened financial speculation of the previous decade: “Why
should we want it to be rapid, when excessive rapidity has been one of the major causes of our
present distress?”88
Some libraries and library associations passed resolutions against federal aid, and
individual librarians made their disapproval known, with numerous resolutions of opposition
read at the 1935 Annual Conference held in Denver.89 This was a struggle waged on both sides,
however. Greta Brown, the librarian of Connecticut’s New Britain Institute, wrote to Carleton B.
Joeckel in May, 1935 after the Connecticut Library Association passed a resolution stating their
opposition to federal aid for libraries. Brown had not been present at the meeting where the
resolution was passed, and believed that the CLA’s claim that a “unanimous” vote for the
resolution was dishonest. The issue of federal aid had not been thoroughly discussed before
taking the vote, she charged. She argued that Connecticut was no exception when it came to
uneven library service: “Connecticut is dotted with more or less expensive buildings, served by
untrained librarians and inadequately equipped. We certainly need better library service for most
of our communities.”90 While Connecticut did not have the same issues as more remote areas of
the United States with large swaths of rural populations, the New England state still had
underserved rural areas. A 1939 WPA press release announced the start of traveling library
services in Connecticut to serve “rural sections where libraries are inaccessible.”91

Joeckel responded to Brown’s letter at the end of May. Joeckel observed that the
registered opposition to federal aid was largely concentrated in the northeastern United States,
with its great concentration of densely populated areas; meanwhile he observed “there are no
protests from the Middle West and South and very few from the Far West, all of these being
regions in which federal aid seems almost essential to complete library service.”92 Yale librarian
C.L. Cannon had anticipated such a reaction in the northeast. He wrote Joeckel in December,
1934 that “there seems to be considerable opposition in this part of the country to Federal
interference, as it would be designated here.”93 Speaking for himself, Cannon noted that he
supported federal aid for libraries.
Writing about opposition in 1934, Louisiana Library Commissioner J.O. Modisette
seemed unintimidated, even galvanized by the opposition. He wrote: “They stimulate.
Opposition always does when properly directed. Progress results from the matching of opposing
forces.”94 Modisette agreed with Herbert Putnam that the Office of Education would make a
better fit for a federal library agency than the Library of Congress. He also referred to the Library
Extension Board meeting in Knoxville from April of 1934, and articulated his takeaway from
that meeting: “if you take advantage of every situation that seems to offer a chance to worm your
way into the federal picture, no matter how small nor how unpromising it looks, you may get
results from a quarter from which you would logically least expect… I don’t think any chance to
get into the federal picture, whether through relief set-up or otherwise, should be passed up.”95

Some dissent was not directed at the notion of federal library aid itself, but at the
organization of the proposed federal library agency. Milton Ferguson of the Brooklyn Public
Library wrote Joeckel in 1938 to voice his concern about the consequences of placing a federal
library agency in the Office of Education, because he believed such an agency needed to be
overseen by librarians. Ferguson stated “you have no reason for feeling that I am opposed to
federal aid. You can say, however, without any hesitancy that I am opposed to surrendering the
library program to the schoolmen of the country.”96

Organizing Support for Federal Library Aid
ALA leaders who advocated for federal aid worked through existing committees such as
the Library Extension Board, while the National Library Planning Committee and the Special
Committee on Federal Relations to Libraries were created in 1934 specifically to advance the
goals of the National Plan. Committee members organized sessions at conferences and published
frequently in library periodicals in order to mobilize the membership in support of federal aid.
ALA’s efforts engendered some significant results. In 1936, Congressional appropriations for
education included a provision for the establishment of a library services division within the
Office of Education, then part of the Department of the Interior. While ALA wished for a greater
sum of money, the division’s creation was seen as a major step in the right direction. Otherwise
headquartered in Chicago, the federal library appropriations for 1938 also marked the beginning
of ALA’s maintaining a Washington office. The subsequent entry of the United States into

World War Two temporarily refocused the scope of library policy, however, as library services
nationwide were diverted to the war effort.97
Joeckel and other researchers at the University of Chicago continued producing studies in
service of the National Plan. President Roosevelt had appointed the Advisory Committee on
Education in September, 1936. In a follow-up directive issued in April, 1937, Roosevelt asked
the Committee to “give more extended consideration to the whole subject of Federal relationship
to State and local conduct of education, and to prepare a report.”98 Staff specialists produced
several related reports pertaining to education, public administration, and economics. Joeckel
was invited to write one of these studies as a specialist in library science. The resulting volume,
Library Service, is an important publication in that it was a federally commissioned document on
the state of American library services. Joeckel’s study is a meticulous description of how library
services are financially sanctioned and sustained, with special attention to where library service
falls short. The study echoes findings in other publications by University of Chicago’s Graduate
Library School from that period—including Louis Round Wilson’s Geography of Reading, from
which Joeckel drew extensively - in that it ultimately argues for the necessity of federal aid for
libraries. This study became known as the Reeves Report, in reference to Advisory Committee
on Education Chair Floyd W. Reeves. The Reeves Report situated libraries in the context of
federal emergency relief of the 1930s, and declared that government assistance could be and
should be extended on a permanent basis.99
Preparing reports like Library Service required the marshalling of large amounts of data
about the full coverage or lack thereof of library services in the United States. Joeckel drew from

research previously published by Louis Round Wilson. He also drew from statistical information
provided by the Office of Education. In an August, 1937 letter, Emery Foster of the Office of
Education’s Chief of Division of Statistics reminded Joeckel that “these figures are for use in the
report to the Advisory Committee only and note for general publication. I think they will,
however, serve your purpose for the report.”100 Foster sent six pages of statistics about school
libraries with the letter. This demonstrates the level of extensive detail that went into producing
Library Service, a crucial tool in ALA’s campaign for a permanent federal library agency.
Prior to the Richmond conference in 1936, California State Librarian Mabel Gillis wrote
Joeckel to convey her “formal approval” of the report produced by the Committee on Federal
Relations.101 The New York Public Library’s Harry Lydenberg also shared feedback with
Joeckel on the proposed national plan. Lydenberg advised Joeckel to stress as clearly and
strongly as possible the importance of local support for library services—that federal aid should
be a supplement and not a replacement for local support.102
ALA members who supported federal aid were involved in committee work to draft
statements and literature. Some committee members, notably the chair, were faculty at Chicago’s
Graduate Library School. ALA federal aid proponents also sought support at conferences, such
as when Charles Compton of the St. Louis Public Library reached out to Joseph Lippincott and
his publishing company. Compton spoke with Lippincott at the ALA Annual Conference held in
Montreal in 1934. That summer Lippincott wrote that he had been in touch with fellow
publishers “who had important connections in Washington political circles” and had identified

one “who thinks he can secure for you a reasonably definite audience with Mrs. Roosevelt on the
subject of the American libraries’ budget crisis.” Lippincott thought an audience with the First
Lady would be useful, as he found her “sympathetic towards literature and education.”103 In a
follow-up letter ten days later, Lippincott emphasized his personal support and his belief that
publishers more generally were supportive of federal aid for libraries. He wrote “it is not a thing
that concerns the libraries alone. Authors, publishers, book manufacturers, paper makers and all
their employees and stock holders are concerned on one hand, while on the other, come the
general public, from learned professors down to the plainest laboring man.”104 Lippincott saw
government money for libraries as a means of boosting a segment of the economy. This broadbased support for ALA—and shades of the Cultural Front—are evident in the endorsements from
the American Association of University Women, the American Federation of Labor, the
Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.105
By the close of the 1930s, though librarianship had gained a modest institutional place in
the federal government, the National Plan for Libraries was dormant––but not dead. The
momentum that started in the 1920s and then accelerated in the depression decade made library
policy an enduring part of the American Library Association’s work. Efforts for a federal library
agency were revived in the late 1940s under the banner of “postwar library planning”. While
ALA had previously limited the publishing of designs for a national plan to mainstream library
periodicals, they published a proper monograph in 1948 entitled A National Plan for Public

Library Service: Prepared for the Committee on Postwar Planning of the American Library
Association. The intended aims and goals of ALA for the National Plan in 1948 can be found in
the first sentence, where Carl Milam wrote “This book can change the course of the Public
Library Movement in North America.”106
The aim of policy activities of the 1930s was transformation of library services in the
United States. Like other ambitious activities of the decade, some of these projects realized their
goals in whole, some in part, and some not at all. Yet as Denning reminds us, the 1930s were
important not just for what was actualized but for what was dreamt. The dream of equal library
service in the 1930s was embarked on in multiple ways—the dream of physical access being
within reach of all people, and of a right to read with restraint or censorship. These were pursued
as a matter of federal policy and internal organizational policy: library extension through
government support and intellectual freedom as a matter of professional commitment. These
were some of the most enduring and effective of contemporary library efforts in the policy
sphere. They culminated in 1956 with the passage of the Library Services Act. Although the Act
has been modified since then, it remains the model for federal library funding today under the
Library Services and Technology Act of 1996. It likewise is the basis for the Institute of Museum
and Library Services, today the primary federal funding source for libraries in the United States.
The Library Bill of Rights is arguably the defining feature and core component of what
constitutes modern American librarianship. The Library Bill of Rights is the foundation of what
became articulated as intellectual freedom and the freedom to read. The evolution of intellectual

freedom in libraries is well-documented, what must be emphasized here again is the formative
significance of the 1930s in this history.
Although federal aid was but one part of the National Plan, it was the most energetically
pursued as well as the most contested. ALA wished to see the creation of a federal library agency
with an annual appropriation of 50 to 100 million dollars. Funding would be distributed amongst
the states—fifty percent on the basis of population and the other half on the basis of need.
Proponents saw government involvement in everyday life as a reality that was only likely to
grow, and felt that libraries should work within that emerging framework. Opponents argued that
federal aid would corrupt the mission of the public library; that libraries would have to answer to
federal authorities instead of local communities. As mentioned previously, this reflected
discussions occurring simultaneously on the appropriate role of the federal government and the
necessity of federal relief. Library debates over federal aid also reflected the broader interest in
the relationship between quality of life, social change, and cultural production in the 1930s.
The National Plan proposed to make specific improvements to the existing public library
system. Leaders like Carl Milam and Carleton Joeckel believed that the current system was
useful but inadequate, and that the traditional scheme of having the local tax base fund library
services meant that some communities would never gain access to a local library. A plan for
permanent federal assistance was needed to truly equalize library services throughout the nation.
The National Plan for Libraries, and library expansion more generally, was seen as
augmenting the existing public school system. The public library system was to be part of the
necessary lifelong education required by the modern population. This is evident in how ALA
saw libraries fitting into the existing government machinery, as they wished for a library agency
to be located within the Office of Education. Global war, political unrest, and economic

203

depression led many to believe that the world was more complex than it used to be. This greater
complexity necessitated better tools for understanding and navigating effectively. Likewise,
many perceived the 1930s as a time of great potential for societal transformation, and saw the
possibility of transformation via the cultural apparatus, its expansion and reconfiguring. In the
depths of depression, people saw an opportunity to make the world anew. Library advocates
drew on and contributed to this larger momentum.
The National Plan for Libraries spelled out the need for dedicated federal funding, strong
state library organization, cooperation at local, state, and federal levels, continued research and
scholarship on libraries and personnel, and greater publicity—all with the goal of facilitating
continuing self-education, the cornerstone of an educated citizenry in a democratic society. It
emphasized the library as a responsive, active institution as opposed to a passive, static one. If
libraries were not going in such a direction before, for adherents, the 1930s made such change
urgently imperative.

Other Legislative Efforts
ALA’s campaigning made it a recognized political player with regard to library
legislation and legislation related to book distribution. Springfield, Massachusetts librarian Hiller
Wellman wrote to Carleton Joeckel, for example, asking if ALA had a stance on the TydingsMiller bill, which would have limited or discontinued publishers’ discounts for libraries.107 It
passed, though it is unclear whether or not ALA was involved in fighting it.108 In 1937
Democratic Representative Ross A. Collins of Mississippi introduced H.R. 3699, which

proposed the creation of five regionally dispersed national libraries in New York, San Francisco,
Denver, Memphis, and Chicago.109 Employing rhetoric not dissimilar to that of ALA, Collins
claimed “no matter what the immediate and future expenditures may be, the benefits to be
derived from the proposed system of national libraries are well worth it.”110 Collins was a library
advocate, and, while typical of the Southern United States with regard to rural poverty and scarce
resources for libraries, Mississippi also stood out in some positive ways, as evidenced by
Collins’ and Ellen Woodward’s roles. Collins’ heart may have been in the right place, but ALA
saw his proposal as a misstep in the quest for a federal library agency. Although J.O. Modisette
had advised in 1934 that ALA should not turn down any opportunity for federal library support,
it seems that by 1937 ALA was in a position to be more discriminating.111
With Collins’ introduction of the bill, federal library agency supporters found themselves
wondering how to proceed: would lending support to the Collins bill bolster or detract from their
ultimate goal? University of Michigan librarian and library school director William Warner
Bishop wrote Carl Milam in February 1937 to ask if Collins’ bill had ALA support; he argued
“that if anything is to be done in this matter it should be done by the A. L. A. as an
organization.”112 Harriet Long of the Oregon State Library contacted Carleton Joeckel with a
similar query about ALA’s stance on what was by then being called the Collins-McKellar
Regional Libraries Bill; Kenneth McKellar was a Democratic Senator from Tennessee and had
introduced the bill in the Senate. McKellar was also the Senator who successfully introduced the

federal library agency bill. Joeckel’s response to Long indicated a cautious approach, writing
“the position of the Federal Relations Committee is that a careful study of the needs and
objectives of a system of national regional libraries should be undertaken before the A.L.A.
commits itself definitely to the support of the Collins bill.”113 The Collins-McKellar Bill was still
stalled in 1938 when George Bowerman of the Washington, D.C. Public Library wrote Joeckel
to say Collins seemed “almost bitter” about not having an endorsement from ALA. Bowerman
pleaded “Why can’t your committee work with Mr. Collins, build upon the bill he has
introduced, and work out something that can have the endorsement of the A.L.A.?”114
In a letter to Princeton’s Lawrence Heyl in 1939, Joeckel candidly admitted that ALA
did more than just withhold an endorsement, it actively tried “to side-track the Collins’
proposal…” Joeckel explained that ALA’s Federal Relations Committee “felt that the whole plan
was premature in its exact formulation” and perhaps more importantly they “felt that this bill
would jeopardize our plans for more comprehensive legislation with respect to federal aid to
libraries.”115 It appears Joeckel and others had at least two major concerns. One was that the
proposal itself was too hastily put together and lacked the support of rigorous evidence-based
research that ALA had come to rely on. Another concern was that the creation of five large
libraries in major metropolitan areas would have the negative consequence of diverting resources
away from creating more library services for rural areas. The Collins-McKellar Bill failed to
pass.

ALA lent support to other legislative endeavors besides federal aid. In 1939 the Federal
Relations Committee endorsed H.R. 4010, which allowed for the “assembling, editing and
publishing of original documents relating to the ratification of the Constitution of the United
States and the first ten amendments.”116 ALA also was active throughout the 1930s in advocating
for book and library postal rates. This advocacy paid off when President Roosevelt signed an
Executive Order on November 1, 1938 establishing an experimental postal rate on books for 1 ½
cents per pound. Effective study of the utility of this postal rate led to an extension of the postal
rate for another two years in 1939.117 The movement to lower postal rates was argued on the
grounds that books were unfairly priced compared to other printed matter. If ad-supported
periodicals could be shipped at a special discounted rate, why not books? The lowering of book
postal rates was hailed by Milton J. Ferguson of the Brooklyn Public Library as “another forward
step by democracy.” He also placed book postal rates in the context of intellectual freedom,
stating “in America, freedom to read and to weigh the proposals, the ideas, the philosophies of
all men has not been abridged. Rather, our government, in clear terms--and in dollars and cents-puts its stamp of approval on a freer dissemination of books as a means of maintaining
government of the people.”118 Book rate is known today as Media Mail, and also allows for
cheaper shipping of print and audiovisual media.119

Conclusion
Perhaps paradoxically, as the country struggled to climb out of the Depression,
appropriations for libraries steadily increased on local, state, and national levels. Rather than
seeing the decade as poor timing, library advocates in the 1930s held that the severity of the
economic crisis made library services all the more necessary.
How successful was the campaign for federal support? Works Progress Administration
support for libraries both responded to and greatly accelerated the case for federal aid, and the
success of WPA library projects served as a promotion for the WPA. One WPA press release
from 1938 boasted that “residents of financially distressed municipalities and country folk in
isolated communities today are enjoying good books, hitherto unavailable, as a result of WPA
library projects in 45 states.”120 On the federal level, financial support for libraries increased
through the 1930s thanks to government subsidies through the WPA. Support also increased in
the form of larger state appropriations. Increased financial backing at the state and federal levels
was a chief concern of the American Library Association in the 1930s, and on both fronts they
were very successful.
Federal information policy predates the Great Depression, as demonstrated by the
existence of information-dependent government agencies. What makes the 1930s significant in
the history of information policy is the renewed and focused sense of importance it was given.
New policies were developed to govern the creation and expansion of government information
activities in response to economic crisis. Existing agencies such as the Bureau of the Census and
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and new services such as the Social Security Administration and
the Works Progress Administration, were organized with a consciousness around the importance

of information policy. Increasingly, the library central to this growing support for information
policy.
As public institutions with local standing, libraries helped to model and usher in
acceptance of the increase of government involvement in everyday life. The ALA’s National
Plan for Libraries and campaign to secure federal funding for libraries drew on the momentum of
this larger trend. This momentum was propelled by the creation and expansion of the welfare
state. ALA argued that libraries were a key part of the social welfare system. Without federal
funding, millions of people, mostly in rural areas, would lack access to library services. As
institutions vital to the sustenance of public engagement, libraries should have guaranteed federal
funding. All Americans benefited from library services, but not every community had the
traditional local tax base to support the creation and maintenance of a library. Federal funding
would ensure that library services became more widespread.
In the 1930s, many ALA members saw the Great Depression as an opportunity to
emphasize the importance of libraries in economic crisis. Librarians were in agreement that
library services could be helpful to patrons during difficult economic times. Where opinion
diverged was on the question of library extension and federal aid, and to what extent members
felt universal library service was a dream versus a practical goal. This divergence was due in part
to differences of opinion regarding the federal government and financial responsibility. More
conservative librarians balked at the idea of the federal government having any role, financial or
otherwise, in the provision of library services, even if government involvement would expand
and enhance services. They fundamentally opposed federal involvement in a local service, which
they saw as the imposition of an inappropriate top-down structure. Proponents of federal aid saw
permanent federal funding as a necessary supplement to, not replacement for, the locally-based

209

funding model. Were Americans to rely only on the traditional model, some communities would
neither be able to create nor maintain library services. This debate played out nationally, for the
first time, with the introduction of federal relief programs and the New Deal, and with ALA’s
lobbying for a federal library agency.
How do we measure the character and import of information policy in the 1930s? May
we claim that transformed policy improved the quality of life in the community, enhanced
political participation, or made the political process more democratic? Perhaps this is going too
far. On the other hand, the 1930s brought in a new or refreshed attitude toward the importance of
information in social life—in political, cultural, and economic affairs—and stimulated
acceptance that government/public support for libraries and librarians should be central to the
more encompassing system of information provision. The debate over the federal government's
role in library services was a microcosm with implications for how we think about labor,
economic crisis, relief, and social responsibility in the 1930s. Policy for enlarging and
modernizing the larger system of information provision by strengthening public support for
librarianship laid down principles and practices that would shape both this field and the larger
system of information provision for decades to follow.

CHAPTER SIX:
CONCLUSION
Summary
“What will be the effects of the New Deal on library work, library income, and the
relation of libraries to government?” asked Carl Milam in 1933. “Are libraries going back to
their former status or on to something new? Will the powers and duties of governmental agencies
continue to increase? Will the duties of libraries be expanded with the rest? Or will library
services be restricted or dispensed with?”1
The 1929 stock market crash resulted in the most economically devastating period in
American history. Its effects reverberated throughout the 1930s, most clearly in catastrophic
unemployment rates. Mass unemployment meant that public institutions were pressed to serve a
greater number of constituents using reduced resources. Under these circumstances, it would
have been understandable, perhaps expected, that library services would have suffered and
collapsed under the strain.
Instead, thanks to the New Deal, the United States underwent “a highly complex political,
economic, and social transformation.”2 Though they have been overlooked, as this dissertation
has shown, libraries were an important part of this transformation. Using broad, coalition-based
support, the persistent efforts of US librarians transformed technology, access, and policy by the
end of the 1930s. A period of grave economic crisis became an opportunity for American
librarians and information workers to be unusually imaginative about the scope and purpose of
library services. When we delve into the changes around technology, access, and policy, we get a

also see that librarians and libraries were an important social force that formed part of the
cultural apparatus of the 1930s as defined by Michael Denning. Librarians and information
workers who spearheaded changes in technology, access, and policy did not necessarily identify
as radicals. Nevertheless, the reformist impulses of the decade are clearly evident in libraries and
in the wider system of information provision.
The American Library Association certainly sought to seize this momentum to their
advantage, in arguing for permanent federal appropriations for libraries. The origins of modern
librarianship in the nineteenth century were imbued with the belief that a democratic society
needed unimpeded access to thoughts and ideas as they are instantiated in print media. What the
ALA was doing and arguing for in the 1930s was not entirely new in terms of the established
mission of the public library. Rather, ALA leaders latched on to the New Deal to reinforce the
importance of the library in public library, and to argue for its expansion.
The 1930s endures as a topic of discussion in professional and scholarly library literature,
and there is a general consensus that library services are acutely important during an economic
crisis. In addition to the special issue of Libraries and the Cultural Record, recent articles such
as Stephanie Henderson’s “From the Great Depression to the Current Economic Crisis,” Eric
Novotny’s “Hard Choices in Hard Times,” and Nora Quinlen’s “Desperate Times, Desperate
Measures” indicate that librarians see the 1930s as a source of inspiration for how libraries my
navigate the current economic downturn.3

While the 1930s’ US has been well-traversed by many scholars, no one has foregrounded
the system of information provision as a pivotal area. I considered librarianship as a pivot of this
larger system, using technology, access, and policy as the key vectors of evidence for my
exploration. Histories of the system of information provision have typically explored these
aspects in isolation from one another. Even more curiously, many histories of contemporary
technology, access, or policy have sidestepped economic crisis.
This dissertation puts flesh on those bones. It makes clear that librarians and libraries
were essential to the process of economic recovery. It challenges a narrative that librarians and
libraries are slow to change and lack innovation. We can assert that, historically at least, this is
not the case. Librarians have often been leading advocates for innovative approaches to
information services; in Klaus Musmann’s history of technology and libraries he characterizes
librarians as “unusually fervent and filled with enthusiasm” for technological innovation.4 It also
challenges the narrative that the best course of action during economic crisis is to rely on the
private sector and private sector practices to reinvigorate the economy. A public service ethic,
informed by government economic planning, is something we must consider. This is particularly
important with regard to access. A library must serve its users first and foremost. When private
funding is a considerable source for library operating expenses, this creates a potential conflict:
will libraries be accountable to their users or their private donors? A commitment to access is
best upheld when library users and funders are intertwined. This still applies under the provision
of federal library aid, as federal dollars are arguably available because of taxpayer contributions.
Access, as we have seen, is never apolitical, and is subject to economic and political forces.

The events of the 1930s were a reflection of complicated political, economic, and social
tendencies that have relevance for today’s information providers. As this study shows, library
decisions were political decisions. The dreams and accomplishment of 1930s’ libraries reflected
the ability of librarians and information workers to organize across institutions. Moreover, the
1930s renders problematic the assumption that cuts are the inevitable response to economic
crisis.
As public libraries become increasingly reliant on private grant dollars and the largesse of
for-profit donors, I contend that libraries can best serve their communities through expansion of
public subsidies. If it was possible during the Great Depression, it is surely a possibility now.
Library leaders must not be timid about voicing their support for comprehensive library funding.
“Whether we are normal or depressed” wrote Judson T. Jennings in 1935, “I believe we should
seek federal and state grants to stimulate library service. And by grants I do not mean a few
hundred dollars for books. What we need, perhaps, may be 30 cents per capita from the federal
government, 20 cents from the state, and 50 cents from the region that is to be served.”5
Concerns over library funding are not new. Thus, while contemporary librarianship faces
great political and economic challenges, they are not entirely unprecedented. Finally, it is worth
noting that information policy of the 1930s treated information as a resource and not a
commodity. Information was used as a resource in service of economic decision-making, and not
in itself as a product to be bought and sold. There was little to no interest in monetizing library
services and shifting economic costs to patrons, although the American Documentation Institute
appeared to have hopes for commercializing the Bibliofilm Service—something that split other
Bibliofilm Service members, and ultimately was a factor in its demise. We see some a move

toward information commodification in the birth of University Microfilms, Incorporated,
however these were not entirely librarian-led endeavors. Instead, librarians largely directed
energy toward increasing subsidies for libraries in order to provide a greatest number of free
services for a greatest number of patrons. Librarianship was, through the efforts of good
policymakers and those of librarians and communities, reaffirmed as a core element of the wider
system of information provision.

Future Research
This dissertation has gestured at a great number of events and accomplishments in
libraries and information agencies of the 1930s. Synthesizing this information has revealed a
number of possible avenues for future research. Here are a few:
There is still much to be said on the WPA’s internal information provision: its own
record-keeping practices, information services, and research centers. WPA arts and writing
projects have been covered to some extent, with William McDonald and Jerre Mangione having
done comprehensive treatments while George Blakey’s Creating a Hoosier Self-Portrait covers
the Federal Writers’ Project on a state level (Indiana).6 Nevertheless, we have a wealth of
documents from the 1930s remaining to be canvassed and assessed: the Historical Records
Survey and the Writers’ Projects generated volumes’ worth of unpublished material. Some of
these records were boxed up and stowed away, sometimes organized and properly cataloged,
more often not. In the case of Maine’s Historical Records Survey, when the director was unable

“to find a Maine Library who would accept the HRS and Writers’ Project materials they were
dumped from a wharf into Casco Bay.”7 We have nothing near approaching a full description of
what was generated by workers across the system of information provision during the
Depression decade, and some of those materials can never be recovered.
On a more hopeful note, the National Archives and Records Administration maintains a
wealth of records pertaining to the New Deal/Great Depression, encompassing fourteen record
groups. As mentioned previously, the WPA holdings alone at the National Archives span 7,300
cubic feet. Library extension seems to be the most popular topic in secondary literature, and yet
there is room for further exploration of library extension examples. There are also several other
WPA library projects that have yet to receive a full treatment, such as union catalogs or indexing
jobs.
As with the WPA’s internal records, much remains to be said about the WPA’s many
research projects. William McDonald’s book devotes a few pages to the Research and Records
Project, but otherwise there is not much written on the topic. According to WPA statistics
published for the month of June, 1936, there were 50,644 people employed under “Research and
Statistical Surveys.” Comparatively, there were 50,328 employed that same month under
“Professional and Technical Projects,” which included library workers.8 What were the full range
of duties and activities encompassed by the Research and Records Project? Why was it created?
What did it produce and can we assess its legacy today? Similarly, volumes could be written
about the Historical Records Survey and its numerous related projects such as the Survey of

Federal Archives, the Survey of Church Records, and the American Imprints Inventory. We still
lack a full account of what information was collected and what can be done with it.
Professional literature of the 1930s offers a wealth of historical data, most of which I
could only skim for the purposes of this dissertation. Library Journal and the Bulletin of the
American Library Association (and after 1938, the ALA Bulletin) can both be easily mined for
qualitative and quantitative research, as between them they published more than 2,000 pages per
year. One could take research topics from this dissertation and formulate more specific research
questions such as: when was microfilm first mentioned? How frequently was it an article topic?
These research questions would build on Michael Buckland’s work on LIS publishing in the
1930s’ United States.9
While there are good sources on the National Agricultural Library, there remains to be a
full account of the Bibliofilm Service. With the exception of Irene Farkas-Conn’s work, most
secondary sources describe what the Bibliofilm Service was, but fail to discuss what became of it
after the 1930s. This would also provide a closer examination of how
documentalism/information science projects intersected with WPA projects, not to mention that
the Bibliofilm Service is an excellent site for exploring cooperation and technological innovation
in libraries in the pre-computer era. On a related note, Claribel Barnett would be a good
biographical subject for reasons already mentioned: she remains the longest-serving director of
the NAL, and she presided over the National Agricultural Library during a major expansion,
which included the development of the Bibliofilm Service. Also of note is that Barnett occupied
such a prestigious leadership position, as it is an oft-repeated statistic that the vast majority of

librarian positions are held by women, except for when it comes to director positions, which are
overwhelmingly held by men. Women’s contributions in the areas of technology, access, and
policy are notable and could form the basis of an important study. Another topic of potential
interest for a social historian would be to indicate a possible influence on the Progressive Era on
New Deal librarianship, as some of the more prominent library leaders and New Deal visionaries
came of age during the Progressive Era.
There are several possibilities for state case studies of libraries and information provision
in the 1930s. A number of states would be suitable candidates interesting case studies, either
because of their campaigns for state aid, or their WPA library projects—or both. Ohio seems one
of the most obvious places for an interesting and potentially revealing study. One, Ohio was very
successful in its campaigns for state library aid. Two, Ohio was home to one of the major WPA
newspaper indexing projects, with none other than Robert Binkley at the helm. Models for these
case studies could be drawn from Edward Barrese Stanford’s, Robert Scott Kramp’s, or Daniel
Ring’s works.10
Robert Binkley would make for a compelling biographical subject. Binkley’s career
crossed numerous professional boundaries; he seemed to have a natural ability for bringing
people together from different backgrounds and working towards common interests. He was
simultaneously involved in efforts to enlarge and enhance technology, access, and policy across
the system of information provision. An examination of Binkley’s professional life could further

illuminate how librarians, archivists, documentalists, and historians collaborated throughout a
watershed decade.
Wayne Wiegand has charged library history research with being too preoccupied with the
library in the life of the user as opposed to the user in the life of the library.11 As I mentioned
earlier in this dissertation, we do not need to choose between studying users or institutions. I do
wish to emphasize that without institutions, there would not be users to study. Leaving library
history aside for the moment, I wish to advocate for the importance of making the library, and
particularly library management, a priority in contemporary research. One of the most obvious
conclusions to emerge from my dissertation research, and one that is foregrounded in Kathleen
Molz’s work, is the importance of research devoted to library administration and management.
Library research produced during the 1930s, especially from the University of Chicago’s
Graduate Library School, regularly prioritized questions of public administration, planning, and
libraries.
I cannot help seeing the comparative lack of emphasis on training library leaders in
graduate schools of library and information science in the twenty-first century as a grave error. It
stands to reason that as more graduate programs drop the ‘L’ and emphasize the ‘I’, libraryspecific problems are even less likely to get the attention they deserve. Yet as library funding
becomes more vulnerable to attack under neoliberalism, it is all the more crucial that we produce
critically-minded library leaders. Strong library leadership was vital to the expansion of library
services in the 1930s, and it is important to remember that this leadership was supported in great
part by meticulous research produced by faculty and graduate students.

The library of the twenty-first century differs from the library of the 1930s in certain
ways, yet there are also ways that today’s libraries are consistent with those of the past. This is
abundantly clear when we consider the centrality of technology, access, and policy to the
provision of library services. In both eras, the library confronted economic and political crisis. In
the 1930s this was manifest in the Great Depression (economic) and the threat of totalitarianism
(political). Today’s library likewise confronts threats of economic crisis, yet the political crisis
has less to do with fascism abroad and more to do with the growth of for-profit information
provision and the commodification of information.
Library services are essential parts of community life, and they provide crucial
information sources for people in economic crisis—regardless of the era. The continued survival
and expansion of library technology, access, and policy would be well-served by research
agendas that incorporate a political economy of librarianship.
