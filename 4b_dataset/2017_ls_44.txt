ABSTRACT
On May 1, 2003, standing in front of a banner declaring “Mission Accomplished”
aboard the warship U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, President Bush announced an end to major
combat in Iraq, referring to the war as “one victory in the war on terror.” Over seven
years later, on August 31, 2010, President Obama in a televised speech also announced
an end to the combat mission in Iraq. On October 21, 2011, President Obama once again
reaffirmed that U.S. military personnel would be leaving Iraq, saluting the troops on their
“success” and remarking on the Iraqi government’s readiness for governing. And finally,
on December 14, 2011, four days before the last U.S. troops left Iraq, President Obama,
once again declared the end of the war and said: “we’re leaving behind a sovereign,
stable and self-reliant Iraq.”
The informational battlefront is a salient feature of any war, and understanding
the role the mass media play in the production and packaging of information in the form
of news offers fertile ground for Library and Information Science scholars. This study
examines U.S. national newspapers’ representations of and discursive construction of two
of these ‘endings,’ 2003 and 2011. Using the method of critical discourse analysis, news
coverage is analyzed in order to understand and explain the discursive constructions of
meaning in news reports about the end of the war, with a focus on outcomes,
consequences, and responsibility for these. The three-part analysis that follows consists
of a contextual analysis, a textual analysis, and a historical-diachronic analysis
identifying the dominant discourses, and comparing and contrasting these in the two
vi

‘endings.’ By shedding light on these discursive structures, this study seeks to elevate and
make clear the ideological basis to hegemonic news discourses.
The findings showed the media offer a narrow range of discursive possibilities
that delimit the parameters of discourse on the Iraq War; however, there is also some
variation within these parameters which give the impression of information plurality. A
pro-American bias permeates the news discourse that has implications for the democratic
and educational function of news as an informational product.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
Following the end of the Gulf War in 1991, Jean Baudrillard (1991/1995)
published ‘The Gulf War did not take place’ in which he characterized the conflict as a
carefully constructed phantasmagoria of surgical war. He argued that the public, as
“hostages of media intoxication” (p.25), are induced to believe in a war that is very
different from the one that is taking place. The information and mass media system
constructed a simulated war in a hyperreal universe of signs, codes, and models, where
the idea of a war was transmitted through media discourse without conveying the true
horrors of war; this process normalized the idea of war as a surgical procedure and a
‘clean’ war without victims. Michaels (2013) and others have also highlighted the
importance of this informational battlefront in relation to the Iraq War (March 20, 2003 –
December 18, 2011).1 Given that there were no final battles, surrender by the enemy,
celebration parades, public ceremonies, or peace treaties concluding the war,
communicating the ending of the war in a way that made it more comprehensible became
even more dependent on rhetoric and discourse (Michaels, 2013, p. 143).
On May 1, 2003, standing in front of a banner declaring “Mission Accomplished”
aboard the warship U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, President Bush prematurely declared an end
1

Although these are the official dates, there had been U.S. and U.K. bombing campaigns in Iraq throughout
the 1990s and into the 2000s, following the end of the Gulf War in 1991 (see for example, Arbuthnot,
2004).

to major combat in Iraq, referring to the war as “one victory in the war on terror” (Bush,
2003b). Over seven years and several thousand dead American military personnel later,
on August 31, 2010, President Obama in a televised speech to the nation, also announced
an end to the combat mission in Iraq and a planned timetable of withdrawal by the end of
2011 (Obama, 2010). In 2010, Iraqi civilian deaths from war-related violence had fallen
to its lowest since the start of the war (4,167); however, hostilities continued and the
security situation for Iraqis remained precarious (Iraq Body Count, 2017). Over a year
later, on October 21, 2011, President Obama once again reaffirmed that U.S. military
personnel would be leaving Iraq, saluting the troops on their “success” and remarking on
the Iraqi government’s readiness for governing.(Obama, 2011a). Finally, on December
14, 2011, four days before the last U.S. troops left Iraq, President Obama once again
declared the end of the war, saying: “we’re leaving behind a sovereign, stable and selfreliant Iraq” (Obama, 2011b). However, since the official end to the war in 2011, a
further 81,211 Iraqi civilians have died,2 and there have been a huge number of Iraqi
military personnel killed in the struggle with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL or ISIS) as well as numerous bombing campaigns carried out by the United States.
It is therefore not wholly unreasonable to extend Baudrillard’s line of inquiry to question
whether the ending of the Iraq War actually took place, despite the presidential
pronouncements mentioned above, and to examine what role the news media played in
shaping the discourses about the ending.
This dissertation examines the prominent discourses of the most widely circulated
national newspapers in the United States concerning two of these ‘endings’ of the Iraq
War. Using the method of critical discourse analysis (CDA), news coverage is analyzed
2

in order to understand and explain the discursive constructions of meaning in U.S. news
reports about the end of the war, with a focus on outcomes, consequences, and
responsibility for these. The analysis that follows consists of identifying, comparing, and
contrasting the dominant discourses in May 2003 and December 2011. The purpose of
undertaking this analysis is to examine the structures of illegitimate power, domination,
and injustice reproduced or challenged in this news discourse about the endings of the
Iraq War. In doing this, it is the aim of this study to elevate and make clear the ideologies
shaping these discourses. As all CDA research seeks to do, the goal is to challenge
structures of power that produce and re-produce social injustices.
Discourse is the primary ‘object’ of study in understanding how the U.S. news
media constructed the social reality of the ending of the Iraq War. Discourse “infuses
events with meaning, establishes widespread social understandings, and constitutes social
reality” (Hodges, 2011, p. 5). It is the representations of reality that matter because these
subsequently “materialize” in ways that produce real consequences (Fairclough, 2003 and
2009; Jager & Maier, 2009, p. 37). Discourses also constitute the soft power of war that
hard power (e.g. military action) relies upon to establish legitimacy (Chouliaraki, 2005, p.
5); such soft power can permeate the media and political and entertainment landscapes to
advance military goals (examples include the creation of movies or video games to
glorify war and vilify political opponents).
van Dijk suggests another material consequence of discourse, pointing out that
discourse may indirectly control the minds of people because “people’s actions are
controlled by their minds (knowledge, attitudes, ideologies, norms, values), [thus] mind
control also means indirect action control.” (2008c, p. 9). Because the ending of this war

3

has been planned for and announced on multiple occasions for various political purposes,
this study examines the ending in 2003 and the ending in 2011. It uses CDA to examine
the discursive construction of the outcomes and consequences of the war, as well as
responsibility for the war, in national newspaper reports at the times when each of these
endings were announced by U.S. presidents in office. These moments represent the
official narratives, policies, and actions regarding the missions Operation Iraqi Freedom
(March 21 2003 – September 1 2010) and Operation New Dawn (September 1 2010 –
December 15, 2011). As Hodges (2011) points out, “they articulate a perspective that has
been well thought out and is representative of a larger set of ideas that underlies much of
the administration’s discourse and policies” (p. 11). The dates of these speeches anchor
the study by narrowing the news media coverage examined to articles dealing exclusively
with the ending of the Iraq War, a specific if incomplete campaign within the broader
ongoing War on Terror. In using the techniques of CDA, this study discusses the social
and political implications of the discursive features of news media coverage of the
denouement of the Iraq War, such as the normalization and dominance of particular
discourses surrounding outcomes, consequences and responsibility in the ending of the
Iraq War.
The aims of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) to shed light on the
dominant discourses that are embedded in news coverage of the ending of the Iraq War in
four major national newspapers (The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The
Washington Post and USA Today); (2) to demonstrate using CDA how meanings of the
ending of the war were discursively constructed in 2003 and 2011; and (3) to illustrate
how news is an informational product that is not free of ideology by discerning patterns

4

and thematic structures of discourses within the coverage that either discursively
reproduce or challenge the injustices of the Iraq War. These aims are realized through
conducting detailed textual and contextual analysis of newspaper coverage of these
‘endings’ of the Iraq War.
The war in Iraq was justified and launched in the context of the War on Terror by
President Bush with the support of a ‘coalition of the willing’ in which the U.S. and U.K.
provided the majority of combat troops. A thorough understanding of the ‘War on Terror’
construct is necessary to understand the discursive features of the media’s coverage of the
ending of the Iraq War. With the rapid rise to prominence of ISIS, the War on Terror
remains a key issue for the Trump administration. Furthermore, given the welldocumented rise in global terrorism since the launch of the War on Terror in September
2001 (see, for example, Stern, 2014), the War on Terror has critically defined the United
States’ foreign and domestic policy agendas for nearly two decades and may define it for
decades to come.
In the days following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President Bush
said, “We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and
those who harbor them” (Bush, 2001a, p. 58). He continued, “War has been waged
against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when
stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in
a way, and at an hour, of our choosing” (Bush, 2001b, pp. 59-60). The Bush
administration made clear that the attacks were not merely criminal and terrorist but acts
of war, and that the U.S. response would be one of waging a war. At this early stage
following 9/11, it was not clear how far reaching this War on Terror would be and which

5

nation states would be deemed as nations harboring terrorists, but as the president stated,
“Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we
have ever seen” (Bush, 2001c, p. 77). Despite the official end to the Iraq War in
December 2011, the evidence suggests that the war is still ongoing, with civilian deaths
from violence continuing to increase since the withdrawal of American troops.3
The informational battlefront is a salient feature of any war, and understanding
the role the mass media play in the production and packaging of information in the form
of news offers many investigative opportunities for Library and Information Science
(LIS) scholars. In particular, news media discourses about the ending of the Iraq War
offer fertile ground for research. The Iraq War was positioned within the War on Terror
which is as much a discursive construct and powerful narrative as it is a series of
conflicts. It is an American construct, with successive U.S. administrations serving as the
key decision-makers determining the direction of this war. Therefore, the focus of this
study will be on the American perspective.
There remains much definitional ambiguity regarding the War on Terror: its
scope, time frame, and geographic borders are uncertain. This ambiguity results in even
greater media reliance on government information that potentially enables the U.S.
government greater hegemonic control over the discourse and informational landscape.
The United States “initiated an open-ended and global conflict – one that can be directed
against any adversary, anywhere in the world” (Thassu & Freedman, 2003, p. 1). The war
on terror thus has both domestic and foreign policy dimensions; the former is concerned
primarily with domestic terrorist incidents and the expansion of state surveillance powers

Civilian deaths in brackets: 2011 (4,153); 2012 (4,622); 2013 (9,851); 2014 (20,179); 2015 (17,511);
2016 (16,393). (Iraq Body Count, 2017).

to thwart terrorism at home, and the latter with defeating terrorist organizations and other
sponsors of terrorism abroad.
This dissertation focuses on the foreign policy arena of the War on Terror,4
specifically on Operation Iraqi Freedom (initial invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and
subsequent occupation until 2010) and Operation New Dawn (President Obama’s gradual
withdrawal of troops and ending of military operations in Iraq). Both operations
generated significant press coverage for nearly a decade but in order to conduct a
meaningful and manageable study of discourse, it is the media’s coverage of the
denouement of the Iraq War that has been selected as key to understand how discourse
operates and to demonstrate how it is not free from ideology in propelling certain
agendas.
There has not been a great deal of research in the LIS field on the Iraq War or
War on Terror despite information warfare being a critically defining feature of conflicts
(Thassu & Freedman, 2003; Webster, 2003). Yet there have been a few LIS studies
concerned with information warfare in other contexts, such as cyber warfare, launching
attacks on the information technology infrastructure of an enemy (see for example, van
Niekerk & Maharaj, 2011), and the potential uses of the internet by extremists, terrorists,
or activists (Crilley, 2001). Taylor has referred to the information environment as the key
battlefront in the War on Terror (Taylor, 2003, p. 112); this informational war is being
waged on many fronts, including with domestic as well as foreign publics. Michaels
4

The War on Terror is so vast in scope that in addition to military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, other
dimensions include a stated world-wide hunt for terrorists, sponsors of terrorism and terrorist organizations,
U.S. military and counter-terrorism operations in the Philippines, Horn of Africa (primarily Sudan,
Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Seychelles and Kenya but also includes operations in Mauritius,
Comoros, Liberia, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania), Pankisi Gorge (Georgia), Trans Sahara (Algeria, Chad,
Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Nigeria, and Morocco), Caribbean and Central America (Belize, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname), Kyrgyzstan, and
Pakistan.

7

(2013) has studied the roles of language and discourse – that is words and meanings – in
warfare, and how discourses can become entrenched and institutionalized, making them
difficult to criticize or dislodge. Michaels demonstrates the functioning of this ‘discourse
trap’ by examining the language of the build up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, finding
that there was a discursive emphasis on terrorism with consistent references to 9/11 and
al-Qaeda within official and media discourse; this was designed to strengthen public
support for the invasion and occupation. However, following the failure to find weapons
of mass destruction (WMD), the government and media discourse continued to focus on
fighting ‘terrorists’ rather than a nationalist insurgency opposed to U.S. occupation, even
though this was at odds with most ground-level military assessments and the assessments
of the intelligence community (Michaels, 2013, p. 123).
The mass media inform the public about the rationale for war, the progress of war,
the necessity for continuing war, and the conclusion of war. Furthermore, the media are
influential in the construction of social reality or realities through discourses. On a microscale, this construction involves language, signs, and symbols; on the macro-level scale,
it involves narratives, theories, and ideological frameworks. Combined, these aspects of
discourse produce social knowledge – that is, knowledge intended to help readers make
sense of the world and events that takes place in it.
News media sociologist Michael Schudson (1995) refers to newspaper
participation in this process as a construction of the mental world in which readers live;
this perspective also mirrors van Dijk’s work on the mental models that news discourse
creates (see for example,1997b, 1998; 2008c, and 2009b). While various communication
theories attempt to explain the extent to which news influences readers and audiences,

8

most of these also understand and account for news consumers as active participants in
the process of interpreting, understanding, and disseminating the information they
consume. That said, discourses produced by powerful individuals and institutions have a
powerful capacity to manufacture social knowledge (see for example, van Dijk 1988,
1998, and 2008c; Herman & Chomsky, 1988). It is, after all, the media that “tell us how
to think about a topic” (Tomasky, 2003, 154).
Although some LIS scholarship alludes to the disciplinary connections between
information studies and communication/media studies, the relationship becomes more
apparent when we acknowledge the critical role of the media in providing accurate, clear,
credible, reliable, and verified information. These are just some of the key characteristics
of professional journalism, yet they are also key characteristics of professional librarians
and information analysts. In this sense, reporters are in the information business (Kitty
2005, p. 54), and news can be viewed as an information commodity that serves the dual
purpose of educating and informing citizens. The democratic and informative role of the
news media is discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two.
A related point is that CDA has not been widely adopted in LIS, but early
advocates of critical theory and those influenced by the works of Foucault [scholars such
as Frohmann (1992a, 1992b, 1994), and Budd and Raber (1996)] bemoaned the lack of
critical reflexivity in LIS scholarship, a situation that left much of the scholarship
disengaged from politics in the hope of remaining neutral. One of the unique
contributions of this dissertation to LIS is that it adopts an approach that expands outside
of the traditional boundaries of LIS research. LIS itself is treated as a discursive construct
in the Foucauldian sense: that is, this dissertation recognizes the ongoing struggle to

9

establish the discipline’s boundaries. Through such disciplinary parameters and the
specialized vocabulary invented for those within the community, LIS distinguishes itself
from other subjects; in contrast, this study connects LIS to disciplines outside of the LIS
community by adopting a theoretical and methodological approach that challenges the
existing orthodoxies of the discipline.
Providing accurate information to enable an informed citizenry capable of selfgovernment is one of the self-proclaimed roles of the news media and theoretical
justifications of a free press as affirmed in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
According to the Project for Excellence in Journalism and Committee of Concerned
Journalists, the “central purpose of journalism is to provide citizens with accurate and
reliable information they need to function in a free society” (cited in Wong, 2006, p.
123). What’s more, as Chermak (2003) explains, the news media’s role in selecting
“relevant” facts, voices, and viewpoints has vital consequences for public discourse:
The public’s limited access to a full range of information on issues,
coupled with people’s limits on the amount of time available to investigate
issues beyond their own immediate primary life concerns, has created
reliance on vicarious sources of information. The public consumes
information but does not critically analyze or ponder the issues
highlighted, and it generally ignores whatever is not presented about the
issues. The mass media can also control the scope of public debate in a
democratic society, determining what facts are relevant, who the
authoritative voices on issues are, and when a minority or alternative
viewpoint is worthy of consideration. (p.9)

10

Therefore, information “confers power on those who possess it or can control its flow in a
way that enables them to achieve their own goals” (Mason, Mason & Culnan, 1995, p.
32). The news media are influential in providing legitimacy or deriding certain
viewpoints in coverage of events and issues (Ashley & Olson, 1998, p. 264). Kitty (2005)
goes further, citing the primacy of emotions and intuition over critical thinking when it
comes to the influence of news media on readers and audiences (p. 292). In assessing
news coverage of controversial aspects of war, including the multiple so-called “endings”
of the Iraq War, it is important to pay attention to these critical characteristics of
information and news.
Following the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11,
2001, there was limited public outcry against the U.S.-led military action against the
Taliban regime in Afghanistan that had been accused of sheltering the Islamic terrorist
organisation called al-Qaeda and its head, Osama Bin Laden, who had taken
responsibility for the attacks. However, the second major military conflict of the War on
Terror, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, has proven to be “the most resisted element” of the
War on Terror narrative (Hodges, 2011, p. 55), one that raises the most questions about
the motives behind the actions of the U.S. government. Prior to the invasion of Iraq,
President Bush stated, “Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists including members
of al-Qaeda” (Bush, 2003a). A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed 86 percent of those
polled in August 2002, and 88 percent in March 2003, believed that Hussein was
involved in supporting terrorist groups that were planning to attack the U.S. (cited in
Fried, 2005, pp. 125-6).

11

Various scholars have attributed public support of the invasion to the direct
influence of the news media in making the case for war without thoroughly investigating
contrary viewpoints (see for example, Freedman, 2004; Altheide & Grimes, 2005).
Despite widespread news media support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in the mainstream
press (including the NYT, WP and WSJ), there has never been a shred of evidence made
public linking Hussein’s regime to al-Qaeda or to the terrorist attacks in New York City
on 9/11 (Collins, 2015). The initial invasion of Iraq and media coverage of the invasion
has been widely studied, primarily in the fields of mass communications and journalism.
Many writers have commented on the prominent and proactive role the news media
played in galvanizing support for the war (see for example, Dadge, 2006; Hayden, 2009;
Keeble, 2004; and Guelke, 2006). Some have attributed this to a traditional “rally around
the flag” effect (Kull, Ramsay, & Lewis, 2003; Moeller, 2004). Others have cited the
atmosphere of fear and patriotism after 9/11 when there was reluctance among journalists
to question government actions for fear of being castigated as insufficiently patriotic
(Chermak, 2003; Kauffman, 2004; John et al., 2007, Zelizer & Allan, 2002; Rosen, 2002;
Tumber & Palmer, 2004; Waisbord, 2002). A great deal of the existing research
scrutinizes and questions the media’s role in rationalizing the Iraq War, focusing largely
on the justification of the war rather than examining the discourse within the news media
surrounding the ending of the conflict, its legacy, and assessment of success.

1.2 Newspapers
Traditionally elite newspapers in the United States have taken the lead when it
comes to investigative reporting to uncover abuses of power, corruption, and wrongdoing

12

(Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro 2011, p. 199). Newspapers are still influential opinion
makers, as often these established stalwarts of the mass media are influential in
determining news frames and news agendas not only for their own organizations but also
for many other news outlets.5 Despite the emergence of non-mainstream online news
sources as competition for traditional newspapers, most online news still originates with
newspapers; for example, in 2016 ten of the top fifteen most popular internet news
sources were either online versions of print newspapers or aggregated content from
online newspapers (Ebizmba, 2016). It is for this reason that newspapers such as The New
York Times and The Washington Post are viewed as “agenda-setting newspapers”
(DiMaggio 2015, p. 14; Hess & Kalb 2003, p. 31), and The Wall Street Journal is widely
considered one of the most influential business news source in the U.S.
Print newspaper circulation in the U.S. in 2001 was 55.6 million for dailies and
about 59.1 million for Sunday editions. Circulation by 2011 (the official year for
withdrawal of troops from Iraq) had fallen to 44.4 million for dailies and 48.5 million for
Sunday editions. The latest figures available indicate that circulation for daily newspapers
in 2014 fell to 44.1 million and 47.9 million for Sunday editions (Pew Research Center,
2015a). Despite falling circulation, newspapers remain a significant medium for access to
news and information for American adults, with readership of daily and print editions still
close to the 100 million mark, which is close to 41% of the adult population.6 The
newspapers selected for this study are the most widely circulated national newspapers
with circulation figures as follows: The Wall Street Journal (2,378,827), The New York
5
Alex Jones, the director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard
University, estimated that approximately 85 percent of today’s news (in 2009) is generated by newspaper
personnel (cited in Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011, p. 198).
6
Data is based on average daily print and website audience of U.S. newspapers from August 2011 to
September 2012, by gender and age group. (Statista, 2016).

13

Times (1,865,318), The Washington Post (474,767), and USA Today (1,674,306) (AAM,
2013). The circulation figures for the Sunday editions of these newspapers7 are as
follows: The New York Times (1,254,506) and The Washington Post (639,966) (AAM,
2013). These figures may seem modest at first glance when compared to the wide reach
of television news programs; however, it is worth pointing out that readership of
newspapers is increasing when you combine the online and print audience. For example,
unique visitor traffic to digital content (mobile and desktop website access) for the month
of January 2015, was 55 million visitors for USA Today (ranked 1st), 54 million for The
New York Times (ranked 2nd) and 48 million for The Washington Post (ranked 4th) (Pew
Research Center, 2015b, p. 30); curiously The Wall Street Journal was not ranked in the
top 25 sites so figures are below 6 million (Pew Research Center, 2015b, p. 30). With the
exception of The Wall Street Journal, the newspapers selected in this study continue to
dominate the digital newspaper market in terms of audience traffic to their websites.
Furthermore, by comparison to the number of visitors to the websites of major cable
news networks, Fox News (55 million), CNN (50 million), MSNBC (6 million) (Pew
Research Center, 2015b, p. 36) and the major TV networks, ABC (65 million), NCB (56
million), and CBC (47 million) (Pew Research Center, 2015b, p. 44) – the newspapers
selected in this study are very close in terms of audience share in the online market. A
further advantage of studying newspaper coverage is that, unlike T.V. news bulletins, the
newspaper format offers more opportunity for critical analysis and depth and breadth of
coverage.
It is also important to consider the wide-ranging influence of American English
language media outlets (Reese, 2004; Magder, 2003). Many countries’ journalists will
7

The Wall Street Journal and USA Today do not have Sunday editions.

14

often compare their sources with those of other languages, and the international
dominance and widespread prevalence of English language media mean that the
newspapers analyzed in this study have audiences beyond the domestic market.
Furthermore, much of the world wide web is dominated by the English language and
often, from an international perspective, American news agencies will be significantly
relied upon when agencies from other countries compile news items. Finally, American
media organizations have to be put in the context of globalization and the dominance of
the U.S. as an international power, not only in terms of military or economic might, but
also the cultural influence of the U.S. throughout the world in nearly all aspects whether
it is business, education, medicine, sports, movies, music, and more (see for example, H.
Schiller, 1981 or D. Schiller, 2007 for more about the impact of information and
communication cultural hegemony).

1.3 Research Problem
As mentioned above, there has been limited scholarly attention to news coverage
of the ending of the Iraq War. Information plurality and a multiplicity of viewpoints in
the mass media are critical to a well-functioning democracy. Thus, to what extent did the
prominent discourses in the media vary and what was the extent of their confluence? This
study seeks to examine the prevalent discourse/s in newspapers that informed the public
and gave historical assessments of the outcomes, consequences, and responsibility for the
successes and failures of the war in Iraq in relation to the aims set out by the Bush
administration and in terms of the broader aims of the War on Terror.

15

CDA is an approach that has been widely used in the analysis of texts, in many
cases for examining the mediation of political discourse between the state and media
institutions. It is an approach that seeks to bring to the fore hidden agendas and to
question accepted frames of discourse; it seeks to highlight how ideology operates in
discourse, and how this ideology prevents a realistic analysis of an event, in this case war,
the costliest of political affairs. More specifically, CDA “focuses on the ways discourse
structures enact, confirm, legitimate, reproduce, or challenge relations of power and
dominance in society” (van Dijk, 2001, p. 353). Through paying close attention to the
text’s linguistic details and other discursive structures (such as narratives and themes), a
body of evidence is produced through the analysis of explicit examples of language and
textual structure that constitute the discourse. In other words, how did the newspapers
create meanings about the ending of the war, specifically outcomes, consequences and
responsibility? This analytical approach focuses on the implications of specific
representations that delimit debate and perhaps even curtail it.
CDA is concerned with highlighting illegitimate power abuses and social
injustices, and if possible proposing solutions to redress these. The war in Iraq is one of
the greatest injustices of our times, with some studies estimating up to 500,000 civilian
deaths as a result of the war (Hagopian et al., 2013). Armstrong views the militaristic
agenda pursued by the Bush administration following 9/11 and subsequently continued
by the Obama administrations as a continuation of a broader American strategy that
developed following the end of the Cold War, namely to use unilateral military force and
conduct preemptive strikes against perceived threats to U.S. interests based on capability
to ensure U.S. hegemony and leadership in global affairs (Armstrong, 2002, p. 529; also

16

see Acharya, 2007). Also relevant is Iraq’s enormous natural resource wealth, which in
2016 had the fourth largest proven crude oil reserves in the world (OPEC, 2016, p. 8). If
Iraq did not possess such vast resources, would it still be targeted for regime change and
an eight-plus year occupation? Noam Chomsky has said: “The U.S. invaded Iraq because
it has enormous oil resources, mostly untapped, and it’s right in the heart of the world’s
energy system. Which means that if the U.S. manages to control Iraq, it extends
enormously its strategic power, what Zbigniew Brzezinski calls its “critical leverage”
over Europe and Asia….So that’s the reason for invading Iraq, the fundamental reason”
(quoted in Parrish, 2006, para. 15).
If this is a war being fought for the control of resources as Chomsky and others
attest (for example, Ahmad, 2003), to what extent did the newspaper discourse address
this perspective? There are enormous corporate interests at stake, including huge military
contracts for equipment and supplies. As Nash has argued, the Iraq War “exceeds past
wars in the privatization of many service-related functions in supply, engineering, and
maintenance, allowing multinational firms based in the United States such as Halliburton,
Bechtel, Blackwater, and their subsidiaries to expand their operations with expectations
of huge profits in the Middle East” (2009, p. 40). There has been enormous profiteering
by U.S. contractors for the rebuilding of Iraq’s infrastructure – strangely, one which the
U.S. helped destroy in its “nation-building” effort that involved a sustained ‘shock and
awe’ bombing campaign throughout the invasion period of 2003. To what extent did
newspaper discourse examine the profiteers of this war when reporting the outcomes and
consequences of the war? What are the other possible explanations for the war in Iraq if it
had nothing to do with eliminating the threat of terrorism or dispossessing a tyrannical

17

regime of its WMD as argued by the Bush administration? Conducting a CDA can shed
light on such questions and aspects of the war that may be absent from the media
coverage and thus reveal how discourses operate (through exclusion and omission as
much as through actual topical content) to serve the interests of those in power.
Examining the media’s coverage of the ending of the Iraq War, and assessing the
role news discourse plays in the positive or negative characterization of the conflict
requires further examination in order to raise public awareness of the cost of the Iraq War
and to highlight a need for more effective alternatives to the War on Terror. By focusing
on the outcomes and consequences of, and responsibility for, the Iraq War, this study can
demonstrate the ideological basis of the dominant discourses as well as how these
discourses normalize certain courses of action (e.g. militaristic intervention) and
rationalize such action as common sense and self-evident. Studying the structures of
news discourse, and breaking down its discursive features, allows for greater insights into
how the news media construct meanings which legitimate certain perspectives. Another
aim of CDA-based research is to offer alternatives to the dominant discourse that more
accurately represent reality and injustice.

1.3.1
•

Research Questions
What meanings were constructed by news discourses about the ending of the Iraq
War, specifically concerning the outcomes, the consequences, and responsibility?

•

What were the similarities and differences in the discourse of the selected
newspapers in the 2003 and 2011 ‘endings’ of the Iraq War?

18

•

What ideological perspectives shape the discursive constructions of reality in the
news about the ending of the Iraq War?
The terms outcome and consequence can be synonymous, although in this study

they are employed to refer to distinguishable features. Outcomes is used to address the
specific results of the war in terms of the goals set out by the Bush administration at the
war’s outset, such as regime change, establishment of democracy, and general deBa'athification of Iraqi civil society; these are generally focused on the positives arising
from the invasion. Consequences focus less on the aims of the US-led coalition and more
on the negative impact and results for Iraqi society, such as civilian casualties and
destruction of Iraq’s infrastructure, de-stabilization of the region, and the rise of Islamic
State.

1.4 Limitations and Scope
The limitations of CDA and its tools as a research methodology are discussed
more thoroughly in Chapter Three, so this section will focus on the limitations of the
structure of this study and approach adopted. The duration and scope of the War on
Terror, its overarching importance to the war in Iraq, and the sheer volume of associated
news coverage requires selecting specific events to study. The scope of this research is
limited to the discursive construction of meaning of the ending of the Iraq War. Thus,
there are other critical events that occurred over this period where the newspapers
selected in this study perhaps adopted alternative discourses and viewpoints. The
historical-diachronic analysis adopted in this study is designed to capture any changes in
discourse from the declaration of the military victory in 2003 and the final withdrawal of

19

troops in 2011. By examining the ending of the war, this study will shed light on the
different ways meaning is discursively constructed and reveal the extent of variation in
the news discourse across the mainstream national newspapers. CDA studies point out
that there may be the presence of numerous discourses embedded within texts and it is
only those deemed significant in the context of the aims of this study that are examined in
detail.
The focus on the four major national newspapers selected for this study requires
overlooking other newspapers and news media. Again, unlike content analysis-based
methodologies, it is not feasible to conduct a broader analysis of the media coverage
without losing the detail and richness that CDA seeks to obtain. However, perhaps the
approach adopted in this study can be applied to study different mediums to give an even
more complete picture of the mass media discourse on the denouement of the Iraq War. I
shall touch upon some of the other studies that have been conducted on the general media
coverage of the Iraq War in Chapter Two. Framing studies and content analysis
approaches form the dominant approaches, but it is hoped that the findings of this CDA
study can enhance and complement existing research.

1.5 Background and Context
The War on Terror poses a very real danger to international stability and peace,
and as exemplified by the invasion of Iraq in 2003, sets a dangerous precedent for the
U.S. to pursue a unilateralist agenda that is highly ineffective in eliminating the threat of
terrorism (see for example, Aoudé, 2016). Most analysts agree that since the invasion of
Iraq, Iraq has become more unstable and a breeding ground for radical or fundamentalist

20

Islamic terrorism (see for example, Milton-Edwards, 2006; and Baker, 2015). There is
much evidence to suggest that the forced removal of Saddam Hussein from power, and
the subsequent destabilization of the country that ensued, has resulted in a further
destabilizing effect on neighbouring nations as well as the wider region. As General
Michael Flynn (Ret.), the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency noted, “[i]n
2004, there were 21 total Islamic terrorist groups spread out in 18 countries. Today, there
are 41 Islamic terrorist groups spread out in 24 countries.” (Flynn, 2014).
In terms of financial cost, different studies of the long term costs of the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq have estimated costs between $4 trillion and $6 trillion (Bilmes,
2013, p. 20; and Crawford, 2014, p. 12). Nothing is more costly than the loss of human
life, but there remain huge disparities in estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths in the conflict,
in part due to estimates being taken for different periods in time by different agencies.
For example, according to the Iraq War Logs based on classified documents released by
WikiLeaks, 66,081 civilian deaths were recorded between January 2004 and December
2009 (WikiLeaks, 2010); estimates by the Iraqi Health Ministry for the period between
January 2005 and December 2009 were 87,215; and Iraq Body Count – the source most
often cited by coalition forces politicians (Tapp et al., 2008) – put the figure at 119,902
for the period between 2003 and 2011 (2017). However, a study published in The Lancet
estimated that between the invasion and June 2006, the number of civilian deaths due to
violent causes was a staggering 601,000 (Burnham et al., 2006, p. 1426). Although the
figures of the Lancet study were rejected by the U.S. and U.K. governments, other studies
such as Hagopian et al. (2013) have estimated the figure to be close to 500,000 when
accounting for deaths attributable to the collapse of infrastructure and other war-related

21

causes. Breau and Joyce (2011) bemoan the lack of enforcement of the existing legal
frameworks in human rights law obliging belligerents to accurately report on civilian
deaths, an accounting essential to assessing the human cost of war (p. 380).
Regardless of the differing opinions on how many civilian deaths have occurred,
the cost of the U.S. led invasion for the Iraqi population has been enormous. In addition
to civilian deaths, the numbers of those injured or maimed also run into the hundreds of
thousands. Then there are other direct casualties of war such as five million orphaned
children (Alternet.org, 2007), 2.7 million internally displaced Iraqis, and 2.2. million
refugees (according to UNHCR figures, quoted in Baker and Adriaensens, 2012; similar
figures are also quoted in Ismael and Ismael, 2013, p. 137), and of course, other victims
of violent crimes like rape or torture. Studies have also been conducted to estimate the
long term effects and indirect deaths through the fleeing of medical doctors, the
destruction of medical facilities, and the destruction of sources for food and water (see
for example Crawford, 2011). The war in Iraq has also come at a significant cost in terms
of U.S. military and Department of Defense (DoD) personnel killed, with deaths for the
period 2003-2011 being 4,497 and a further 32,249 wounded (DoD, N.D.). The invasion
has also resulted in the violent deaths of thousands of Iraqi police and military personnel
as well as other coalition forces.
In addition to the loss of life and economic destruction, the longer term effects of
the war, including the destruction of essential infrastructure such as sewage treatment
plants, factories, energy facilities, communication, transport, schools, and hospitals, will
continue to be felt in Iraq for decades. In Chapter Two I will elaborate further on the LIS
research that has focused on the damage to Iraq’s rich cultural heritage institutions such

22

as the National Archives, libraries, museums, and sites of enormous archaeological
significance. The war has also had a devastating effect on Iraq’s educational institutions,
a country with once high levels of literacy and education amongst its citizens (Baker &
Adriaensens, 2012, p. 261). Al-Azawi (2016) has written about the extensive
environmental damage, including destruction of soil texture and internal structure, and
exposure to desertification as a consequence of the coalition’s intensive bombing
campaigns that involved the use of 18,467 smart bombs and missiles in addition to 9,251
dumb bombs. (p.57). This dissertation will shed light on the extent to which the
mainstream press and news discourse in general have addressed such issues in their
assessments of U.S. “success” in Iraq.
One of the striking features of the War on Terror, and specifically the war in Iraq,
has been the lack of opposition to the war in the United States from leaders of the
opposite parties whether the Democrats during the G.W. Bush years or the Republicans
during the Obama years. This is problematic because public protests and opposition to the
war in Iraq prior to the invasion were unprecedented; however, both parties remain very
closely aligned in terms of foreign policy. This dissertation will demonstrate how
ideology operates within the Iraq War news discourse and discuss the implications of
news media representations. The Democrats voted in favor of going to war and President
Obama also had Republican support to continue the War on Terror. However, many
Republicans remained opposed to a withdrawal from Iraq and critical of Obama’s refocusing of the War on Terror to Afghanistan rather than Iraq. At present, Iraq remains
key to the Trump administration as the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria have resulted in
further American military engagement in the region.

23

Not only is the weakness of opposition voices to the wars a reflection of the weak
state of representative democracy in the United States, but it is also indicative of a failure
of the press to scrutinize government policy choices and the implications of these. This
symbiotic relationship is encapsulated in the propaganda model proposed by Herman and
Chomsky (1988), who assert that elite influence on the mass media is worrying for the
health of democracy and the realization of justice. Furthermore, the lack of media
scrutiny of the agenda of the political establishment to take the country into a war that has
been so costly has damaged the image of the U.S. globally, and, as some have argued,
may have increased the threat of terrorism (see for example, Stern, 2014; or Stern and
McBride, 2013). News media coverage of war is clearly an informational issue when it
comes to the public’s understanding of foreign policy.
Given the contextualization of the Iraq War within the War on Terror, it is
necessary to draw attention to the broader conflict of the War on Terror and ask why it is
necessary to pursue and when it might possibly end. Following the establishment of a
weak government in Iraq that was not inclusive of all groups, parties, and ethnicities, the
U.S. withdrew troops from Iraq in December 2011. Yet the aftermath of the withdrawal
saw a spiraling of terrorist activity and violence directed at civilians as well as political
opponents by various competing factions and groups. Iraq became destabilized, with a
strong presence of al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia that did not exist prior to the invasion, with
many groups competing for power, including the group known as ISIS. Furthermore, the
destabilization of Iraq has resulted in the expansion of armed militias that are carrying out
atrocities against political and religious opponents at an alarming rate. In addition, the
establishment of a strong extremist presence in Iraq has seen the birth of ISIS, a

24

fundamentalist Islamist organization determined to overthrow the government of Syria as
well. The effects of the War on Terror are unfolding in the Civil War that is currently
taking place in Syria – a conflict that has been raging from 2011 until the present moment
– resulting in 470,000 direct and indirect war-related civilian deaths by 2015, according
to a policy report from the Syrian Center of Policy Research (2016, p. 61), and a further
displacement of over five million Syrians (2016, p. 9), causing an immense refugee crisis.
Although at the time of the official ending of the Iraq War, the full ramifications of the
war could not have been known, it is important to examine the discourses about the
ending of the conflict to ascertain what kinds of meaning and reality were discursively
constructed by the media. The next chapter will examine in detail the relevant literature
to bring attention to some of the competing analyses and discourses of the situation that
arose out of the invasion of Iraq.

25

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
The Iraq War or the War on Terror have not received a great deal of attention
within the Library and Information Science (LIS) discipline and much of the literature
that does deal with these topics, does so tangentially or peripherally. LIS research will be
the starting point for this review but as there is an abundance of interdisciplinary
scholarship from numerous other fields that is highly relevant, this review will draw from
much of such literature as well. In some instances, the scholarship outside LIS addresses
the direct concerns of this research and therefore, the purpose here will also be to
summarize this and clarify how these disparate bodies of work have helped inform this
dissertation. This interdisciplinarity is typical of most Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)
scholarship, and this dissertation will also advocate for such an approach.
This literature review will be organized into the following broad sections: 2.1)
The Iraq War in LIS; 2.2) General Iraq War Literature; 2.3) Information and Media
Landscape – which offers a survey of the literature that has dealt with questions
concerning the role of the media in U.S. politics and media performance in the Iraq War;
2.4) Dominant Themes and Discourses – which gives a survey of some of the CDA
studies of media coverage of the Iraq War highlighting the predominant discourses and
themes that have been found to be present by other scholars; and 2.5) Summary.

26

A great deal of the non-LIS studies originate in the discipline of mass
communications, however, this review will also bring together research that has
addressed the topic at hand in the fields of political science, history, military and defense
studies, critical studies and rhetoric. It is also in the final section of this review that I will
address other CDA studies about the media and the Iraq War. It is worth pointing out,
that CDA is as much a theoretical approach as it is a methodological approach. Therefore
the relevant CDA literature that forms the basis of the theoretical foundations of this
study has been addressed in Chapter Three, the bulk of which comes from the fields of
linguistics and socio-linguistics.

2.1 The Iraq War in LIS
One of the features of LIS scholarship on the Iraq War in general is a reluctance
to take a committed stand for or against the action that has been taken by the coalition
forces in Iraq regardless of the informational issue being discussed. Much of the LIS
scholarship does not address the controversies of the initial war, such as the rationale for
war, its questionable legality, the massive devastation, economic, human and cultural
costs, as well as the wider implications of instability in the region and loss of American
standing in the international arena. These are concerns of social justice which is
something that LIS scholars are keen to stress when it comes to issues such as
information access; at the same time, these issues require engagement with politics,
which runs against the dominant tradition of seeking neutrality that is so common in LIS
research. Instead, the focus of these studies is almost entirely on an academic concern of
one kind or another, whilst tactfully avoiding the slippery terrain of addressing the ethical

27

or moral consequences of the war. To a CDA approach this is problematic because
responsibility for the outcomes and consequences are central to the ending of the war and
crucial to the aims of redressing the injustice of the war.
Despite the existence of journals such as Progressive Librarian, which is
dedicated to critical scholarship and progressive politics, only a single research paper has
been published within it that addresses the Iraq War. This is not wholly surprising given
that in LIS, as in most other social sciences, there is a tradition of at least presenting an
academic impartiality and objectivity, with its roots in the positivist tradition of
enlightenment thought. However, this is precisely what theorists in CDA highlight as
non-critical scholarship that does little to address the wrongs or social injustices (in this
case of the consequences of war) and may even be faulted for preserving the status quo
and thereby perpetuating the injustice (see for example, Fairclough, 1992; van Dijk,
1995a).
A number of LIS articles on Iraq are concerned with the pertinent issue of cultural
heritage institutions such as libraries, museums, and archives damaged by war (Kam,
2004; Johnson, 2005; Edwards & Edwards, 2008; and Moustafa, 2013). Edwards and
Edwards (2008) illustrate the fractured national history of Iraq, and the forging of a
nation state based on colonial lines drawn up by the British government in 1920-21. The
authors demonstrate the critical role that cultural heritage institutions, and specifically the
Iraq National Library and Archive (INLA) and its director Saad Eskander continue to
play in the retention of a shared historical memory and fostering a national identity in the
aftermath of the 2003 invasion. Kam (2004), Johnson (2005) and Moustafa (2013) for
example, document the damage to Iraq’s cultural heritage in the form of fire and looting

28

but all three authors do not address the issue of responsibility for such destructives
consequences. For CDA scholars this is a crucial problem as the treatment of the topic of
destruction as naturally occurring without any agent, and the pretense of neutrality or
objectivity further entrenches such destruction as inevitable (for similar arguments see for
example, Fairclough, 1992b, p. 9; Gee, 2011, Rogers, 2011, p.4). The focus of these LIS
articles on the Iraq War remain on the practical problem of ensuring that there are proper
and effective disaster management plans in place for securing sites of cultural heritage
during times of war. Johnson (2005) asserts that the media tendency to report negative
news resulted in exaggerated claims of damage to Iraq’s cultural heritage sites following
the invasion and early occupation (p. 210). His article focuses largely on questioning the
veracity of various media accounts regarding the damage caused by war and like others,
he steers well-clear of the issue of examining the responsibility for the destruction caused
by the invasion, and instead offers suggestions for reconstruction and restoration not only
of the damaged sites themselves but of the informational professional workforce. Mustafa
(2013) bemoans the losses to the Iraqi National and Library Archives as a consequence of
the invasion but does not engage with questions of responsibility for initiating the
invasion in the first place nor the inevitable destruction to sites of archaeological and
cultural importance that happened as a consequence of the Coalition forces’ shock and
awe bombing campaigns. Similarly, Kam (2004) refers to the damage to Iraq’s ancient
collections and archaeological sites as a “cultural crisis” and calls on scholars and
librarians to provide creative solutions to mitigating the losses (p. 10).
A wider consequence of such academic discourse that does not directly engage
with the politics of the war is that it implicitly treats the issue of war as something that

29

just ‘happens’ and that the conditions of war are merely inherited or exist, rather than
being brought into existence through questionable policies such as ‘regime change’,
‘nation building’ or ‘pre-emptive war.’ Baker and Adriaensens (2012) who are not LIS
scholars but specialists on Iraq, argue that there is an obligation amongst journalists and
scholars to “counter the massive effort of the White House and the corporate media to
whitewash America’s deplorable legacy in Iraq.” (p. 269). This is a key concern for
critical discourse analysts and will be expanded on in Chapter Three.
Soyka and Wilczek (2014) in their study of challenges for archivists in military
record keeping, do offer a little more of a critical stance on the archival practices of the
military, specifically the need of an improvement in documenting military actions in Iraq
and Afghanistan in order to increase the transparency, accountability and public trust in
government actions. They also underline the importance of documenting the routines of
counterinsurgency and interactions with local populations, as this data can be utilized for
lessons learned and actionable intelligence (p. 183). Soyka and Wilczek also suggest that
the absence of well-kept records poses a significant challenge to veterans trying to claim
their medical benefits (2014, p. 191). Similar to the LIS research mentioned above, there
is an absence of criticism of the decision to go to war, the conduct in terms of U.S.
military actions in Iraq or a discussion of responsibility for the situation in Iraq. The
article remains focused narrowly on the information issues of accurate documentation
and knowledge capturing but bypasses a discussion of controversies such as the Jessica
Lynch “rescue” story or the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal. It could be argued that such
events have had an even bigger impact on the issues of transparency, accountability, and

30

public trust, and therefore the need to retain detailed information on these events is even
more important for collective memory and the historical record.
Another aspect of the Iraq War that has been addressed within the information
ethics literature in LIS are the implications of the broader War on Terror for civil
liberties, and particularly the impact on libraries and their patrons (see for example,
Hamilton, 2003; Brown, 2003; Chang, 2003). There has been a growing concern
expressed within the LIS discipline with regards to the erosion of privacy, the issues of
balancing national security concerns with protecting civil liberties. Although this
literature is not directly relevant to the control of information and discourse in the
media’s coverage of the Iraq War, it has been one of the key areas that LIS and related
scholarship has branched into (see for example Caidi & Ross (2005) who examine the
impact of government policies on citizens’ information rights). Hamilton (2003)
examines the consequences of the War on Terror for freedom of expression, including
highlighting the deliberate attempts attacks on alternative news websites such as Al
Jazeera English and Yellow Times (p. 200). There are generally numerous studies from
LIS and non-LIS scholars on intelligence and surveillance issues that have resulted from
key events in the War on Terror, such as the passage of the Patriot Act in 2001, and the
revelations of controversial events from the various theaters of the War on Terror
(including Iraq) published by organizations such as WikiLeaks and by whistleblowers
such as Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning) and the former National Security
Agency worker Edward Snowden.
Another important study about the Iraq War was conducted by Robbin and Buente
(2008). They examined the impact of internet information and communication on the

31

political behavior of nearly 1500 people drawn from a digital dialing survey by the Pew
Internet and American Life Project concerning how respondents obtained and used
information in the case of Iraq. Although the findings of the study where not directly
relevant to the central research enquires of this research, it is still important for two
principle reasons: 1) the authors point out that much of our understanding of political
information use comes from researchers outside LIS (p. 2211) and therefore propose
crossing disciplinary boundaries in order to borrow more robustly developed theoretical
models for understanding the effects of political information on behavior, especially from
the fields of political science and mass communications (p. 2224). And 2) their study
emphasizes the interlinked nature / parallel importance of the informational component
(e.g. digital libraries, newspapers, political news, etc.) and the communication component
(e.g. contacting political representative, engaging in online political conversation, sharing
information, etc.) (p. 2115). In other words, information is contextually dependent on
communication, and communication is situated within an informational context. This
connection between information and journalism, has also been examined by Rusciano
(2005) who raises the informational dilemma that journalists face between the public’s
right to know and “knowing what is right” from a moral point of view, even if it
undermines the war effort (p. 8). Despite his research appearing in the Progressive
Librarian journal, Rusciano himself is not an LIS scholar. This study also views
information as intertwined with politics and communication, and political information as
an important site for LIS research.

32

2.2 General Literature on the Iraq War
Since the events of September 11, 2001, there has been an exponential growth in
research related to U.S. foreign policy and geopolitics, concerning areas such as the postCold War role of the U.S. in global affairs as the sole superpower and the threat of
terrorism. The study of contemporary international politics and events such as the global
War on Terror have drawn scholars from many different disciplines, and it is useful to
draw from the extensive body of work when it comes to studying the Iraq War as the war
was initiated within the broader context of the War on Terror and justified on the same
grounds. Furthermore, the events surrounding the War on Terror have profound
consequences for the nature of democracy for American citizens with the erosion of civil
liberties and expansion of state surveillance powers being two such areas. In addition, the
War on Terror due its global scale has an ongoing impact on international security, the
security of many countries, and most profoundly on the populations of the regions chosen
as theatres of war. Thus, the subject of the War on Terror has inspired almost an industry
of academic, historical and popular books dealing with multiple facets of this eradefining conflict.
This section also briefly reviews literature dealing with the key phases of the Iraq
War including making the case for war, the initial invasion, the occupation before turning
explicitly to the literature that deals with the ending of the Iraq War and its legacy. It is
especially necessary to examine the literature dealing with the different phases of the
ending of the war as this is the central focus of this dissertation and will also shed light on
the dominant discourse within each phase.

33

With regards to the media role in the ending of the Iraq War, Obama, the Media
and Framing the U.S. Exit from Iraq and Afghanistan by Erika G. King (2014) is the
most comprehensive study examining various aspects of the exit strategy and media
coverage. King examines President Obama’s speeches and how the media reported these,
with the objective of firstly, demonstrating the thematic evolution of the narratives
deployed by Obama; secondly, the extent to which these narratives fit the War on Terror
frame established by the Bush administration; and thirdly to evaluate the level of reliance
on the foundational myth of American exceptionalism to undergird Obama’s
interpretations of the outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan (King, 2014, p. 15). Although
King’s work is not a traditional CDA approach, there are important elements to it such as
the observation of dominant themes and narratives in the media; these elements make it
highly relevant to any study on ending of the Iraq War and her work will be referenced at
various points in this review.

2.2.1 Defining Terrorism
Determining meanings in language is central to discourse analysis and the phrase
‘War on Terror’ perfectly exemplifies the importance of definitions, discourse
parameters, interpretive frameworks and narratives. To begin with, there is no
international consensus on a legal definition of terrorism and nearly every researcher in
this area highlights the problematic nature of confining it to a single definition (Tuman,
2003: 1). There are many competing definitions but when it comes to labelling groups as
terrorists, this is a special right that governments have the power to exercise to determine
which types of opponents are terrorists or not. According to Solomon (1999), there is an

34

Orwellian logic behind defining terrorism; as bombings by Third World countries are
defined as terrorism while bombings by the U.S. are virtuous strikes against terror (cited
in Rothe & Muzzatti, 2004: 331). This point illustrates the highly subjective nature of
defining terrorism and has led Townshend (2002) to remind us that designating a group
or opposition as ‘terrorists’ is merely a way of labelling as the word ‘terrorist’ is not a
description that groups or individuals self-apply (p. 3). Labelling opponents in this way
implicates them of criminality and disregard for human life. Rothe and Muzzatti (2004)
echo this point arguing that the reason for the definitional quagmire is that
conceptualizing terrorism is difficult due to the pejorative connotations of the term, its
subjective nature, and that it is dependent on political power (p.331). Karim adds that the
term terrorist is merely a label applied by those in power, stating that the “political
violence of those who seek to upset the status quo is characterised as terrorism” (2002, p.
104). These debates reflect the contested terrain and problematic nature of the terms
terrorist and terrorism.
It is important to bear in mind, historically, struggles for the end of now widely
considered inhumane practices such as freedom from imperial rule, the right to selfdetermination, the end to slavery, the end to apartheid or segregation, or legalized
discrimination, the end of occupation by foreign troops, etc. began with some kind of
violent opposition and disorder aimed at those in power. In many social movements
throughout different historical periods, governments opposing them had labelled
segments of the struggles or supporters of the movements as terrorists, agitators,
troublemakers, or criminals (see for example Chaliand & Blin’s (2007) edited collection
of The history of terrorism: From antiquity to al Qaeda for detailed examples from

35

various social movements in history that began with some form of violence but later
gained legitimacy). Labelling is therefore a critically powerful tool used by governments
to preserve their own legitimacy or the legitimacy of an injustice or legal framework of
injustice (Michaels 2013, p. 119). Furthermore, the importance of establishing labels
within existing cultural contexts is critical to ensuring the wider public is able to place the
story.
Specifically, there are pre-existing frames of reference such as the doctrine of
American Exceptionalism which permeates American society that politicians from both
parties draw upon when framing foreign policy issues. American exceptionalism is an
informal but deeply entrenched ideology that endows Americans with the faith in a
special destiny amongst nations, a belief that American wars are noble, with Americans
always positioned on the right side of history, therefore casting conflict as a struggle
between the forces of good and evil rather than incompatible national interests is the
norm (King, 2014, p. 5; Patman, 2006, p. 964).
Aside from the use of the term ‘terrorist’ to label undesirables, others such as
Schaffert (1992) focus on the role of the media in turning violence or criminality into
terrorism through its power to transmit fear. He argues that “without the media there is no
terror, only murder and mayhem (Schaffert, 1992, p. 47). Tuman (2003) and Altheide
(2003, p. 43) also stress the role of the media, asserting that the meaning of terrorism is
socially constructed and communicated through the media. However, even in the case of
the War on Terror, it is not just the state that describes opponents as terrorists as these
labels have also been widely adopted in Western media outlets, leading some to argue
that there is a strong undercurrent of Orientalist discourse (Said, 1978), where a great

36

deal of media analysis has privileged a clash of civilizations discourse (Kellner, 2004, pp.
144-45).
However, what constitutes terrorism is usually dependent on specific acts being
labelled as such by governments, and the news media play an important role in
reinforcing such designations. The term terrorist is used to describe politically motivated
violence instead of alternative descriptors such as ‘political violence,’ ‘state violence,’
‘aggression,’ or ‘protest.’ The War on Terror framework has been widely adopted as an
interpretive construct within news discourse on the Iraq War to help audiences make
sense of the need for invasion and occupation. The media reliance on this framework
reflects the influence of the government in news discourses as it has monopolizing power
to designate the label ‘terrorist’ in order to justify its own policies. Hodges’ (2011) book
The “War on Terror” Narrative demonstrates how this discourse has been constructed
with a view to reflect a certain sociopolitical reality and his relevant findings will be
revisited throughout this review.

2.2.2 The War on Terror as an Interpretive Construct
Here, I draw attention to the literature that sheds light on the phrase ‘War on
Terror’ itself as an interpretive framework that has been influential in how the Iraq War
has been presented officially as well as how it has been represented in the mainstream
media, including the newspapers chosen for this study.
Hodges (2007a) in his study of narrative has identified six narrative ‘events’ that
constitute the ‘War on Terror’ and give the moniker its lasting interpretative value. These
include, 1) the introduction of a global War on Terror (GWOT); 2) naming 9/11 as the

37

precipitating event; 3) the Afghanistan War as the ‘first’ battle in the GWOT; 4) an
ongoing discussion of GWOT fought on many fronts; 5) talk of the ‘battle’ of Iraq; 6) a
recap of the precipitating event and long term commitment to continue the war (p. 69).
Some have commented on the inaccuracy of presenting Iraq as part of a terror narrative,
something that many officials within the Bush administration continued to do in the run
up to the invasion (King, 2014, p. 22). Regardless of its inaccuracy and lack of evidence
of an Iraq and al-Qaeda connection, the GWOT narrative became a cultural narrative that
was “common sense” to many Americans in their understanding of 9/11 and especially
during the early years of the war (Hodges, 2007a, 2007b; 2011). Hodges’ deconstruction
of the phrase ‘War on Terror’ demonstrates the discursive achievements of the Bush
administration as the phrase itself characterized 9/11 as an act of war and created a
dichotomy between ‘us’ – the good, innocent, peace and freedom loving people and
‘them’ – the bad, evil, freedom-hating terrorists. With such an understanding, there is
limited room for diplomacy or negotiation with the enemy, and war becomes the
naturalized response (also supported by findings from King & Wells, 2009). We shall
revisit the discursive achievements of the War on Terror discourse and how it operates as
a Foucauldian discourse – that is, one that regulates how the subject can be dealt with.
King (2014) also found that the War on Terror construct was not contested by
either political party or the media, and the Bush administration had been successful in the
establishment of this discourse. King concludes that despite competing narratives being
presented by President Obama about the American legacy in Iraq, these were not as
successful in being widely adopted by the media as the ‘War on Terror’ master narrative
had been (2014, p. 185). Lewis and Reese (2009) in a study interviewing journalists from

38

USA Today about the War on Terror framework found that it “remains a powerful
organizing principle…[and ] the meta-frame not only shapes much of foreign and
domestic policy, but also defines the terms of debate, hedging public and media discourse
within its framework.” (p. 96). The War on Terror narrative has remained intact, largely
unquestioned, and a dominant interpretative framework for the war Iraq and the larger
fight against terrorism. Similar findings have been reported by Karim (2002), who studies
journalism as a cultural practice and found there was uncritical acceptance of the War on
Terror frame in the media that polarized the conflict as a struggle between good and evil
(p. 106).
Some scholars are heavily critical of a War on Terror as it overlooks terrorism as
a tactic and not an end in itself, but rather a symptom and reaction against what are
perceived injustices such as the expansion of neo-liberalist hegemony in the Third World
(for example, Hasmi, 2014;). Romaya (2012) also argues that it is not possible to wage a
War on Terror, nor win one, as it is not possible to eradicate international terrorism
through war itself (p. 111). In this study, a close textual analysis of the newspapers
selected will also illuminate the salience of this key narrative in how newspapers gave
meaning to the ending of the war.

2.2.3 The Case for War and the Initial Invasion
The International Journal of Contemporary Iraqi Studies provides critical
perspectives on various aspects of the Iraq War, including media coverage, and is
therefore an important scholarly arena for research on Iraq. It is the Bush administration’s
rhetoric and the media coverage of the initial justification for war that has received the

39

most attention in terms of the Iraq War literature. Various scholars have written of the
Orwellian logic behind the rationale for war, (Najjar, 2014; Lazar & Lazar, 2007;
Kellner, 2004, 2005; Kalsi, 2008). Najjar (2014) has written about how frequently the
terms ‘peace’, ‘liberty’, ‘freedom’, were used to justify the war in the American media (p.
19), where the war was presented as a war for peace; the destruction of Iraq’s
infrastructure was for humanitarian purposes; and the large number of civilian deaths
would produce a healthy democracy and freedom. Lazar and Lazar (2007) refer to this
recasting of violence as moral and justified as a strategy of re-lexicalization, where war is
placed as a necessary precursor to peace (p. 58) and in their examination of the speeches
of three presidents (H. W. Bush, Clinton, and G.W. Bush), found this to be a running
theme throughout. Such frames although widely utilized in the mainstream media, Najjar
argues were not persuasive in the middle-east (2014, p. 29).
It is necessary to understand the Iraq War within the War on Terror narrative that
was utilized as the primary framework for understanding the rationale for the Iraq War.
There is general consensus that regime change in Iraq was an important foreign policy
goal for the Bush administration (Holsti, 2011; McClellan, 2008, p. 126). Throughout
both Presidential terms of Bush, the rhetoric emphasized Iraq as a key battleground in the
War on Terror (King, 2014).
An important study of public reactions to the war by Feldman, Huddy, and
Marcus’ (2015) concludes that in the run up to the war, there was cross party consensus
of the Bush initiative for war, and that most of the media (including The New York Times
and The Washington Post, and most television media) supported and amplified the
administration’s case for war. They do however point out that there was greater anti-war

40

or neutral war coverage amongst newspapers compared to television news, and a greater
skepticism about the war expressed in USA Today, as well as amongst the Knight Ridder
Papers such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, Detroit Free Press, Miami Herald, San Jose
Mercury News and others. Nevertheless, the authors also conclude that the elite press
(The New York Times and The Washington Post) were more likely to echo the message of
the administration than local papers (p. 101); and antiwar sentences within news stories
by elite papers expressed relatively mild opposition whereas sentences that supported the
administration were strongly supportive (p. 90).
After the media coverage on the lead up to war, another widely studied aspect of
the war has been the initial invasion and various key events in the subsequent occupation
have also garnered a great deal of scholarly attention. A number of military strategists
and experts have blamed the lack of progress after the 2003 invasion on poor postconflict planning; and lack of cultural knowledge about Iraq’s demography (for example,
see Hooker & Collins, 2015a, 2015b; Collins, 2015; Lamb & Franco, 2015).
The period of occupation also involved a series of events that brought the legality
of the war as well as the moral justification into even sharper focus, particularly the large
number of civilian deaths, the lack of security and protection, the Abu Ghraib prisoner
torture and abuse scandal, the dubious ‘rescue’ of Private Jessica Lynch, and the use of
indiscriminate arrests, raids and detentions by the coalition forces. Hagen, Kaiser and
Hanson (2015) cite these reasons and the fear generated amongst ordinary Iraqis as a
result, for why many turned to Sunni or Shia insurgent groups for protection (p. 96). They
provide harrowing accounts of interviews with Iraqis who were victims of occupying
forces or sectarian violence, but also point out that the American media has been vague

41

when it comes to reporting the brutality of the war experience. (p. 61). However,
numerous studies of the media covering the rationale for war have shown that although
unfavorable views of the Bush administration began to surface, the overarching
framework for a War on Terror was never brought into question by journalists or senior
members of the Democratic Party (King, 2014, p. 13).
Another key event in the Iraq War that has received significant attention from
scholars of media and political rhetoric alike is the success of the troop surge in 2007.
King (2014) found that by 2007, although the mood in the press and amongst Democrats
was critical of the situation in Iraq, the troop surge was put forth as the brainchild of
General Petraeus and criticism of his approach would be considered as an attack on the
military (p. 27). King (2014) also found that the strong Democratic opposition to the
troop surge was primarily a disagreement over strategy, but the discussion took place
within the hegemonic discourse of the War on Terror, and that the larger framework was
not brought into question by Democrats or the press (p. 28). As mentioned, by this time
the media had become more critical of the Bush administration policies in Iraq and the
surge strategy received more criticism in the media as well, particularly in The New York
Times and The Washington Post (King, 2014, pp. 30-31). King’s study showed that by
the Fall of 2007, with reports of declining violence, The Washington Post had become
more positive about improving security conditions and that by the middle of 2008, the
media were back ‘on board’ with the administration about the importance of Iraq in the
fight against terrorism (King, 2014, p. 32). King concludes that despite the success of the
Bush administration in getting the media on side, the public’s fundamental attitudes about

42

the war did not change (King, 2014, p. 38). Throughout this period and up until the
Presidential debates, neither Obama nor McCain questioned the War on Terror frame.
Michaels (2013) found that the discourse around the surge as a success became
widely adopted by politicians and the media because the media ignored the split within
the Sunni insurgents and al-Qaeda, as well as Sunni calls for a ceasefire out of fear of
being ethnically cleansed by Shia militias. (pp. 154-55). This once again illustrates the
power of language and controlling discourse in managing perceptions and constructing
social reality. Chapters Three and Four will show the way in which CDA can be used to
demonstrate how this is discursively achieved in more detail.
Various scholars have provided some analysis of the change in the U.S.
government’s approach to Iraq following the election of Obama. On the whole, there is
general consensus that there was some divergence in the approach to the War on Terror,
and specifically with regards to Iraq (see for example, Lansford & Covarrubias, 2012;
King, 2014). Obama wanted to shift attention back to Afghanistan and argued Iraq was
not the key battleground for the War on Terror. (Obama, 2009). One of the key changes
in Obama’s rhetoric was to redefine a War on Terror in narrower terms, and usually to
identify specific conflicts. The change in rhetoric has also been observed by other
scholars including Katz, 2012; King, 2014; and Hodges, 2011. Terry (2013) in his study
of Obama’s rhetoric and policy found that despite some policy differences and change in
rhetoric between Obama’s approach and that of the neo-cons that dominated the Bush
administration, there was not much change in terms of the general U.S. policy in the
middle-east (p. 52).

43

An interesting consideration when examining newspaper performance is the
nationality of the readers of newspapers. As mentioned, the strength of patriotic feeling in
the United States following 9/11 was extremely high (Eisman, 2003), as was support for
the invasion of Iraq amongst the public and press. This was not however the case in other
countries such as Germany and China who were not involved in the war, and where
newspapers were subsequently far more critical in their coverage and focused on
alternative motivations for war (see for example, Yang, 2008; or Herber & Filak, 2007).
The extent to which the lack of critical journalism in the U.S. in the lead up to the
invasion cannot purely be down to the nationality of journalists because in the U.K.
(which committed the second largest combat troops to Iraq in the coalition), the
mainstream broadsheet newspapers offered more variety of opinion than in the U.S., with
the Guardian and The Independent both taking more critical stances of the war and The
Daily Telegraph and The Times supporting it (Kalsi, 2008). However, the sense of
commitment to one’s own group and pressure of community values was found to be a
concern amongst journalists in one survey of American journalists which raises further
questions of the extent to which impartiality is possible (Mackay, 2012, p. 33).

2.2.4 The Ending of the War
As highlighted in the introductory chapter, the ending of the Iraq War and
analysis of media coverage of its end has not received as much scholarly attention as the
earlier phases of the war. This is in part due to the war officially having ended fairly
recently, but also because of the ongoing sense of war that persists in Iraq long after the
troop surge and declarations of an end by President Obama in 2010 and 2011. However,

44

it is the discourse constructed around war’s denouement that provides an interpretive
framework for understanding the construction of meaning of the ending of the war as
well as an assessment of whether the outcomes were successful or not, and worthwhile.
Studying the news media constructions of success and failure in the outcomes of the Iraq
gives this study its novelty amongst the existing scholarship.

2.2.4.1 End of Combat Mission – Bush, 2003
There is limited scholarship specifically about the legacy of the Iraq War in May
2003 as a point of ending in the war as it became evidently clear not long after President
Bush’s May 1, 2003 ‘Mission Accomplished’ speech that the situation in Iraq was
deteriorating far more rapidly than anyone in the White House had anticipated. In
general, the scholarship here is part of the same body of literature that deals with the
initial invasion period and is quite critical of the government and media. Joseph J. Collins
(2015) at the National Defense University still refers to the initial invasion as a success
but admits there was a lack of planning for the insurgency that resisted the occupation. (p.
58). This view is echoed by other strategists such as Hoffman and Crowther (2015).
Hayden (2009) who examines in detail the Bush administration’s relationship with the
media, writes that Bush’s premature celebration badly lacerated the White House in the
long run, especially because of the dramatic spectacle and triumphant tone of the speech
(delivered atop the USS Abraham Lincoln) (pp. 130-1). He goes on to stay that the
administrations campaign of disinformation in cases such as the staging of Iraqis pulling
down Saddam Hussein’s statue or the deceptions of Ahmed Chalabi eventually
discredited the administration (Hayden, 2009, p. 136). Scott McClellan (2008), the

45

former press secretary for President Bush, recalled in his memoir, that in his role as press
secretary, the priority was to protect the image of the President and administration and
the administration “short-circuited debate over the necessity for war in Iraq and chose
instead to turn it into the subject of a massive marketing blitz. (p. 249). This dissertation
will re-visit the discourse of the press at the time of this ‘first’ ending of the Iraq War to
ascertain what kind of meaning was constructed about the conflict given such aims of the
Bush administration to emphasize a successful end to the conflict.

2.2.4.2 End of Military Combat – Obama, 2010
King (2014) argues that Obama changed his narrative of criticism of the Iraq War
in 2008 and brought it more in line with Bush (p. 3). Obama had made clear that his
administration intended to de-escalate the war in Iraq and re-focus resources on
Afghanistan. Media interest in Iraq had also been declining with the global economic
crisis of 2008 getting more coverage. In February 2009, Obama laid out his exit strategy
to end the combat mission in Iraq by August 31, 2010. (Obama, 2009). In the same
speech he also re-iterated the successful completion of the job in Iraq, stating “We sent
our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein – and you got the job done. We kept
our troops to help establish a sovereign government – and you got the job done. And we
will leave the Iraqi people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life – that is
your achievement; that is the prospect you have made possible.” (Obama, 2009). King
found that from the point in time when Obama assumed office, to the withdrawal of
troops from Iraq, there were five interrelated themes that were consistently present in his
rhetoric. 1) The U.S. had fulfilled its responsibilities in Iraq; 2) U.S. troops served with

46

honor and met with success; 3) the war’s benefits outweighed the costs; 4) It was
necessary to re-focus on the real security threat of terrorism in Afghanistan; 5) Iraq was
now able to achieve its democratic destiny. (King, 2014, p. 128). The analysis conducted
for this dissertation will draw from King’s findings by examining the extent to which
such themes dominated newspaper discourses concerning the ending of the war, and
could therefore shed light on whether news discourses reproduce or challenge such
presentations of the outcomes of the war.

2.2.4.3 Full Withdrawal of Troops – Obama, 2011
Many commentators who have studied the war feel that the principle reasons for
failure to implement a functioning democracy in Iraq were the sectarian divisions
amongst the Sunni, Shia and Kurdish populations of Iraq (for example, Katz, 2012;
Collins, 2015; Hagen, Kaiser, & Hanson, 2015). To what extent did the selected
newspapers focus on such explanations for ongoing problems in Iraq? Prior to the full
withdrawal and earlier declarations of victory, there had been various landmark events
such as the capture and trial of Hussein and the death of al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu
Musab al-Zarqawi in 2006, and the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, all at the
time were heralded as victories in the war but as Katz (2012) points out, the death of bin
Laden for example, was noteworthy for its lack of impact in ameliorating the War on
Terror (p. 108).
Obama’s speech on December 14th, 2011 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina to
American troops stated: “we’re leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq,
with a representative government that was elected by its people…This is an extraordinary

47

achievement, nearly nine years in the making.” (Obama, 2011b). King (2014) in her
analyses of various White House speeches and statements asserts that the careful
selection of information and subsequent presentation of reality was designed specifically
to promote a particular understanding of the story of the Iraq War (p. 3). However, King
(2014) also found that there was still caution to declaring complete victory in Obama’s
rhetoric but that there was emphasis on positive achievements of freedom, democracy
and progress – core American values that were comforting to the public (p. 141).
Obama’s Iraq War narrative was firmly entrenched in the notion of American
exceptionalism, tying the purpose of the Iraq War to the U.S. self-image of promoting the
cause of human rights and democracy globally (King, 2014, p. 142). In his speeches there
was muted criticism of the Bush administration’s legacy in Iraq and scant mention of the
existing deteriorating conditions in Iraq. However, King found that the media outlets
“constructed their own, more foreboding narrative” about the war at its conclusion.
(2014, p. 144).
News organizations, including The New York Times and The Washington Post,
highlighted the inadequacies of the Obama narrative whilst praising U.S. fighting forces.
Specifically, counter news discourses emerged concerning the aftermath in Iraq, the
effect on the image of the U.S., and the war’s meaning and legacy (King, 2014, p. 149).
However, King also found that once the withdrawal of troops had been announced, media
interest in the U.S. legacy in Iraq virtually disappeared (2014, p. 187). This study seeks to
build upon King’s findings using the CDA methodology by investigating additional
sources such as The Wall Street Journal and USA Today which are excluded from her
study.

2.2.5 Iraq War Legacy
Chapter one elaborated on some of the physical destruction of Iraq’s
infrastructure as well as civilian casualties and deaths resulting from the war, therefore,
this section will focus on the narratives put forth by the Obama administration and media
to represent the legacy of the war. King (2014) found that Obama’s rhetoric downplayed
the ongoing problems caused by the destruction of war and instead focused on looking
positively at the future, emphasizing the removal of Hussein as a success, and the fall in
violence since the troop surge in 2007 (p. 134).
Raymond Baker, an international specialist on the Arab and Islamic world as well
as a critical scholar, views the Iraq War as a “carefully calculated and lucrative war
crime” (2015, p. 89). He draws attention to the ways in which regime change and nation
building creates opportunities for profit, arguing that ‘winning’ a war is not the most
important objective as ‘lost’ wars can be profitable too. (Baker, 2015, p. 87; see also
Baker & Adriaensens, 2012; Terry, 2013). He points out that “service contracts over the
course of the war totalled some 138 billion dollars” (p. 88); this is an aspect of the
discourse of war that will be investigated when examining the coverage of the selected
newspapers, as the overwhelming majority of mass media coverage did not address this
facet of the war at its outset.
At the time of the initial invasion, there were calls amongst the anti-War
movement that the aggressive approach to the War on Terror, and particularly the
invasion of Iraq and the destabilization that that would ensue would result in fueling
Islamist extremism. This is a thesis supported by Baker (2015); Chernus (2006); and
Ramazani (2013). Iraqis in general have experienced a great deal of trauma, even prior to

49

the invasion, including from the authoritarian regime of Saddam Hussein as well as from
the economic hardships inflicted through 13 years of sanctions. The median age is 20.9
(Ismael & Ismael, 2013, p. 142) and youths make up 40 per cent of the population
(Bowring, 2011). Youth vulnerability and the appeal of extremist groups are likely to be
highest amongst young men who have had little opportunity and never experienced life
without sanctions or war (Ismael & Ismael, 2013, p. 142). This study will elaborate on
any media commentary on Iraq’s future and the potential for democratic participation in
the political process, as this is one of the outcomes of the war that President Obama was
keen to emphasize.
Much of the literature on the post-war situation in Iraq dealing with the aftermath
of the war has also drawn attention to the plight of women (for example, Al-Ali, 2005),
children and minorities. For example, Bowring (2011) argues that the fate of Iraq’s
diverse population (minorities include significant communities of Armenians, Baha’is,
Black Iraqis, Chaldo-Assyrians, Circassians, Faili Kurds, Jews, Kaka’I, Palestinians,
Roma, Sabian Mandaeans, Shabaks, Turkmen and Yazidis) is uncertain and in peril. The
growing sectarian divisions emerging since the invasion (Selim, 2012, pp. 63-4) reflected
not only in the Interim Governing Council (IGC) but by the force of various militias is
likely to exacerbate the plight of minorities. Others have documented the ‘cleansing’ of
Baghdad’s mixed neighborhoods which were once diverse but are now Shia occupied
(Hagen, Kaiser & Hanson, 2015, p. 112). Given some of the findings of these studies, it is
important to examine the extent to which the dominant discourses of the media contained
or reflected such outcomes.

50

Another outcome of the Iraq War has been avoiding a military defeat but at
enormous cost to U.S. international standing as a result of controversies over torture,
undermining civil liberties at home (Foot, 2004, p. 6; Chang, 2003), as well as the
economic and human costs of the war (Baker & Adriaensens 2012, p. 266). Selim (2012)
in his study of the impact of the invasion on the process of democratization in Iraq also
found that Arab distrust of the U.S. remains high (p. 60) and the process of
democratization has been set back. This study will also examine the extent to which the
information contained in the newspapers reported on the debate surrounding the
repercussions for the U.S. image abroad.
There is also an emerging array of scholarship that is beginning to assess the
current conditions in Iraq, the prospects for democratization and other potential
consequences, not only for Iraq but for the Arab world in general. Selim (2012) argues
that the war has set back the prospects of democratization, and that despite the rhetoric
about bringing democracy to Iraq, the U.S. continued to provide financial and military
support to autocratic regimes in Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and others, as the
democratic movements would be likely to bring about anti-Western groups as happened
in the case of Muslim Brothers in Egypt in 2005 and Hamas in Palestine in 2006 (p. 75)
(similar views are echoed by Katz, 2012, p. 114; and Hashmi, 2014;). Some observers
had argued that the Arab Spring movements were a reflection of the growing desire for
democracy inspired by the success in Iraq but Selim points out that both Bush and
Obama’s administrations had continued to support Ben-Ali in Tunisia and Mubarak in
Egypt, until it became clear that the regimes were collapsing (2012, p. 81). Such actions
bring the U.S. commitment to democracy into question; as Romaya (2012) points out, for

51

a democracy to be authentic, it must reflect the values of the culture in which it arises (p.
3). It is therefore important to examine the news media’s congruence with this narrative
of U.S. commitment to freedom and democracy, both of which were central arguments to
justifying the war even after no WMD were found in Iraq.

2.3 Information and Media Landscape
The mass media are the primary mechanism by which information, especially
information on foreign affairs reaches the public. This section deals with the
informational component of this war, namely the control of information, information as
the key battlefront in this war, and an overview of the media’s coverage. This section also
presents competing theories on the social power of mass media, a brief look at competing
elite theory models of media influence, how news agendas are set, and an examination of
the scholarship of journalism in the War on Terrorism.

2.3.1 The Role of the Media in General: an Overview
Central to the modern conceptualization of democracy is the role of a free press
and media that acts as a watchdog against abuse of government and corporate power.
Access to information and news is essential for there to be an informed citizenry or for
consumers to make informed choices. As Michael McCurry, former press secretary for
Clinton noted, “the adversarial relationship” between the press and administration is
critical for a meaningful civil discourse (quoted in Hess & Kalb, 2003, p. 46).
McChesney (1999), Carey (2002) and others view journalism as a public service and
have lamented the increasing commercialization of news at the expense of democracy;

52

they argue that the for-profit model for journalism views news as a consumer product at
the mercy of economic forces. Just like any other consumer product, the news product
must be made appealing to consumers in an increasingly fragmented marketplace and this
often occurs at the expense of high standards of journalism. If anything, the digital age
has led to greater competition and placed greater pressure on media companies to make
news more entertaining in order to retain audiences, again resulting in a decline in the
quality of investigative journalism (see for example Picard, 2004; Kitty, 2005). However,
it is also worth bearing in mind that regardless of the type of ‘product’ that news is, it is
still a product, that is produced by a certain industry with its own economic constraints,
and produced by organizations that are not ideologically neutral.
Another central concern to media scholars that advocate for a freer and more
independent media is the concern of media ownership being concentrated in few hands.
For example, “in1983, fifty companies together controlled 90 percent of American
media; in 2011 the corresponding number of companies was six.” (Baum & Potter, 2015,
p. 229). Proffitt (2007) in her study focusing on Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation
(News Corp.) of which Dow Jones which owns The Wall Street Journal was a part, found
there was a lack of contestation of official reasoning in the lead up to the Iraq War and
concludes that the marketplace of ideas is dominated by a corporate ideology that stunts
public discussion through controlling information dissemination (pp.66-68). Bagdikian
(2004) and McChesney (1999, 2005) have reached similar conclusions about the structure
of media ownership. Bagdikian (2004) compares the top five media conglomerates (Time
Warner, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Viacom, and Bertelsmann) to a
cartel, who although in competition with each other, all seek to expand beyond

53

dominance in a single medium which further narrows the diversity of information
available (pp.3-4). McChesney thus concludes that “the global media system is better
understood as one that advances corporate and commercial interests and values and
denigrates or ignores that which cannot be incorporated into its mission.” (2005, p.95).
The extent to which the media and a better informed public could have altered the
course of the war is questionable, as the public has limited influence in foreign affairs
policy (Holsti, 2011, p. 181). An influential study by Gilens and Page (2014) concluded
(as have many others before this study) that the state of U.S. democracy was jeopardized
as most citizens had almost no influence over government policy, and that economic
elites and interest groups had far greater power shaping policy, making the U.S. system
more a plutocracy with some democratic institutions and features (pp. 576-7). Such
studies do reflect a dangerous state of affairs and the weakening of democratic
representation if the public’s ability to impact policy formation is reduced to almost
nothing. Furthermore, even in countries like the U.K., Italy and Spain, where there was
unambiguous opposition to involvement in the Iraq War, the media still failed in altering
government policy (Baum & Potter, 2015, p. 16). News is only one factor within the
media that impacts beliefs and behaviors; there are of course other institutions (for
example schools as well as entertainment organizations) that influence and structure
discourses.
Jensen (2005) argues that at the heart of the uncritical coverage in the lead up to
the Iraq War and the early years of the occupation, was patriotism amongst journalists,
which he argues undermines American democracy (p. 67). There is the glaring conflict
between the professional practices of fairness, balance and objectivity which results in

54

journalists typically avoiding pronouncements about their own personal political beliefs,
yet an open patriotism which makes questionable any claims to neutrality (Jensen, 2005,
p. 80; see also, Hess & Kalb, 2003, Ch. 10; Allan & Zelizer, 2004; Waisbord, 2002). This
however, also fits into what Sonwalker (2004) argues is a socio-cultural binary of “us”
and “them” which on a fundamental level determines how journalists cover news stories.
Hayden acknowledges that media failed in their watchdog duty but says American news
organizations were “snookered into supporting the rationale for going to war.” (2009, p.
111). The CDA conducted in this dissertation seeks to elevate the underlying ideologies
that are operating within the news discourse, and will therefore also be able to determine
the extent to which the four newspapers embraced patriotism in their coverage. This is
something that CDA studies of media seek to demonstrate through a dissection of various
linguistic devices and the language used in coverage; how this is done will be addressed
more fully in the Chapters Three and Four.
Within media scholarship, there are a wide variety of theories that seek to explain
how media function, operate and ultimately influence mass opinion. The purpose here is
to focus on the informational component of the media, that is, the role of the media to
mediate, communicate, produce, and re-produce information, knowledge, and ideologies.
Speaking of its functions, Fuchs (2005) writes: “The mass media don’t map objective
reality, but construct social realities that distort objective reality due to the subjective
views, interests, and complex relationships that are contained in this [media] system.” (p.
191). In others words there is no neutral ground to stand on when it comes to the
production (or indeed consumption) of news commodities. It is the purpose of CDA to

55

demonstrate how such realities are discursively achieved and what the implications of
these informational realities are for material reality.

2.3.2 Informational Battlefront
The concept of a post-industrial society8 was popularized in 1973 by Daniel Bell
in his influential book, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. For Bell, it is a society in
which the socio-economic structure is reconfigured from being a goods producing society
to one in which the production of information and knowledge take precedent. The
predominant industrialized structure characterized by the manufacture and trade of
physical goods is transcended by a structure that is driven by the centrality of information
and knowledge as primary commodities. The ubiquity of information in our lives have
led many to term the current age as a truly ‘information age’, as our lives in the modern
world are saturated with the production and consumption of information. However, this
incessant flow of information is not value free, “we are constantly subjected to, as well as
in control of a plethora of technological and medial informational flows that both
construct and transfer ideologies between ourselves, our information providers, and our
target audiences.” (Johnson & Enslin, 2007, p. 11)
Information and knowledge are increasingly viewed as commodities in the
information economy, since these are utilized in a way to gain competitive advantage,
and many of the dominant global industries such as banking, accountancy, legal services,
‘trade’ expertise and knowledge. If as mentioned above, news is subject to the forces of
supply and demand, and is increasingly commodified as many have argued (McChesney
8

The terms digital age, information age, network society or knowledge society are also often used
interchangeably in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Communications literature to describe a
post-industrial society.

56

1999; Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011; Fuchs 2005), it is then necessary to expand
on the effect this has on our conceptualization of news as a public good. Others have said
that as citizens are treated more and more like consumers, the consumer-citizen’s own
demand for “McNuggets of information for easy digestion” (Artz, 2005, p. 19) also needs
to be considered as it has an obvious impact in terms of quality and depth of news.
In addition to the ubiquity of information, the informational battlefront fits well
with Baudrillard’s (1981/1994) simulacrum concept, which posited that society had
advanced to a stage whereby signs or models of what is real substitute for reality itself.
The signs are the language and images transmitted through the media to consumers
(readers and viewers) who are physically removed from the reality, of war for example.
Keeble (2004) refers to the key function of media in manufacturing war as the “mediamilitary-industrial complex” (p. 46). All the images transmitted through the media, and
the rhetoric of the war used by leaders and re-produced through the media, create a
certain discourse and perception of war. In the Iraq War (2003-2011), McLaren and
Martin (2004) in their exploratory study of the dialectical relationship between the
domestic policy and War on Terror during the first Bush administration, also found there
to be media complicity in giving ideological oxygen to the Bush administration’s
message on the war with Iraq and this they deduce amounted to domestic psyop
(psychological operations) (p. 287). It can be deduced that perception management and
the nature of the information battlefront in the information age are critical aspects of
warfare which CDA is well suited to investigate through its focus on the role of language.

57

2.3.3 Information Control
Numerous media scholars have argued that reporters are thoroughly dependent on
government officials for information (see for example, Di Maggio, 2015; Richardson,
2007; Kauffman, 2004; Herber & Filak, 2007); this is especially true in times of war.
This control of information works in several ways, with varying degrees of impact on the
final message that is communicated through the press. Three models for theorizing how
elites control information and influence news are discussed in section 2.3.4. There are
also many layers of how information is conveyed from elite voices such as from the
White House to the public; press releases, media appearances, press conferences and
speeches are activities that seek to develop common media frames over time (Robinson,
2004, p. 105). The mere act of quoting official sources enables those sources to set the
agenda and frames for the news, and this in turn results in the replication of official
rhetoric through the mass media. For example, during this initial phase leading up to the
war, newspapers such as The Washington Post were heavily reliant on official sources
(Herber & Filak, 2007). Miller and Ko (2012) applied Herman and Chomsky’s (1988)
propaganda model to analyze media coverage (The New York Times, Al Jazeera English,
The Christian Science Monitor, BBC and Reuters) of 4 bombings in the run up to the
Iraqi election in 2010 and found that despite sufficient plurality of voices and competing
narratives, most news organizations also promulgated elite narratives that relied on
official sources (p. 109).
DiMaggio (2015) found in his analysis of media coverage of the Iraq War that the
range of opinions expressed by journalists were “extremely narrow” (p. 288) with the
media regularly failing to achieving the goal of exploring diverse and competing views.

58

King (2014) however found that the five media outlets she examined all embarked on
different interpretive paths to the one presented by President Obama, but there was some
congruence in praise for American troops for example (p. 166).
There are not always unified voices from those in power that shape media
coverage either. As Baum and Potter (2015) point out, the extent to which media voice
opposition opinion is dependent on the extent to which the party in opposition to the
government raises criticisms (p. 7). The professional practice of journalistic impartiality
also results in what DiMaggio (2015) refers to as bipartisan bias; which is the reporting
the views of both parties but excluding other competing perspectives. And if, as in the
case of the Iraq War, there was not a loud enough Democratic Party voice against the
war, the media tends to overlook other criticisms. As both Republican and Democrats
strongly supported the invasion and regime change, there was limited diversion from the
dominant political opinions in the press. But as opposition in the Democratic Party grew
as the situation in Iraq deteriorated, there was also an evident shift in the mainstream
media from disproportionate support to disproportionate criticism of the war (Baum and
Potter, 2015, p. 29).
Another widely studied area relating to information control in the Iraq War was
the use of embedded journalism and the wider attention garnered by embedded coverage
over other coverage (Allan & Zelizer, 2004, p. 6). Numerous scholars have examined the
effects on the quality and accuracy of information produced through embedded
journalists in shaping the news (see for example, Hess & Kalb, 2003; Miller, 2004; BoydBarret, 2004; Tumber & Palmer, 2004; Reese, 2004; Richardson, 2007). One of the
effects of embedded journalism is the identification the journalist feels with the soldiers

59

and military unit responsible for their protection. This effectively means the objectivity
standard is jeopardized and the journalist no longer has the same freedom to interview
whoever s/he likes and is less likely to provide critical and unfavorable coverage. In a
war environment, the scarcity of information also makes journalists more dependent on
official sources, more fearful of being labeled as unpatriotic and the government more
tight-lipped about information.
Others have also produced works that have demonstrated the tight control of
information coming from the Bush White House in the lead up to the war, with John
Dean, former counsel to Richard Nixon, labelling the administration as the “most
secretive” in his life time (quoted in Hayden, 2009, p. 75). Richardson (2007) in his study
of British media in Iraq also comments on the strict controls and limits imposed on
embedded journalists as well as those stationed in Doha as a key way in which the
propaganda campaign during the initial invasion was achieved (pp. 193-4). Similar
conclusions are drawn by Tumber and Palmer (2004) from their interviews with
journalists stationed in Doha who complained about lack of information received from
the military command. Lewis and Reese (2009) conducted interviews with various
journalists covering the War on Terror for USA Today and found that these journalists
inadvertently found themselves utilizing (and therefore reifying) the Bush
administration’s framing of the War on Terror out of convenience even though many of
them questioned whether Iraq belonged to that framework (p. 96).
Within the media and communications literature, there are various competing
theories that seek to explain how individuals interpret events. One school of thought,
“Elite Theory” argues that public opinion is shaped by political elites who are able to

60

frame events and set agendas through their public statements and rhetoric. Furthermore,
this position posits that elites own and control the media; and that elites also control
cultural institutions such as entertainment and schools that encourage spectatorship rather
than citizen involvement (Kamalipour, 2005, p. 3; Artz, 2005, p. 9). Researchers such as
Baum and Potter (2015); Kamalipour (2005); Artz (2005) in various settings, found this
to be the case with a corporate media representing elite interests. However, scholars who
hold this opinion also remind us that elite power is not unlimited and the influence is not
merely through manipulating the masses, but rather more a means through which consent
arises from the “common sense” of everyday life that has been institutionally organized.”
(Artz, 2005, p. 9). Three elite theory models of media influence are discussed in further
detail below as such phenomena have a direct effect on how discourses are shaped.
On the other hand, “democratic theory” posits that the public are less influenced
by political elites and are rational and informed when it comes to their opinions and
beliefs about world events. King (2014) also reminds us that despite a President’s power
to frame issues, the president’s message must still compete with the background noise of
infotainment, celebrity gossip and scandal (p. 9). Both schools have some overlap and
acknowledge the merits of the other, however, it is possible to draw from both and posit
that the strength of opposition to government from opposition parties, especially with a
multi-party electoral system that offers a greater diversity of viewpoints, also leads to a
wider range of viewpoints being expressed in the media. This in turn improves the range
of information that citizens have. This assumption is supported by Baum and Potter’s
(2015) findings, where media and public opposition to the Iraq War was highest in
Germany, where the public has high access to media and there are a high number of

61

opposition parties. Whereas countries like Poland (which was one of the coalition
partners), had low party representation, and lower access to media, and the Polish
government was greater able to frame the war in the media to galvanize public support.

2.3.4 Elite Theory Models of Media Influence
2.3.4.1. Indexing
In this model it is political establishment elites and primarily those highly ranked
administration officials who garner the most media attention and their perspectives are
privileged in media coverage. However, unlike the hegemonic model, when elites diverge
in their perspectives, the media reflect these disagreements as conflict provides eyecatching headlines and public attention (See for example, Althaus et al., 1996; or Entman,
2004, Ch. 1). The indexing model privileges the established political parties and nonestablishment perspectives are ignored. The indexing model provides a useful framework
for understanding source selection and what social actors and voices are represented in
the news discourse.

2.3.4.2 Hegemony
Also falling within the ‘elite theory’ perspective, the hegemony model posits that
public consent is obtained by elites through the construction of a social reality that taps
into society’s underlying myths and core principles (King, 2014, p. 16). It is
predominantly through the cultural dimension of which media are one part, that dominant
meanings are established. In such an arrangement, journalists replicate and thereby
amplify the views of those in power by encapsulating such views within the dominant

62

discourses of society. There is ultimately less variation in the perspectives represented in
the media and limited disagreement (or manifestation of disagreement amongst elites)
within the media. The implications of this model for this study are that the range of
possibilities of what the ending of the war means is limited by the dominant discourses
that surface in the news. These discourses, in order to become hegemonic encapsulate
and draw upon specific values such as freedom, democracy, patriotism, the myth of
manifest destiny that many Americans can readily identify with.

2.3.4.3 Cascading Activation Model
Entman (2003; 2004, pp. 15-20) expands on the elite theory perspective in his
cascading activation model, noting that a counter frame to the dominant perspective may
emerge within the media if the competing interpretation/s better explain events and
manage to gain the support of political elites from the opposition party as well as striking
a chord with the public’s general overview of the events (King, 2014, p. 17). This model,
like the others is also a top-down model, but one where disagreements amongst elites
may emerge and eventually surface in the public discourse, leading to a lack of consensus
and divergent views gaining coverage in the media. There is a vast literature on elite
media influence and these models offer a useful starting point. The purpose here
however, is to draw attention to these and tie these in with the concerns of this
dissertation which is the construction of meaning and the resultant hegemony of certain
discourses in the informational battlefront.

63

2.3.5 Control of Information in the Iraq War
In terms of controlling the informational battlefront, the U.S. government has
been more successful at home than abroad. Selim (2012) in his study of democratization
in Iraq concluded that Arab media frames for the war differed extensively from the
portrayal of the war to the American audience. The dominant frames cast the U.S. in a
negative light: as a violator of UN charter; as driven by an agenda to expand hegemony in
the region and control oil; as an imperialist power (p. 74). The extent to which such
critical perspectives and themes emerged in the discourse of the selected U.S. newspapers
will become apparent from how the outcomes and consequences of the war were
represented.
As mentioned above, the use of embedded journalists was a prominent feature of
the Iraq War; during the initial invasion phase, there was a larger contingent of embedded
journalists, but as the occupation prolonged, the number of embedded reporters declined,
which Haigh (2014, p. 41) argues resulted in more thematic coverage of the war. Holsti
(2011) in his book examining American public opinion on the Iraq War, points out that as
public and media criticism of the war grew, there were concerted efforts from the
Pentagon to hire high ranked retired officers to make supportive comments in media
interviews and appearances (p. 149-50). These however were ultimately unsuccessful in
changing public perceptions as the public sentiment seemed to reflect the deteriorating
situation in the ground (Holsti, 2011, p. 155); nevertheless these efforts are indicative of
the importance of controlling discourse and perceptions in war. Others such as DiMaggio
(2015) also recognize 2005-2007 as a turning point in public opinion against the war as

64

failure to find WMD, a growing insurgency against American occupation; and the Abu
Ghraib controversy affected public mood.

2.3.6 Media Coverage
2.3.6.1 General Media Performance in Iraq War Coverage
Most media scholars agree that there was a failure by the media to scrutinize
government sources and information about the claims of the Bush administration with
some characterizing the media’s coverage as propaganda (see for example, Curtis, 2004;
Miller, 2004; Snow & Taylor, 2006; Altheide & Grimes, 2005; Altheide, 2004;
Kauffman, 2004). It is worth drawing attention to the scholarship on the coverage of The
New York Times, and particularly the articles supporting the invasion written by journalist
Judith Miller. Her reporting widely quoted the now disgraced Ahmed Chalabi without
fact-checking her source or claims about the WMD program of the Hussein regime; her
reports exaggerated the threat Iraq posed and many scholars have analyzed her coverage
with some calling it outright propaganda (for example, Hayden, 2009, p. 115). Although
Miller’s reporting was concerned with the initial justification of the war, this dissertation
will seek to examine the extent to which (or if at all) The New York Times and other
newspapers reporting of the end of the war contained ‘white and grey propaganda’ – the
former involves the intentional suppression of potentially harmful information, combined
with the deliberate promotion of positive information or ideas to distract attention from
problematic events. Grey propaganda essentially involves the non-verification of facts or
the avoidance of questioning their validity, especially when the content serves the
interests of the propagandist (Baran & Davis (1995, p. 62). Although The New York

65

Times, later issued apologies for the inaccuracies contained in Miller’s reporting,
Richardson (2007) points out that the public are far more likely to remember an original
incorrect story than a subsequently corrected version of the story (p. 184). Judith Miller’s
reporting also received widespread attention because of the importance of The New York
Times as an agenda-setting newspaper with an international reputation for high quality
journalism, and how such an institution, and one of its pre-eminent journalists produced
such poor quality of journalism.
Baker (2015) states:
The problems of Iraq are projected as an age-old Iraqi propensity to
violence, corruption and sectarianism. It came naturally for Americans to
think of Iraqi’s as ‘savages’, dishonest and violent, a people who neither
think nor feel as we do. Native Americans, African slaves, and various
categories of immigrants, including European populations like the Irish,
have all at some point exemplified these subhuman qualities. (2015, p. 95)
Similar Western-centric interpretive frameworks were observed by Lemons (2007) in her
analysis of discourses on freedom in relation to gender and religion in The New York
Times; she found that there was an unwillingness to acknowledge or critically engage
with differing conceptions of liberation and religion (pp. 90-94). According to AbuLughod (2002) this was apparent even earlier, as following 9/11, she argues there was a
tendency in the U.S. news media to use patronizing rhetoric for saving Muslim women
and interpreting events through the lens of religion and culture instead of the history of
US involvement in the region (p. 784).

66

There is a general consensus amongst scholars that the media rely heavily on
government officials and institutions, and a consequence of this is an increasing ability of
the government to frame the news and set the parameters of the mass-mediated debate
(Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011, p. 12; see also DiMaggio, 2015; Herber & Filak,
2007; Hayden, 2009; Hodges, 2011). This has been largely observed during the early
years of the war under the lead of the Bush administration. However, King (2014) argues
that as the war wore on, and the situation on the ground did not improve, journalists
began to diverge in their assessments from the official frames. By the end of the war, this
was even more the case with greater media criticism and contestation. Despite the Bush
administration’s best efforts to control the language and discourse of war, one study of
newspapers found that, the number of mentions of Vietnam and words such as guerilla
war and quagmire began to increase, indicating growing contestation and divergence
from the official narrative (Hayden, 2007, p. 47).
Media scholars found that leading news organizations failed in their responsibility
of scrutinizing government information during the lead up to the war and early phase of
the war (see for example, Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011; DiMaggio, 2015; Fuchs,
2005; Tomasky, 2003; Christie, 2006). Some are more critical of the media, arguing that
in many ways the failure to inform citizens about important public matters was
tantamount to propaganda (see for example, Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011, p.
124). Various media scholars have commented on the widespread public support for the
wars at the time of the initial invasion, where for example according to polls by Pew and
CNN/Gallop over 70% of respondents felt that taking military action in Iraq was the right
thing to do (cited in Holsti, 2011, p. 39). Feldman, Huddy and Marcus in their analysis of

67

the Threat and National Security Survey (TNSS), reported that in October 2002, 90% of
Democrats and Independents, and 95% of Republicans believed Saddam Hussein was
actively supporting anti-U.S. terrorist groups (2015, p. 47). Such data indicate a worrying
lack of knowledge amongst American citizens of Iraq, its regime, and the ideological
differences between Hussein and Islamist terror groups like al-Qaeda. However, as
numerous other scholars have demonstrated, there was some growing criticism of the war
in the mainstream press, especially following the 2006 Abu Ghraib scandal, the ongoing
violence and growing resistance to the occupation that between April-June 2008, only
40% of Americans had felt that taking military action was the right thing (Holsti, 2011, p.
39). Demonstrating direct media effects is not straightforward and there are numerous
reasons for the change in public opinion over time, but these studies underline the media
role and impact on the public in understanding attitudes towards policy decisions.
Gasher (2005) conducted a textual analysis of Newsweek and Time magazines
during the period (March-April 2003) and found that the themes of technical superiority
(co-developed with moral superiority) and sophistication provided a surgically precise
image of the war. For example, there were regular emphasis on American military
technology in the reportage, often contrasted with descriptions of Iraqi WMD or nerve
gas (Fuchs, 2005, p. 217; see also (Iskandar & el-Nawawy, 2004). One of the important
advantages of looking at studies undertaken of different mediums is to enable a
comparison to the four national newspapers that will be examined in this study.
King (2014) in her study of The New York Times, The Washington Post,
Associated Press, NBC News, and Fox News concludes that within these organizations
there was sufficient independence from the official administration’s endgame narrative

68

and that there was plenty of criticism, highlighting of uncomfortable truths about the war
such as the ongoing violence, the destruction to Iraq, the political instability, the lack of
infrastructure, as well as mentioning of realities of war such as the psychological effects
on returning soldiers (p. 163). Other news outlets such as Fox News praised American
success but also cautioned about a quick withdrawal and reminded readers/viewers about
ongoing violence and instability.

2.3.6.2 Newspapers’ Performance in Covering the Iraq War
Newspapers are often seen as elite organs of American discourse as a result of
their greater in-depth coverage and analysis of issues. The Newspaper Research Journal
has published a number of articles that offer a variety of content analysis studies on Iraq
War coverage that give insight into the journalistic and democratic performance of
newspapers. Porpora et al. (2013) found that prior to the invasion, The Wall Street
Journal was “Hawkish” even in the opinion pages with over 95 percent of articles
published between 15 August 2002 and October 2002 in favor of the war (p. 81), The
Washington Post had been calling for Saddam’s removal even before the Bush
administration (p. 73), and The New York Times had resisted the call for war before the
invasion citing that 78 percent of the articles they examined were against the war (p. 81).
The New York Times later did come aboard as the invasion drew closer but both The New
York Times and The Washington Post admitted belatedly that their coverage was heavily
tilted in favor of the Bush administration (Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011, p. 25;
similar findings are reported by DiMaggio, 2015, p. 73; Fuchs, 2005). Fuchs (2005, p.
204) also drew similar conclusions about USA Today although Feldman, Huddy and

69

Marcus’ (2015) do believe that the newspaper did contain more critical coverage than
elite papers (p. 78). Various content analysis studies of The New York Times have found
the newspaper to have been supportive of the war (see for example, Artz, 2004; Fuchs,
2005). DiMaggio (2015) found that Knight Ridder papers were the only ones which
consistently printed articles that questioned Bush’s claims about WMD. He cites the
relative independence of local newspaper reporters compared to many national
newspaper journalists as a reason for offering more critical coverage as there was less
access to and therefore dependence on official resources. Similar findings are also
supported by the research of Feldman, Huddy and Marcus’ (2015).
When it came to the exit strategy from Iraq, there was much coverage in The
Washington Post and The New York Times that remained cautious. King found that news
in editorials and opinion pages, in both newspapers, on the whole was more independent
of official rhetoric and that reporters drew their own conclusions about the political
stalemate, ongoing violence, and uncertainty in Iraq (King, 2014, Ch. 5). King (2014)
examines numerous articles from The Washington Post and The New York Times where
coverage was critical, and often scathing, reminding readers of the fragility of Iraq. In her
qualitative content analysis, she found plenty of evidence of a disconnect between the
language used by the Administration and that offered by the media, saying there was a
more sobering assessment of the war’s achievements in the media. (King, 2014, Ch. 5).
King (2014, p. 157) also found that within The New York Times and The
Washington Post’s coverage, there were competing voices from Iraq that also countered
the President’s frame of endgame success, specifically surrounding the U.S. commitment
to security in Iraq and complaints about the lack of functioning infrastructure and

70

difficult living conditions. The analysis conducted in this study will compare and contrast
the discourse of the selected newspapers and examine whether the coverage was indeed
critical of the outcomes and consequences of the Iraq War. In addition, King’s work does
not examine the discourse of attributing responsibility for the outcomes of the war which
forms a focal point for this dissertation. There are no other major works examining the
rhetoric and media discourse of the American exit from Iraq which is the major
contribution this dissertation will make in terms of the gap in literature.

2.4 Dominant Themes and Discourses
This section addresses the findings of other various discourse-related studies that
have revealed the dominant themes or narratives that surfaced in media discourse of the
ending of the Iraq War. Collectively, these sections will bring to the fore some of the
important debates that researchers in the field are grappling with as well as shed light on
the shortcomings, challenges and future directions that research in this field can take. The
nature of discourse, competition between discourses, its varied interpretations and
meanings will be discussed in more detail in Chapter Three, however, in this section, I
will draw attention to some of the important studies on discourse and the Iraq War. In
general, these can be divided into two broad categories, those studies that deal with the
official voices of government which involve the study of rhetoric; and those studies that
examine the media discourse which largely originate in the field of mass communication
studies but due to the interdisciplinary nature of CDA, attract scholars from a variety of
other backgrounds too.

71

2.4.1 Absence of Moral Discourse and Questionable Legality
From the literature examining the control of discourse, an emergent theme
amongst some authors was the absence of a public debate on the morality of the war
(Porpora et al., 2013; Hagen, Kaiser & Hanson, 2015; DiMaggio, 2015). Whilst
humanitarian intervention was one of primary justifications of the war, especially once
the key reasons for war fell apart (Moeller, 2004) there was limited debate about the
morality of the war itself as the situation in Iraq deteriorated. This thesis is propounded
by Porpora et al. (2013) in their book Post-Ethical Society: The Iraq War, Abu Ghraib,
and the Moral Failure of the Secular. The authors analyzing the news media’s moral
reasoning and discover what they call the “privatization of morality” (p. 2). They found
that in various phases of the war although the media coverage became more critical of the
lack of progress, there was a tendency to leave out any moral critiques that this was a war
of aggression in violation of international law and prosecuted by torture (pp. 18-19).
They found that there was a marginalization of the moral arguments across the elite
newspapers (p. 86). Romaya (2012) in The Iraq War: A Philosophical Analysis highlights
the inadequacy of the existing philosophical discourse, specifically ‘Just-war’ theory for
being ill-equipped to deal with the complex nature of modern wars (such as non-state
actors, the inequalities produced by globalized capitalism, or greater threat to civilians
than armed combatants). He calls for a greater moral awareness of the human toll on
civilians in modern wars as the risk of injury and death to civilians is far higher than it is
for the traditional combatants (Romaya, 2012, p. 112).
Closely associated to the morality of war, is studying the legal language
surrounding the legality of the war. The work of Hagen, Kaiser and Hanson (2015) on the

72

questionable legality and immorality of war, especially in light of the ensuing genocidal
chaos that was emerging concurrently in the Darfur region (given that humanitarian
intervention was a later justification), raises important questions of the media coverage
related to the characterization of the war, whether it was characterized as a war of
aggression or criminal act (as Hagen, Kaiser and Hanson (2015) argue) or a ‘just’ war for
humanitarian reasons. How war is characterized is important because it also raises the
need to examine the media discourse on the Iraq War legacy and how it will be
remembered as there is the problem of the public’s historical amnesia and the possibility
of continuing the policy of pre-emptive wars without sound moral and legal justification.

2.4.2 CDA Studies on Official Rhetoric
As various researchers have found, the President has immense power in setting
the media agenda (for example, Porpora et al., 2013, p. 87; DiMaggio, 2015; Hodges
2011; and Entman, 2003). Hodges (2011) demonstrates how this is discursively achieved
when politicians make statements in a concise and catchy way so that these become
soundbites that are repeated over and over again in the media; examples include, “war on
terror,” “WMD,” “either you are with us or the terrorists.” (p. 87). Hodges (2011)
examines the relationship between micro-level discursive actions such as the rhetoric of
the president and shared cultural understandings bound up in the macro-level discourse of
the War on Terror narrative. In other words, although the discourse of the War on Terror
began at a macro-level, reference to it, repetition of certain phrases, and media discourse
about it reified it and established it as a dominant frame of understanding events such as
the Iraq War.

73

In discourse studies, language is the fundamental unit of analysis, but for critical
discourse analysis scholars, language is analyzed in the context of social phenomena
(Wodak & Meyer, 2009, p. 2) and societal values which are linked back to the workings
of ideology (van Dijk, 1997a). Numerous critical scholars have demonstrated the
strategic use of political metaphors during the Iraq War that can polarize the debate
between Us vs. Them or Good vs Evil. For example, Sowinska’s (2013) study of
President Bush’s State of the Union Speeches between 2001 and 2008, found that the
metaphors of “freedom is a story” and “America is a writer” played a key role in
reasserting the idea of American leadership in the pursuit of the ideals of peace and
democracy (p. 803). Sahlane (2013) also examined the strategic use of five metaphors in
The New York Times and The Washington Post, and how this coverage reflected the U.S.
official perspective of the ‘legitimacy’ of attacking Iraq. For example, 1) the
‘Schedule/timetable’ metaphor was used to emphasize the running out of time, or
countdown to military action; 2) the ‘game metaphor’ was used to present the U.S.
decision as a calculated risk, and use of phrases like Hussein playing ‘hide and seek’
being ‘cornered’ or talk of ‘winning the contest’ to underline the foul play of the Iraq
regime; 3) the ‘Making a case’ metaphor was used to represent the efforts of the Bush
administration as having exhausted diplomatic options; 4) War as a ‘driving’ metaphor
utilized language that constructed the future as a realm of inevitable democratic change,
with the U.S. in the driving seat, and the public ‘bracing’ itself for the inevitable crash,
that was war, without the option of a u-turn; and 5) the disease/germ metaphor for which
war is the best medicine was routinely deployed in the media, using imagery of ‘health’
and ‘vigor’ which translated to military strength, ‘precision [surgical] strikes’ against

74

‘terrorist cells’ to ‘contain’ the ‘spread’ of the disease of terrorism (p. 162). The textual
analysis conducted in this dissertation will also examine the use of metaphors as they are
a key rhetorical device not only to legitimate actions but to create mental models in
readers’ understanding of a situation.
Dunmire (2007) in her CDA of two Bush speeches illustrates how the Bush
administration’s ‘doctrine of preemption’ depended on gaining a control of the future as
an ideologically important site, one where it was able to use language that would
determine how the future could be “imagined, articulated and realized” (p. 19). She
found, that rather than presenting policies as being motivated by political or ideological
goals, the policies were “presented as a necessary response to external imperatives, forces
and impending future realities” (p. 31). Sahlane (2015) examined the use of argumentum
ad baculum (argument by force, or threat of force to make some agree with a conclusion)
and argumentum ad hominem (attacking the arguer’s character), and employing political
metaphor to present a discursive reality whereby the pro-war position was presented as
the natural and only course of action. Similar conclusions about the Bush
administration’s rhetoric are reached by Cohen (2005) who states that there was a
“fortiori” nature to the argumentation used. Fortiori is a rhetorical practice where the
arguer proves that the opponent acted cruelly in the past and demonstrating on another
level that there remains the possibility of future cruel actions (p. 39). Porpora et al. (2013)
refer to Bush’s rhetoric as manipulative through its simplification and dramatization (p.
65) as well as use of arguments that appealed to emotions rather than sound logic (p. 69).
Cole (2005) argues that the rhetoric characterized the enemy as inherently evil and
evoked the image of savagery which in turn closes any possibility to an alternative in

75

dealing with the threat other than the course of war (p. 150). This was a persistent theme
in both Bush and Obama’s rhetoric and is revisited below.
According to Entman (2004), in order for a narrative to become dominant and
salient, it should “strike a public chord by drawing upon perceptions and opinions already
stored in memory, bringing these habitual ways of thinking, or schemas, to the forefront
of people’s minds.” (pp. 6-7). King’s (2014) analyses showed that Obama’s rhetoric fit
into the discourse of American Exceptionalism (p. 5). This notion of the United States as
a special, divinely ordained nation, with its uniqueness of celebrating the core human
values of individual rights is widely believed by many Americans and is thoroughly
culturally and historically institutionalized (King, 2014, p. 5; Moeller, 2004, p. 66). Artz
(2005) reminds us that “[t]he ritual of the pledge of allegiance and the national anthem
are publicly enacted discursive affirmations of the good, clean, wholesome, benevolent
empire of innocence” (p. 17). Therefore, if Presidents are able to tap into such preexisting discourses, or grand narratives of the nation’s history, Americans are more likely
to be persuaded by the story being told.
A study by Graham, Keenan and Dowd (2004) adopted Wodak’s discoursehistorical approach to illustrate how Bush’s speeches declaring a War on Terror had
linguistic similarities to three other ‘call to arms’ speeches delivered by Pope Urban II in
1095, Queen Elizabeth I in 1588, and Hitler in 1938. They identified four generic features
that had endured in these texts:
1) an appeal to a legitimate power source that is external to the orator, and
which is presented as inherently good; 2) an appeal to the historical
importance of the culture in which the discourse is situated; 3) a

76

construction of an evil Other; and 4) an appeal for unification behind the
legitimating power source. (Graham, Keenan & Dowd, 2004, p. 201)
The findings of these past studies are useful as they help the researcher look out for the
presence of similarities in the data set being analyzed for this study.

2.4.3 Constructing Dominant Discourses
Chapter Three looks at the various theoretical perspectives of discourses and how
these become ‘hegemonic;’ here discourse is understood in the Foucauldian sense, as the
range of possibilities within the discursive terrain, that is, controlling the language and
thereby colonizing concepts of truth so as to make the basis of one’s own position as selfevident (see for example, Foucault, 1972, 1975/1995; or Foucault & Rabinow, 1984, pp.
72-75). Within this understanding of discourse, Foucault also stresses the importance of
conceiving discourse as a “series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is
neither uniform nor stable.” (1978/1990, p. 100). In other words, discourses remain in a
constant state of struggle that can be both instruments of dominance and resisting
dominance. (Foucault, 1978/1990, p. 101). Nearly all critical discourse analysts
emphasize the importance of culture and ideology in establishing a dominant discourse
within a community, that promotes an ideological common sense’ (Fairclough, 1995, p.
123) and other ‘common values’ (see for example, Fairclough, 1992b, p. 49; Holland,
2006, p. 43; Sowińska, 2013; van Dijk, 1997b, 2008). As previously mentioned, the ‘War
on Terror’ narrative/discourse has been widely adopted within the media, and even
opponents of the policies of the Bush and Obama administrations must utilize the same
language which inadvertently perpetuates the discourse. In his study of the War on

77

Terror, Michaels (2013) highlights three functions of what he calls the “discourse trap”
that can result in government actors losing control over the discourse. Firstly, blowback
is where the discourse is used by opponents to condemn its policies; secondly,
bandwagoning is where others adopt the discourse for their own purposes (for example,
in the way that governments of Russia, China and India have been engaged in fighting
domestic opponents); and thirdly, marginalization, which indicates a widespread adoption
of the discourse but it results in the marginalization of other discourses (Michaels, 2013:
pp. 10-11).
Also critical to the establishment of legitimacy for the War on Terror discourse is
the consistent references to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which according to
Reyes (2011) has been a strategy deployed by both Bush and Obama as it appeals to the
emotions related to 9/11, such as fear, sadness, insecurity and revenge, but also serves the
purpose to justify current American military actions (pp. 789-90). Another important
CDA study of the Bush administration’s National Security Strategy of 2002 disrupts the
‘9/11 changed everything’ narrative, demonstrating how 9/11 was used as a justification
for the ‘preventative war’ doctrine by the administration (Dunmire, 2009). Chang and
Mehan’s (2008) discourse analysis of the argumentation strategy of the Bush
administration, illustrated that preventative war to combat evil and madness was central
to the discourse of building the case for war, particularly, the authors demonstrate how
syntactical formations convoluted the debate about the threat by heightening the
connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda and sidelining the debate about the factuality of
the presence of weapons of mass destruction (p. 473). Ferrari (2007) goes further by
comparing the political metaphors and language of the Bush administration to the cascade

78

propaganda used by totalitarian regimes, indulging in self-flattery, construction of an evil
but less objective enemy, denigration of the antipatriotic spreaders of doubt, etc. (p. 605).
King (2014) points out that one of the key elements to crafting storylines that
resonate amongst the public is that they have to employ the “underlying assumptions,
beliefs, and values, the symbols, images and histories and myths.” (p. 15). As mentioned
about, she discovered how the reliance on the rhetoric of American exceptionalism
shaped Obama’s exit speeches. American exceptionalism is a central concept as it is
within this ideological frame that other dominant metaphors such as the ‘clash of
civilizations’ or prevalent Manichean characterizations of the conflict as a battle between
as ‘us’ and ‘them’, ‘good’ and ‘evil’, as well as themes of democracy, freedom, and
patriotism are contained. It is to this polarization of the discourse that we now turn our
attention.
A CDA study by Denton-Borhaug (2012) examining the war rhetoric of Obama
argues that the President discursively “links the practice of war with the achievement not
only of peace and prosperity, but also global security and democracy.” (p. 126). DentonBorhaug contrasts Obama’s language with speeches by Martin Luther King on Vietnam
and war; for King, war is a travesty, especially for the poor; whereas for Obama, war is a
necessity, requiring sacrifice, and constitutes a central part of the American national
identity, character and wellbeing (pp. 130-131). The results of this study are an excellent
example of the prominence of intertextuality in war discourse to construct reality.
Obama, who has often invoked the legacy of Martin Luther King, in many ways
considered a voice for justice and morality, reconstitutes his message within his own war
discourse; which is often reproduced by the media, and is influential in how we make

79

sense of events or understand their meaning/s. It is worth remembering that the
‘naturalization’ of a war discourse did not begin with Obama, indeed discourses, in order
to become hegemonic must resonate culturally and historically. Analyzing how
discourses are placed within cultural and historical contexts is pertinent to all three
central research questions of this study. This placement of discourses influences the
nature of meaning that is given to social phenomena or events; this study will ascertain
whether this changed over the course of the three periods of announced ending of the
war.

2.4.3.1 ‘Clash of Civilizations’
Stocchetti (2007) argues that the ‘clash of civilizations’ metaphor has been an
influential interpretive framework for explaining the causes of terrorism for some time (p.
224-5). This conceptualization polarizes the Western world against the Islamic world as
two separate and ultimately incompatible cultures. However, Hasmi (2014) states that
Western discourse on Islam has been largely an Orientalist discourse – for example, he
points out the readiness of Western leaders and press to speak of a clash of civilizations
or discuss the compatibility of Islam and democracy but the same questions are never
raised of the incompatibility of Catholicism in Latin America and the lack of democracy
there. (p. 105). The Iraq War fits into what Knox (2013) believes is the civilizing mission
of the War on Terror, where the option for pre-emptive action is only possible for the
West when dealing with ‘rogue states;’ this is encapsulated in Knox’s analysis of
international law which demonstrates that the legal language of war remains racialized
and imperialist. (p. 128). It is the task of the CDA conducted in this study to discern the

80

extent to which such discourse structures were reflected in the newspaper coverage of the
Iraq War.
Various studies have observed the presence of a Manichean narrative of ‘us’ as
good versus ‘them’ as evil in media and official rhetoric (see for example, Kellner, 2004;
Patman, 2006; Bartolucci, 2012; Zagacki, 2007; King & Wells, 2009). For example, there
was a constant bringing to light the transgressions of the Iraqi regime but not the
violations of unilateral action by the U.S. (Porpora et al., 2013, p. 96). Stocchetti (2007)
argues that such characterization has the effect of polarizing the discourse in a way where
the enemy is presented as completely de-rational or fanatical (p. 234). Richardson (2007)
echoes similar observations in his critical discourse analysis of British newspaper
coverage of the Iraq War, by highlighting that war propaganda typically describes
conflicts in polarized ways that the discourse only allows for two possibilities: for and
against (2007, p. 179). He analyses the language of British Labour politician John Reid in
the lead up to the Iraq War and how the rhetoric functioned in the above described way:
1. No war = doing nothing = sustaining murder, torture = undesirable
2. War= doing something = opposing murder, torture = desirable
Being attentive to such moral absolutism and dichotomization in media discourse can
reveal a great deal about how discourse operates in setting the boundaries on contentious
issues and topics.

2.4.3.2 ‘Us’ vs. ‘Them’
Erjavec and Volcic (2007) in their study of Bush’s discourse, argue that the War
on Terrorism established a new discursive order that aimed to control representations and

81

communications, where anything but support for the U.S. leadership was seen as antiAmericanism and taking sides with the terrorists (p. 125). Numerous studies have shown
how the Bush regime utilized an ‘us’ vs ‘them’ framework that the media also
perpetuated and adopted to a large degree (see for example, Hutcheson, Domke,
Billeaudeaux & Garland, 2004; Castonguay, 2004; Coe et al., 2004; Kalsi, 2008; Kellner,
2007). Various terms are used to describe this process, but from a discourse perspective,
Lazar and Lazar referred to this as a process of ‘outcasting’ (2004) through
‘criminalization’, ‘enemization’, ‘evilification’, and ‘orientalization’. (2007, p. 46). ‘Us
vs. Them’ frames are utilized by politicians not only in times of war but within countries,
and between political groups (Becker, 2007, p. 181). This type of discourse was utilized
throughout the Bush presidency by officials, and also later adopted by Obama as he
sought to shift attention from Iraq back to Afghanistan. One of the ways CDA seeks to
unearth how this dichotomy is discursively achieved is through analysis of the text that
illuminates the presentation of a vivid self against a blurry other. This dissertation seeks
to reflect on whether all four newspapers selected adopted such a binary presentation and
what the implications of such discourses are.

2.4.3.3 Theme of Fear
Various studies of the media have found that the mainstream media contributed to
the atmosphere of fear of terrorism after 9/11 and forfeited their role as government
watchdog (see for example, Altheide, 2003, 2004; Chermak, 2003; Der Derian, 2005;
Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011). DiMaggio (2015) also found that during the Bush
presidency, the rhetoric of fear was prominent in the President’s statements (p. 157) and

82

that in 2014 along with the rise of ISIS, there was a return of the rhetoric of fear (p. 303).
This dissertation will examine the extent to which the news discourse during the ending
of the Iraq War made reference to the fear propounded about Iraq’s WMD at the start of
the war, and whether the end of the war meant the removal of a threat.

2.4.3.4 Democracy Theme
The theme of democracy was repeatedly present in Presidential rhetoric and
media coverage after the failure to find WMD but democracy was also being undermined
because the vast majority of Iraqis remained opposed to the occupation and privatization
of Iraqi oil (DiMaggio, 2015, p. 129). Closely tied to the theme of democracy was the
theme of liberation; Michaels (2013) points out how there was a reluctance in the early
stages of the occupation to refer to the insurgency as the word insurgency had
connotations of an uprising or resistance movement that could be interpreted as
legitimate, so words like al-Qaeda, terrorists or Saddam loyalists were preferred (p. 133).
Similarly, the absence of the term civil war in Iraq during the occupation was also
noticeable as the administration and media referred to sectarian violence instead (p. 132).
Such debates illustrate the discursive battleground, with contested terminology and
meanings having more to do with politics rather than achieving semantic accuracy
(p.136).

2.4.3.5 Sanitized War Discourse
This study has been limited to study the textual details that reveal the dominant
discourse surrounding the ending of the Iraq War, but some researchers such as Machin

83

(2007) make a case for “visual discourses” that are captured through photographs and
other multimodal analyses. Machin’s assertion that discourses can be realized through
images capturing various features of war – such as suffering, enemies, combat, and
civilians – would certainly enhance the existing approach but is beyond the scope and
ambitions of this project. Furthermore, multimodal analysis of photographs appearing in
newspapers would also require a detailed analysis of the printed text in order to establish
a fuller understanding of the discourse present; however, this is not necessarily the case
for textual analysis which is not as dependent on the visual (that is indeed if there is a
visual aid provided at all).
Machin (2007) examined the visual photography of the Iraq War appearing in
U.S. mainstream media and found that the visual discourse has clearly changed in its
presentation of suffering, combat, enemies, and civilians when compared to the Vietnam,
Crimean or first Gulf War. (p. 124). For example, he points out how depictions of agency
and action of U.S. soldiers has changed from showing bombings of targets or soldiers
firing guns to depicting “behavioural processes” of observing, searching, keeping guard –
emphasizing peacekeeping rather than destruction. (p. 135). Machin reminds us that
images are frequently used to convey concepts or emotions rather than be informative (p.
139). The news presented images of “technologized soldiers” who are depicted
professionally, and working in small teams to protect civilians who are often portrayed as
helpless and weak became (p. 140). Agency in terms of the responsibility for the
outcomes and consequences of the situation in Iraq is a critical dimension and this study
will shed light on how it is discursively achieved.

84

This dissertation seeks to unearth the extent to which the textual details of the Iraq
War represented the reality of the situation, especially the ongoing extreme violence
between sectarian militias as well as the ongoing repercussions and suffering caused in
the aftermath of a war that had been fought on Iraqi soil for over 8 years. As Machin
(2007) and others have observed, there was a great deal of emphasis on the technologies
of war, especially the equipment and sophistication of American precision missiles. The
language used to describe such technology can almost make one forget that these are
weapons that inflict immense harm and lasting destructiveness. Using language in this
way can easily shift the emphasis on to the brutality of the ‘other;’ it is the enemy that is
brutal and carrying out acts of terrorism and carnage whilst overlooking the carnage
caused by the actions of coalition forces. CDA helps illustrate how language operates to
enable the creation of such social realities that sanitize and eradicate the true horrors of
war.

2.5 Summary
In section 2.1 I highlighted how LIS scholarship on the Iraq War is characterized
by a reluctance to take a critical stance concerning the decision to go to war or
responsibility for its aftermath. CDA and this study in particular take a position of
examining the war as an injustice, with the express aim of examining the role played by
media information (in the form of news discourse) in constructing meanings for the
ending of the war, and how responsibility for the disastrous aftermath of the war was
discussed in the selected newspapers.

85

The general literature dealing with the Iraq War (2.2) provides important
historical details and context that shed light on the central discourses (interpretive
frameworks) that were utilized in media coverage such as the War on Terror, American
exceptionalism, and patriotism. King’s (2014) study on the discourse of President Obama
and the discourse in the press concerning the Iraq War endgame has illuminated areas
where the press coverage was critical and deviated from the President’s rhetoric on
success in Iraq. As has been shown, the news media were criticized by various scholars
for their uncritical support of the rationale for war with Iraq. During the invasion and
occupation, the media generally continued to support the war although did question some
specific points of strategy (for instance, the troop surge of 2007) but this occurred only
when there were strong opposition voices from the Republican or Democratic parties.
Hence, the elite theory models that were addressed are often used to explain why such
opposition occurs in the press when it does. Media coverage of the ending of the war has
received limited attention, but King (2014) and Feldman, Huddy and Marcus (2015), in
their studies found sufficient evidence of press criticism and skepticism towards the
endgame narrative.
The CDA approach adopted in this study is particularly useful in scrutinizing
discourse in such a way as to unearth underlying ideological positions that can illuminate
the extent to which the newspapers selected in this study did actually offer critical
perspectives about the outcomes and consequences of the war, and responsibility for
these. This study will also give a glimpse of how mainstream media discourse operates in
terms of offering citizens information that is representative of reality. The literature
covered in section 2.3 highlighted the importance of the media and news to a healthily

86

functioning democracy but also showed that news is an informational product that is
packaged in a particular way to serve the business interests of the media organizations
that produce it.
A defining feature of this literature review has been the wide range of studies
from different disciplines that have been consulted in order to form a fuller picture of the
media discourse in the Iraq War. Section 2.4 highlighted the dominant discourses and
themes extrapolated from this broad literature. These were: clash of civilizations; Us vs.
Them; themes of fear and democracy; and a discourse of sanitized warfare. These will act
as useful starting points when trying to identify dominant discourses within the articles
selected for this study. In addition, by drawing heavily from disciplines outside LIS, it is
hoped the interdisciplinary nature of this study will further aid the methodological
procedure of the type of CDA carried out. Specifically, CDA seeks to shed light on
dominant discourse not only from an informational point of view (i.e. content contained
in the text), but also from being able to understand the context of the textual content in
relation to society and history.

CHAPTER 3
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS
Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) offers rich theoretical foundations as well as a
variety of methodological approaches to analyze communication. The leading scholars of
CDA are Norman Fairclough, Ruth Wodak, Teun van Dijk, and Paul Chilton; all four
have backgrounds in various strands of linguistics. The CDA program that these scholars
along with others formulated sought to bring a linguistic emphasis to the study of society
and discourse, as language plays a central role in the legitimization or delegitimization of
power relations (Fairclough, 1989, p. 41). The works of these scholars form a great deal
of the theoretical framework for CDA. There remain some theoretical shortcomings and
criticisms that CDA scholars continue to grapple which are examined in more detail
below. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 deal with the intellectual roots and theoretical terrain of CDA
and elaborate on its epistemological rationale. Section 3.3 addresses the major critiques
of CDA. And finally, Section 3.4 reviews the CDA literature within Library and
Information Science (LIS) and situates this study in the field.

3.1 CDA as Theoretical Approach
CDA does not constitute a single unified theory or methodological approach; it is
best understood as a school of thought (Weiss & Wodak, 2003, p. 12; Wodak & Meyer,
2009, p. 5) with roots in rhetoric, text linguistics, anthropology, philosophy, socio-

88

psychology, cognitive science, literary studies and sociolinguistics, as well as applied
linguistics and pragmatics (Wodak & Meyer, 2009, p. 1-2). Given the varied disciplinary
origins and backgrounds of practitioners of CDA, CDA emphasizes interdisciplinary and
transdisciplinary approaches to investigating a wide range of social phenomena. Indeed,
the definition of discourse the analyst utilizes impacts the type of CDA that proceeds. For
example, a discourse is not limited to that which appears in text form, it can constitute
other communicative events such as the dialogue that occurs in a classroom or
workplace; it can be a system of thought that shapes social or cultural practices; it can be
conceived of as a genre such as scholarly writing or journalistic writing; it can be a visual
discourse such as the display of artefacts in a museum that shapes patrons’ behavior; it
can be conceived of as the unspoken establishment of rules particular to a specific setting
such as the layout of a library which influences the behaviors of participants and
interactions between a patron and librarian for instance. Furthermore, discourse is not
limited to form, i.e. syntactic, grammatical, semantic, semiotic structures, or mental
processes, but is extended to include the “complex structures and hierarchies of
interaction and social practice and their functions in context, society and culture” (van
Dijk, 1997a, p. 6).
Often, different types of discourse overlap and contain numerous other discourses,
so for example, a speech by the President of the United States, can be analyzed as both
political and media discourse, as it is a part of both the world of politics, and the world of
media (assuming the speech is documented, reported or broadcast in some way).
Furthermore, the content of the speech contains a host of other discourses depending on
the topic of the speech. For example, a Presidential speech about the Iraq War may

89

contain within it a historical discourse, a war discourse, a moral discourse, a security
discourse, or a legal discourse, as well as less obvious examples such as an American
exceptionalism discourse, or just-war discourse. In addition, the form the speech takes
influences the type of discourse, for instance, if the speech is broadcast on television,
there is an audio-visual discourse dimension as well as a spoken-textual component; if
the speech is only reported in the printed press, the form it takes again influences the type
of discourse (the speech can be understood as a written-textual discourse, that is reproduced by the writer/editor, that may also be altered with the reporter’s own evaluative
statements added). The texts to be analyzed in this dissertation are news articles from
major newspapers that reported the ending of the Iraq War, specifically selected from
2003 and 2011 when the United States President announced the ending of the war, as it is
through these representations that meaning is ascribed to issues and events. And as one of
the pioneering theorists of CDA van Dijk states, the media “are manufacturers of public
knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, norms, values, morals and ideologies…[and] their symbolic
power is a form of ideological power” (2008c, p. 32).
Compiling a history of the vast intellectual heritage of CDA would be an
ambitious undertaking and is beyond the task set here; however, the influence of social
and linguistics theories is often cited by critical scholars as fundamental to the theoretical
foundations of CDA. The former addresses the contribution of European social theorists
that have informed what could be described under the umbrella term of critical studies.
For example, critical social theory has been heavily influenced by the various traditions
of Marxism, the Frankfurt School of philosophers, the French post-structuralist tradition
of thinkers such as Pierre Bourdieu, Jean Baudrillard, Michel Foucault and others, as well

90

as broadly by British social theorists such as Anthony Giddens, Stuart Hall, and
Raymond Williams. In addition, the work of Antonio Gramsci on theories of cultural
hegemony are often cited as heavily influential too. The second oft-cited influence
amongst critical scholars is the impact of critical linguistics, specifically the works of
Fowler et al. (1979); Kress and Hodge (1979); Fairclough (1989) and various works by
Halliday which are considered seminal. However, the works on critical approaches to
language have a tradition that started in the 1920s and 1930s, with the works of
Voloshinov and Bakhtin. Although the term critical linguistics came later on, Voloshinov
(1928/1973) viewed language (the sign) as an ideological product inseparable from
society (material reality). In critical linguistics or critical language studies, language is
thought of as a social practice and a socially conditioned process that is shaped by the
various elements of society (Fairclough, 1989, p. 22; Fowler et al., 1979). It is not
analyzed as an objective and transparent medium independent of the workings of
ideology.
One aspect of these various philosophical influences that remains constant in
critical studies is a critique of positivism and rejection of the notion of objective truths in
social scientific inquiry. This perspective is captured by the following statement by the
historian Hayden White, who emphasizes the role of human agency, ideology and
interpretation in historical and scientific inquiry:
there is no value-neutral mode of emplotment, explanation, or even
description of any field of events, whether imaginary or real…the very use
of language itself implies or entails a specific posture before the world
which is ethical, ideological, or more generally political: not only all

91

interpretation, but also all language is politically contaminated. (White,
1978, p. 129).
However, what sets CDA apart from other approaches such as rhetorical analysis, content
analysis, or other types of discourse analysis without the prefix critical, or indeed most of
the typical approaches to social scientific inquiry, is its commitment to social justice by
intervening “on the side of dominated and oppressed groups and against dominating
groups, and that it openly declares the emancipatory interests that motivate it”
(Fairclough & Wodak, 1997, p. 259). In other words, CDA scholars seek to address and
combat discursive injustices in texts (van Dijk, 2009a, p. 63), including the inequities of
discourse access and control (van Dijk, 2008c, p. 14). The way analysts do this is through
de-naturalizing the language of illegitimate domination by those in power, highlighting
amongst other things, the workings of ideology in texts through misrepresentation,
omission of information, and social manipulation. Keeping to this approach, this study
seeks to go beyond merely highlighting the workings of bias in media coverage, as CDA
is concerned with the subtle ways in which ideology and power operate through
discourse. Indeed, it is the subtleness that makes it difficult to detect illegitimate power
abuse and unjust representation in which certain beliefs, values, and rationales are
naturalized as attitudes (Fairclough, 1992b, p. 51) and can materialize in the form of
policies for instance. In this sense, rather than contributing to a specific discipline,
paradigm, school or discursive theory, CDA researchers are motivated by social issues
(van Dijk, 1993, p. 252), and addressing and overcoming social wrongs (Fairclough,
2009, p. 163).

92

3.2 Three Dimensional Framework of CDA: Critical – Discourse – Analysis
3.2.1 Critical
The usage of the term critical in CDA operates in a similar fashion to its usage in
Critical Theory or Critical Studies in that it designates an orientation towards challenging
and changing assumptions about society, as opposed to the traditional social scientific
approach, which seek to explain and understand phenomena often without questioning
the institutions and frameworks from which such social systems emerge. Ultimately it is
concerned with individual emancipation, refusing “to identify freedom with any
institutional arrangement or fixed system of thought” through skepticism towards existing
forms of practice and the purposes behind these (Bronner, 2011, p.1). There are other
traditional methods that espouse greater academic neutrality towards social problems;
however, such approaches do not necessarily seek to find solutions to the problems and
for critical scholars, these may in fact, contribute to the perpetuation of the problems by
becoming part of the institutionalized rhetoric of a discipline. For example, van Dijk
(2012) shows how elite discourses (those discourses that are dominated by politicians,
journalists and other experts for example) in the media on immigration issues can
reproduce and reinforce a system of racism through the use of language that represents
migrants as a problem. Another example occurs when the discourse on one issue, such as
the presentation of sex education in the classroom, can use language that is
heteronormative which can inadvertently reinforce a paradigm that presents alternative
sexualities as deviant or abnormal. In these ways, traditional methods that do not question
the underlying assumptions (and prejudices) present in the mind of the researcher, may be

93

somewhat responsible for the lack of progress in addressing injustices – that is, as far as
academic research can be expected to bring to light the true nature of social problems.
The realm of critical linguistics emphasizes that a great deal of social meaning is
implicit and not always contained in the language of texts or statements. The movement
of critical linguistics is concerned with unveiling how language can conceal or distort,
often without the awareness of the speaker (Fowler et al., 1979, p. 196). This critical
aspect is made clear in CDA with the analysts positionality, as well as through the
explicit aims of CDA, which for instance are to demystify discourses by unearthing
ideologies (Weiss & Wodak, 2003, p. 14); to bring to light structures, strategies and other
properties of text that play a role in the reproduction of dominance (van Dijk, 1993, p.
250); to question and criticize discourses and thereby reveal contradictions within and
between discourses, highlight the boundaries of what can and cannot be said, and what
role discourses play in making particular perspectives seem rational (or natural) (Jager &
Maier, 2009, p. 36); and to contribute to the resolution of social problems, especially
those where there are victims of unjust domination and illegitimate power relations (van
Dijk, 1997b, p. 22; 2009a, pp. 63-64). Despite the diversity of aims and approaches in
CDA, the presence of this critical dimension is essential for a study to be considered as a
CDA study.

3.2.2 Discourse
The concept of discourse has been defined in many ways across a broad range of
disciplines. In linguistics, it is common for ‘discourse’ to refer to extended pieces of
either spoken or written language but can also refer to the different types of language

94

used in social situations, such as newspaper discourse, advertising discourse, or
classroom discourse (Fairclough, 1992a, p. 3). As mentioned above, even within CDA
‘discourse’ can broadly be defined to incorporate a wide range of meanings. However, in
general the CDA concept of ‘discourse’ incorporates a bi-directional influence between
society and language, with each constituting the other. In other words, discourses are
socially constructed representations of the world as it is perceived or as it could be
imagined (Fairclough, 2003, p. 124). These representations become material realities
when they manifest as verbal and non-verbal expressions, symbols, texts or actions; in
addition, discourse also includes those representations that form the mental maps that we
use to finding meaning in, interpret and understand society (Gee, 2011, p. 39; van Dijk,
1995a, p. 21).
In social theory, our understanding of ‘discourse’ has been largely shaped by the
work of Michel Foucault and the term generally refers to the ways in which areas of
knowledge are structured through social practices. For example, in The Archaeology of
Knowledge, Foucault states that a discourse is a group of statements that belong to the
same discursive formation, and a discursive formation exists whenever “between objects,
types of statement, concepts, or thematic choices, one can define a regularity (an order,
correlations, positions and functionings, transformations)” (1972, p. 38). Examples of
such discursive formations include disciplines such as medicine, psychiatry and law (or
indeed Library and Information Science, see Frohmann,1992a, 1992b) as well as
conceptualizations such as the discourse of the ‘War on Terror’ which like the disciplines
mentioned above, has its own foundational premises of the causes of the war, its own
explanations and justifications, or descriptions of enemies and allies, in short, a

95

constructed reality for understanding events such as in the cases of the atrocities
committed on September 11th 2001, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the expansion of
the surveillance state, or the rise of ISIS for instance. However, the Foucauldian
conceptualization of ‘discourse’ undergoes various incarnations from his earlier work on
archaeology, where the focus was on discursive formations, to his later work on
genealogy, which examines the relationship between knowledge and power (Fairclough,
1992a, p. 39). What is constant though is that discourses are viewed to “exercise power in
a society because they institutionalize and regulate ways of talking, thinking and acting.”
(Jager & Maier, 2009, 35). It is this perspective that makes Foucault central to CDA and
the reason critical scholars are interested in analyzing the power of discourses in shaping
material realities.
Although Foucault’s theories aim to illustrate the power relations that are
sustained, perpetuated and reinforced by discourse, his work also offers perspectives on a
variety of related aspects such as the nature of truth, objectivity, knowledge, history,
individual and mass consciousnesses, individual and group agencies, and social and
political relations. Foucault’s oeuvre has influenced CDA on these subjects as well and
continues to be highly relevant for scholars across the humanities and social sciences.
Another aspect of Foucault’s work that informs the theoretical foundations of CDA in
general is what he refers to as genealogy, that is the various historical components and
discourses that constitute a discipline. As Jager and Maier (2009, 37) point out “[a] single
text has minimal effects, which are hardly noticeable and almost impossible to prove. In
contrast, a discourse, with its recurring contents, symbols and strategies, leads to the
emergence and solidification of ‘knowledge’ and therefore has sustained effects.” It is an

96

examination of this larger corpus of discourse and its placement in the correct historical
context that also inspires the approach to CDA adopted in this study. There are of course
different ways within CDA to unearth this larger body of discourse, but all acknowledge
the influence of Foucault in setting out to examine the epistemological evolution of
discourses beyond the linguistic features of texts, by including an analysis of the sociocultural and socio-political contexts within which these discourses operate.
Also related to the conceptualization of discourse as a body of socially
constructed knowledge, is the importance of truth and reality as socially constructed
entities. This is lucidly articulated in the works of Baudrillard (1981/1994, 1991/1995,
2009/2007), who puts forth the idea that signs and images are now substituted for reality
itself in a universe of simulacra, a hyperreality that privileges simulation over the real. In
other words, it is through language and the ensuing discourse that the real is
overshadowed, indeed, replaced by a constructed reality of signs and symbols. For
example, in the case of the first Gulf War (1990-91), Baudrillard questions the reality of
the war, as it was a one-sided onslaught against an inferior army unwilling to go into
battle: there are no great battles, no engagement with the Iraqi air force, no large number
of dead coalition soldiers, no final battles or victory parades; instead, we are spectators,
watching carefully selected images of ‘war,’ troops preparing, fighter planes being
readied, journalists reporting about the coming battles and dangers, or experts discussing
the technological superiority of the coalition forces and so forth. Baudrillard brands such
discourse “a masquerade of information” (1991/1995, p. 40) that presents a sanitized
informational version of war without displaying any of the true horrors of warfare or its
victims. CDA analysts Jager and Maier (2009) also highlight the importance of collective

97

symbols, through which “we interpret reality, and have reality interpreted for us,
especially by the media.” (p. 47). CDA seeks to bring to light these kinds of social
constructions of reality and specifically, analyze the role of the social, political and
ideological dimensions within discourses to help create hegemonic discourses that give
meaning to events and appear truthful, rational and natural.

3.2.3 Analysis
There are various social domains of analysis that are of interest to CDA
practitioners such as media language, political discourse, economics, advertising, gender,
institutional or work place discourse, and education discourse. Within each domain
practitioners have developed analytical methods that are suitable to achieve the
overarching CDA aims of unearthing ideology and power at work but are at the same
time quite eclectic and dissimilar. One noticeable difference is in the micro and macro
level of analysis – where the former places a greater emphasis on the linguistic details of
the discourse (such as vocabulary, syntactical structures, metaphors, etc.), and the latter
seeks to analyze broader socio-political contexts (e.g. grand narratives, thematic
structures, intertextuality, etc.). The macro-level of analysis is largely Foucauldian in
character with emphasis on historical contexts and processes and having a greater social
theory emphasis. For example, Foucault’s (1961/1988) study of the history of insanity
involve a macro-level analysis with limited attention to linguistics, as he engages with the
broader social landscapes and institutional processes that eventually impacted the
development of medicine and psychiatric practice, as well as the formation of the penal
system for dealing with transgressors of social norms (madmen). Another example of a

98

macro-level analysis with limited linguistic attention to the analysis is Edward Said’s
(1978) study of the concept of Orientalism; through a critical analysis of Western literary
cultural products over time he demonstrated that the macro-level discourse of Orientalism
permeated and culminated in negative cultural representations of non-Western peoples
and places and was deeply colonial in ideological outlook. Thus, in a general sense,
macro-level analysis is concerned with structures such as genre, paradigms, and models
of understanding that ground knowledge within such frameworks. Within CDA, macrolevel approaches can include analysis of semantic macrostructures, thematic analysis, or
what van Dijk calls schemata, these are the overall forms of a discourse, its superstructure
(1985b, p. 69). In CDA the purpose of a linguistic analysis is to aid the analysis of the
overall discourse as a social phenomenon by providing additional material (linguistic
structures) to use as units of analysis and evidence in explaining social structures.
In terms of a micro-level discourse analysis, there are varying degrees of
emphasis on linguistic features and numerous methods for the analysis of linguistic
structures and characteristics upon which the analyst can choose to focus. For example, in
political discourse, breaking down the strategies of argumentation used in the text in
terms of logos (appeal to reason), pathos (appeal to emotions), ethos (appeal to morality)
is concerned with local meaning. The analyst then delves deeper into the semantic and
syntactic structures of the text to shed further light on the nature of the discourse. Since
CDA is largely descriptive and interpretive in methodological approach, it is essential for
the analyst to situate the micro-level (local) meaning or meanings contained within a text
in the macro-level (global) structure within which the text is contextualized. In other
words, the analysis of the text must be interpreted in terms of its relation to the social

99

structures in which power operates. The combining of “the discursive with the textual,
through a conjunction of analysis of both text and its intertextual context” is one of the
key methodological strengths of CDA (Chouliaraki, 2000, p. 297).
A central aspect of the analysis in this study is examining the evolution of the
dominant newspaper discourses across two endings of the Iraq War, 2003 and 2011. Most
studies of representation tend to focus on how a certain event or issue was represented at
a specific point in time (synchronic) rather than over a certain period of time
(diachronic). The obvious reasons for this are that conducting a diachronic analysis of the
media’s coverage of an issue is laborious and time-intensive. Furthermore, establishing a
suitable period to contextualize the issue remains problematic and highly subjective.
Indeed, van Dijk’s socio-cognitive approach underlines the subjective nature of context;
he defines context as “a specific kind of mental model, that is, as subjective participant
representations of communicative situations, and not as the communicative situations
themselves” (2008b, p. 21). However, in this study context is also understood in the
Foucauldian sense outlined above, that is, tracing the ‘genealogy’ of certain discourses
over time. This study adopts Carvalho’s (2008) framework for tracing such a genealogy
of meanings in media discourses, which incorporates analyzing the sequence of media
texts that appear at key moments. The specific procedures for this analysis are explained
in Chapter Four.
Another important aspect of discourse analysis that CDA practitioners devote
attention to in their examination of texts is the issue of omission. This is sometimes
referred to as deletion as well and is concerned with what is left out of a text in order to
present someone or something in a particular light to make the speaker or writer’s point

100

of view more persuasive. It is in this regard that a purely linguistics-focused analysis or
quantitative content analysis approaches that document frequency and co-location of
words for example – that examine only what is ‘there’ in the text – will inevitably miss
what is not part of the text. In the context of media discourse analysis, these “informative
omissions” (Molina, 2009, p. 187) become critical in revealing strategies of evasiveness,
deceit, or manipulation. Also, related to the issue of omission is the issue of implication,
or what is implied by a statement; a text does not necessarily have to explicitly state
something in order for it to imply something. As Fairclough (1995) points out, “the
unsaid, the already said, the presupposed, is of particular importance in ideological
analysis, in that ideologies are generally embedded within the implicit meaning of a text
rather than being explicit” (p. 108). Presuppositions in texts are an example of textual
features that reveal what the producer of the text takes as ‘given’ or to be understood by
the reader, for instance the phrase ‘the Iran threat’ presupposes that Iran is a threat and is
clearly a value-laden construct.
Foucault’s writings also engage with the topic of silence and the effects it has on
‘truth;’ he elaborates in numerous works how this is achieved discursively through
concepts such as ‘regime of discourse,’ ‘regimes of truth,’ ‘orders of discourse’ and
epistome, and these remain largely relevant in CDA. For example, establishing
parameters of operation for a field of enquiry or selecting a specialized vocabulary, by
default requires a process whereby what is deemed most relevant is selected and what is
deemed less so excluded. Foucault writes:
Silence itself – the things one declines to say, or is forbidden to name… is
less the absolute limit of discourse, the other side from which it is

101

separated by a strict boundary, than an element that functions alongside
the things said, with them and in relation to them within overall
strategies….There is not one but many silences, and they are an integral
part of the strategies that underlie and permeate discourses.” (Foucault,
1978/1990, p. 27).
This understanding of how silences operate within discourses undergirds the CDA
emphasis on the necessity of examining the context within which the text ‘speaks.’

3.3 Critiques of CDA
Although CDA has been firmly established as a research approach in the
humanities and social sciences, there continues to be debate surrounding its limitations
and weaknesses. There have been numerous criticisms of CDA on both theoretical and
methodological grounds (see for example, Billig, 2008a, 2008b; Billig and Schegloff,
1999; Blommaert, 2001, 2005; Breeze, 2011; Hammersley, 1997; Jones, 2007; Jorgensen
& Phillips, 2002; Widdowson, 1995, 1996, 1998; and Verschueren, 2001), with
significant critiques of its philosophical assumptions, its heavy reliance on linguistics at
the expense of other aspects of discourse (e.g. non-discursive, contextual, and societal),
fragmented framework, variation in analytical approaches, and apparent contradictions.
The variation that exists in studies that identify as CDA means that occasionally these
criticisms appear directed at specific theorists or interpretations of CDA; however, here I
will address those that challenge the broader premise of CDA itself.
CDA’s opposition to philosophical presupposition, normative research and values
on truth and objectivity prompted Hammersley (1997) to criticize CDA on several levels.

He argues that advocates of CDA treat the validity of a critical approach as obvious (p.
239) and that much of the research of the ‘critical’ tradition in the social sciences takes
for granted its own philosophical foundations, concluding that “the term ‘critical’ has
become little more than a rallying cry demanding that researchers consider ‘whose side
they are on’.” (p. 244). Hammersley is alluding to the problematic nature of the higher
value placed on the position that the analyst adopts that places her/him on the right side
of morality. However, this type of critique is also levelled at other traditions that also
reject normative schemata such as critical theory, ethnographic studies, social
constructivism, and post-modernism. Like these traditions, CDA has continued to
improve and attract a growing following in academia and as Carvalho (2008) reminds us,
ideological commitment “does not equal analytical distortion.” (p. 162).
Critical discourse analysts have also been criticized for imposing their own
interpretations on texts at the expense of other possible interpretations (Widdowson,
1995, 1996 and 1998). Widdowson (1998) charges that analysts are selective of
fragments of texts that support their argument and disregard inconvenient textual features
(p. 145). Breeze (2011) also highlights that there is a tendency amongst analysts to ignore
“text trajectories” by focusing on fragments of discourses rather than tracing their larger
contextual history which can lead to an incomplete picture of the discourse. (p. 515).
These criticisms can be addressed by the individual analyst and are not necessarily the
result of a defective methodology however; indeed they serve as useful reminders of
retaining analytical rigor.
CDA requires the analyst to make her/his position explicit, but as Fairclough
(1996) points out, CDA need not be oriented towards the political left, and that it is

103

conceivable for those on the right to also perform CDA. This is problematic for
Hammersley (1997) and Breeze (2011) for the same reason that the work of Foucault has
been criticized as being decisionist.9 Hammersley writes that such foundations “allows
political commitments of any kind to govern research…the implication is that all
commitments are necessarily and equally irrational.” (p. 243). This argument suggests
that there are some political viewpoints that are more valid than others and displays an
inherent discomfort with the possibility of researchers being led by political and
ideological convictions rather than scientific ones. However, as discussed above, the
perspective of CDA adopted in this study holds that all political viewpoints are critiqued
and that there is no neutral ground in the traditional positivism-influenced methodologies;
the approach is rather centered on those in power, regardless of where the party in power
might be regarded on the political spectrum.
CDA analysts have also been charged with over-interpretation at the expense of
disregarding the language user’s agency, whether it is the agency of the text producer or
text consumer (reader) (Billig, 2008a, p. 793; Jorgensen & Phillips, 2002, p. 90;
Widdowson, 1995, 1998). Widdowson argues that analysts interpret the ideology of the
text producer vicariously, as well as ignoring the ideological disposition of the reader
which reflects an adoption of a simple transmission model of communication (1995, p.
168). The lack of attention that has been devoted to the reader or listener’s interpretation
of the text is also cited as an overall criticism of CDA studies. Given the interdisciplinary
9

Breeze (2011) writes that “in a post-modern framework, it has been suggested that one simply “chooses”
particular values or stances, in a process of existential selfdefinition [sic] which is sometimes referred to as
decisionism…In this perspective, although we may try to form our commitments by following “rational”
procedures, the fragmentation of the moral and intellectual order is such that it is hard to find consistent
grounds for a rational politics, or for reasoned political discourse, and there is little real hope of furthering
human emancipation.” (p. 500).

104

emphasis of CDA, Breeze cites as a criticism the rare references by CDA practitioners to
the literature from media studies or ethnography of communication to examine audience
effects and responses to discourses. (2011, p. 512). This is a criticism also raised by
Molina (2009), who asserts that many CDA analysts assume a weak and disengaged
audience that is easily manipulated by dominant discourses, and he points to the electoral
successes of left-leaning governments in South America, such as those of Chavez in
Venezuela, Lula in Brazil, Correa in Ecuador, and Morales in Bolivia; these electoral
successes demonstrate that the will of the people can overcome the dominance of media
discourse by elites that were opposed to these leaders (p. 195).
It is ironic that the success of CDA in establishing itself and achieving wider
recognition and acceptance across disciplines, has also led to criticisms of its
institutionalization as part of an academic and therefore elite discourse. For example,
Billig (2003), himself a critical scholar, has been critical of the re-branding of the
analysis of critical discourse into the acronym “CDA” as a marketing ploy as if it is an
intellectual product to become part of the academic economy. (p.46-42). He argues that
this type of standardization can lead to discourse analysis losing its ‘critical’ stance and
establish its own critical orthodoxy. Billig (2008a) critiques analysts’ use of
nominalizations to instantiate their own writings in the same way that they criticize others
for; and particularly points out the development of a “technical language which is filled
with nominalizations rendering processes as entities” (p. 786). The result is a creation of
a specialized language of technical jargon belonging to the world of the initiated (p. 796)
which ensures a formalization of the CDA discourse. Verschueren (2001) was one of the
earlier critics of this happening in CDA, stating that CDA forming its own community of

105

scholars overrides the importance of mutual critique, resulting in an oxymoronic ‘critical
community’ of like-minded scholars (p. 67). In essence this is not wholly dissimilar to
what Foucault says occurred in the formation of the fields of medicine (Foucault,
1978/1995, p. 185) and psychoanalysis (Foucault, 1970/1973, pp. 373-374) through the
development of a disciplinary episteme that contributed to the development of
hierarchical power structures. van Dijk (2008a) reminds us that CDA is principally
concerned with illegitimate uses of language, and the use of nominalization by CDA
scholars is not done so to hide forms of domination (p. 823). Fairclough (2008b) and
Martin (2008) have also defended the use of technical language and nominalizations,
arguing that they are needed in theory development, and to organize discourse building
knowledge, and is therefore essential to academic writing.
Also related to this point is the forming of a discipline that steers away from its
own emphasis on interdisciplinary study towards an over-emphasis on linguistic analysis,
which comes at the expense of understanding the wider societal contexts (Blommaert,
2001, 2005; Jones, 2007; Molina, 2009). Blommaert (2005) criticizes the lack of
historical and contextual analysis that accompanies the linguistic analysis in most CDA
studies, and suggests that this can lead to the analyst ignoring how hegemonic discourses
come in to being in the first place. Jones (20007) goes further stating that linguistics in
general and CDA specifically do not have the tools to meaningfully explain the
connection between discourse and material economic process and the relations between
the dominant and dominated in society in the same way that political writers and activists
can do so using a different set of skills (p. 366). It is also worth bearing in mind that
whilst there are criticisms of the linguistic orientation towards understanding discourses,

106

criticisms pointing in the other direction have also been made, pointing out a lack of
linguistic theory (Widdowson, 1998) or vagueness and ambiguity of the terminology of
CDA (Hammersley, 1997; Billig, 2008a), as well as an over-reliance on social theory to
link the textual analysis to the evaluations made by analysts (Verscheuren, 2001, p. 69).
CDA’s eclectic theoretical epistemology although criticized can also be its
strength, as it can prevent a critical orthodoxy from forming. This is because such
diversity can prevent the formation of rigidity of theoretical approach, which could overregulate and delimit CDA, resulting in a version of institutionalization that can make
CDA less critical. Criticisms about analysts drawing ideologically driven conclusions can
be addressed if researchers make explicit their positionality and agendas. Furthermore,
the researcher should remain attentive to methodological issues such as clarity of usage
of terminology, remain consistent in usage of utilizing social theories to explain discourse
phenomena, and being cautious and measured about the conclusions drawn from the
micro-level discourse within texts about the macro-level discourse about societal
problems. As can be seen from the diversity of literature that this study draws from, my
approach crosses disciplinary boundaries to obtain a deeper understanding of the
institutions of government and media and their relations to each other and the general
public. Drawing from the research of such a diverse range of disciplines also helps
address the charge that most CDA studies ignore the historical and contextual issues
relating to discourses. Issues of representativeness of data and validity are addressed in
Chapter Four, as these are largely dependent on the CDA approach of each individual
study.

107

3.4 CDA in Library and Information Science
The methodological relevance of CDA to LIS is evident because both aim to
address social problems and issues of social justice; in LIS this commitment is reflected
by the core values of the American Libraries Association’s (ALA) such as democracy,
education, diversity, intellectual freedom, the public good and social responsibility
(2004). Mehra, Albright, and Rioux (2006) cite methodology as playing a central role in
enabling research committed to social justice; they, like critical scholars, point to the
inadequacy of traditional positivism-based approaches to responding to issues of power
abuse and discrimination. Oliphant (2015) uses Kelvin Rioux’s five underlying
assumptions of social justice metatheory to make the case for CDA in LIS,10 concluding
that “critical discourse analysts share a political orientation found in the LIS community,
taking a research position that explicitly involves seeking positive, empowering effects
on dominated social groups.” (p. 241).
Although there are very few instances of the explicit reference to CDA in LIS
research, there have been a number of studies that focus on discourse or utilize discourse
analytic tools to address a broad range of LIS concerns. The earlier of these studies
tended to focus on the methodological and theoretical possibilities of discourse analysis
for LIS research (for example, Frohmann, 1994; Budd & Raber, 1996; R. Day, 2000 and
2005; Radford, 1998; Radford & Radford, 2005; Talja, 1999) as well as an application of
a critical approach to the dominant paradigms and streams of theory within LIS (for

10
Rioux’s five underlying assumptions of social justice for LIS are: 1) All human beings have an inherent
worth and deserve information services that help address their information needs. 2) People perceive reality
and information in different ways, often within cultural or life role contexts. 3) There are many different
types of information and knowledge, and these are societal resources.4) Theory and research are pursued
with the ultimate goal of bringing positive change to service constituencies. 5) The provision of
information services is an inherently powerful activity. (Cited in Oliphant, 2015, p. 231).

108

example, Budd, 2006; Frohmann, 1992a, 1992b; Haider & Bawden, 2007; and
Touminen, 1997). A number of other studies have utilized discourse analysis to critique
the LIS profession or its disciplinary publications to trace the development of specific
discourses. For example, M. Day (1998) traces the emergence of transformational
discourse; Hicks (2014) examines the construction of professional identities; Hicks and
Given (2013) apply discourse analysis to chart the evolution of a leadership discourse and
how it has become incorporated into most MLIS programs; Radford (1992, 2003) and
Radford and Radford (2001) have been amongst the major advocates of utilizing
discourse theory and applied it to the study of various discourses within LIS; and Willet
(2016) who examines discourse within the scholarship on the maker movement.
As discourse-related studies (including CDA studies) asserted itself as a
legitimate field of inquiry in the social sciences and humanities, its theories and methods
drew greater academic interest, including from LIS scholars in the last decade. Some of
the discourse studies in LIS have a clear critical orientation for social justice (for
example, Brook, Ellenwood and Lazzaro (2015) focus on the reproduction of racism
through the privileging of whiteness as a default for library standards, values and
practices; Hudson (2012) advocates for a critical stance on the discourse of information
inequality; and Kumasi and Hill (2013) evaluate the workings of ideology behind the
cultural competency discourse. Another set of studies make power relations within
organizational structures their principle focus, (for example, Gallagher, McMenemy and
Poulter (2015) analyze the language of acceptable use policies in Scottish public libraries;
Hedemark, Hedman and Sundin (2005) identify various discourses and how these lead to
the reproduction of inequality of power between users and librarians; Stevenson (2001)

109

uses Fairclough’s model of textually oriented discourse analysis (TODA) to examine
policy documents concerning the funding of Canadian Community Information Centres
and how information is treated as a commodity within a capitalist discourse; and Wadas
(2017) who conducts a discourse analysis of library mission statements to examine how
closely they resemble those of their parent institutions). The studies mentioned above are
not a complete list as there have been some other LIS studies that utilize discourse
analysis on a diverse range of topics, however, what is clear from a general search in the
leading LIS databases is that these are few in number; for instance, there were no
discourse analysis articles published before the 1990s, and only around forty since, and of
these only a handful make explicit reference to CDA. The rest of this section will
summarize some of the studies that are most closely related to CDA, and then situate this
dissertation within the LIS / CDA corpus.
Bernd Frohmann (1992a, 1992b, and 1994) was one of the first to recognize the
value of a critical approach to dominant theoretical paradigms within LIS. His works
proposed discourse analysis for investigating talk and text within the discursive practices
of librarianship in addition to critiquing conceptualizations of ‘information’ within LIS
scholarship. Frohmann (1994) demonstrated the various ways that concepts such as
information and information use are discursively constructed, and how information users’
identities are constructed as to present a particular identity (for example, library user as
consumer) as natural or objective; his work also highlighted the role that social and
institutional practices play in achieving “closure over the discursive elements available to
articulate social and personal identities.” (p. 135). Frohmann (1992a, 1992b) adopts a
Foucauldian discourse analysis of the archaeology of the LIS discipline, arguing that LIS

110

theory is unreflective about its underpinnings and that concepts such as an information
‘user’ and ‘generator’ remain uncontested within the dominant cognitive discourse. He
goes on to charge that:
The cognitive viewpoint presents itself neither as one theory among many,
nor as a local theory of specific problems, but as a total theory for LIS,
and as its only theory. It occupies not only the LIS homelands but also
colonizes its hinterlands, silencing theoretical guerrilla movements by the
imposition of a universal discourse. (Frohmann, 1992b, p. 371)
Frohmann’s analysis is thus, congruent with Foucault’s conceptualization of discourse,
demonstrating how knowledge is constructed and how power operates through specific
discursive procedures which permeate and control the scholarly terrain. Frohmann
(1992a, 1992b) thus demonstrates how the cognitive paradigm in LIS has obtained
hegemonic control over the field not just through its delimitation of conceptualizations
such as ‘information’, ‘document’, ‘users’, ‘knowledge stores’, etc., but also through
setting the parameters of what constitutes the discipline of information science.
The discursive structures of LIS that enable its existence as a discursive formation
are also addressed by several other LIS scholars. Radford (1992, 1998, and 2003) has
argued that much of LIS scholarship is inward-looking, pointing out that it “develops and
uses a specialized vocabulary that differentiates its users from those in fields such as
sociology, psychology, or philosophy. It is the discourse of a particular intellectual
community and is institutionalized through specific professional associations, journals,
and conferences. Taken together, this talk in these contexts forms an easily recognizable
discursive formation.” (Radford, 2003, p. 5). R. Day (2005) has also commented on the

111

general resistance to post-structuralism within LIS as a result of its historical anxiety over
its disciplinary status and what he calls an “obsession over creating a uniform sense of
theory” (p. 591). Much LIS scholarship is still entrenched within a positivist view of
knowledge that understands it as “an independent object that can be stored, classified,
and arranged in an objective manner.” (Radford, 1992, p. 410). As a result of this, there
are fewer challenges to the established orthodoxies of the discipline, including theoretical
and methodological approaches, which is why CDA and other closely related
philosophical movements remain on the outskirts of the discipline.
Budd and Raber (1996) and Budd (2006) also make the case for the use of
discourse analysis (closely related to but distinct from CDA) as an approach to
information problems, as it is concerned with both the form and functions of
communication. The LIS profession is preoccupied with the intersection of information,
communications and technologies – as well as with the role Information Communication
Technologies (ICTs) play in facilitating the plethora of objectives of information
professionals revolving around access, organization, storage and retrieval. Budd and
Raber (1996) propose that discourse analysis can be useful for penetrating tacit forms of
knowledge in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the workings of discourse in
formal structures in the form of cognitive, psychological, and emotional insights (p. 220).
Whilst Budd (2006), Budd and Raber (1996), R. Day (2000, 2005), Frohmann
(1992a, 1992b, 1994), and Radford’s (1992, 1998, 2003) work does not utilize the term
‘CDA’ it does resemble many of its principle features (e.g. heavily influenced by
Foucault, concern with discursive formations and the effects these have on the
conceptualization of inequitable relations between user and librarian for instance); a

112

noticeable exception however, is the absence of a detailed attention to linguistic analysis.
The lack of attention to detailed linguistic analysis of discourse is also noticeable in most
of the LIS scholarship that uses discourse analytical approaches; this scholarship has
largely been influenced by the important contributions of Budd, R. Day, Frohmann and
Radford but there remains a void in terms of CDA. A citation analysis study of the
references to Foucault’s seminal works Archaeology of Knowledge (1972) and The Order
of Things (1970/1973) in LIS journal found there was limited use of these works by LIS
scholars; and even discourse analysis studies tended to engage with secondary works that
explained Foucault’s ideas through the works of scholars such as Budd, Frohmann or
Radford rather than turning directly to the original works themselves (Dewey, 2016, p.
474). Part of the reason for the limited use of critical theory, post-structuralism or
postmodernist ideas is due to the ‘classical’ (outdated) manner in which information
science treats history (R. Day, 2005, p. 579) with little regard for the historical
discontinuities or the rejection of the notion of truth as a discursive construction
emphasized in the works of Foucault and others.
In addition to theoretical critiques of LIS that form a key body of the discourse
analysis literature, there are numerous other studies that adopt discourse analysis to
examine a wide range of texts, issues and discourses in the field. For instance, Haider and
Bawden (2007) employed discourse analysis for tracing the ontological roots of the
notion of information poverty in LIS scholarly journal articles. Although the authors do
not refer to the study as a CDA, their theoretical ambitions and Foucauldian approach
resemble some features of the historically oriented critical discourse analysis, also

113

sometimes referred to as the Vienna school approach.11 Moreover the study is concerned
with the role played by the LIS discourse to fix concepts such as information or
knowledge in order to stabilize the relations between user and librarian and thereby
concentrate power in the hands of LIS professionals. Amongst other things, they
conclude that the discourse of information poverty involves the discursive construction of
an “information poor” and a positioning of the LIS professional, armed with a specialized
knowledge as the savior; and that various discursive procedures tie the “information
poor” to the LIS profession and its institutions, thereby lending LIS an ethical dimension
to its practices (p. 552).
Another related study by Hudson’s (2012) advocated for LIS to adopt a more
critical approach to Western discourse on global inequality, suggesting that practitioners
have paid scant attention to the assumptions inherent in the discourse of development (p.
70), and accepted the taken-for-granted language of the information inequality (digital
divide) narrative which is inattentive to the role of colonial legacies (p. 79). Hudson
conducts a textual critique of LIS literature through “a critical unpacking of the discourse
of “information inequality” as a key conceptual constellation through which LIS
communities have tended to articulate concern for global inequalities and desire for
transformative intervention….[but] such uncritical acceptance and reproduction of such a
discourse results in the unwitting reinforcement of presumptions of civilizational
superiority through notions of Western “information societies” and invention of ICTs.”

11
The Discourse-Historical Approach to CDA was developed by Ruth Wodak and her associates at the
University of Vienna, and is a method that is concerned with charting the intertextual history of phrases and
arguments; its distinctive features are that it combines theories and methods (including ethnography); it
takes account of historical context in interpreting texts and discourse which permits the analyst to
reconstruct how recontextualization functions in the linking of texts and discourses over time. (Blommaert,
2005, p. 28; Wodak, 2015, p. 2).

114

(p. 83). In terms of the analysis, there is a clear emphasis on language features such as
word choice and metaphors in addition to the focus on narratives and themes. Hudson
concludes that the LIS profession and its accompanying discourse remains fixated on
conceptual narratives of “information poverty” and “digital divides” without
acknowledging the legacies of colonialism, and the West’s historical and present-day role
in globalization practices which only perpetuates the discrimination discursively.
Studies of discourse in the LIS field demonstrate the versatility of discourse
analysis as it has been applied in many different ways and to various types of texts (e.g.
government policy documents, library policies, library and university mission statements,
scholarly articles, or interview transcriptions) in order to investigate a range of discourses
which are more often than not, related to the functioning of power relations in society.
Most of these however would not fall under the umbrella of critical studies, although
they may have critical dimensions. For example, Hicks’ (2014) study of interpretive
repertories that librarians use to construct their professional identities focuses
predominantly on what was said in the texts (which included LIS literature, discussion
boards and interviews), and takes note of the prominence, recurring themes, word choice
and descriptions (which are all important in critical discourse analysis too) with limited
attention to how it was said, and linguistically constructed. Whilst not denying the value
of the study, Hicks does not devote much direct attention to the deconstruction of the
workings of ideology in the discourse structure. This is not a criticism of the study but
rather, is intended to illuminate the difference between discourse analysis and CDA.
Other examples of studies which would not come under critical studies include Hicks and
Given, 2013; Rabina, Drabinkski & Paradise, 2016; or Wadas, 2017. There are natural

115

overlaps between the two approaches, for example, the interest in the formation of
knowledge, and its relation to power, understood through how specific knowledge
structures become hegemonic. But, these studies are not necessarily dealing with a social
injustice, redressing social wrongs, or seeking to unearth the illegitimacy of hegemonic
discourses in the same way that CDA and this dissertation seek to. In many ways this has
largely to do with the positivist traditions of LIS that still dominate research approaches
in the sense that researchers still seek to find that ideal neutral, unbiased, and objective
ground to stand on. This point is echoed by Jaeger, Bertot and Gorham (2013) who
bemoan the lack of attention to and awareness of within the LIS profession of politics, its
effects on policy, and how librarians can advocate against damaging policies such as
library closures or underfunding. Their recommendations that LIS research and education
needs to address politics and policy issues more effectively rather than remain
disengaged, searching for that ever elusive neutral ground coincides with the broader
aims of CDA mentioned above. M. Day (1998) in his study of the influence of
transformative discourse within LIS argues that there is a tendency in LIS to adopt
dominant discourses in the managerial culture (such as corporate organization and
corporate culture discourses which are often seeped in capitalist discourse) which results
in the acceptance of the prevailing order and conditions (p. 3). CDA as a methodological
approach aims to de-naturalize these accepted orders of discourse by critiquing the
dominant models of thought or readily accepted consensuses that prevail.
In summary, this study aims to put into practice the recommendations of LIS
theorists such as Frohmann and Budd for researchers in the field to pursue discourse
studies as a way of enhancing the critical scholarship tradition within the discipline. As

116

mentioned, the concern with social justice issues has been central to the tradition of the
LIS field with research championing equal access to information for instance. This
dissertation treats the Iraq War as an injustice and highlights the need for a news
discourse that illuminates the true outcomes and consequences of the war. Therefore, this
study, by scrutinizing critical information products such as news reports, is also
concerned with predominant LIS issues such as the accuracy and reliability of
information sources.

117

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY
The analytical framework for CDA in this study is based on Carvalho’s (2008)
model for analyzing media discourse, and has been adapted in order to meet the specific
research aims of this study. To recap, these are: (1) to shed light on the dominant
discourses that are embedded in news coverage of the ending of the Iraq War in four
major National newspapers (The New York Times (NYT), The Washington Post (WP), The
Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and USA Today); (2) to demonstrate using CDA how meaning
of the ending of the war was discursively constructed in 2003 and 2011; and (3) to
illustrate how news is an informational product that is not free of ideology by uncovering
patterns and thematic structures of discourses within the coverage that either discursively
reproduce or challenge the injustices of the Iraq War. The essential methodological
concepts of the analytical method have been influenced by various theorists but remains
largely Foucauldian in character, in that discourses are understood as broader frameworks
of interpretation that delimit the parameters of dialogue and regulate how reality is
textually constructed. Central to this objective is highlighting the workings of ideology
within discourses, how this is achieved is discussed in detail below. This chapter also
describes the method of data collection and analysis, the specific procedures of
Carvalho’s (2008) framework, and addresses the issues of validity and reliability.

118

4.1 Data Collection and Analysis
The newspaper articles from NYT, WP, and USA Today were retrieved from the
LexisNexis Academic database, whereas WSJ articles were retrieved from the Factiva
database. The search query “Iraq” AND “War” (appearing anywhere in the text), was
used to identify articles from two periods (see Table 4.1 below for exact dates) in which
the American President announced the ending of the Iraq War. Articles were then
selected based on relevance to the topic of this dissertation. This involved an open-ended
reading of the retrieved texts, paying close attention to headlines and lead paragraphs to
ascertain an article’s relevance. The sample of articles selected directly addressed the
ending of the war, specifically, its outcomes, consequences and the issue of
responsibility. The dates of news coverage were based on Presidential announcements of
the ending of the Iraq War, as these are deemed to be critical discourse moments in the
news coverage. Carvalho defines critical discourse moments as “periods that involve
specific happenings, which may challenge the “established” discursive positions. Various
factors may define these key moments: political activity, scientific findings or other
socially relevant events.” (2008, p. 166). The focus on these critical discourse moments
also enables the researcher to restrict the amount of data to ensure the feasibility of the
study. Those articles that merely mentioned the Iraq War but were not directly about the
ending were not selected for analysis. Complete transcripts of the President’s speeches,
book reviews and letters to the editor were also weeded out at this stage. The May 2003
and December 2011 ‘endings’ were selected for comparison in this study as these two
periods marked points closest to the beginning and official end of the conflict (there had
been news coverage about the drawing down of the conflict in Iraq in 2009, 2010 and

119

earlier in 2011). In addition, examining the coverage from 2003 and 2011 would enable
to highlight the evolution of discourse over a longer period of time as well as between
different administrations. Furthermore, restricting the scope and data was necessary in
order to attain the richness of textual and contextual analysis that CDA seeks to. This
process resulted in a total of 219 articles (158 from May 2003 and 61 from December
2011) being selected across all four newspapers shown in Table 4.1 below.

For the textual and contextual analyses components, important metadata such as
date, headline, byline, article type (e.g. editorial, op-ed), location (e.g. section, page
number), and article word length were documented for all 219 articles. Data such as word
length and article location was used as indicators of importance attached to a report by
the newspaper. These articles were then analyzed and coded using NVivo 11 Pro – a
qualitative data analysis software. Similar to many grounded theory approaches to
coding, the newspaper articles were analyzed using open-coding, which aimed to capture
all the different ways the outcomes, consequences and attribution of responsibility in the
war were represented. The process of open-coding involved a line-by-line reading and
120

designation of meaning within texts into appropriate categories of discourses. So for
example, if an article contained a reference to a successful military mission, the reference
was coded under ‘military operation as a success.’ Once numerous such codes had been
developed, axial coding was used whereby the data within the open codes was integrated
and re-categorized into broader discourse categories. So for example, in analyzing the
outcomes of the war, the openly coded discourses of ‘liberating Iraqis’,
‘democratization’, ‘women’s liberation’, and ‘justice for Iraqis by holding former regime
officials to account’ were all re-categorized under the overarching discourse of ‘removal
of dictatorship.’ As highlighted in earlier discussions about the aims of CDA, this
approach enabled the identification of the sustained discourses, themes, narratives,
representations and ideological perspectives that appeared in multiple texts over the
course of the selected coverage and therefore allowed a more meaningful interpretation of
the vast data set. Once all articles had been analyzed in this way, the dominant discourses
concerning the outcomes, consequences and attribution of responsibility were ranked for
each newspaper by prevalence in the overall data set. These results were then used to
conduct a contextual analysis; these were then compiled into summaries and are
presented in Chapters Five, Six and Seven (also see Appendix A and Appendix B for
coding summaries).
Following the contextual analysis, key articles from 2003 and 2011 were chosen
for detailed textual analysis. As is typically the case in many CDA studies, the amount of
data selected for such an analysis has to be restricted in order to achieve the level of
detail which can enable a thorough deconstruction of discourses and demonstrate how
these operate within a single text. Therefore, one major article from each newspaper for

121

2003 and 2011 was selected, making a total of 8 articles. For 2003, articles from May 2nd
were chosen as it was the first Presidential announcement of the end of major combat
operations. For 2011, articles were selected from December 16th, as all the newspapers in
this study reported the official ending of the war (marked by a formal ceremony held in
Baghdad on December 15th) as lead stories.

4.2 Carvalho’s (2008) Framework for Media Discourse Analysis
Carvalho’s model for analyzing media discourses is well-suited to address the
concerns of this dissertation as it integrates several elements of analysis (detailed below)
and crucially offers a procedure that addresses the synchronic and diachronic temporal
dimensions. Carvalho’s framework promotes analyzing an extended period of time
thereby privileging the analysis of continuity (and discontinuity) in media discourse over
episodic analysis. The original model actually places the textual analysis as preceding the
contextual analysis, however for this study, it was decided that analyzing the larger
corpus of data (219 articles) using NVivo 11 Pro would offer an understanding of the
wider context of the 8 articles chosen for textual analysis. Starting out from a larger data
set and narrowing down to a more granular level of analysis would also aid in the
presentation of findings. Below is an outline of the key features of the methodology,
followed by a detailed description of each component.

Contextual Analysis
In this stage of the CDA the aim is to analyze the coverage beyond individual

news articles and examine the overall coverage of an event in a particular newspaper, as
well as the wider social context. It is therefore necessary to establish how many texts are
dedicated to each event in a given amount of time (see section on data collection above).
As Carvalho highlights, the number of texts is indicative of the importance attributed by a
news outlet to an event (2008, p. 171). In addition, collecting data on the number of
articles appearing in a given period also enables a comparison of changes in the amount
of coverage across different time periods as well as across different newspapers.
The second research question of this study (What were the similarities and
differences in the discourse of the selected newspapers in the 2003 and 2011 ‘endings’ of
the Iraq War?) is concerned with understanding how discourse evolved over time.
Carvalho’s (2008) CDA framework accounts for the temporal aspect of discourses by
focusing on two time-related dimensions of analysis, synchronic and diachronic. The
principle methods employed are comparison and historical analysis, thus requiring a

123

comparative-synchronic analysis and a historical-diachronic analysis. In order to aid the
contextual analysis, the dominant discourses concerning the outcomes, consequences, and
attribution of responsibility for the consequences of the war were coded, organized into
summaries and then ranked (see Appendix A and Appendix B). The rankings of
discourses were determined by the number of times a particular discourse had appeared
in the articles of a particular newspaper. So for example, in 2003 there were 27 articles
about the war’s ending USA Today, of these 18 articles (or 67 percent) characterized the
outcomes of the war as a success; 10 articles (or 37 percent) emphasized the uncertainty
over Iraq’s future as an outcome; 9 articles (or 33 percent) highlighted the war’s failures
and removal of the dictatorship as important outcomes; and 7 articles (26 percent)
contained the discourse of U.S. reconstruction of Iraq as an outcome. In this way, those
discourses deemed most prominent were analyzed and discussed in the results. The same
procedure of ranking discourses was followed for consequences and attribution of
responsibility. It is also worth re-stating that a single article can contain numerous
discourses, which for example, can characterize the war’s outcomes as both success as
well as failure. The methodology applied here does not attempt to quantify how much of
an article contains a particular discourse; CDA acknowledges that this is a highly
subjective process whereby the researcher attempts to ascertain what the most dominant
discourses on a particular issue across multiple texts.

1. Comparative-synchronic analysis
A comparative-synchronic analysis means examining various representations
(news articles) of an issue or event at a specific point in time. This involves comparing

124

one text with others published within the same period by different authors in the same
news outlet and in others (Carvalho, 2008, p. 171). By comparing different media
depictions of reality, a more accurate or complete picture of the event can be formed
(than by focusing on just individual texts for instance). In addition, this also enables a
better assessment of the author’s discursive interventions in the creation of certain
realities. A comparative-synchronic approach thus helps identify the specific discursive
traits of a given news outlet (Carvalho, 2008, p. 172). In this dissertation, the primary
focus of the comparative-synchronic analysis is on the outcomes, consequences, and
attribution of responsibility for these.

2. Historical-diachronic analysis
There are two levels at which the historical-diachronic analysis takes place: 1)
examining the evolution of an event and its wider socio-political context; 2) examining
the temporal evolution of media discourses about a given event or issue which culminates
in a history of media constructions about the event or issue (Carvalho, 2008, p. 172). At
the first level, the analyst has to account for the historical conditions and contexts within
which texts have been produced. This requires an interdisciplinary approach that
incorporates the contributions of related disciplines such as political science,
communications, sociology, and history to the analysis of media discourses on relevant
topics such as the global War on Terror in the case of the Iraq War. Much of this has been
presented already in Chapter Two.
At a second level, examining the temporal evolution of a mediated discourse
“involves looking at the sequence of discursive constructions of an issue and assessing its

125

significance.” (Carvalho, 2008, p. 172). Pertinent questions for the analyst to ask at this
stage include: How did representations of reality at one point in time impact
representations at later points? How were such representations reproduced or challenged
in subsequent representations? Once again it is important for the analyst to bear in mind
the socio-political and socio-cultural significance and implications of dominant
discourses, such as the impact these might have on government or military agendas as
well as the public debate about certain events or issues. Carvalho underlines the critical
importance of ascertaining the sequential development of events and construction of
issues for understanding the present (2008, p. 172). The resemblance to Foucault’s
concept of genealogy that involves tracing the life-span of certain discourses in order to
understand the socio-political arrangements of the present is apparent. Furthermore,
Foucault’s remarks on the analytical approach are also pertinent, he states:
One has to dispense with the constituent subject, to get rid of the subject
itself, that’s to say, to arrive at an analysis which can account for the
constitution of the subject within a historical framework. And this is what
I would call a genealogy, that is, a form of history which can account for
the constitution of knowledge, discourses, domains of objects, etc.,
without having to make reference to a subject which is either
transcendental in relation to the field of events or runs in its empty
sameness throughout the course of history.” (Foucault & Rabinow, 1984,
p. 59)
It is hoped that by undertaking these procedures, the discursive effects of media discourse
are also identified. In order to aid the organization and a clearer presentation of the results

126

of the historical – diachronic analysis, the findings are presented separately in Chapter 7
comparing analyses from 2003 and 2011.

II.

Textual analysis
This approach focuses the analysis on six areas of the text in the newspaper

articles which matter the most in the construction of meaning. The importance of each
area is explained in detail below. As various CDA researchers have emphasized, the
analyst must continuously examine what is both present in the text as well as what is
absent (see for example, Fairclough, 1995; 2003; Gee, 2011; or van Dijk, 2009a).
Additionally, the analyst must bear in mind how the inclusion and exclusion of
information gives meaning to the discourse on an issue. (Carvalho, 2008, p. 171). The
procedures outlined below were used in the detailed textual analysis of 8 selected articles.

1. Layout and Structural Organization
Carvalho refers to specific “surface” elements in the structuring of a text such as
article location in the newspaper or the size of the article as playing a key role “in the
definition of what is at stake, as well as the overall interpretation of an issue” which can
reveal more about the valuation of the issue by a given news outlet (2008, p. 167). The
headline and lead not only serve the function of summarizing the key information the
news item (Fairclough, 2003, p. 74) but also activates general social knowledge (van
Dijk, 2003, p. 99). As mentioned above, various metadata on each news article was
collected as these are helpful in getting an overview of the data set and do enable some
useful inferences to be made regarding issues of importance or salience. In the interests

127

of keeping the data to a manageable size, this study does not examine any accompanying
images even though these can add additional meaning to an article. As highlighted in
Chapter Three, conducting a visual discourse analysis of images requires a different set of
methodological procedures in addition to conducting a detailed textual analysis;
moreover, images are still dependent on the accompanying text to give meaning to them.

2. Objects
The objects of the text are similar to topics and themes but enhance the
conceptualization of discourses constituting rather than merely referencing the realities at
stake (Carvalho, 2008, p. 167). Identifying objects helps in deconstructing the role of
discourses. For example, in the case of the War on Terror, broader objects that are
constructed as part of its discourse are the topics of intelligence and national security,
humanitarian issues, or international solidarity. The objects can also be more specific, for
instance, how the War on Terror impacts airport security. An important question to
consider in the case of the ending of the Iraq War is what events and specific issues are
associated to the broader discourse being constructed? For example, does the article
support or oppose the policy of troop withdrawal? Addressing such aspects of the text is
likely to reflect the political standing of certain discourses.

3. Actors
Here the analyst seeks to illuminate the identity and representation of principle
actors; this includes the individuals, groups, organizations or institutions that are referred
to in the text, either by direct quotation or otherwise. Carvalho notes:

128

The term ‘‘actors’’ in this analysis means both social agents (someone
who has the capacity of doing something) and characters in a (staged)
story (which is ultimately what news reports are). Actors are then both
subjects – they do things – and objects – they are talked about. (Carvalho,
2008, p. 168)
A useful tool for extrapolating the workings of ideology and a strategy of polarization in
the construction of the identity and agency of social actors is what van Dijk (1998) calls
the ‘ideological square.’ It involves creating an “US” vs. “Them” framework which, 1)
emphasizes our good properties/actions; 2) emphasizes their bad properties/actions; 3)
mitigates our bad properties/actions; and 4) and mitigates their good properties/actions (p.
33).
Numerous CDA scholars have written about the major role that language (and
ideology) plays in constructing identity, group identities, relations and images of social
actors. An examination of the representation of actors in texts plays an essential role in
helping our understanding of their perceived influence in shaping the overall meaning of
the text. Important questions to ask are whose perspectives dominate the text? What
“framing power” do social actors have in relation to the media? Regarding framing,
Carvalho states:
Framing power may be defined as the capacity of one actor to convey
her/his views and positions through the media, by having them represented
by journalists either in the form of quotes or regular text. Having the
predominant framing power in relation to a certain issue is an important
form of social influence. (Carvalho, 2008, p. 168)

129

As highlighted in Chapter Two, there are certain actors, for example, Presidents and highranked government officials that are more likely to be quoted and given voice in media
coverage on account of the public office they hold.

4. Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
This dimension of the analysis zeroes in on the lexical choices that are made by
the author/s of the text as vocabulary (verbs, adjectives and adverbs) directly influence
how meaning is created and realities represented. As many CDA scholars advocate, it is
also important to pay attention to the grammar of a text, such as its syntactic features
(presuppositions, nominalizations and active/passive sentences) which can shed light on
issues of agency as well as ideological viewpoint. The final part of the linguistic analysis
pays close attention to the rhetoric of the text, which includes an examination of
important metaphors and persuasion devices that are employed (by both social actors as
well as those of journalists), as these can be employed to appeal to emotions. There are
other CDA approaches that focus far more heavily on linguistic analyses that require an
advanced knowledge of specialist branches of linguistics such as pragmatics, semantics
and syntax, however, Carvalho’s model adapted for this study is limited to the aspects
listed above (2008, pp. 168-9).

5. Discursive Strategies
“Discursive strategies are forms of discursive manipulation of reality by social
actors, including journalists, in order to achieve a certain effect or goal.” (Carvalho, 2008,
p. 169). The implication however is not of an illegitimate shaping of reality but rather a

130

discursive intervention. One such discursive intervention to look out for in the text is the
process of claims making, and examining the strategies involved in “showing”,
“proving”, or “calling attention” to a given argument. (Carvalho, 2008, p. 169). For
example, how does the use of sources add weight to the argument being presented?
Carvalho identifies four key discursive strategies that require attention in
undertaking CDA, these are: 1) the angle of the reality being presented which is integral
to the framing of that reality; 2) positioning; 3) legitimation and 4) politicization. The
‘angle’ ought to be understood in terms of framing as an action or operation, rather than
as something that is a fixed entity. Similar to Entman’s (1993; 2007) understanding of
framing, framing involves the organization, selection and composition of the discourse to
promote a certain point of view. Selection focuses on what information (facts, opinions,
perspectives, etc.) is included or excluded in the frame. Composition is concerned with
how these elements are arranged in order to produce a specific meaning for the issue or
event being described. As highlighted in Chapter Three, critical scholars view the
language choices made by authors as inherently political; Carvalho also points out that
framing is thus an inherent operation in the construction of texts when talking about
reality (2008, p. 169).
“Positioning is a discursive strategy that involves constructing social actors into a
certain relationship with others, that may, for instance, entitle them to do certain things”
(Carvalho, 2008, p. 169). It is therefore concerned with the process of constructing the
identity of the subject through discourse. Thirdly, legitimation involves the justification
and sanctioning of certain actions or authority and the reasoning behind these. The fourth
discursive strategy highlighted in Carvalho’s model is politicization which is how issues,

131

actions or events are given political attributes so as to give a political stance or
understanding of the issue. For example, how the representation of an event such as a
gun-related homicide in the U.S. can become a political issue about fire-arm control that
focuses either on tighter regulatory policies or about punishing such crimes with severer
penalties. As many other CDA theorists point out, Carvalho’s model also acknowledges
the importance of the reverse of these discursive strategies such as de-legitimation and
de-politicization (2008, p. 170). Others such as Chilton have said on this issue:
[Delegitimization] can manifest itself in acts of negative other –
presentation, acts of blaming, scape-goating, marginalising, excluding,
attacking the moral character of some individual or group, attacking the
communicative cooperation of the other, attacking the rationality and
sanity of the other. The extreme is to deny the humanness of the other.”
(Chilton, 2004, p. 47)
The procedure for analyzing discursive strategies must discriminate between the
journalist’s strategy from those of the actors mentioned in the text. For the purposes of
this dissertation however, the primary focus shall remain on the media discourses, that is
the newspapers’ construction of discourses. The reason for this is that examining the
discursive strategies of all social actors such as government officials, would also require a
detailed examination of other forums and documents where such actors might air their
views (e.g. televised speeches, websites, press releases etc.) which is beyond the scope of
this study. Nevertheless, analyzing the discursive strategies of the journalists and
comparing these to those of the key actors in the texts (as exemplified through quotations
in the news articles), can enhance our understanding of how media discourse reproduces

132

or challenges such perspectives, and also shed light on what the dominant perspectives in
the media are.

6. Ideological Standpoints
This part of the textual analysis is directly related to the third research question of
this dissertation which is about unearthing the ideologies shaping the discursive
construction of the ending of the Iraq War. As van Dijk points out, ideologies are not
simply true or false, they rather represent the “possibly partisan, self-serving ‘truth’ of a
social group.” (1995b, p. 246). Fairclough also highlights that it is the presentation of a
discourse as naturalized that is of concern to CDA stating:
“Ideology is most effective when its workings are least visible….And
invisibility is achieved when ideologies are brought to discourse not as
explicit elements of the text, but as the background assumptions which on
the one hand lead the text producer to ‘textualize’ the world in a particular
way, and on the other hand lead the interpreter to interpret the text in a
particular way.” (1989, p. 85)
One particularly helpful schema for ideology advocated by van Dijk identifies five areas
that can be helpful at identifying ideology. These can be summarized as:
•

Membership devices (who belongs to us?)

•

Typical acts (what do we do?)

•

Aims (why do we do it?)

•

Relations with other (opponent) groups

•

Resources, includes access to public discourse (2009a, p. 79).

133

Carvalho’s conceptualization of the discursive realization of ideology also
requires understanding ideology as an overarching aspect of the text (2008, p. 170). In
other words, it is not something that can simply be extrapolated from examining one
particular feature of the text but is rather constitutive of the entire discourse (and is
therefore expressed in all of the textual features outlined in her framework). Despite this,
it is not always straightforward bringing to light the ideological standpoints of an author,
especially because appearing balanced, fair or unbiased is at the core of the news-making
process. One approach to identifying ideological standpoints is looking at alternative
constructions of the same realities by comparing media reports on the same events, and
also comparing the news articles with factual information about that event (for instance,
the information presented in newspaper reports compared with information from other
sources such as government reports or NGO reports).

4.3 Reliability and Validity
Questions regarding criticisms and weaknesses of CDA as an approach have
already been discussed in detail in Chapter Three. CDA as an interpretive enterprise
leaves ample scope for the validity of the analyst’s claims to be subjected to scrutiny and
contestation. Despite differences in the model applied in this study and Gee’s (2011)
model for CDA,12 Gee advocates four key areas to be scrutinized to enhance the validity

12

Gee’s (2011) model for CDA identifies seven ‘building tasks, that require the analyst to ask the following
set of questions related to each building task but acknowledges that although not all of these may be
necessary to raise, a critic can raise the unanswered questions as a criticism.
1. Significance: How are situated meanings, social languages, figured worlds, intertextuality,
Discourses, and Conversations being used to build relevance or significance for things and people
in context?
2. Practices (Activities): How are situated meanings, social languages, figured worlds, intertextuality,
Discourses, and Conversations being used to enact a practice (activity) or practices (activities) in
context?

134

of claims made by the researcher. These are: convergence; agreement; coverage; and
linguistic details (2011, p. 123). Convergence refers to the compatibility of the findings
between each of the areas of textual analysis and contextual analysis identified.
Agreement relates to the level of conviction “native speakers of the social languages and
members of the [d]iscourses being implicated in the data agree that the analysis reflects
how such languages actually functions in such setting” and the more other data analysts
support the conclusions reached also increases the validity. Inevitably this is something
that takes time until other research is published on similar data. Thirdly, coverage is
concerned with the how much the analysis and findings can be applied to related sorts of
data (e.g. other informational / news products). “This includes being able to makes sense
of what has come before and after the situation being analyzed and being able to predict
the sorts of things that might happen in related sorts of situations.” (Gee, 2011, p. 123).
The fourth area of validity refers to linguistic details. The validity of the analysis
increases the more it is tied to the linguistic structure. (Gee, 2011, p. 123). In other words,
the analyst must be able to produce linguistic features from the text as evidence for the
claims being made. In addition, to the above four criteria, also relevant to the aims of

3.

4.

6.

7.

Identities: How are situated meanings, social languages, figured worlds, intertextuality,
Discourses, and Conversations being used to enact and depict identities (socially significant kinds
of people)?
Relationships: How are situated meanings, social languages, figured worlds, intertextuality,
Discourses, and Conversations being used to build and sustain (or change or destroy) social
relationships?
Politics: How are situated meanings, social languages, figured worlds, intertextuality, Discourses,
and Conversations being used to create, distribute, or withhold social goods or to construe
particular distributions of social goods as “good” or “acceptable” or not?
Connections: How are situated meanings, social languages, figured worlds, intertextuality,
Discourses, and Conversations being used to make things and people connected or relevant to each
other or irrelevant to or disconnected from each other?
Sign Systems and knowledge: How are situated meanings, social languages, figured worlds,
intertextuality, Discourses, and Conversations being used to privilege or disprivilege different sign
systems (language, social languages, other sorts of symbol systems) and ways of knowing? (2011,
pp. 121-122).

135

CDA is the notion of fruitfulness of the analysis.13 Jorgensen and Phillips explain that
fruitfulness emphasizes the importance of producing new knowledge “that may foster
new types of thinking and action.” (2002, p. 172) but acknowledge that how this is
applied can vary depending on the researcher’s perspective on the status of scientific
knowledge and her/his perspective on what it should be used for (p. 173).
The issue of reliability is not as great a consideration in qualitative research as it
is in quantitative research as there is a “fundamental assumption of multiple, changing
realities” which asserts the importance of the researcher’s own continually changing
understanding of the object of study (Lindlof & Taylor, 2011, p. 272). Furthermore, CDA
acknowledges that each researcher is likely to interpret and read the data (newspapers)
differently (as indeed are the wider public), and therefore, CDA recognizes and embraces
the variation that can occur in different and competing interpretations. In this way, CDA
practitioners differ from the recommendations of Lincoln, Guba and Shenton (cited in
Shenton (2004, p. 64)) for ensuring the trustworthiness of research by adopting constructs
that correspond to criteria employed in a positivist tradition (e.g. credibility in preference
to internal validity; transferability in preference to generalizability; dependability in
preference to reliability; and confirmability in preference to objectivity).
Despite the differing views on how to ascertain validity and whether there is a
universally acceptable set of criteria to determine it, Jorgensen and Phillips stress, the
importance of the researcher explicating the validity criteria s/he intends to follow so that
the reader is able to critique and evaluate the findings before accepting or rejecting the
claims (2002, pp. 173-147). In addition, the inclusion of supporting evidence in the form

13

Jorgensen and Phillips (2002) examine Potter & Wetherell’s (1987) criteria for fruitfulness as potentially
useful for discourse-related qualitative research (pp. 172-4).

136

of excerpts and quotations allows readers to make their own assessments of the analyst’s
interpretations as well as allowing them to make their own.

137

CHAPTER 5
MAY 2003: “MISSION ACCOMPLISHED”
This chapter presents the findings from the contextual and textual analyses of
newspaper articles from the first ‘ending’ of the Iraq War on May 1, 2003 when President
Bush announced: “Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the
United States and our allies have prevailed.” (Bush, 2003b). The chapter is organized in a
way that incorporates the analytical evidence into the discussion by presenting first, the
results of the contextual analysis – a discussion based on the coding analysis of 158
newspaper articles utilizing NVivo 11 Pro – to ascertain what the dominant discourses
concerning the outcomes, consequences and attribution of responsibility were in the
construction of the war’s ending. Prominence of a discourse was determined by the
number of selected articles from a given newspaper that contained a particular discourse;
a percentage was calculated in order to aid the visual presentation of the coding analysis
(See Appendix A and Appendix B for summaries of coding). Second, I present the
findings and discussion of the textual analysis of selected articles which is based on
Carvalho’s (2008) model of analysis outlined in Chapter Four. Both sections incorporate
elements of the comparative-synchronic analysis where the focus remains on
demonstrating how the ending of the war was discursively constructed at a specific point
in time across the four newspapers selected in this study.

138

5.1 Brief Overview of Data
As mentioned earlier, the announcement of the declaration of victory in the Iraq
War by President Bush on May 1, 2003 generated significantly more media coverage in
terms of articles across each newspaper (158 articles), than any other announcement of
ending, including the official withdrawal of troops in December 2011 (61 articles) (see
Table 4.1 on p. 120). This suggests, as King’s (2014) study also found, that news media
interest (and possibly public interest too) in the issue of the Iraq War was highest during
the initial invasion period but that it declined as the war wore on.
In addition to the amount of coverage, the importance attributed to an issue by a
newspaper is also reflected by the location of the article within the newspaper, with front
page items generally being considered the most newsworthy. A brief examination of the
percentage of the articles selected in this study, which appeared on the front page for each
newspaper shows that all four newspapers gave a similar amount of front page coverage
to the war in 2003 (between 18-26 percent; see Figure 5.1 below), suggesting that there
was some consistency in giving prominence to the war when it was covered (judging by
front page coverage). In the ending announced in 2003, the WSJ contained the most front
page articles out of the four newspapers selected in this study, but many of these were
‘news in brief’ pieces that listed several headlines on the front page, and did not
necessarily constitute devoted coverage to the issue hence, underlining the disadvantages
of conducting a purely quantitative content analysis. In the ending of the war in 2011, the
figures for front page prominence did not change dramatically for the WP or NYT;
although overall news media interest in the Iraq War did decline for all four newspapers
as reflected by total number of articles (see Table 4.1 on p. 120). In 2011, coverage of the

139

war was considered just as worthy of front page attention for both the NYT and WP as it
was in 2003. However, for the WSJ and USA Today, front page coverage did show a
significant decrease in 2011 compared with 2003, suggesting the Iraq War was not as
important an issue for these two newspapers over eight years after the start of the war.

There are of course other factors that can reflect a newspaper’s attribution of
importance to an issue such as the size of an article in terms of both word count and page
space coverage (and whether photographs are included), or by prominence and visibility
of headline. CDA is not preoccupied with compiling quantitative data on such issues or
data on frequency of words or numbers of articles for instance, but highlighting these
features of the data does provide some helpful insight and give a contextual perspective
of media interest in the issue of the war over time. CDA delves deeper into the
constructions of meaning within the texts and how these meanings become hegemonic
interpretive frameworks for understanding discourses.
140

5.2 Contextual Analysis: Outcomes
5.2.1War as a Success
Across all four newspapers, the discursive construction of the war as a success
characterized the overall coverage. Although there was slight variation in how the
meaning of success was constructed by different newspapers, this outcome appeared as
the pre-eminent characterization of the war. As mentioned above, prominence of this
outcome was determined by the percentage of the selected articles, which presented the
war in this way. Rank of outcomes simply refer to how frequently it formed a part of the
discourse, with the most often cited outcome being ranked first, and the least often
(although still prominent) being ranked lowest (see Tables A.1 to A.4 in Appendix A for
coding summaries, which show specific descriptions of discourse categories with
examples). The discourse characterizing the war’s outcomes as a success was most
prominent in the NYT (70 percent) and USA Today (67 percent), and was the second and
joint second most prominent discourse in the WP (48 percent) and WSJ (57 percent)
respectively. In general, this discourse emphasized the success of the military operation,
the progress that was being made in Iraq in terms of favorable effects on regional politics
and the situation in Iraq returning to normal. The coverage also characterized Iraq as
heading towards modernity and a brighter future. The success of the war was naturalized
in all four newspapers with consistent references to the ending of the war, to “military
victory”, and speaking of the war’s end or victory in the past tense. It is worth bearing in
mind that although the ‘war as a success’ featured prominently, there were other
discourses, including those that highlighted the failure of the war that also surfaced

141

concurrently in the overall coverage of newspapers, and sometimes within the same
articles.

5.2.2 Removal of Dictatorship
The toppling of Saddam Hussein’s regime as an outcome of the war appeared in
the top three discourses across all newspapers. Prominence of this outcome (in relation to
the range of other outcomes) in terms of a percentage of the selected articles in which it
featured was: WSJ (57 percent, ranked second), NYT (50 percent, ranked second) and WP
(50 percent, ranked first), and USA Today (33 percent, ranked third). The USA Today was
an anomaly in the regard that there was a greater amount of critical coverage emphasizing
uncertainty about Iraq’s future and offering some critical coverage questioning the
outcomes. Nevertheless, the removal of the dictatorship as an outcome featured
prominently in its most dominant discourses on the outcomes. The social reality being
conveyed in the removal of the dictatorship discourse was that Iraqis had been liberated,
were now free and better off than before, would be able to seek justice by holding former
regime officials to account for their crimes, and that democratization was underway.
Another critical reason for the dominance of this outcome was that the removal of the
Ba’athist regime from power was later stated as a justification for the war, especially
once it became evident that there were no WMD and the Hussein government were not
linked to al-Qaeda or the terrorist attacks in New York on September 11th, 2001. This
outcome also strengthened the moral justification for the war by characterizing the war as
a war of liberation for a humanitarian agenda, especially once it became increasingly
clear that the initial rationale before (WMD and Iraq’s terrorist links) began to fall apart.

5.2.3 Reconstruction of Iraq
This discourse was constituted by coverage that emphasized the U.S. role in
rebuilding and positively transforming Iraq; it featured discussion of economic
opportunities for American companies as well as for Iraq; focused on the re-building and
modernization of Iraq’s infrastructure and industries; and naturalized the post-war
occupation of Iraq. The U.S. reconstruction of Iraq was emphasized in the discourse on
the outcomes of the Iraq War most strongly in the WSJ, with 61 percent of the selected
articles focusing on this outcome, thus making it the most pre-eminent outcome featured
in the WSJ’s coverage (i.e., ranked first). Prominence of this outcome in terms of a
percentage of the selected articles in which the reconstruction discourse featured was:
NYT (41 percent, ranked third) and WP (35 percent, ranked fourth), and USA Today (26
percent, ranked fifth). Like the previous two outcomes discussed, this one emphasized the
positive impact of the war in offering Iraqis a brighter future.

5.2.4 Uncertainty over Iraq’s Future
This discourse was characterized by critical coverage that expressed warnings
over risks and challenges facing Iraq, emphasized the uncertainty of the future, potential
problems facing the U.S. occupation, and raised questions about the type of democracy
that might emerge from Iraq. Prominence of the uncertainty discourse in terms of a
percentage of the selected articles for each newspaper was: USA Today (37 percent,
ranked second), NYT (29 percent, ranked joint fourth), WP (31 percent, ranked fifth), and
WSJ (13 percent, ranked sixth). Often, such critical coverage appeared within the same
articles emphasizing the positive outcomes of the war, and the discourse may have

143

manifested in the form of questions being asked about the political challenges Iraq may
face and the uncertainty over achieving a lasting peace. The overlap of multiple
discourses and emphasis on different outcomes is discussed in more detail below. In this
discourse, there is a marked difference between the coverage of the individual
newspapers, with this outcome forming a more prominent feature of the coverage of USA
Today compared with the coverage of the NYT and WP. Also, evident was that this
outcome was not a prominent feature of the WSJ’s coverage, which coincides with the
newspapers overwhelming emphasis on the positive aspects of the war.

5.2.5 Critical Coverage Questioning ‘Success’ Discourse
This category was an eclectic mix of news coverage that included challenges to
the rationale for war, and specifically to the failure to find WMD or evidence linking
Hussein to al-Qaeda; it also raised questions about the negative impact on the U.S.’
international relations as well as pointed to the ongoing violence as evidence of failure.
Prominence of this outcome in terms of a percentage of the selected articles for each
newspaper was: USA Today (33 percent, ranked joint third), WP (37 percent, ranked
third), and NYT (29 percent, ranked joint fourth). The WSJ (17 percent, ranked joint
fourth) was not necessarily critical of the war but did question outcomes in a less critical
way by mentioning the failure to find WMD or evidence of the link between Iraq and alQaeda. The presence of this outcome reveals that there was some degree of critical
coverage, especially in the USA Today, however, this coverage would likely have been
‘drowned out’ by the preeminence of the other outcomes mentioned above.

144

5.2.6 Summary of Outcomes
The purpose here has been to provide a brief overview of prominent outcomes, in
order to offer part of a picture (the other parts being consequences and the issue of
responsibility) of how the ending of the Iraq War was constituted in news discourse.
From the evidence extrapolated from the coding exercise using NVivo 11 Pro, it is
evident that the discourses on the outcomes emphasized the success of the war most
vociferously in the WSJ but also evidently in the NYT, WP and USA Today. This is not
wholly surprising and is line with much previous research that analyzed media
performance in the lead up to and during the Iraq War, finding that American media in
general remained supportive of the war and continued to echo the sentiments of the White
House, specifically by situating Iraq in the context of the War on Terror. However, the
USA Today counter-balanced its coverage of the ‘positive’ outcomes of the war with
more balanced coverage that raised questions about the war compared with the others
newspapers examined in this study. The WP’s coverage was also more critical than the
NYT and WSJ. Coding the outcomes in this way enabled summarizing a large number of
articles which is useful in providing contextual detail about the overall coverage and
should be viewed as complimentary to the evidence extrapolated by conducting a detailed
textual analysis.

5.3 Contextual Analysis: Consequences
5.3.1 General Emphasis on Positive Consequences
This consequence was characterized by expression of positive sentiments about
the consequences of the war with coverage focusing on future improvements of public

145

services and industries as a consequence of U.S. occupation. It was the most prominent
discourse to emerge when coding the consequences in the coverage of the NYT (30
percent, ranked first) and WSJ (39 percent, ranked first). This is not surprising and fits
with the findings discussed above in the outcomes, where the NYT and the WSJ’s
coverage of the ending strongly emphasized success. Although such sentiments were also
expressed in the WP and USA Today, this category was not preeminent in their coverage.

5.3.2 Worsening Security Situation in Iraq
The focus of this consequence was on increased lawlessness and threat of
violence due to insecurity resulting from the war; this category also included mentions of
instability and heightened risk of terrorism in Iraq. Prominence of this consequence in
terms of a percentage of the selected articles in which it featured was: WP (33 percent,
ranked first), NYT (29 percent, ranked second), and USA Today (11 percent, ranked joint
sixth). Interestingly, this preeminent consequence of the Iraq War appeared in less than
10 percent of the WSJ’s news articles on the ending of the war. As we shall see below
this fits the pattern of the rest of the WSJ’s coverage, which continued to represent the
war as a success and deemphasized its negative consequences. Up until today, security
remains a vital concern with daily violence; however, at this point in the war, the
situation had not deteriorated to the same degree, which could explain why the worsening
security did not extensively dominate coverage for any of the four newspapers. For the
WP and NYT, much of the coverage was concerned with the potential risks and threats to
security.

146

5.3.3 Growing anti-American Sentiment
This category included reporting that drew attention to the growing Iraqi
suspicions of U.S. intentions in Iraq; coverage also focused on anti-American protests
and mentioning of Iraqi frustration with the U.S.’s efforts in Iraq. Prominence of this
consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in the selected articles for each
newspaper was: WP (31 percent, ranked second), USA Today (26 percent, ranked first),
and NYT (13 percent, ranked seventh). The mention of growing anti-American sentiment
only featured as a theme in less than 10 percent of the WSJ’s coverage. The coding
analysis of this category reveals that the WP and USA Today were once again more
critical of the war than the NYT and WSJ by highlighting the diminishing support of
ordinary Iraqis for the American-led invasion. Clearly highlighting the anti-American
feelings of the Iraqi feeling would contradict the dominant narratives of the NYT and WSJ
presenting the U.S. as liberators, welcomed by the Iraqi population. This does not mean
that the discourse of anti-American sentiment was excluded altogether but rather, it was
less visible than the discourses emphasizing the positive impact of the war.

5.3.4 Destruction of Iraq’s Infrastructure
This consequence refers to coverage of damage to public services such as schools,
hospitals and other civilian infrastructure such as the energy sector. Prominence of this
consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in the selected articles for each
newspaper was: NYT (27 percent, ranked third), WP (23 percent, ranked fourth), and USA
Today (11 percent, ranked joint sixth). The WSJ’s discourse on the destruction of
infrastructure (13 percent, ranked fourth) focused more on fuel shortages and lack of

147

energy but not necessarily occurring as direct consequences of the war, as sometimes
these consequences were attributed to poor maintenance during the pre-war period and
thereby implicating the Hussein regime (see section 5.4 on responsibility below).
Furthermore, the WSJ’s coverage placed less emphasis on the destruction of
infrastructure and instead focused more on the ‘challenges to reconstruction,’ which
entailed examining the perspective from the point of view of American ambitions in Iraq
rather than the misery caused by the initial destruction due to the invasion. The
‘challenges to reconstruction’ discourse appeared in 22 percent of the selected articles in
the WSJ’s coverage but did not feature as a significant discourse in the other newspapers.
Once again, the WSJ’s discourse focused more on the positive consequences and
subjected the negative consequences to de-emphasis. Considering the widespread damage
caused by the U.S. led bombing campaign in the initial invasion period, it is not
surprising to see that there were numerous reports across the news media of destruction to
civilian infrastructure but how responsibility for the destruction was attributed offers
further insight to how the reality of this was constructed in the media and conveyed to the
public. On many occasions, when the consequence of destruction was discussed in the
four newspapers, it was done so in way that discursively ‘naturalized’ Iraq’s
infrastructure problems as existing without any identification of causation or agent (see
the textual analysis of selected articles below and Appendix A for examples).

5.3.5 General Negative Consequences
This was a broad coding category that emerged from miscellaneous codes that did
not coherently fit as a single cohesive consequence and also differed slightly for each

148

newspaper. However, the essence of the category was drawing the reader’s attention to
general critical coverage of the negative outcomes of the war, such as the potential for
adverse impact on the U.S. economy, focusing on the costs of the war, challenges to the
U.S. military, and criticisms of the unilateralist policy pursued by the U.S. This category
did not include the other negative consequences already mentioned separately in this
section but collectively formed an important part of the coverage for USA Today, WP,
and the NYT. Prominence of this consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in the
selected articles for each newspaper was: WP (27 percent, ranked third), NYT (23 percent,
ranked fourth) and USA Today (19 percent, ranked joint third). Similar to the abovementioned negative consequences, this category did not feature prominently in the WSJ
(less than 10 percent of articles).

5.3.6 Civilian Deaths
Another important part of the discourse of the ending of the war was covering
civilian deaths and casualties as a consequence of the invasion. Prominence of this
consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in the selected articles for each
newspaper was: USA Today (26 per cent, ranked joint first), NYT (18 percent, ranked
fifth), WP (15 percent, ranked joint seventh), and less than 10 percent for the WSJ. The
pattern that emerges is that the coverage of USA Today did draw its readers to this
negative consequence more than any of the other newspapers. However, it is not
surprising that civilian deaths (regardless of cause) did not draw the majority of media
attention in the early days of the war as coverage in wars tends to focus on supporting
troops as adverse public sentiment against the war could potentially affect troop morale

149

negatively. Furthermore, doing so would have brought into question the NYT, WP and
WSJ’s support for the war in the first place. Nevertheless, the USA Today’s coverage
emphasizing civilian deaths as an important consequence of the war distinguished it from
the other newspapers.

5.3.7 Worsening Political Situation
Although not the most prominent consequence covered in newspapers, all four
newspapers did at least pay some attention to the deteriorating political situation in Iraq.
This included but was not limited to coverage that emphasized a political quagmire,
political instability, the opening of a political power vacuum with the toppling of the
Hussein government, and other general challenges following regime change in Iraq.
Prominence of this consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in the selected
articles for each newspaper was: WP (19 percent, ranked joint fifth), USA Today (19
percent, ranked joint third), WSJ (17 percent, ranked third), and NYT (16 percent, ranked
sixth). The lack of political solution to form a government that satisfies all sides as well
as puts an end to the sectarian violence has been an ongoing issue in Iraq since the start of
the war. It is therefore surprising to see this consequence of the war not being addressed
more prominently in the WP and NYT – both newspapers have a considerable ability to
devote more space for analysis to foreign news issues than the USA Today or WSJ. This
consequence did feature in the WSJ’s coverage but it was also often contextualized as a
problem resulting from pre-existing conditions or the Islamic religion rather than as a
result of the war. This is discussed in more detail below when we consider the issue of
attributing responsibility for the negative consequences.

150

5.3.8 Increase in Suffering of Iraqi People
This was discussed as a consequence in two out of the four newspapers. The key
features of this consequence were specific moments where coverage focused on issues
facing Iraqi civilians such as unemployment, food or energy shortages, or poverty.
Prominence of this consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in the selected
articles for each newspaper was as follows: WP (19 percent, ranked joint fifth), USA
Today (11 percent, ranked joint sixth), with the NYT registering less than 10 percent of
coverage and WSJ none. The lack of attention to this issue as a consequence is once again
suggestive of a concerted effort by newspapers to construct a discourse that focuses on
the positive outcomes of the war, as otherwise, civilian suffering would be an inevitable
consequence of any war. It was in line with the other results of this contextual analysis
that the WP and USA Today were the most likely of the four newspapers selected in this
study, to bring attention to the suffering experienced by Iraqis.

5.3.9 Summary of Consequences
From the coding analysis it has emerged that consequences proportionately made
up less of the coverage for all four newspapers than the outcomes of the war discussed
above (see appendices for details). In other words, the success of the war in terms of its
outcomes was emphasized to a much higher degree than the consequences of the war.
The WSJ’s coverage stood out for having devoted the least attention to the negative
consequences of the war out of the four newspapers. The most balanced coverage and
attention devoted to consequences came from WP and USA Today. The NYT touched on
many of the consequences but these did not necessarily dominate its discourse of the

151

ending of the war in 2003. Some of the other consequences of the war that came up in the
coding analysis included the damage to Iraq’s cultural heritage and deaths of U.S.
personnel, both of which appeared in less than 10 percent of all the articles examined –
the exception being USA Today which did devote about 15 percent of its coverage of
consequences to coalition forces deaths.

5.4 Contextual Analysis: Responsibility
5.4.1 Responsibility for Destruction
In terms of the general discourse surrounding the destruction caused by the
invasion, for example, destruction of civilian infrastructure or cultural heritage, the
coverage of all four newspapers omitted the role of the U.S. in causing the conditions of
the chaos or the actual destruction. It is clear from Figure 5.2 that when responsibility for
destruction was attributed, it was mostly attributed to the Hussein regime and former
Ba’athists or to unnamed criminal elements often referred to as “looters.” USA Today was
the only newspaper where attribution of responsibility for destruction was equally shared
by Americans as well as the other groups indicated. What becomes clear is that often
when talking about the hardships caused by the destruction of civilian infrastructure,
there was a tendency across the newspapers to remove agency. Also interesting is that
most of the blame is shifted onto the Hussein regime for the destruction but there were
many contrary reports that appeared in these newspapers indicating that the invasion of
Iraq had not witnessed the destruction of oil fields as some had predicted.

5.4.2 Responsibility for other Negative Outcomes
The general discourse on various negative war-related outcomes included things
such as general comment about the security, lack of civilian services, and political
fighting amongst various ethnic groups. As Figure 5.3 shows, USA Today and the WP
attributed responsibility to U.S. actions (that is either the U.S. government or military)
more than the NYT or WSJ did. In fact, from the WSJ articles analyzed on the discourse of
general negative outcomes, the U.S. was not considered responsible for any of the
negative outcomes. Instead, all of the WSJ’s articles often did not directly attribute
responsibility onto the Iraqis or Americans, but stated that the problems pre-dated the
invasion, and thereby the implication was that the previous government was responsible
for the post-war problems. The resultant implication was further vindication of the U.S.led invasion and decision to forcibly overthrow the government of a sovereign state as it
was due to the Hussein government that Iraq faced such acute problems. Such a selective
recounting of history and lack of historical context often also overlooked the impact of

153

U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following the end of the first Gulf War in 1991 and the
devastation these wrought until 2003 when they were official lifted.

5.4.3 Responsibility for Positive Outcomes
When it came to attributing responsibility for improvements in Iraq, including
better security or services for the Iraqi people, and helping the recovery and
reconstruction effort, only occasionally were Iraqis deemed responsible, and only in the
coverage of USA Today and NYT. Such praise for Iraqis was absent from the selection of
articles analyzed in the WP and WSJ. However, even in the NYT or USA Today, the
overwhelming majority of the time the positive outcomes of the war were attributed
directly to the Americans. This fits exactly with van Dijk’s ideological square (1998)
which stipulates that the good deeds of others are downplayed or ignored, whilst ‘our’
good actions are illuminated and championed in media coverage. The purpose of utilizing
the ideological square (whether consciously or unconsciously) is to fit the wider narrative

154

which vilifies the enemy by contrasting ‘our’ good actions with their evil ones, and to
engender further support for the military action being carried out against the enemy.
Removing the responsibility of the Iraqis for positive outcomes also constructs an identity
of Iraqis as a weak, almost feeble people incapable of helping themselves. Such issues are
examined in more detail in the textual analysis section.

5.4.4 Responsibility for Civilian Deaths and State of Violence
When it came to attributing responsibility for deaths of civilians and the general
state of violence in Iraq (see Figure 5.5 below), 80 and 71 percent of the selected articles
in the WP and USA Today respectively, did identify American responsibility. The NYT
only attributed responsibility for civilian deaths to the U.S. in 23 percent of the cases and
it was 40 percent for WSJ articles. A significant amount of responsibility was placed on
the Hussein regime and its supporters, with the exception of USA Today, which only did
so in 14 percent of cases. It was not uncommon in the coverage of all four newspapers to
also omit responsibility for the American role in civilian deaths which, further illustrates
the problems with drawing conclusions based solely on quantitative analyses of the data,

155

as clearly there are contradictory discourses that require closer textual analysis in order to
understand how they operate and co-exist.

5.4.5 Responsibility for Negative Political Situation
Figure 5.6 shows that USA Today more frequently cited American culpability for
the deteriorating political situation in Iraq than any other newspapers. This often came in
the form of criticism towards the Bush administration’s policy of invading without a
more effective plan for the post-conflict situation. We can see the newspaper did not
place responsibility for the political mess on Iraqis as the aftermath of the war and lack of
non-Ba’athist leadership were clear factors preventing any kind of transition to
democracy. There was some blame apportioned to Iraqis in the NYT and also to Shia
militants by the WP but when examining the coverage more closely, the NYT and WSJ
did raise questions about Islam and democracy. The discourse surrounding the political
problems contained the implication in some of the coverage of the incompatibility of
Islam and the type of Western democracy that the Bush administration had hoped for.
This theme appeared in the WSJ, NYT and WP but not in USA Today. Once again, the

156

omission of U.S. responsibility for the political situation on the part of the WSJ and also
within a significant number of the selected articles of the WP and NYT’s coverage
reflected unwillingness to direct blame at the U.S. and instead present the political
situation through the ‘clash of civilizations’ discourse. For example, the WSJ warned:
The situation is made all the more volatile by the fact that the various
components of Iraqi society are always on the brink of violence. Whether
they are easily manipulated by the Iranian mullahs or not, the Shiites -65% of the population -- need to play a leading role in the coming
government: it is the best way to prevent the real threat of an Islamic
regime in Baghdad. (Kouchner , 2003, p. A16).
The implicit suggestion being that an “Islamic regime” is undesirable to the Americans as
well as incompatible with democracy. What was often overlooked in the coverage was
the context of the cultural formation of Iraq; specifically, that whatever form of
democracy Iraq formed, would in some way reflect its cultural and religious heritage.

5.4.6 Responsibility for Worsening Security Situation
Attributing responsibility for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq formed a
significant part of the WP’s coverage. As shown in the discussion above, this issue
appeared as the most important consequence in the selected WP articles, so it is not
surprising that the WP’s coverage also addressed responsibility directly. As Figure 5.7
shows, in 60 percent of the cases the U.S. was held responsible for the worsening security
situation (at other times, Shia militants or Hussein loyalists were also blamed). What is
striking about Figure 5.7 below is none of the other newspapers linked the responsibility
for the deteriorating security situation back to American or coalition forces’ failure to
ensure stability in the post-war environment. This is a case where the absence of
attribution of responsibility reveals a great deal about the overall media discourse. Part of
the explanation could be that the overlapping of discourses and simultaneous discussion
of related consequences of security, political instability, civilian deaths, or Iraqi suffering,
and how coding responsibility for such related consequences is not an exact process.

5.4.7 Responsibility for Economic Problems Facing Iraq
Similar to the apportioning of responsibility for the worsening security, the
attribution of responsibility for the economic problems facing Iraq was not a prominent
feature across all four newspapers. It is unsurprising that the WSJ devoted a great deal
more coverage to the economic issues of the war, at least from an American, business and
investor perspective, than the others newspapers as it is a widely regarded as an
influential business information source. However, it is revealing that the WSJ’s coverage
squarely laid the blame for economic difficulties on the previous regime (see Figure 5.8
below); discussing problems such as shortages in critical equipment and lack of industry
expertise as though they pre-dated the invasion, and not addressing the U.S. role and
responsibility in infrastructure destruction that had contributed to and exacerbated the
economic hardships facing Iraq.

5.4.8 Summary of Attributing Responsibility
Comparing the NVivo 11 Pro coding analysis of discourses on the attribution of
responsibility for the consequences of the Iraq War across the four selected newspapers

159

shows clear patterns that are revealing of the discursive context of the news coverage.
Overall, there was a tendency in the NYT, WSJ and to a lesser extent in the WP and USA
Today, to omit the agency and role of the U.S. in the negative consequences of the war.
However, the coverage of USA Today and the WP more frequently attributed
responsibility for negative outcomes when the issue of responsibility was actually
addressed, and it is fair to say these two newspapers offered more balanced coverage of
the ending of the Iraq War compared to the NYT and WSJ. In contrast, when the NYT did
attribute responsibility for negative outcomes to the U.S., its coverage also emphasized
the responsibility of the former regime. This was also the case for the WSJ, only it
attributed even greater responsibility to the former regime for the negative consequences
of the war than it did to U.S. policy or actions. The effect of this was to advance a
patriotic or nationalistic discourse that constructed a positive self-representation of the
U.S. role in Iraq.
As highlighted at various points in this dissertation, the importance of establishing
the context through which the outcomes, consequences, and attribution of responsibility
are given meaning is critical as it illuminates the macrostructure of discourse; that, is the
global conditions in which local meanings of the ending are constructed. The contextual
analysis of the 2003 ending of the Iraq War reveals the workings of ideology through the
presence of an ‘ideological square’ (van Dijk, 1998) in which the positive outcomes of
the war are attributed to the U.S., and responsibility for the negative ones are deflected
away from the U.S. to others. Although, the ending of the war had been declared, much
of the news media coverage continued to focus on the previous regime for causing the
problems faced by Iraqis in post-war Iraq. This fit within the Manichean discourse that

160

permeated much of the pre-war media coverage (discussed in Chapter Two) which sought
to win the U.S. public’s approval for the invasion. In order to demonstrate how such
contexts for discourses are constructed, it is important to conduct a granular level analysis
of the text.

5.5 Textual Analysis: The New York Times
Sanger, David E. Bush Declares 'One Victory in a War on Terror': He says military
operation in Iraq has ended.’ NYT, Friday, May 2, 2003, A, C6, p. 1. (1730
words).
Layout and Structural Organization
This article was selected for close textual analysis because it was the preeminent
story printed in the NYT about the declaration of the end of major combat operations in
Iraq made by President Bush. The article made up the lead story and appeared
prominently on the front page alongside a photograph taken showing the President giving
a thumbs-up gesture during his speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, in front of a
banner decorated in the stars and stripes of the American flag with the phrase “Mission
Accomplished” salient. The message contained within the headline also referred to
“victory” in Iraq as one that was part of the larger War on Terror, thus giving the
impression of success to what was being presented as the finale of a six week conflict that
started on March 20, 2017.

Objects
David E. Sanger, the author of the article, situates the ending of the war within the
broader discourse of the War on Terror by deferring to President Bush’s quote that the

161

Iraq War is “one victory in a War on Terror that began on Sept. 11th, 2001, and still goes
on.” The effect of this is that it reminds the reader without explicitly stating that the Iraq
War is to be understood in the context of the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the
ensuing War on Terror, a war propagated to be one of self-defense against those
responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks or deemed to be a threat to the U.S. The article
then goes onto quote excerpts of the President’s speech that continue this contextualizing
of the war within the War on Terror frame.
There are numerous other discourse objects that are part of this article. For
example, mentioning the Presidential election to come in 2004, the supposed link
between al-Qaeda and Iraq, the danger Iraq posed to world security, the speculation about
where Iraq’s supposed WMD might be hidden, the unilateralist policy of the U.S. under
the Bush Administration, and references to the search for proof of Saddam Hussein’s
whereabouts. However, for the purposes of this dissertation, it is the actual ending of the
conflict as an event that constitutes the most important discourse object that is
constructed in the text. The author re-iterates the key message of the President about the
ending of the war, stating:
Mr. Bush's speech tonight, 43 days after he announced to the nation from
the Oval Office that the war had begun with a surprise bombing of a
compound where Mr. Hussein had been sighted, ended the combat phase
of one of the swiftest wars in American military history, and one of the
most dramatic chapters of Mr. Bush's presidency.

162

In this passage and throughout the article, Sanger normalizes the ending of the war by
making reference to its swiftness and placing it historically in U.S. military history.
However, appearing further along in the article Sanger explains:
White House officials said they did not want to declare a final end to the
war, in part, because that would require them, under the Geneva
Convention, to release more than 6,000 prisoners of war, many of whom
are still being interviewed.
Thus, the war is effectively over but the U.S. need for “interviewing” prisoners is cited as
the reason for the non-declaration of victory. Sanger does refer to the WMD search as
“largely unsuccessful” and the search for Saddam Hussein as unfulfilled but overall, the
article does not dwell on these issues and instead retells the core elements of the
President’s message about removing “an ally of al-Qaeda” and the necessity for a
unilateral policy of using military force to eradicate threats to U.S. security. Despite a
cautionary reminder of a mission that is incomplete, Sanger then goes onto report the
President’s speech as follows: “Still, he told the sailors and fliers that "major combat
operations in Iraq have ended," and that "in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our
allies have prevailed."” Furthermore, Sanger goes on to describe the military mission in
Iraq as “largely completed” and utilizes the word “victory” to describe the war. Sanger
then describes the President’s pronouncement on the war as “carefully measured” which
struck an “optimistic and purposeful chord.” Sanger offers little critique or challenge to
the narrative of the ending presented by Bush; he makes little reference to the destruction
caused by the invasion and of the potential for Iraqi resistance to a foreign occupation.

Actors
The principle actors (i.e., social agents that ‘do’ things as well as ‘objects’ that are
talked about (Carvalho, 2008, p. 168)), within the text that are illuminated in the
discourse on the ending of the war, can be separated into two broad categories. First, the
U.S., represented by President Bush as Commander in Chief; “Mr. Bush’s war council,”
which included senior Administration figures such as Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld; and various unnamed persons referred to as “senior officials” or “senior
administration official” or “White House officials” – who all generally represent the
perspective of the United States. As is usually the case in journalistic writing, there are
also various synecdochic identifiers such as “White House” and “Pentagon” used to refer
to either the U.S. government or Department of Defense respectively which can obscure
agency but are also used for the sake of brevity. The various social actors representing the
U.S. are “activated” rather than passivized. Fairclough refers to activation in social actors
as “their capacity for agentive action, for making things happen, for controlling others” as
contrasted with passivation where “what is accentuated is their subjection to processes,
them being affected by the actions of others, and so forth.” (2003, p. 150). In Sanger’s
article, the U.S. forces are described as active agents that “invade” , “liberate”, “defeat”,
“confront major threats”, “defend peace”, “remove an ally of Al-Qaeda”, and re-build
Iraq. There is a complete absence of any of the inevitably negative consequences of war
(regardless of how the act of war is described) on Iraq’s civilian population and
infrastructure. The actions taken by the U.S. are therefore portrayed in a purely positive
light.

164

The second broad group constructed in the article is that of the enemy, which
lumps together Saddam Hussein, “Hussein loyalists,” Al-Qaeda, “the Qaeda Network,”
“terrorists,” and “terrorist networks.” Peripheral enemies such as North Korea and Iran
are also identified as being next in line to face the wrath of the U.S. military for their
nefarious actions. Mentioning these two countries follows on from previous references
Bush had made to confront an “Axis of Evil,”14 and now turning attention to North Korea
and Iran also marked the conclusion of the Iraq phase of the War on Terror and possibly
the beginning of a new phase; thus, further adding to the impression that the Iraq War has
ended. In the article, the principle actions that Hussein and his government are described
to be responsible for are pursuing banned weapons with the possibility of supplying
WMD to terrorists. Although Sanger, acknowledges the “Bush administration has never
linked the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to Mr. Hussein,” he
follows up stating “although senior officials did charge that Iraq had ties to the Qaeda
network.” Thus, the second portion of the sentence somewhat negates the effect of the
first. Following a quotation by the President that referred to Hussein as an “ally of Al
Qaeda” and “source of terrorist funding” Sanger goes on to write: “Mr. Bush did more
this evening than simply meld Mr. Hussein's fallen government with Qaeda terrorists” but
he does not critique or question this information; instead by positioning Hussein and Al
Qaeda in this way, the message of linking Iraq and Al-Qaeda is amplified and reified in
his article.
When discussing the failure to locate Hussein in the aftermath of the invasion,
Sanger writes “other members of the administration are clearly concerned that until Mr.
14

The ‘Axis of Evil’ is what President Bush used to describe North Korea, Iran and Iraq in his State of the
Union Address in 2002. In May 2002, its ‘members’ were expanded to include Cuba, Libya, and Syria
(Bush, 2002).

165

Hussein is proved dead, his loyalists will still harass American occupation troops, setting
off grenade attacks or car bombs.” This sentence exemplifies the “activation” of the
enemy group, in other words highlighting agency only with regards to criminality and
sneak attacks. The polarization of the identities of the U.S. and its opponents is clear and
follows a Manichean presentation, which contrasts the U.S.’s good actions with the evil
actions of the opponents. This dichotomy is further accentuated by equating the identity
of Hussein to Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin, with clear implications of evil.
What is evident from the construction of the identities and the text is the absence
of the voices of the Iraqi people or political opponents of the war inside as well as outside
of the United States. Sanger’s exclusive reliance on Bush Administration figures to report
the story and the implications this has, enables the administration’s perspective to
dominate the discourse and frame the issue within the War on Terror construct. This
dominance is further entrenched by excluding the voices of the war’s critics. This
exclusion of relevant voices illustrates the working of Foucault’s (1978/1990)
conceptualization of how silence operates by closing down the possibilities of alternative
realities. In other words, it is an example of how dominant discourses become hegemonic
by delimiting the scope of the debate.

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
Some of the lexical choices relating to the verbs and adjectives made by Sanger
about the topic and actors have already been commented on above, particularly how these
convey agency and aid polarization between positive self-presentation and negative
‘other’ presentation. In addition, grammatical features, such as the author’s use of

166

presupposition display deference to the Bush Administration’s rhetoric regarding the Iraq
War. For example, in the second paragraph, Sanger sets the scene as follows:
Speaking from the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln before
thousands of uniformed sailors and aviators as the ship approached San
Diego Harbor, he argued that by vanquishing Mr. Hussein's government,
he had removed "an ally of Al Qaeda," and he vowed to continue to search
for banned weapons in Iraq -- a search that so far has been largely
unsuccessful -- and to confront any other nations that use such weapons to
threaten the United States or could sell them to terrorists.
In the last two lines, the reference to confronting other nations contains the implicit
assumption that Iraq had been confronted because it had used WMD to threaten the U.S.
or could potentially have sold them to terrorists, both claims, which were unproven. As
the scholarship discussed in Chapter Two showed, many in the media were found to be
merely reproducing the same message from the White House that Iraq possessed WMD
without scrutinizing the evidence around the claims.
Reifying the Bush administration’s rhetoric was also evident in the nominalization
contained in the phrase “the invasion and liberation of Iraq” used by Sanger to describe
the war. Dunmire (2007) describes nominalization as “a process of transformation
through which verbs, which represent “reality” in terms of processes and actions, are
reclassified as nouns, which represent “reality” in terms of objects and entities, that is, as
“reified processes.”” (p. 26). Nominalization is not by itself evidence of manipulation but
it is often highlighted in CDA as a syntactical feature that can be used to obscure or
delete agency; and here its usage is interesting in conveying “liberation” as a substitute

167

for war. In addition, van Dijk reminds us that CDA is interested in the illegitimate usage
of nominalization by elite authors to distort the presentation of social events and therefore
reality (van Dijk, 2008a, p. 822). The use of the term “liberation” also adds a moral
dimension to the war’s end, by representing the war as one fought on humanitarian
grounds to set a people free. It is worth reminding the reader that it is not a single
linguistic feature that ought to be the focus of analysis, but how such features relate to the
rest of the text (and context) and how these impact the discourse.

Discursive Strategies
In examining the discursive interventions that constitute manipulation of social
reality, all of the textual features described above play into the overall discursive strategy.
To begin with, the headline reads “Bush Declares ‘One Victory in a War on Terror,’”
which performs the critical function of summarizing the principle topic of the text (the
end of the war) and thereby expressing:
a strong strategic suggestion to the readers to construct this as the top
macro proposition of their mental model of the event to be represented –
or to add or modify an opinion already formed in an earlier model when
readers heard about the case. (van Dijk, 1988, p. 99).
The ‘angle’ of the reality being presented therefore, was that the Iraq War ought to be
understood as finished as well as a part of the broader War on Terror.
In terms of packaging the information in the news story, the author relies heavily
on sources and perspectives that reinforce the Administration’s claims and add weight to
its perspective of the war being constructed; this is reflected by only quoting President

168

Bush and other un-named White House officials. Legitimation is another feature of the
text that sheds light on the discursive strategy, which allows the White House perspective
to dominate. Sanger in effect is justifying the war by celebrating the swiftness of victory
and sidelining controversies. For example, the decision by the U.S. to pursue a war
without the backing of the U.N. Security Council is presented by Sanger without critique
or attention to the legal or other implications of unilateral military action. Sanger
describes the unilateralism of the “Bush doctrine” as “the aggressive commitment his
administration has made to confront major threats before they reach American shores. He
described the attack on Iraq as an example of the extreme lengths he would go to stop
such threats.” In other words, the attack on Iraq is presented as an act of self-defense.
Sanger does not challenge the Iraq-as-a-threat narrative presented by the Bush
administration and by describing the Bush Administration’s policy of pre-emptive
unilateralist military action in this way, Sanger sanctions the authority and reasoning
behind such actions.

Ideological Standpoints
CDA seeks to unearth how ideology operates discreetly within the dominant
discourses of the text. The presentation of the war’s ending is naturalized throughout the
article by presenting it as a victory and referring to outcomes such as the “vanquishing of
Hussein’s regime”, “liberation of Iraq” and repeating that major combat operations have
“ended.” There is also evidence of positive self-presentation and negative ‘other’
presentation, which, although subtly presented, shows how the text producer
“textualizes” the war’s end in a particular way that in turn influences the reader’s

169

interpretation (Fairclough, 1989). Sanger’s writing also gives the impression of appearing
to be balanced and measured by interspersing a few challenges to the war as a success
narrative, namely mention of the unconfirmed whereabouts of Hussein and the alleged
stockpiles of WMD.
The purpose here is not to try to show that Sanger’s article is typical or
representative of all of the NYT’s coverage. However, when coupled with the findings of
the contextual analysis, there is some congruence between the presentation of outcomes,
consequences and responsibility. Specifically, the principle outcome is military victory
for the U.S.; there are few if any allusions to the consequences of the war; and
responsibility for the positive outcomes is bestowed on the U.S. and the blame for
ongoing problems is levelled at loyalists of the former regime. Some of the discursive
strategies identified, the incompleteness of information presented in the article (through
exclusion of alternative voices), the reliance on White House sources, and resorting to a
Manichean representation of ‘us’ and ‘them’ are elements of what van Dijk (2006, p.
375) identifies as power abuse through manipulative discourse, because readers are led to
believe the war was one of self-defense and therefore justified, with limited negative
consequences, and that major combat has ceased.

5.6 Textual Analysis: The Washington Post
DeYoung, Karen. Bush Proclaims Victory in Iraq; Work on Terror Is Ongoing, President
Says. WP, Friday, May 2, 2003, Section A, p. A01. (1539 words).
Layout and Structural Organization
Karen DeYoung’s article was the leading front page story about President Bush’s
announcement of the ending of major combat operations in Iraq, and like the NYT’s
170

article reporting the same story, it featured a similar photograph of the President giving a
thumbs-up although the “Mission Accomplished” banner was not visible. There were two
related stories that also appeared on the front page less prominently (and not
accompanied by photograph) but DeYoung’s article was chosen because it was the
longest in terms of word length, and most prominent in terms of space and location on
page, thus indicating the importance attributed to the story by the WP editorial staff. The
story dominated the front page and the headline specifically making reference to “Victory
in Iraq,” which gave the impression that the war had ended; the by-line did offer some
retreat from the emphatic declaration of the headline by cautioning “Work on Terror Is
Ongoing, President Says.”

Objects
Similar to the David E. Sanger article in the NYT, DeYoung’s article is situated
within the War on Terror construct as well. The widespread adoption of the War on
Terror discourse in the media has received widespread attention already as shown in the
literature review of existing scholarship in Chapter Two. The key discourse objects
established in the article are 1) the ending of the war and 2) the speech as a spectacle.
There are numerous instances of DeYoung repeating the President’s message of
the end in her own words, for example, referring to “Victory in Iraq”, to the President as
“fresh from victory in battle”, and that the Bush administration’s focus “has clearly
moved on” from military policy to domestic economic policy. When describing the
speech, De Young writes:

171

Portraying the anti-terrorist battles in the tradition of the Normandy
invasion and Iwo Jima, Bush placed his own doctrine of overwhelming
American strength and the use of preemptive force along side [sic]
Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, the Truman Doctrine of containment,
and Ronald Reagan's challenge to the Soviet Union's "Evil Empire."
The author adopts the War on Terror frame, contextualizing the War in Iraq as one battle
in the War on Terror and also referring to “anti-terrorist battles,” which inadvertently,
situates Iraq in that context and perhaps sanctions the use of pre-emptive force against a
sovereign state without formal UN approval. The effect of this is to normalize the
understanding that the Iraq War was about the struggle against terrorism, despite the lack
of evidence to support such claims. In addition, DeYoung situates the characterization of
the War historically, comparing the “Bush doctrine” of pre-emptive force to previous
epochs in U.S. history. The effect of this is to historicize the War in Iraq, thereby putting
it in its place in the nation’s history and adding further to the discursive construction of
the war’s ending. The ending of the war discourse is not challenged, although reference is
made to the legal ramifications of declaring the war’s ending as a reason for there not to
have been an official declaration of end. DeYoung also reports that although the speech
was written “over the past week,” the President waited until Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the
U.S. military commander in Iraq, “told him the fighting was over” thus adding further to
the discourse of an effective end to hostilities.
Unlike the NYT article, a great deal of the article is devoted to describing the
spectacle of the speech, at one point describing it as “a scene straight from “Top Gun”
that is sure to appear in future campaign ads.” The construction of the scene as a

172

discourse object is relevant as it further adds to the celebratory tone of the speech about
the military victory in Iraq. Almost half of the article is dedicated to describing how the
President helped co-pilot S-3B Viking onto the Lincoln, and how the speech was
carefully stage-managed, quoting instructions given to gathered sailors and other military
personnel about when to cheer and not too. The dedicated focus on the event itself results
in a lack of attention to the issues and controversies surrounding the war and its
consequences. It does however illustrate that the scene has been carefully orchestrated
and gives a rather hollow impression of the substance of the President’s speech.
DeYoung seems to focus her story away from commentary on the President’s
announcement of the ending or war. Instead DeYoung quotes excerpts from the speech,
which addressed the gathered sailors who Bush congratulated for their performance in
Iraq, and whom he referred to as “homeward-bound”, thus further add to the impression
of the conclusion of the war. She also quotes unnamed White House officials who
described the event as the “bookend” to the beginning of the war. DeYoung’s analysis
therefore overlooks the implications of the ending of the war for Iraq.

Actors
Unlike the NYT article by Sanger (2003), DeYoung does not dichotomize the war
as one between ‘us’ and ‘them’ or good and evil, and carefully avoids accentuating the
President’s rhetoric. The principle identity constructed is that of President Bush as a
politician. There is no hyperbolic language to contrast the President with an opposite
villain figure in the form of Hussein. There is also not a litany of the crimes of the
Hussein government. As mentioned above, the focus of the article is largely on the scene

173

which results in descriptions of the President’s behavior during the speech such as
interactions with sailors, his swaggering, his dress in full flight regalia, his avoiding the
mistakes of a past presidential candidate, and “cultivating an aggressive, can-do image.”
This again adds to the impression of a stage-managed performance, albeit one that
DeYoung suggests has been well-performed. DeYoung writes:
Bush was so exhilarated by the sights and sounds of the ship, he
abandoned his usual media aversion and became a virtual camera hog,
grinning and posing with sailors, shouting at journalists to take more
pictures and ask about his flight. "I miss flying, I can tell you that," the
former National Guard pilot yelled at one point, over the constant din of
the carrier.
The excerpt above typifies the fixation on the scene of the speech rather than on the
contents of Bush’s speech, or on the implications of the ending of the war. Overall, the
speech does not glorify Bush or indeed the military. Instead, at one point, DeYoung
reminds the readers that “Bush sidestepped U.S. failure thus far to find any chemical or
biological weapons in Iraq, nearly a month after toppling Saddam Hussein’s
government.” This has quite a critical tone of the President characterizing his action as
evasive and political maneuvering to mask failures. Similar to the NYT article, the article
does not construct the identities of Iraqis or give voice to those challenging U.S. action in
Iraq. Inevitably, what this results in is the silencing of dissenting voices. However, the
effects of this silencing are not as amplified through an excessive reliance on White
House or Administration officials as was the case in the NYT article by Sanger (2003).

174

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
Despite not resigning to the hegemony of the Bush Administration’s rhetoric,
there is nevertheless a certain level of inevitable journalistic acquiescence to it from
DeYoung, especially when quoting the President, thus indicating the power of the
President to assert his influence in to the news discourse. DeYoung does not challenge
the President’s statements on Iraq, but frequently uses verb phrases such as “he
proclaimed victory in Iraq”, “he portrayed Iraq as one more battle in the global war on
terrorism”, and adverbs in sentences such as “Bush repeatedly justified the war as
necessary” all of which have the effect of distinguishing the author’s view from the
propositions being put forth. The President is identified clearly as the active agent in the
quotes above, for example, there is no agency deletion from “he portrayed Iraq…” to
“Iraq was portrayed as…” Furthermore, although the author did not openly challenge the
President’s claims (such as the claims of a “victory” in Iraq, or links between al-Qaeda
and Iraq), she also did not reify the President’s claims in her own analysis through
repeating them. For example, DeYoung did not make references to “the victory in Iraq”
or to “the removal of the WMD threat posed by Iraq.” Hence, the language of the author
does not re-inforce the normalization of the war’s ending as strongly as it potentially
could. Transitive choices are critical to representation in journalism; however, these have
to be considered along with the meaning that the rest of the text conveys (Richardson,
2007, pp. 57-8). Therefore, while it is difficult to gauge DeYoung’s intentions or political
stance, there are not robust challenges to the White House discourse in her article despite
the report retaining some distance by avoiding outright amplification of the President’s
message through adopting his rhetoric and language.

175

Discursive Strategies
In this article it is difficult to find clear instances of discursive manipulation or
examples of persuasive rhetoric that are directly attributable to the author. Harre points
out that “[i]n particular the two prime features of persuasive discourse are the use of
examples to prove a point, and the use of enthymemes, compressed stretches of logically
connected reasonings, in which commonly understood premises are not mentioned
explicitly.” (1985, p. 127). Instead of strong argumentation, the news report retains the
typical narrative structure of a description of an event, with a beginning, middle, and
ending. This is not to suggest that the effects of discourse on the construction of the
reality presented in the story are not operating within the text, rather, they are somewhat
more difficult to detect.
To examine further, we can turn to what van Dijk (1985b) terms the summary
portion of the “macrostructure” of a news story as it is realized through the headline and
lead paragraph. For example, typically the information placed at the beginning of the
story also reflects the part of it considered the most important by the editorial staff. The
headline captures the principle theme or topic of the event; and in this case it is the
President’s announcement of “Victory in Iraq;” thus, signaling to the reader that there is
some kind of ending to the conflict. However, as Scollon (1998) observes, news stories
undergo a process of mediation from the writer, sub-editor/s to editor and that it is often
the sub-editor that determines the headline and byline, and sometimes the lead paragraph
too (p. 192). Therefore, even though DeYoung’s article may not be politically aligned to
the Bush administration’s policies, the structural emphasis of the article, as expressed by
the headline and lead paragraph, echo the message of the President.

176

In addition, Carvalho’s (2008) analytical model of CDA adopted for this study
stipulates analyzing the composition of the discourse through an examination of what
information is included or excluded from the event being described. As mentioned, the
reliance on White House sources and absence of any oppositional political commentary
and Iraqi voices to the reality of the proclamation of victory in Iraq does exclude any
alternative discourses. For instance, the absence of discussion about the uncertainty of the
political future of Iraq, the ongoing security problems, the widespread anti-American
sentiments in Iraq as well as in the wider Middle-East, are all neglected even though
these issues are critical to providing any meaningful commentary about the ending of the
conflict.

Ideological Standpoints
The above section on discursive strategies illustrates the subtle ways in which
ideological perspectives can manifest in a news story even when there is the absence of
detailed analytical commentary on the announcement as well as lack of provision of
historical context. Although DeYoung does not overtly support the Bush administration’s
policy, there remains evidence of deference to the President, which is made more visible
as a result of the lack of critique and absence of alternative voices rather than through a
show of support. As a result of the lack of oppositional voices, van Dijk’s (2009a)
schema (discussed on p. 129) for identifying ideology is helpful here. In terms of group
membership, there is essentially the presentation of a single, unified perspective of the
U.S. with a focus on the actions of what ‘we’ do (fight “anti-terrorist” battles); an
explication of ‘our’ aims (to impede those countries “aiding terrorists or seeking weapons

177

of mass destruction”), and vague allusions to ‘our’ opponents described by Bush as
“[a]ny person, organization or government that supports, protects or harbors terrorists.”
In this sense, the representation of the event and issue is almost exclusively through a
nationalistic perspective.
The discourse on the ending of the Iraq War in this article is ultimately colored by
the Bush administration’s perspective as the war is represented as a success and its
ending normalized. Due to the discursive features examined above, particularly the
absence of critique and alternative voices, this article ends up confined to and
reproducing much of the Bush administration’s discourse although not always directly.

5.7 Textual Analysis: The Wall Street Journal
Cummings, Jeanne, and Hitt, Greg. Bush Says War Ending, Looks to '04 --- Declaration
Frees President To Focus on Broader Agenda, Including Campaign Plans. WSJ,
Friday, May 2, 2003, A, p.4. (1256 words).
No Author. World-Wide: What’s News: Bush staged a dramatic show of thanks for the
victory over Iraq. WSJ, Friday, May 2, 2003, A, p. 1 (180 words).

Layout and Structural Organization
President Bush’s announcement of the ending of the Iraq War featured in two
locations in the WSJ. The first, in a 180 word bulletin that appeared at the top of the list
in the daily news summary section called ‘World-Wide: What’s News.’ This bulletin
directed readers to other Iraq-related stories that appeared elsewhere in the edition. As it
is so brief, a second article was also selected for detailed textual analysis. The second
article was by Cummings and Hitt called “Bush Says War Ending, Looks to '04” and
appeared above the fold and as the main story in the ‘Politics and Policy’ section of the

178

newspaper on page A4, accompanied by a 2” x 3” cartoon sketch of the President
standing atop the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. The WSJ published other news stories more
prominently on its front page, these were: “After Inflating Their Income, Companies
Want IRS Refunds”, “Line of Fire: How TV Crew, Off On Its Own in Iraq, Fell Into
Fatal Fight --- U.K. Network Presses Military For Word on 2 Men Missing In a Clash
Outside Basra --- SUVs Raced Toward U.S. Tanks”, and “Inside the WHO As It
Mobilized for SARS.” It is peculiar that the President’s announcement did not feature as
the main story, or indeed that there was no photograph but the fact that the announcement
appeared at the top of the ‘World-Wide: What’s News’ section does indicate its
importance and did give the story greater visibility. Also, the headline of the Cummings
and Hitt article (“Bush Says War Ending, Looks to '04 --- Declaration Frees President To
Focus on Broader Agenda, Including Campaign Plans”) activates in the readers a sense of
conclusion to the conflict and looking ahead to the future or moving onto other issues
important to the 2004 Presidential election.

Objects
In the news bulletin, the principle discourse object of interest is the reference to a
“victory over Iraq” solidified by the following sentence: “Because of you, the tyrant has
fallen,” the president told the cheering crew of the carrier Abraham Lincoln off San
Diego, chosen for a moment of finality in a war ending with no formal surrender.” These
references contribute to a sense of finality to the war. There are other events in the news
brief that are not related to the announcement but report on events in Iraq, such as seven

179

soldiers being injured by grenades in Fallujah; the death of a Jordanian airport guard; and
the return of U.N. relief workers to Iraq.
The Cummings and Hitt article is in part dedicated to the ending of the Iraq War
but also as the headline suggests to offering political commentary on the future
Presidential campaign. The principle discourse objects of concern are: 1) the normalizing
of the ending of the Iraq War; 2) the spectacle of the speech; 3) constructing Iraq as a
‘clean’ war; and 4) the uncertainty over the future of Iraq. The lead paragraph contains
the President’s declaration that “major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle
of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.” Thus, forming the
macrostructure, that is the framework of the topic of the article as a whole, and
establishing the impression of an ending. The article also devotes attention to the
spectacle of the speech describing the “cheering troops,” how the president “personally
helped fly an S3 Viking Navy plane used for refueling during the war,” and how “Mr.
Bush strutted around the deck in a military flight suit, shaking hands with pilots and crew
under the shadow of a tower adorned with a sign that read: “Mission Accomplished.””
This, along with an earlier reference to removing a tyrant, and a later reference to Bush’s
announcement as “good news” evokes a sense of celebration and success in the war.
Thirdly, the article downplays the destructiveness associated with the invasion of
Iraq by contrasting the “devastating American attacks on civilian populations during
World War II” with the “relatively light damage to Iraq in this battle.” This point is
backed up in the following quote from the President that further adds to the metaphor of a
medical intervention to attack a disease in the form of a surgical procedure: “With new
tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve military objectives without directing

180

violence against civilians.” There is no mention of civilian casualties and infrastructure
destruction, or the difficulties faced by civilians in Iraq following the invasion. Thus,
constructing the reality of war as one that is surgical, precise and ‘clean.’ Without
commentary on consequences of the war, the authors also add to the sense of
righteousness associated with the actions of the United States.
Fourthly, within the context of the 2004 Presidential campaign, Cummings and
Hitt allude to a sense of uncertainty surrounding the future of Iraq. They write:
While Mr. Bush is riding a wave of public support fueled by war-time
sentiment, even Iraq can pose complications for the president. Voters may
judge him by what happens inside Iraq in the months ahead, by how
effectively he rallies other countries to help pay for Iraq's reconstruction,
how smoothly Iraq's transition to self-government goes, and whether the
U.S. finds the weapons of mass destruction that Mr. Bush used to justify
the invasion. The president, attempting to quell skepticism about the
existence of such weapons, said troops "already know of hundreds of sites
that will be investigated."
And:
Mr. Bush's remarks last night reflected the broader political sensitivity
within the White House about the war. Officials don't want to declare
victory for fear of appearing a conqueror rather than a liberator of Iraq.
That kind of flat-out declaration also is deemed inappropriate since
military clashes, such as the shootings this week in Fallujah, are

181

continuing inside Iraq. Indeed, several U.S. soldiers there were injured
yesterday when two grenades were tossed into their compound.
The excerpts above do not necessarily paint a bleak picture of the situation in Iraq but
allude to the issues of security, the challenges of reconstruction, and the establishment of
effective political leadership. However, the article mimics the sentiments expressed by
Bush that the “transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time.” The authors do
not challenge or criticize the Bush administration for the absence thus far of discovering
banned WMD but instead continue to give oxygen to the notion that there is a possibility
of finding them. The result is continued justification of the rationale and outcomes of the
war.

Actors
The key social agents developed in the WSJ’s two articles are the President, the
American electorate, the U.S. military, and al-Qaeda. The majority of the focus remains
on the President as he is portrayed as a war-time leader who is responsible for success in
the War on Terror, including the military victory and removal of Saddam Hussein from
power. The authors go on to say Bush’s administration will also build its campaign
around his “commander-in-chief role” and “national-security themes.” The article does
not develop any relationships between Bush and his political opponents or policy critics.
The absence of any such actors enables the Bush administration’s voice to dominate the
news discourse. Both the Cummings and Hitt article, as well as the brief bulletin
appearing on p. 1 of this WSJ edition, almost exclusively quote President Bush when
reporting; hence, allowing his perspective to dominate by affording him the most

182

“framing power” (Carvalho, 2008, p. 168). The quotations from Bush enable the Iraq
War to be contextualized within the publicly ubiquitous War on Terror discourse
(Hodges, 2007a, p. 80), for example, by mentioning the atrocities of September 11, 2001
as the precursor for U.S. military action, and asserting “nearly one-half of al Qaeda’s
senior operatives have been captured or killed” in a speech that was about the end to
major combat in Iraq. Finally, Bush’s presidency is exalted in the article’s concluding
sentence, ending with a quotation from the former President George H. W. Bush, praising
“the focus, clarity of purpose and sense of duty that Americans have come to know and
admire [in President Bush].”
Cummings and Hitt also discuss the importance of the American voter describing
Bush as he “went before the nation” in what they view as “the beginning of his 2004 reelection campaign.” The discussion of voters’ choice in judging Bush’s success in Iraq
gives some insight into what might be important to the wider public and electorate. The
authors do not dwell on the questions they raise regarding the outcomes of the war.
Instead, they defer to quoting Bush when raising questions about the failure to find WMD
or definitively prove links between Hussein and anti-American terrorists. Although the
voters are talked about, there are no mentions of public opposition to the war and no
voice given to the anti-war movement. Like the NYT and WP, there is heavy reliance on
the White House as a source, which limits the parameters of the news discourse. This
construction of the voter in the text, also illustrates the dual way in which discourse not
only reflects the existing situation in Iraq (in the present), but also constitutes a future
reality by forecasting what factors will be important to voters.

183

The institution of the U.S. military is also an important actor established in the
discourse of the text, even though the writers do not refer to official military personnel as
sources. The presence of the military is significant because Bush is physically present
with military personnel in his speech. When describing the scene in the news bulletin,
Bush is described as thanking “the cheering crew of the carrier Abraham Lincoln” and
quoted as describing the war as one fought “for the cause of liberty and for the peace of
the world.” Cummings and Hitt also describe the gathered sailors and marines as
“cheering” and Bush as “shaking hands with pilots and crew.” The co-piloting of the S3
Viking Navy plane also adds to the closeness of the relationship between the president
and military, something that is critical to ensuring public approval by conveying the
‘support our troops’ mantra to the wider public. Cummings and Hitt describe the voyage
of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln as “bringing home sailors and marines who had
participated in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,” which is further suggestive of a successful
“ending” to the war. Again, the close proximity that the authors establish between Bush
and reporting success in Iraq and the return home of military, seem supportive of the
President’s bid for re-election.

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
As touched upon above, the vocabulary used to represent the situation in Iraq is
sanguine; the use of phrases such as “great strides” and “military victory” to describe
U.S. progress, and Bush “riding a wave of public support” exemplify the positivity that
runs throughout the two WSJ articles. As mentioned, Bush’s leadership is also described
in glowing terms, which also adds to the sense of accomplishment and victory.

184

Roughly midway through the Cummings and Hitt article there are two references
describing Iraq as being in transition from dictatorship to democracy. This is an example
of nominalization by the authors (used by Bush in his speech as well) as the verb ‘to
transition’ is transformed in to a noun to describe a process. When stating that Bush could
be judged by voters depending on “how smoothly Iraq’s transition to self-government
goes” one of the effects of this usage is that it naturalizes the assumption that such a
transition is actually in process and that it will take place. This, in turn, has the effect of
retaining a positive outlook by ‘buying time’ and requesting voter patience towards the
existing instability in Iraq. Also, syntactically placing the terms “how smoothly” at the
start of the quotation helps continue the positive tone of the article by creating the
impression that the transition will be measured on a scale of “smoothness” rather than
simply “how the transition goes” or replacing the adverb “smoothly” with the less certain
and perhaps more accurate conjunction “whether” Iraq will transition to self-government
smoothly.
The rhetoric and formulations advanced by key social agents President Bush and
the authors of the article, frequently mirror each other and rarely clash. The result is a
cohesive discourse that permeates the text, which portrays the ending of the conflict as a
success and contextualizes the Iraq War as part of the broader War on Terror, which must
continue to be fought (see ‘Discursive Strategies’ below for more on this point).

Discursive Strategies
The authors of the articles in the WSJ readily adopted the War on Terror
discourse, which thereby determined the interpretive framework used to report the

185

announcement by President Bush. Hodges (2007a) highlights six key components of the
global War on Terror narrative, almost all of which are strongly present in the article: 1)
introducing the theme of a global War on Terror; 2) naming 9/11 as the precipitating
event; 3) mentioning the first ‘battle’ Afghanistan; 4) discussion of the many wars fought
on many fronts (only vaguely present); 5) talk of the ‘battle’ of Iraq; 6) recap of the
precipitating event and commitment to continue war. (2007a, p. 69). The discursive
impact of this narrative is not merely a representation of a pre-existing social world but
the language used plays a critical role in the construction of that social reality. Part of this
constructed social reality was the adequation between Iraq and al-Qaeda despite the
evidence against such an alliance (Hodges, 2007a, p. 83). Furthermore, by presenting the
Iraq War as part of a broader war to defend America, freedom and peace, the authors
legitimate Bush’s pre-emptive war policy despite the skepticism being voiced by War
critics as well as U.N. inspectors about the alleged Iraqi WMD program.

Ideological Standpoints
As mentioned already, there are some examples from Cummings and Hitt article
that suggest the authors would support the re-election of Bush. The presentation of Bush,
his policies, and the situation in Iraq are examples of positive discursive construction on
behalf of the authors. As was the case for the NYT and WP, there are noticeable absences
of the counter-arguments to Bush’s characterization of the ending and therefore
effectively silencing alternative discourses. Cummings and Hitt largely reinforce and
reproduce the Bush administration’s discourse allowing it to establish further hegemonic
presence in the public domain. Interpreting the data in light of the rest of the WSJ’s

186

coverage examined in the contextual analysis of this dissertation makes clear that there is
close alignment between the Bush administration’s ideological stance and that of the
WSJ.
In terms of the most vivid examples in the text of the workings of ideology, it is
neither the case that there are a large number of presuppositions or implicatures, nor that
it is through the semantic structures of the text that ideology is most visibly realized.
Instead, the attempt here has been to illustrate how ideology permeates the entire
discourse structure of the articles analyzed. It is through the simultaneous examination of
the various features of the text that a pattern of political support for the Bush
administration is revealed. The diachronic-historical analysis in Chapter Seven will help
illuminate some possible explanations for this support; in other words is it the strong
conservative political allegiance of the WSJ, or do the news media and WSJ specifically
tend to support the President at times of war as part of their ‘patriotic duty’?

5.8 Textual Analysis: USA Today
McQuillan, Laurence and Benedetto, Richard. Bush hails win, looks ahead, USA Today,
Friday, May 2, 2003, NEWS Section, A, p.1. (480 words).

Layout and Structural Organization
Of the articles selected for textual analysis, this one is the shortest in terms of
word length but is also fairly typical compared to the length of other USA Today articles
on the topic of the Iraq War. The article appeared on p.1 as a front page cover story and
was deemed the most important of eight other articles on the topic of Iraq appearing in
the same issue. The story was accompanied by a large photograph of President Bush

187

addressing smiling military personnel on the deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. The
headline was “Bush hails win, looks ahead” was also salient and establishing the story as
the key story on the front page. Beneath the photograph, another story about the sailors
nine and half month mission at sea and their return home added to the sense of “victory.”
The headline and lead paragraph established that the article was about the U.S. “winning”
the Iraq War, with the authors referring to the ‘end’ of the conflict as “America’s
triumph.” The lead also established the discourse of the War on Terror, stating Bush’s
warning that “the war on terrorism is far from over.” As others have discussed, the effect
of the War on Terror discourse appearing in the lead is that it activates general social
knowledge, which readers use to make sense of the information being presented (see
schema established by Hodges, 2007a, p. 69 cited above on p. 184), namely that the Iraq
War is one of many battles against the terror threat posed by enemies of the U.S. that first
manifested on 9/11.

Objects
As with the NYT, WP and WSJ articles, McQuillan and Benedetto also accepted
the President’s announcement of an ending to the war without challenging it, referring to
the war as a “swift success” and “triumph” and as the declaration by the president as
bringing “closure to the heavy fighting and [serving to] symbolically, if not officially,
declare victory.” The President is also quoted saluting the U.S. troops, saying “[b]ecause
of you, our nation is more secure. Because of you, the tyrant has fallen and Iraq is free.”
Thus, the discourse object of Iraqi freedom is established as an outcome of the war. The
authors do not question or raise concerns about what such freedom looks like, especially

188

in light of the lack of means for Iraqis to conduct effective governance and amidst the
widely reported growing Iraqi frustration with the American-led invasion. This relatively
short article also describes the speech as an event that was “crafted” by the White House
to “highlight Bush’s credentials as commander in chief and lay the political groundwork
for the 2004 presidential campaign.” The combined impact of these discourse objects is
to discursively construct the war as a success, as looking to the future of presidential race
signals moving forward from the war and consigning it to history.

Actors
As with the coverage of the NYT, WP, and WSJ, the principle actor is President
Bush as it is his voice that is most amplified throughout the report. The authors do not
assert many counter-arguments to the President’s announcement in their commentary,
which renders their voice subservient to his. Saddam Hussein is mentioned twice in the
context of the War on Terror and therefore established as the enemy. However, other than
contextualizing him in the War on Terror discourse, there are no overt examples of
evilification of his character. Interestingly, given that the Iraqi leader’s whereabouts were
not established at the time of the speech and that there had been no formal surrender or
ceasefire, it is surprising that the authors do not raise it as an important issue in declaring
victory.
President Bush is represented as a worthy commander in chief with no questions
raised regarding his leadership in the war. Even the unproven claims of Iraq’s WMD
threat made by the President and his administration to justify the invasion of Iraq is
downplayed by citing the results of a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll of 409 people

189

watching the speech, 79 % of who said the war was justified even if no WMD are found.
The implication of including such information is that the President is presented as having
public support and his decision to go to war vindicated. The authors also speak positively
of Bush’s leadership by referencing his “successes in Afghanistan and Iraq.” Finally, in
terms of the dominant voice in the article, it is clearly President Bush whose perspective
determines the framing of the ‘ending’ of the war. One possible reason for the lack of
other voices that challenge the President’s perspective contained in the article could be
the briefness of the article and that there were seven other articles on the Iraq War
appearing in the newspaper on the same day. Some of these articles do offer different
voices as shown in the contextual analysis; and some did raise challenges to the
President’s narrative regarding the consequences of the war and issue of responsibility for
these. However, McQuillan and Benedetto’s article was the most salient and attributed
the most importance editorially judging by its appearance on the front page.

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
In addition to the lexical choices characterizing the war’s end as a success
mentioned above, the descriptions of a “buoyant” audience and “cheering sailors and
Marines” give the reader the impression of celebrating victory and success. Indeed the
audience is invited to celebrate “America’s triumph,” a phrase, which carries with it a
patriotic tone, perhaps designed for broadening the emotional appeal of the outcomes of
the war to the readers. However, this is an isolated incidence of patriotic undertones from
the authors, and despite a few examples of patriotic sentiments expressed by Bush in his

190

speech, there are not many concrete examples of rhetorical devices employed to
emotionally manipulate readers.
Inevitably the aim of the President’s speech was to characterize the war as a
success and galvanize public approval for the policies of his administration. McQuillan
and Benedetto quote elements of Bush’s speech, which contextualize the war in the War
on Terror discourse. It has been demonstrated in various studies that the discourse of the
War on Terror was manipulative through its evocation of the imagery of 9/11 and thereby
generating a paranoia and fear of another such attack in the public mindset (see for
example, Nacos, Bloch-Elkon, & Shapiro, 2011, p. xii). By submitting to the Bush
administration’s rhetoric, and conceding the discursive terrain in their article, McQuillan
& Benedetto enable the Bush administration’s rhetoric to be amplified, even though this
may be not be a conscious choice.

Discursive Strategies
In addition to reproducing the War on Terror discourse, the article by McQuillan
and Benedetto also reified the legitimacy of the “Bush Doctrine,” which they describe as
serving to inform nations that they “must side with efforts to stamp out terrorists or they
will be viewed as standing with the enemy and will be “targets of American justice.”” Or
more succinctly stated as “either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.” (Bush,
2001c, p. 69). Although the authors to do not overtly advocate for the use of pre-emptive
military strikes against sovereign countries without obtaining the necessary legal
approvals from the U.N., they also do not highlight the controversy of a nation acting
outside the accordance of international law. Specifically, McQuillaan and Benedetto do

191

not challenge the Bush Doctrine by describing the attack on Iraq as one on a sovereign
nation that had not acted aggressively towards the U.S. Instead they quote Bush’s phrase
“targets of American justice,” which performs the function of a euphemism by disguising
an act of aggression as an act of delivering justice.
In the very next paragraph after mentioning the Bush Doctrine, the authors go on
to state that “An official declaration [of an end to war] would trigger international laws
that, among other things, bar killing a nation’s leader.” The effect of this arrangement of
composition is that it serves to remind the readers that the U.S. is a nation that respects
and adheres to international law rather than a rogue state that acts outside of the law. This
is also an example of positive self-representation in the tradition of American
exceptionalism – essentially an argument that the U.S. has a uniqueness amongst nations
that justifies its acts of exceptionalism in history (also see Chapter Two, p. 75).
Another example of legitimating Bush’s pre-emptive war policy is by presenting
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as successes. McQuillaan and Benedetto write: “[a]fter
successes in Iraq and Afghanistan, Bush said, ending the strife between Israel and
Palestinians is his next goal. Just this week, his administration outlined a "road map" for
peace in the Middle East.” The implication here is that Bush’s policies are wellintentioned and to be trusted because they have been successful in Iraq and Afghanistan
already, and because the President is ready to work towards peace in the long-standing
Israel-Palestine conflict. The Orwellian logic behind the notion that a policy of preemptive war is the solution to obtain peace is striking. Another effect of this is to consign
the events of Iraq to history by emphasizing the beginning of a new international effort
towards peace in the Middle-East, thus, adding to a sense of conclusion in Iraq.

192

Ideological Standpoints
Many of the same issues regarding the workings of ideology highlighted in the
analyses of the NYT, WP and WSJ are also present in this USA Today article. For
instance, the incompleteness of information on the present situation in Iraq and the
absence of alternative discourses when discussing the ‘ending’ results in silencing and
marginalizing alternative representations of reality. As Foucault (1972) highlights,
hegemonic discourses formulate by limiting the range of discursive possibilities leading
to a discursive formation which becomes evident when there is a discernable regularity to
the discourse. This curtailment of discursive possibilities is vividly evidenced by
McQuillan and Benedetto’s reliance on and deference to President Bush’s perspective.
Even though the authors may not be politically behind Bush, a textual analysis of their
article reveals a reproduction of the dominant discourses, and therefore acts as a vehicle
to ‘distribute’ the ideology of the administration in the form of news.
The dependence on President Bush’s discursive formations such as the ‘War on
Terror’ and ‘Bush Doctrine’ results in a naturalization of the beliefs, rationales and values
of the Bush administration. McQuillan and Benedetto’s (and the USA Today editor/s)
thus provide an arena for the Bush administration’s policies to be broadcast to the wider
public and possibly influence readers which results in support for and materialization of
policies.

5.9 Summary
In brief, the contextual analysis of the 158 articles from 2003 has provided a
useful overview of the broader characterizations of the ending of the war. As mentioned

193

earlier, the outcomes of the war referred to the goals set out by the Bush administration in
relation to the war in Iraq, specifically to disarm Hussein’s regime of its WMD and to
eradicate the terrorist threat posed by Iraq. The consequences of the war referred to what
transpired as a result of the war, most of which were concerned with the negative
consequences such as the destruction of civilian infrastructure or civilian deaths. The
final component of the discursively constructed ‘ending’ of the Iraq War in the news
focused on how responsibility for the consequences of the war were assigned (or not).
The analysis underscored how multiple discourses continue to operate across the
coverage of a newspaper but that certain discourses gained prominence over others.
The broader discourses revealed in the contextual analysis, such as the
representation of the war as a success and situating the war within the War on Terror
construct, were also confirmed by the findings of the detailed textual analysis. In the
ending of the war announced in 2003, the (positive) outcomes of the war received far
greater attention in the coverage of the NYT, WSJ, and to a lesser degree the WP than the
(negative) consequences of the war. USA Today was an exception in this regard, in that it
offered more balanced coverage, which was especially evident in how much of the blame
for the negative consequences of the war was not apportioned solely to Iraqis or the
former regime but frequently to U.S. policies as well.
The textual analysis of the individual articles also yielded similar findings, which
shed light on the micro-level of how dominance of macro-level discourses was
discursively achieved through analysis of key components of discourse. The nationalism
and patriotism evident through the attribution of responsibility in the contextual analysis
was also confirmed when examining the presentation of certain social actors in the

194

detailed textual analysis that was conducted in much of the coverage. This was evident
across all four newspapers, even within USA Today, which did provide more balanced
coverage than the other newspapers selected in this study. How this was achieved was
discussed for each newspaper individually but what was revealed was the role that
language and rhetoric play, for instance, through the reliance on specific nationalistic
viewpoints that are presented through a Manichean lens and were illuminated through the
presence of van Dijk’s (1998) ideological square.

195

CHAPTER 6
DECEMBER 2011: FORMAL END OF WAR IN IRAQ
This chapter presents the findings from the contextual and textual analyses of
newspaper articles published in December 2011 reporting the formal ending of the Iraq
War. This chapter is organized in much the same way as the previous one, beginning with
a presentation of the results of the coding analysis of 61 newspaper articles analyzed
using NVivo 11 Pro – a qualitative data analysis software. The discussion that proceeds
summarizes what the dominant discourses were concerning the outcomes, consequences
and attribution of responsibility in the construction of the war’s ending. Prominence of a
discourse was determined by the number of selected articles from a given newspaper that
contained a particular discourse; a percentage was then calculated in order to aid the
visual presentation of the coding. (See Appendix B for NVivo coding summaries of
outcomes, consequences and responsibility and rankings of discourses). Next, I present
the findings and discussion of the textual analysis of selected articles which is based on
Carvalho’s (2008) model of analysis outlined in Chapter Four. Both sections incorporate
elements of the comparative-synchronic analysis where the focus remains on
demonstrating how the ending of the war was discursively constructed at a specific point
in time across the four newspapers selected in this study. For a brief overview of data and
comparison of front page headlines between 2003 and 2011 refer to section 5.1 in
Chapter 5.

196

6.1 Contextual Analysis: Outcomes
6.1.1 War as a Success
The withdrawal of troops in 2011 marked the end of the American combat
mission in Iraq. The characterization of the war as a success featured as a pre-eminent
outcome for all four newspapers. The discursive construction of success, that is the
constitutive elements in the constitution of ‘success’ had some differences across
newspapers; in addition, although the representation of war as a success was prominent in
the NYT and WP, these newspapers also emphasized the war’s failures. It is also worth restating that multiple discourses, such as those that highlight failures of the war, were also
simultaneously part of the war discourse across all four newspapers. The percentage of
articles which constructed the discourse of success for each newspaper was as follows:
USA Today (100 percent), NYT (68 percent), WP (62 percent) and the WSJ (56 percent).
The discourse of success drew from the positive outcomes of the war such as the
liberation of Iraqis from Saddam Hussein’s government, the potential for positive impact
in the wider Middle East region, and stressing the progress that was being made. USA
Today and WSJ had the least amount of alternative narratives to the war as a success
discourse and were the most likely to have a strong positive-self representation leaning
(that is, a pro-American leaning).

6.1.2 Removal of Dictatorship
Referring to the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s regime was a dominant discursive
construct in presenting the outcomes of the war; results revealed the WP (62 percent,
ranked first), USA Today (78 percent, ranked third) and NYT (27 percent, ranked fourth)

197

all cited this as a major outcome of the war, whereas the WSJ (56 percent, ranked joint
first) leaned its coverage on the existence of democracy in Iraq. This discourse
emphasized the liberation of Iraqis from Hussein’s regime, often with reminders of how
evil Saddam Hussein was, and underscored the values of democracy and freedom that
had come to dominate the discourse once the arguments about Iraq’s WMD and links to
terrorism threat had lost credibility.
Closely related to this discourse was the discourse on improvements in Iraqis lives
after the invasion which featured heavily in the coverage of USA Today (89 percent,
ranked second). This discourse often overlaps with the discourse on removing Hussein
from power and the consequences of regime change, in that it paved the way for Iraqis to
live better lives. The discourse focused on the state of democracy, the growing economic
opportunities available to Iraqis, and the increased freedoms now available. Often the
themes of this discourse ran through some of the coverage in the other newspapers but it
was a dominant feature of USA Today’s coverage and constituted a distinct discourse
separate from the discourse on democracy. The reality being constructed by USA Today
was congruent with its major discourse of the war as a success. In the NYT and WP the
war as a success narrative, although present, co-existed alongside competing discourses
that highlighted the challenges and failures as well.

6.1.3 War as a Failure
The reporting of the war’s failures was also a prominent feature in the coverage of
the NYT (68 percent, ranked joint first with ‘war as a success’), the WP (57 percent,
ranked third) and to a lesser extent in USA Today (44 percent, ranked joint fifth).

198

However, this discourse did not necessarily require the newspaper coverage to explicitly
call the wall a failure or draw attention to the failure of finding WMD or proving
definitively a connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda. Instead, the presentation was not of
the war as a total failure but honed in on several of the war’s negative outcomes,
principally concerning the ongoing difficulties to stop atrocities from being committed,
the sectarianism, and questions over the war’s overall legacy. The WSJ did not emphasize
the war’s failures and these did not form a distinctive discourse in its construction of the
war’s ending. In fact, most of the WSJ’s coverage was critical of the ending of the war
and stressed the need for a continued American occupation of Iraq to ensure the “gains”
were not lost. Furthermore, as can be seen from the coding sheet for the outcomes of the
war in the USA Today’s coverage, the discourse of failure competed with numerous
discourses of success (see Table B.2, Appendix B). Overall, the WP and to a lesser extent
the NYT were the two newspapers that highlighted the war’s failings without “drowning
out” the message with coverage about the successes.

6.1.4 Reconstruction of Iraq
This discourse was constituted by coverage that emphasized the U.S. role in
rebuilding and positively transforming Iraq; with numerous news items on the newly
forged U.S. – Iraqi economic partnership that would seek to build close ties in order to
help Iraq develop its oil industry, as well as further enhance economic and educational
ties between the countries. This discourse brought a sense of normalizing relations
between the countries and also demonstrated how the U.S. was helping to get Iraq on its
feet. Inevitably, wherever such news surfaced, there was often the absence of the

199

discourse on the cause of Iraq’s economic problems. Problems such as lack of modern
equipment and supplies, and lack of expertise were presented as though they had always
existed without the presentation of the context i.e., the sanctions on Iraq or the aerial
bombardment of Iraq and the devastating effects of such events on educational
infrastructure. This emphasis on Iraq’s recovery was most prominent in USA Today (56
percent, ranked fourth) and the WSJ (44 percent, ranked third), but also made up a
significant proportion of coverage for the NYT (23 percent, ranked fifth) and the WP (24
percent, ranked fifth). This discourse propelled the notion of a compassionate U.S. policy
of self-less interest and was often accompanied by news items about how much money
the U.S. was pouring into reconstructing Iraq.

6.1.5 Uncertainty over Iraq’s Future
Equally prominent across the four newspapers was the expression of uncertainty
concerning Iraq’s future but this was not necessarily characterized by critical coverage.
How each newspaper presented the uncertainty depended on the other discourses it was
situated within. In general, the discourse of an uncertain future emphasized the questions
over whether Iraq’s fragile government and security forces would be able to retain
control and order, especially over the competing groups that were not part of or
represented by the Maliki government. Prominence of the uncertainty discourse in terms
of a percentage of the selected articles for each newspaper was: USA Today (44 percent,
ranked joint fifth), WP (38 percent, ranked fourth), and WSJ (33 percent, ranked fourth).
The NYT expressed the precarious future of Iraq differently, expressing more concern
about the outcomes not being what the U.S. wanted (41 percent, ranked third). This

200

discourse pointed to undesirable outcomes such as the increasingly uncompliant Maliki
government, the increasing sectarianism of the Maliki government, and the lack of
progress in the oil sector as causes for U.S. concern. Such outcomes of the war were not
necessarily indicative of opposition to the war, indeed, these concerns often surfaced
when arguments for extending the U.S. troop presence in Iraq were presented. This was
especially the case in the WSJ but also represented the dominant Republican position that
found its way into the news discourse of the WP, NYT and USA Today as well.

6.1.6 Summary of Outcomes
The 61 newspaper articles selected from December 2011 following the
announcement of the final troop withdrawal from Iraq are revealing about the news
media’s overall characterization of the main outcomes of the war. Taking into account the
overwhelming desire of the American public for U.S. forces to exit from Iraq, as well as
President’s Obama’s promise to ensure troop withdrawal based on the timetable for
withdrawal agreed by Bush in 2008, it was unsurprising to see several lengthy articles
that focused on the legacy of Iraq with titles such as “What we left behind in Iraq” or
“What Obama’s leaving behind” and “End of an era.” In such articles, it was necessary to
reflect on the outcomes of the war but the positive presentation of the war as a success
enshrouded the true nature of the reality in Iraq. Like in 2003, positive self-representation
was a characteristic feature of much of the coverage across all four newspapers, and this
was evident in the discursive constructions of the outcomes of the war. The WP followed
by the NYT was perhaps the most measured in counter-balancing the successful outcomes
discourse with news stories about the ongoing problems in Iraq. USA Today offered the

201

least critical coverage and the most brazen examples of (mis)representing the state of
affairs in Iraq; the WSJ reminded its readers of the ongoing problems in Iraq in a way that
was intertwined with its endorsement of Republican policies of aiming to secure an
extension of the U.S. presence in Iraq coupled with direct critical attacks on President
Obama’s decision to withdraw troops. The coding analysis of the outcomes should be
interpreted in conjunction with the discourses on consequences and apportioning of
responsibility, as well as with the textual analysis to ascertain a clearer idea of how
competing discourses fared.

6.2 Contextual Analysis: Consequences
6.2.1 Iraq Faces Precarious Security Situation
Given the daily news reports of bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations in
Iraq, it is not surprising to find that much of the focus of the four newspapers cited the
ongoing level of violence as a consequence of the war. The discourse of this consequence
focused on the threat posed by Shiite militias and terrorists, the state of lawlessness and
inability of the Maliki government to secure Iraq. Prominence of this consequence in
terms of a percentage of the selected articles in which it featured was: WSJ (67 percent,
ranked first), NYT (50 percent, ranked first), USA Today (33 percent, ranked first), and
WP (38 percent, ranked joint fourth). Similar to its coverage of the uncertainty faced by
Iraq, the WSJ presented the security risks in a way that advocated retaining U.S. troops in
Iraq beyond 2011. The issue of responsibility for the ongoing violence is addressed below
however the context in which the discourse about security was situated rarely explicitly
linked the state of violence to the U.S. led invasion and occupation of Iraq. Nevertheless,

202

the fact that this issue was discussed in the context of the withdrawal of U.S. troops adds
to the presentation of the Americans as a force for good that were keeping peace in Iraq.

6.2.2 Political Stalemate
The focus of this discourse was on political instability, problems with the Maliki
government (from a U.S. government perspective), sectarian divisions, and the lack of
political solutions. Prominence of this consequence in terms of a percentage of the
selected articles in which it featured was: WP (43 percent, ranked joint first), NYT (46
percent, ranked second), USA Today (22 percent, ranked joint second), and WSJ (33
percent, ranked joint third). There was a great deal of uniformity in the discursive
construction of this discourse across the four newspapers. For example, there was a
general consensus that ethnic and religious loyalties were fueling sectarian politics and
were a stumbling block for various parties reaching political consensus. Despite the news
media’s focus on the political quagmire in Iraq, this did not overshadow the overall
characterization of the war as a success in the coverage of the WSJ and USA Today. Both
newspapers continued to highlight the formation of Maliki’s government as a positive
outcome of the war. In the coverage of the NYT and WP, it was often difficult to parse the
extent to which the political divisions were intended to be represented as a direct
consequence of the war or pre-dating the U.S. led invasion in 2003, thus, illustrating the
intertwined nature of how multiple discourses on the same issue operated within both
texts. Furthermore, the WP and NYT were more likely to voice concerns about the
growing sectarian and authoritarian tendencies of Maliki and his aides.

6.2.3 Growing Iranian Influence in Iraq
One of the preeminent consequences that emerged from the news coverage in
three of the four newspapers was the increase of Iran’s power in Iraq and the wider
region. This consequence was characterized by expressions of “Iran’s meddling,”
references to “Iranian-backed Shiite militias,” and warnings about the growing danger
posed by Iran. Prominence of this consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in
the selected articles for each newspaper was: WP (43 percent, ranked joint first), WSJ (33
percent, ranked joint third), and NYT (32 percent, ranked fourth). It is perhaps not
surprising that this discourse on Iran did not feature continuously and extensively in the
coverage of USA Today as it would run contrary to its characterization of the war as
resounding success but it did appear in the newspaper’s longest article on the end of the
war. The WP referred to Iran as emerging from the war as a “winner” and therefore as an
undesirable consequence of the war. The emergence of the Iran discourse is critical in the
construction of meaning to the war’s end as it offers readers an explanation and perhaps
even an excuse for the difficulties faced by the Americans in trying to “liberate” Iraq. The
discursive effect of this strategy is to not only absolve the U.S. of blame for the situation
in Iraq but to simultaneously contribute to the existing discourse on Iran as an enemy of
the U.S. and rogue state.

6.2.4 Growing anti-American Sentiment and Loss of American Influence
Related to the growing influence of Iran discourse, were the discourses on
increasing anti-American sentiments and the subsequent loss of American influence in
the region. The discourse on anti-Americanism featured coverage of news which

204

contained voices of opposition to the U.S. in Iraq, a mistrust of American intentions, as
well a sense of the enormous injustice the Iraqis felt against the U.S. for what transpired
in Iraq after the invasion. Such voices only appeared in the form of quotations or
paraphrased opinions from Iraqis rather than as the dominant views expressed by
American journalists. Prominence of this consequence as a percentage in which it
appeared in the selected articles for each newspaper was: WP (38 percent, ranked joint
fourth) and NYT (36 percent, ranked third). The suggestion that there was an immense
anti-American sentiment in Iraq did not find hegemony in the discourses of the WSJ or
USA Today but for different reasons. As aforementioned, USA Today predominantly
characterized Iraq as a success, without relying on celebratory language of military
victory, but by focusing on positive outcomes. Stressing the anti-American sentiments
many people in Iraq felt would also run contrary to the narrative of the U.S. troops being
liberators; ultimately, the discourse remained on the periphery of its coverage. In the case
of the WSJ, there were numerous expressions of quite the opposite view, that Iraqis
wanted the U.S. to remain in order to ensure security. Inevitably there were isolated
examples where Iraqi citizens might be quoted blaming Americans but in general, these
did not dislodge the dominant agenda of the WSJ, which was to oppose Obama’s
withdrawal of troops and stress the need for the U.S. to remain in Iraq. In addition, it is
also worth stating that the mere presence of quotations of Iraqis that opposed the
American presence in their country does not necessarily reflect a fair presentation of the
viewpoints, as who these voices are and how they have been previously represented
would also add or detract from their legitimacy. It is for this reason a closer textual

205

analysis that examines how actors and identities of groups and individuals have been
developed is particularly useful.
The need for the U.S. to remain in Iraq also found expression in the WSJ by the
presence of a closely related discourse that was the loss of American influence in Iraq.
This discourse was salient in the WSJ and featured in 33 percent (ranked joint third) of
the selected articles; it was also the most dominant in the WP’s coverage, with 43 percent
(ranked joint first) of articles highlighting the loss of the U.S. strategic foothold in Iraq,
and a failed consequence of the war to secure U.S. interests. Compared with the WSJ the
WP’s coverage seemed a less partisan assessment of the sober reality of the growing
differences between the Maliki government and the Americans, often citing the
unreliability of the Maliki government in remaining loyal to the American’s geopolitical
aims in the region. By highlighting this consequence of the war in this way, the WP was
again proving itself to provide the most critical and balanced coverage out of the four
newspapers.

6.2.5 U.S. Military Personnel Deaths
The mention of military deaths from the invasion found its way into the discourse
of the ending in all four newspapers. Prominence of references to military deaths were as
follows: WSJ (44 percent, ranked second), WP (29 percent, ranked sixth), NYT (27
percent, ranked fifth) and USA Today (22 percent, ranked joint second). This
consequence of the Iraq War did not dominate the discourse in any of the newspapers, but
numerous references to the military sacrifices and lives lost shaped the overall
construction of meaning to the ending of the war differently for each newspaper. The

206

sacrosanct position of the military was reflected by President Obama addressing the
troops at Fort Bragg, N.C. days before the final troops left Iraq, calling it “the most
respected institution in our land.” (Obama, 2011b). Therefore, even though this was an
obviously negative consequence of the war, the concept of sacrifices was frequently cited
alongside the ‘legacy of liberation’ that the American troops were leaving behind and in
which they could take pride. The WSJ highlighted the military deaths in order to make the
case for not losing the ‘gains’ of the previous eight years. USA Today quoted President
Obama and Secretary of Defense Panetta in thanking the troops for their service, and also
cited the successes of the American troops in deposing Hussein and “beat[ing] down an
insurgency backed by al-Qaeda terrorists.” (Brook, 2011, p. A6). The WP drew attention
to issues facing returning veterans such as re-adjusting and challenges in finding
employment in a weak economy. The NYT was perhaps the most critical of the war when
mentioning military deaths as the discourse surfaced most prominently around criticisms
of the rationale for war, and specifically of the Bush administration in leading the nation
into an unnecessary war. Overall, the military deaths discourse was utilized not only to
celebrate the war’s achievements but also to criticize the decision to go to war; thus,
illustrating how the same topic can reflect very different ideological and political
positions.

6.2.6 Civilian Deaths
A final consequence that featured in the discourse of the ending of the war in
three of the four newspapers was civilian deaths as a result of the invasion and
occupation. Prominence of this consequence as a percentage in which it appeared in the

207

selected articles for each newspaper was: USA Today (22 per cent, ranked joint second),
WP (19 percent, ranked seventh), and NYT (18 percent, ranked joint sixth). This
discourse did not feature significantly in the coverage of the WSJ. That this discourse
appeared so low down in terms of prominence across the four newspapers is revealing of
the low priority attached to the issue by the news media; by downplaying the importance
of civilian deaths as a consequence of the war the positive self-representation of the U.S.
remained intact. Furthermore where civilian deaths were mentioned, it was usually in
conjunction with other costs of the war such as U.S. military lives lost and the financial
cost of $1 trillion. The effect of this was to mitigate the heavy costs of war endured by
the Iraqi people for an outcome that did not bring about a great deal of improvement to
their lives. Reporting civilian deaths alongside U.S. military deaths presented a sense of
unified purpose amongst Americans and Iraqis, as well as mutual sacrifice. When in
reality, the devastating loss of civilian lives reflected the disparity between the Iraqi
people’s desire to free themselves from a foreign occupying power and the geopolitical
aims of successive U.S. administrations to extend its influence in the Middle East.

6.2.7 Summary of Consequences
One of the aims of CDA is to utilize different types of analysis in order to
establish patterns in the text that are revealing of how power and ideology operate to
propel a certain discourse; that is, one version of reality over another. CDA scholars are
interested in interpreting the collective meanings and impact of these multiple discourses
that appear across different texts. What emerges from this comparative-synchronic
analysis of newspaper stories about the ending of the Iraq War is the illumination of a

208

framework within which these stories operate. Or put another way, it is the narrowly
confined parameters within which the information presented is contextualized that shapes
the construction of reality.
These parameters of discourse could be conceptualized in terms of coverage that
broadly favors positive self-representation and a nationalistic-patriotic ideology. Within
these parameters there were slight variations between the different newspapers,
representing perhaps the Republican-Democratic leaning of the journalist or editor/s. The
coverage of the consequences of the war in USA Today was the most unabashedly
patriotic, providing little scope for critical coverage of the war itself. Even after public
opinion had turned against the war, and it was no longer politically fatal to express
opposition to the war (as it was during the run up to the war in the climate of the postSeptember 11 attacks and the launching of the War on Terror by President Bush), USA
Today downplayed the negative consequences and devoted more of its coverage by
presenting the positive outcomes of the war such as an emerging democracy and Iraqi
freedom, without critically examining the nature of the democracy and failure of the Iraqi
leadership to form an inclusive and representative government.
The WSJ’s coverage stood out for casting many of the negative consequences of
the war through a Republican Party rendering, specifically referring to the loss of
American hegemony in Iraq as a result of President Obama and the Democratic Party’s
policies in Iraq. For example, in an article entitled “What Obama Left Behind in Iraq”,
Ajami of the WSJ reported:
A president who understood the stakes would have had no difficulty
justifying a residual American presence in Iraq. But not this president. At

209

the core of Mr. Obama's worldview lies a pessimism about America and
the power of its ideals and reach in the world.
The one exception to this strategic timidity is the pride Mr. Obama
takes in prosecuting the war against terrorists. In a moment evocative of
George W. Bush, Mr. Obama last week swatted away the charge that he
had been appeasing America's enemies abroad: "Ask Osama bin Laden
and the 22 out of 30 top Al Qaeda leaders who've been taken off the field
whether I engage in appeasement." Fair enough. But the world demands
more than that, it begs for a larger strategic reading of things. (Ajami,
2011, p. A15).
Such a viewpoint was typical of the political stance of the WSJ adopted towards the exit
from Iraq, through, which runs a strong inclination of the ideology of American
exceptionalism and global leadership. Nearly, all the consequences discussed above were
interpreted within such a discourse. Overall, the WSJ’s focus was more on the
consequences of the exit for American power, than it was about the consequences of the
Iraq War itself. Hence, the marginalization of the discourse on Iraqi suffering through
death, displacement, injury, destruction of civilian infrastructure, or any such negative
outcomes. Another effect of such a construction of reality is that it reduces the suffering
and human costs of war to geo-political and economic agendas.
Of the newspapers selected in this study, the NYT and the WP offered the most
extensive commentary on the consequences of the war, but also operated within the same
framework of positive self-representation. The result of deploying such an underlying
framework meant the coverage emphasized Iraq’s problems without dwelling on these as

210

a direct consequence of the American-led invasion, or overlooked the negative
consequences all together. For example, the issue of lack of electricity and failure of the
American occupation to get services up and running even after eight years hardly
received any attention. Yet, the coverage spoke of the newly acquired freedoms Iraqis
enjoyed and the improvements in their lives. Even a brief glance at the rankings of the
dominant discourse on the consequences of the war reveals that civilian deaths,
destruction of Iraq’s infrastructure and lack of services did not dominate the NYT or WP’s
coverage as doing so would portray the U.S. in a negative light (see Appendix B for
further details on rankings of dominant discourses).

6.3 Contextual Analysis: Responsibility
One of the aims of CDA is to expose the workings of ideology or politicization in
a text; the discursive features and arrangement of a text can enable the removal or
masking of agency, which makes ascertaining the attribution of responsibility particularly
difficult. When examining multiple texts, there are not always enough instances where a
consequence or indeed attribution of responsibility is deemed dominant enough to be
considered significant across coverage. The results presented here prioritize those
consequences, which surfaced in multiple newspaper articles, and then only those where
there was a significant attribution of responsibility. So, for example, if only one out of the
nine USA Today articles selected for analysis discussed security concerns in Iraq, then it
was not considered a dominant discourse in the USA Today’s representation of its
coverage of the war. One of the most striking features of the results for the 2011 ‘ending’
was how infrequently the topic of responsibility surfaced. Another important factor to

211

bear in mind is that a principle aim of this contextual analysis and CDA is to interpret
overall discourse structures and trends across texts rather than rendering a quantitative
assessment of the data.

6.3.1 Responsibility for Political Situation
Figure 6.1 shows the attribution of responsibility for the political problems that
Iraq faced. USA Today and WSJ both had only two articles each where responsibility was
addressed, and both also cited the sectarian tendencies of Iraqis as the root of the political
instability. When it did assign blame, the USA Today blamed the Maliki government, a
government that frequently faced accusations of favoring the Shiite majority at the
expense of Sunnis. Even though the political disagreements amongst Shiites and Sunnis
was a reality that confronted Iraq, USA Today did not assign responsibility to the U.S.
policy of De-Ba’athification which was later adopted by the Maliki government to further
crackdown on Sunnis accused of being Ba’ath party conspirators or Islamist terrorists.
This policy had caused a great deal of resentment amongst Sunnis as they faced a
crackdown in the aftermath of the invasion where many were arrested, held in detention
centers, and sometimes tortured by U.S. forces.
In the case of the WSJ assigning blame to the U.S., this needs to be put into
context with the rest of its coverage that assigned blame specifically to the Obama
administration for what it deemed an early withdrawal from Iraq based on political
expediency rather than careful planning. In other words, it was not a case of critical
commentary on U.S. involvement in Iraq but politically motivated criticism of Obama’s
decision to withdraw. Figure 6.1 also shows the NYT directed most blame at the Maliki

212

government, but also raised concerns about sectarianism as well as the influence of Iran.
There was a significant apportioning of responsibility (in 30 percent of articles) to the
U.S. for a lack of clear post-war planning. Like the other newspapers the WP cited
sectarianism as the cause of the political problems; in addition, blame was also assigned
to Shiite Islamists for exacerbating sectarian tensions. Again, this was not free from
ideological or political biases, as the potential for a close alliance to emerge between Iraq
and Iran (also a Shia majority country) was something that concerned the U.S.
government.

6.3.2 Responsibility for Destruction
As pointed out in the section on Consequences, there was not a great deal of
newspaper coverage on the destruction caused by the war to Iraq’s civilian infrastructure,
cultural heritage sites, schools, or hospitals, for example (only a total of 8 articles of the
61 analyzed addressed this consequence). The issue did surface as a consequence of the

213

war in the NYT, USA Today and to a lesser extent, in the WP; often ,the discourse on
destruction took the form of references to the poor state of Iraq’s industries and their need
for improvement as well as general state of disrepair in the country as a whole. Figure 6.2
shows that the WP assigned responsibility equally between the Hussein regime for poor
maintenance, insurgents for looting and other damage since the invasion, and to the U.S.
for its policies of De-Ba’athification and lack of troop presence. So, it was not attributing
blame to the U.S. for the destruction caused by the aerial bombardment of Iraq or
conducting military operations in Iraq.
In two articles that addressed destruction in the WSJ, one charged the Hussein
regime for the conditions of Iraq’s infrastructure (without citing the U.N. sanctions which
were responsible for much of the destruction of Iraq’s once-impressive achievements in
education and civilian infrastructure) (Dagher, 2011), and the other blamed the U.S. but it
was in fact only through a quotation from Moqtada al-Sadr so not representative of the
WSJ’s position (Barnes, Dagher, & Hodge, 2011). USA Today only assigned
responsibility for destruction once and it was to insurgents that were blamed for
vandalizing electrical substations (Michaels, 2011). The NYT also assigned responsibility
for the destruction and alluded to the poor performance of oil and energy sectors as the
fault of religious extremists and Hussein. There were frequent examples in the NYT of
removing U.S. culpability. Recounting the killings of four Blackwater contractors, the
NYT reported: “[i]nsurgents killed four contractors in 2004, and a cheering mob dragged
their charred bodies through the streets. In the battles that followed, hundreds died and
much of the city was destroyed by bombs and airstrikes.” (Healy, 2011, p. A16). The
sentence begins by clearly assigning responsibility for the killings of the four contractors

214

to “insurgents;” however, it does not shed light on who was doing the destroying and
whose bombs and air strikes were causing the damage to the city. The second sentence
does not suggest the deaths of innocent civilians because it refers to “in the battles that
followed,” thus, indicating that those who died, died in battle. Furthermore the actions of
the insurgents are presented in a way that accentuates the barbarity of the insurgency as
well as casting the Iraqis as medieval by referring to “a cheering mob” and “charred
bodies.” There were never such descriptions of the Iraqi victims of aerial bombardments
by U.S. planes which also left in their wake many charred dead bodies. Masking agency
was not an unusual feature as exemplified by the following excerpt from the NYT
describing the city of Fallujah:
Calls to prayer ring out from minarets where insurgent snipers once
perched. In restaurants once obliterated by mortars and airstrikes, waiters
skate from table to table with trays of lamb kebabs and fire-roasted
tomatoes. Opulent houses rise from fields of rubble, built by sheiks,
contractors and anyone else who benefited, illicitly or not, from the vast
sums of American money that poured into Iraq during the war. (Healy,
2011, p. A16).
The above excerpt does not state that the city was reduced to rubble by American mortars
and airstrikes; instead the composition of the paragraph creates the impression that it is
only the “insurgent snipers” responsible for the destruction, and the mention of
“American money” pouring in conforms to the characterization of the U.S. as nation
builders. Ultimately, a pattern of absolving the U.S. of blame for the destructiveness
reflects a clear pro-American bias in the coverage of all four newspapers, as well as an

215

adherence to a Manichean presentation of world events in which the U.S. is always on the
side of righteousness. This type of characterization demonstrated the presence of
nationalism in news discourse and confirmed the position held by many critical scholars
(see Chapter 2) regarding the difficulty (indeed, impossibility) for journalists to provide
objective, balanced coverage which is free from ideological commitment. This is not
necessarily a problem unique to American journalism (or the profession of journalism)
but it is still useful for highlighting the political nature of all representation and
discourses.

6.3.3 Responsibility for Precarious Security Situation
As highlighted above, the ongoing security problems faced by Iraq appeared as
one of the most dominant consequences of the war across all four newspapers; yet, the
attribution of responsibility fixated on current causes of insecurity rather than seeking to
attribute responsibility for the security that resulted from the invasion and occupation. As
can be seen from Figure 6.3, it is only the NYT, which attributes responsibility for the
security problems on to the U.S. but in both of the articles it did this, it was criticism
216

levelled at President Obama for his exit strategy and leaving former allies in a state of
limbo in Iraq rather than taking up opposition to U.S. foreign policy. The state of
insecurity was blamed on sectarianism and the violence perpetuated by Shiite Militias,
unidentified ‘insurgents’, and ex-Ba’ath party members. It was clear to those following
events closely in Iraq that an alliance between Iraqi Shiites and Iran was seen as an
undesirable outcome for the Americans, not least because the Shiites were amongst the
most vocal opposition groups to the Americans, especially those identifying with
Moqtada al-Sadr’s Sadrist movement. Furthermore, the increasing Sunni alienation from
Maliki’s government due to its crack down on former Ba’ath party members, including
prominent Sunni leaders, also led to anti-government and anti-occupation militias.
The weakness of Iraq’s security forces was also a reason for the problematic
security situation, especially highlighted by the WSJ, which had opposed Obama’s policy
to remove the troops. The WSJ characterized the withdrawal as contrary to what most
Iraqis wanted, stating “[t]his wasn't something the people of that region pined for. These
are lands that crave the protection of a dominant foreign power as they feign outrage at its
exercise.” (Ajami, 2011, p. A15). The underlying presumption here contrasted the Bush
administration’s rationale for bringing ‘freedom’ to the Iraqis by the overthrow of
Hussein’s government in 2003 (after the WMD and terror links were disproved); it was
ironic WSJ was now making the argument that the Iraqis pined for domination from a
foreign power. It was surprising to find no commentary attributing blame for the loss of
security on the policies of the Bush administration and initial decision to go to war,
especially as the American war was drawing to a close.

6.3.4 Responsibility for Civilian Deaths
The WP was the only newspaper that significantly apportioned responsibility for
civilian deaths in its discourse on the ending of the war. Figure 6.4 shows how this
responsibility was distributed between sectarian militias (40 percent), the U.S. (20
percent), and Hussein loyalists (20 percent). By far the most significant finding was the
removal of agency for who was responsible for civilian deaths when they did occur; this
happened in 80 percent of the WP articles on this topic. Another reason for this was that,
the coverage merely mentioned that “tens of thousands” had died in the conflict but it
was never the case that the responsibility for these deaths was levelled at those that
launched the war or even the way the U.S. military conducted it. One article in the WP
claimed, that “[e]ven taking into account the far larger number of civilians killed, injured
or displaced, Iraq trails well behind the really big wars of the modern era. Not casualties
but consequences define the significance of this lamentable episode.” (Bacevich, 2011, p.
218

B1). Downplaying the civilian deaths was a general theme in the news discourse across
all four newspapers; and the removal of agency simply naturalized these as ‘collateral
damage’ or the inevitable price of a greater good.

6.3.5 Summary of Attributing Responsibility
The attribution of responsibility or blame is one of the simplest ways to discern
the ideological leaning in news items. This analysis revealed that there was consistently a
pattern of omitting responsibility for negative consequences of the war. This was
especially problematic because all four newspapers featured prominent front page stories
offering an assessment of the war’s successes and failings, and yet did not offer critiques
of U.S. foreign policy objectives or consistently highlight the flawed rationale for the
war. For consequences such as the growing anti-Americanism in Iraq or civilian deaths
featured, there was a tendency across all four newspapers to deflect responsibility away
from the U.S., whether it was criticism of the foreign policies of the Bush or Obama
administrations. As shown above, the WSJ was the most critical of the withdrawal, not
because it took a stance of opposition to the war but because it advocated for keeping an
219

American presence in Iraq and holding on to apparent ‘gains’ made over the years. The
WP offered the most diverse opinions on the topics, followed by the NYT.
Generally, the WSJ and USA Today’s coverage were overtly dominated by a proAmerican perspective that permeated much of the commentary on the withdrawal of
troops. Thus, frequent characterizations of the war as a success by focusing exclusively
on positive outcomes such as the liberation of the Iraqi people was common in both these
newspapers. Comparatively the NYT and WP contained more critical coverage of the war
but both papers also contained patriotic undertones to their coverage and displayed a
tendency to gloss over the negative consequences of U.S. actions in Iraq.
This first stage of analysis provided a glimpse of the ending of the war by
establishing what the overarching outcomes, consequences and responsibility for these
were. It also provides the necessary context that aids a more granular analysis of selected
texts as it is important to be aware of the broader corpus of newspapers’ coverage on an
issue when examining a specific text.

6.4 Textual Analysis: The New York Times
Arango, Tim. U.S. Marks End to a Long War for an Uncertain Iraq. NYT, Friday
December 16, 2011, A, C0, p. 1. (1965 words). [Reporting was contributed by
Jack Healy, Michael S. Schmidt, Andrew E. Kramer, Duraid Adnan, Omar alJawoshy and an employee of The New York Times]
Layout and Structural Organization
This was the NYT’s leading cover story on the ending of the war during this
period, dominating the page above the fold with a large photograph showing an orderly
convoy of armored American military vehicles arriving in Kuwait, the serene background
and night sky conveying a sense of calm as well as symbolizing the formal withdrawal of
220

American troops. Arango’s article was also chosen because the story provided extensive
analysis and commentary on the American legacy in Iraq, being nearly 2000 words long
and nearly 900 words longer than the next longest article. The headline not only
conveyed the prolonged state of war but also Iraq’s ominous future. The reference to Iraq
as a “Long War” in the headline also resonated with the somberness and fatigue felt by
the American public about the conflict which many had already begun to view as a
mistake. As the headline can be indicative of the editor’s preferred reading of the text that
follows, it is interesting that in it the U.S. is made to be the “active” agent which
determined the ending of the war. Conversely, Iraq is passivized through the use of the
phrase “Uncertain Iraq” which connotes a kind of helplessness or feebleness. The effect
of this syntactical arrangement of the sentence is that the criticism of the U.S. is deflected
and responsibility for the problems in Iraq partially shifted on to Iraq itself. The reporter
Tim Arango is cited as the author, but an additional six reporters are also identified as
contributors, which complicates being able to distinguish Arango’s voice from the others.
The implications of this collective authorship and its impact on the discourse are
addressed in detail in the section on Actors below.

Objects
There are a number of important discourse objects that are established in the
article. However, the focus of the analysis will remain on those objects that are most
directly concerned with the representation of the ending of the war, and specifically the
discursive construction of the outcomes, consequences and issue of responsibility. The

221

pertinent discourse objects that are textually constructed are as follows: 1) Iraq faces
huge problems; 2) Iraq is a fractured society; and 3) the American legacy in Iraq.
Arango’s article does not exude a celebratory tone for the ending of the war or
one of an American victory. There is instead a significant focus on the ongoing security
problems with the author describing Iraq as “a shattered country marred by violence and
political dysfunction” and “an extremely dangerous place….[where] there were 500 to
750 attacks a month this year, including bombings, rocket attacks and assassinations.”
Throughout the article there are instances of vivid descriptions of life in Iraq, for
example:
Aesthetically, Baghdad is still a war zone of checkpoints, blast walls and
coils of razor wire, where buildings sit partially destroyed from the first
wave of bombings that President George W. Bush called ''shock and awe.''
At entrances to the garrisoned heart of the central government, the Green
Zone, vehicles on the way in are searched for bombs, and on the way out
for kidnapping victims. And most Iraqis still receive only a few hours of
electricity a day, forcing many to sleep on their rooftops during sweltering
summer nights.
The excerpt above gives readers a sense of the colossal failure to bring security and peace
to Iraq; the reference to the electricity shortages in the country after nearly 9 years of war
only serves to accentuate the sense of failure of the reconstruction mission.
Iraq is presented as a country with a fractured society, with multiple references to
the ethnic and religious divisions and phrases such as “failed reconciliation,” “political
dysfunction,” “standstill” and “paralyzed” to describe the situation of political disunity.

222

One of the effects of this is to present the current crisis in Iraq as pre-dating the U.S. led
invasion. There is some truth to this thesis but experts were well aware of the ethnic and
religious diversity of Iraq prior to the invasion; much was already known about the
frustrations and grievances of the majority Shia population at the hands of a Ba’athist
government, which was largely perceived to favor the Sunni minority; and much was also
known about the Iraqi government’s harsh suppression of the political will of the Kurdish
minority in the north during the 1980s and 1990s. Therefore, the U.S. government’s
decision to enact regime change without adequate preparation for the unleashing of
violent forces after years of resentment and frustration in the population is overlooked.
The absolving of U.S. responsibility for the violence in Iraq is exemplified in the
following sentence describing its benign efforts: “Iraq faces a multiple of vexing
problems the Americans tried and failed to resolve.” The article also speaks of a
“generational divide that splits older Iraqis…from younger ones, who are more drawn to
the culture and ideas the Americans tried to import here.” Such sentiments contain an
Orientalist discourse as the article is suggestive of the idea that the Americans invaded to
‘import ideas’ to Iraqis in order to show them how to be free and liberated; that the Iraqi
people were unable to understand these ideas is not the fault of the Americans.
This point segues into the discourse object of the American legacy in Iraq which
is another important theme running throughout the article. The author states “the war
leaves an uncertain legacy as Americans weigh what may have been accomplished
against the price paid, with so many dead and wounded.” Arango highlights the
destructive consequences of the war citing “about 4,500 American fatalities” and “more
than 100,000” Iraqi civilian deaths, and makes numerous other references to violence and

223

instability. Furthermore, Arango mentions the failure to find illicit weapons as
undermining the original rationale for war. As mentioned above, the political instability,
ongoing violence, and regional instability which has resulted from the invasion is also
discussed. One particularly critical passage on the legacy of the American invasion reads:
In Falluja, where years of block-to-block urban combat left behind a city
that its Sunni residents refer to as Iraq's Hiroshima, residents celebrated
the withdrawal with a day of public demonstrations, angry speeches, the
burning of American flags and a gallery exhibition of photos of mangled
children, destroyed homes and other signposts of what residents call the
bitter legacy of the American invasion.
Arango’s reference to Hiroshima and the anti-American sentiment resulting from the
devastation caused by the invasion leaves the reader with a sense of failure that countered
the more upbeat tone of President Obama in his speech at Fort Bragg just two days earlier
declaring the American legacy in Iraq as an “extraordinary achievement” and calling the
country a “sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq.” (2011b). Despite the negative
consequences and legacy being salient in the article, these points are also counteracted
with passages that are at times incongruent with the rest of Arango’s piece. For example:
Iraq has improved in some respects. Life in Baghdad has blossomed in
recent years -- street life has returned, markets are bustling, a new
amusement park is opening and even the circus came to town this year.
The government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, while
hamstrung by sectarian infighting, was chosen in elections last year that
international monitors declared as free.

224

And:
The war opened Iraq to the outside world. For the first time, Iraqis had
easy access to satellite television and the Internet. This allowed the pop
singer known as Dali, who left Iraq in the 1990s as a child and became
famous in the Arab world, to become a star in her own country. She
recently returned for the first time since the war began, to perform and
film a music video.
Such passages are frequent throughout the article; the contrast of celebrating access to
satellite television alongside Arango’s descriptions of “mangled children” and “destroyed
homes” seems beyond absurd. The impact of such passages will be examined in more
detail in the section on actors below. Here, the point has been to highlight that the legacy
of the war seems to oscillate between negative and positive.

Actors
At the time of publishing, the author Tim Arango was reporting from Iraq and
held the position of Baghdad bureau chief for The New York Times. He has gone on
record on numerous occasions citing the negatives of the American legacy in Iraq,
particularly emphasizing the rise of ISIS as a consequence of American policies in Iraq,
such as selection of the Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki (whose policies were
considered divisive and alienated many Sunnis); the de-Baathification policy and
decision to dismantle the Iraqi army and other state apparatus; and the indiscriminate
arrests of young Sunni men by the U.S. and the al-Maliki government. Arango as author
is obviously a key figure however, as mentioned above there are passages that seem

225

incongruent in the article, which appear to have the effect of trying to “balance” the
coverage – specifically the bad news with some good news. The extent to which these
moments of “good” news are representative of Arango’s voice is questionable as they do
not seem congruent with the vivid language used to describe the dire state of the country
and his comments elsewhere on the American legacy in Iraq. This illustrates the editorial
influence on the reporting, as there seems to be two very different discourses at work
about the American legacy.
Other than the journalists responsible for the article, the voice of a number of
Iraqis is prominent throughout with several quotations included in the text. For example,
Muhammed Ali, a merchant who lost two brothers during the conflict, when talking
about a market in Baghdad is quoted as saying “[t]his will be an easy target for car
bombs….People will die here.” Emad Risn, an Iraqi columnist is quoted as saying that
the war’s end “is the end for the Americans only….Nobody knows if the war will end for
Iraqis, too.” A Shiite politician laments “[w]e are going from bad to worse.” And
elsewhere another civilian speaks of his joy at the American departure, saying “[i]t’s a
huge happiness that the Americans are getting out…Hopefully, we are all going to be
fine, we Iraqis. We were doing fine before 2003.” These voices convey the uncertainty
felt by Iraqis due to the widespread violence and volatility in the country as well as show
the hostility felt by many towards the U.S.
The Iraqi voices do not dominate the entire discourse however, as often there is
commentary interspersed throughout the article that resorts back to describing the crimes
of Saddam Hussein and his regime, almost as if reminding readers of the good that the
United States was trying to achieve. In one instance, a passage from the article states:

226

Experts estimate that the remains of 250,000 to one million Iraqis lie in
mass graves around the country, victims of the Hussein government. Not a
single victim has been identified by DNA analysis, partly because various
government ministries and the two factions with the greatest claims of
victimhood -- the Kurds and Shiites -- have been unable to agree on how
to proceed. The lack of a painful but cathartic process of reckoning with
its history -- as South Africa and other countries have done -- has stymied
Iraqi society's ability to vanquish the ghosts of its past.
The first line resembles the type of news reporting that was so widespread in justifying
the invasion in 2003, especially by Bush administration officials after the failure to locate
illicit weapons. Also evident is apportioning the blame and responsibility for Iraq’s
current problems onto Iraqis themselves; thus, deflecting and mitigating American
culpability in the devastation. As identified above, this narrative is the essence of the
discourse object that presents Iraq as a fractured society. This is indicative of the power
of journalists to construct a discourse – in this case, the discourse of Iraqi incompetence.
The identity of Iraqis that is constructed in the discourse is one of a helpless
people; they are passivized to the point of impotence, including most of those that are
given voice in the article. For example, the quotes from Muhammed Ali and Emad Risn
above have an air of inevitability and despair. Elsewhere the report mentions the low
levels of Iraq’s oil output, whilst another Iraqi is quoted saying about the political
situation: “[w]e are in a standstill and things are paralyzed.” This sense of impotence is
summed up in a passage that reports that “for better or worse, [Iraq] is now in the hands
of its people.” This commentary contributes to the discourse of Iraqi incompetence and

227

overlooks the very real problems Iraqis face as a consequence of the invasion. Such
problems include massive civilian deaths, economic losses, infrastructure destruction, and
a civil war that will take decades to recover from.
There are many different actors and groups talked about in the text, such as
Sunnis, Shias, Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia, Shiite militias, and
other regional powers such as Iran, Syria and Turkey. What is particularly remarkable
about this article is the absence of quotations and commentary of President Obama,
White House officials, or other American officials. It is perhaps indicative of a rejection
of the positive take on Iraq that President Obama spoke of only days earlier, as well as a
rejection of the voices of prominent figures in the previous administration, many of
whom continued to insist that invading Iraq was the right decision. This lack of
subservience to the Obama endgame narrative was also found in the research of King
(2014) and Feldman, Huddy and Marcus’ (2015); with King arguing that the WP and
NYT departed significantly from the official White House narrative.

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
The article highlights the “menacing role of Iranian-backed militias, which
…killed many American soldiers” when describing the instability and violence. It does
not contextualize the rise of the militias as a consequence of the invasion and subsequent
breakdown in law and order, as well as due to the inability of the Iraqi army or indeed the
coalition forces to protect Iraqi civilians. The use of the term “Iranian-backed” to
describe these groups also resonates with the American public’s image of Iran as a
familiar enemy and rogue nation in recent history. The vocabulary used to describe

228

Moktada al-Sadr, an influential and widely respected Shiite cleric in Iraq known outside
of Iraq for his opposition to the American occupation, indicates the discursive
construction of a negative identity for his movement. According to the report the U.S.
withdrawal means that American diplomats are now considered “fair game for his
militiamen.” The use of the term “militiamen” has implications of operating outside of
law as does mentioned to in close proximity to al-Qaeda, which has the effect of delegitimizing the Sadrist movement.
There are numerous examples of presupposition that sustain different discourses
in the article. For example, speaking of Iraq as needing to “manage its rivalry with Iran”
assumes there is a rivalry, and connotes strained relations between the two countries.
Close observers would see the reality as quite different. However, even in the article it is
reported that “close political ties” between Iraq’s Shiite leadership and Shia-majority Iran
are a worry for Americans. This sustains the discourse of Iran’s meddling in Iraq, which
had pervaded media discourse for many years.
An interesting and potent metaphor that emerges from the construction of the
collective identity of Iraq is one of a patient suffering incapacitating mental illness. The
metaphor surfaces at various key points in the article. The lead paragraph sets the stage as
follows:
At a crowded market in the city center here, the flotsam of the war is for
sale. Ripped Fuel workout supplement. Ready-to-eat meals, macaroni and
cheese ''Mexican style.'' Pistol holsters. Nothing seems off limits to the
merchants out for a quick dinar, not even a bottle of prescription pills from
a pharmacy in Waco, Tex., probably tossed out by a departing soldier.

229

These deranged Iraqis scramble for survival selling the “flotsam” – the unwanted and
useless leftovers from war, presumably to equally deranged buyers, including bizarrely a
bottle of prescription pills ironically from a place named Waco, which one would be
forgiven for mispronouncing as “wacko.” The discourse of a fractured society of Iraq is
continued with the mental illness metaphor: Iraq, with its many religious and ethnic sects,
its political infighting and perpetuation of sectarian violence suffers from a form of
dissociative identity disorder, where the multiple personalities cause internal conflict and
suffering. The article informs the reader that the “dictatorship inflicted deep wounds to
the collective psyche, which partially explains why the American invasion unleashed so
many unforeseen consequences, from sectarian violence to a winner-take all political
culture.” Thus, Iraq resembles a mentally ill patient suffering from past trauma and a
madness that was always latent beneath the surface and could not have been foreseen by
the Americans.
The “winner-take-all political culture” reflects a psychopathic entity acting
without conscience or awareness of its impact on wider society. Furthermore, Iraqis that
are suspicious of the American exit are said to suffer from “a conspiratorial mind-set
developed over years of living under the violent and repressive dictatorship” and are
deluded by “other perceived injustices at the hands of the West.” As Gill and Whedbee
(1997) point out about the metaphoric process, “the mind grasps an unfamiliar idea only
by comparison to or in terms of something already known.” (p. 173). Whether or not the
usage of the metaphor is intentional, its rhetorical presence emerges, and has the effect of
comparing the foreignness of Iraq with popular perceptions of some traits of mental
illness resulting in a dismissal of the Iraqi point of view.

230

Discursive Strategies
The vocabulary used to describe civilian deaths is vivid, the author does not
attempt to use euphemistic language to replace words like “killing” and “assassination”
or avoid mentioning “more than 100,000” civilian deaths. However, throughout the piece
there is a masking of agency for the responsibility for the destruction of infrastructure and
the death toll. It is not explicitly stated that the heavy American bombardment of the
country contributed to the destruction or left many civilians dead. This has the effect of
diminishing U.S. responsibility for the present problems faced by Iraq.
Another way in which U.S. responsibility is negated is that when mentioning alQaeda, the report overlooks that that group did not exist in Iraq prior to the invasion and
emerged as a consequence of the invasion in response to the failure of the occupying
forces and newly installed Shiite-dominated Iraqi government to protect the
disempowered Sunni minority. In fact, the removal of the context in which al-Qaeda
obtained a foothold in Iraq is suggestive of the Iraqi propensity for religious extremism,
exemplified by the use of the term “homegrown” to describe Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
The normalization of al-Qaeda’s presence through omission of context is also evident in
the description of a part of Baghdad: “His neighborhood is no longer a bloody
battleground controlled by Al Qaeda.” This is followed up immediately with commentary
that states “The War opened Iraq to the outside world.” The arrangement of propositions
in this segment aid the construction of a discourse that implies that al-Qaeda were
operating in Iraq until the war; and because of war, Iraqis benefitted from the positive
outcome of having the “outside world” opened up for them. The accumulative effect of

231

this discourse constitutes a manipulation of discursive reality and serves the functions of
justifying and legitimating the war.

Ideological Standpoints
The article does not discursively constitute an extreme polarization of actors as in
van Dijk’s (1998) ‘ideological square.’ Yet, some of the discursive strategies outlined
above do reveal an ideological leaning that stresses a belief in the inherent goodness of
the U.S.’s intentions in Iraq. This perspective is forwarded subtly but its presence is
observed through close attention to the accumulative effects of the numerous features
outlined already. To begin with, the opening few paragraphs inform readers of American
sacrifices and the costs of the war for the U.S (4,500 American fatalities and a cost of $1
trillion), and they describe the American perspective of a “lengthy conflict and repeated
deployments [that] strained the country and its resources.” Underlining American
sacrifices sets up the discourse of the well-intentioned American invasion but despite
America’s honest efforts to resolve Iraq’s problems, the Iraqis express ingratitude by
“public demonstrations, angry speeches, the burning of American flags.”
Although Arango’s article highlights many of the negative consequences of the
war, responsibility for these are almost never attributed to American policies in Iraq.
Coupled with highlighting the discourse of American sacrifices, one is left with the
impression that the Americans are on the right side of history. There is little discussion of
failed American policies and the integrity of the U.S. foreign policy is not questioned.
U.S. integrity is cemented in one paragraph citing the American invasion of Iraq as the
reason for opening up Iraq’s oil reserves to foreign investment. The report highlights that

232

“American companies did poorly in the postwar auctions” for lucrative contracts to
exploit Iraq’s oil fields and concludes that this helps “defuse criticism that the United
States invaded Iraq for its oil.” This is yet another example of manipulative discourse as
the inference to be made is that the failure to win contracts proves the claim that the
decision to invade Iraq was not about oil. However, according to Greg Muttitt, a senior
adviser to Oil Change International, an energy research organization, “[t]he most
important strategic interest [for the U.S.] lay in expanding global energy supplies,
through foreign investment, in some of the world's largest oil reserves – in particular
Iraq.” (cited in Ahmed, 2014). In other words, increasing global oil supplies would
ensure the stability of oil prices, hence the need to make Iraq a reliable oil exporter,
which it was not under the leadership of Saddam Hussein. Furthermore, there are still
industries that profit from the war. For instance, companies that secure contracts for the
re-building of Iraqi infrastructure, the supplying of military equipment to allied forces,
the manufacturing of expensive weaponry including thousands of ‘precision’ bombs, etc.
The point is that, U.S. companies not securing oil contracts does not necessarily discredit
voices in the anti-war movement that highlighted the war as immoral and unjustified.
Another ideological standpoint naturalized in the article is the vilification of Iran.
Iran is portrayed as a vulture, preying on the weakness of Iraq to expand its own
influence. The discursive impact of the construction of the identity of Iran as having a
destabilizing effect in the region, shifts responsibility for the regional instability caused
by the invasion and its aftermath from the Americans onto a country already deemed an
‘enemy’ of the U.S. The wider context of the vilification of Iran and strained U.S. –
Iranian relations in recent decades is not an unfamiliar discourse in American media

233

coverage and therefore, blaming Iran for many of Iraq’s problems aides the anti-Iranian
discourse and is perhaps designed to obtain public approval for continued hostile U.S.
policy towards that country. When discussing the Iranian influence, the spectrum of
tolerated opinion, or range of possibilities within the dominant discourse on Iran does not
entertain the possible justification for Iran – a neighboring country, sharing a great deal
of commonality with Iraqis in terms of culture, heritage, religions etc., and with vital
security interests at stake – to be involved (along with other regional powers) to aid a
diplomatic and military efforts to the end the crisis. Thus, illustrating the confined
boundaries of discourse that are aired in this article.
In summary, this NYT article was quite representative of the subtle ways in which
the discourse of American exceptionalism and an ideology of a pro-American leaning can
remain embedded within a text despite the author/s raising several criticisms of the
American legacy in Iraq. In this way, the article can appear to provide a fair and balanced
perspective but ultimately remains deeply ideological and political.

6.5 Textual Analysis: The Washington Post
Sly, Liz and Whitlock, Craig. U.S. war in Iraq draws to a quiet close. WP, Friday,
December 16, 2011, Section A, p. A01. (1094 words).
Layout and Structural Organization
This article was the lead story on the front page and included a large photograph
of U.S. soldiers walking through a sandy base with bags packed. There had been fairly
extensive coverage of the exit from Iraq in the WP in this period (with 22 articles
appearing between December 11-19). The selected article was also the longest and most
prominent one on Iraq featured in the December 16 issue. The sub-headline was “Muted
234

farewell reflects lingering worries about nation’s security, politics,” which conveyed a
sense of uncertainty for Iraq’s future and also a somber rather than a celebratory tone.

Objects
The principle discourse objects are centered on the event of the ceremony itself
which marked the end of the war and American troop withdrawal from Iraq. Firstly, the
ceremony is constructed in the text as an underwhelming and insignificant event but
nevertheless as an event that reveals a great deal about the uneasy relationship between
the U.S. and Iraq; secondly, the text constructs the object of the Iraqi population’s desire
for the Americans to leave. There is limited reflection on the outcomes of the war and it
is neither presented as a success or victory, nor a disastrous mistake based on illegitimate
premises. However, for a center piece article on the conclusion of the war, the focus on
the ceremony itself diverts attention from the wider debate about the consequences of the
American invasion and the American legacy in Iraq.
The “simple ceremony held on the edge of Baghdad’s international airport”
marked an “unspectacular end” to the war. Sly and Whitlock report that there were “[n]o
pronouncements of victory, no cheers or jubilation” and that “[n]o senior Iraqi
government officials showed up for the event” dampening the “American hopes that they
might.” The broader issues this represented were the disagreements between the
Americans and Iraqis about the U.S. government’s desire to extend U.S. troop presence
in Iraq beyond 2011 and the Iraqis’ insistence that U.S. military personnel be subject to
Iraqi law if they stayed beyond 2011. The ceremony is presented as a hollow event, for
example, when reporting the American Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III’s speech about

235

“opportunities” the Americans had created for the Iraqis, he is described as having little
confidence that the Iraqis will take advantage of the ‘opportunities.’ The specter of
looming violence in Iraq, but also at the ceremony itself is conveyed throughout the
report. For example:
The persistent dangers were underscored by the strict security measures
surrounding the U.S. ceremony in Baghdad and the small scale of the
farewell pageantry. Visitors' badges carried numbers identifying which
bunkers they should access in the event of a rocket attack. The date was
kept secret for months to prevent insurgents from targeting the site.
Sly and Whitlock convey the present state of danger in Iraq without trying to glorify
American achievements in the war; there is an evident sense of the fragility of the
situation in Iraq.
A second object that is constructed is that of the Iraqi people’s desire for the
Americans to leave. “On the streets of Baghdad, an overwhelming number of residents
said they were glad the U.S. troops were going home.” Sly and Whitlock report, quoting
one Iraqi who says “I’m happy they’re leaving because they are occupiers.” The report
also acknowledges that there is an awareness amongst Iraqis that violence could erupt
again after the withdrawal but that most Iraqis do not feel the Americans have a
constructive role to play. The primary reason for the exit from Iraq is “because [italics
added] most Iraqis want them to go.” In this regard, the Americans are portrayed as
humbling themselves to the Iraqi will, in high contrast to the manner in which the
invasion of the country was orchestrated by the Bush administration, without any
consultation with the will of the Iraqi people.

236

Actors
The U.S. as a key actor in this article is represented through military leadership
and a single quotation from the Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. There are no
references to President Obama or other senior White House officials. In an article about
the war’s ending, the absence of any historical dimension of the war through mentioning
the cheerleaders for the war in the Bush Administration is also noticeable. The U.S.’s
involvement in Iraq is still portrayed as honorable as it exits Iraq by obliging to the will
of the Iraqi people. The lack of pomp and ceremony underlines American humility and
dignity, contrasted with the deplorable legacy of torture and indiscriminate killings of
Iraqi civilians, the most notorious being the Abu Ghraib scandal and Haditha massacre
respectively. Furthermore, when Iraqi civilian deaths are mentioned, the U.S. role in the
killings through aerial bombardment and military operations on the ground are omitted.
The U.S. is portrayed as a peripheral figure acting only as an advisor and consultant to
the Iraqis; for instance, despite “U.S. commanders [urging] Iraqi leaders to extend
American military presence…so that they could continue to train the Iraqi security
forces” the Iraqis’ refusal to accept these terms is presented as a sign of their freedom and
the Americans’ respect for a nation’s sovereignty.
Although there is not an overtly negative characterization of Iraq and its leaders,
the article gives the impression of Iraqi resentment towards Americans firstly, by the nonshow of its leaders to the ceremony, and secondly by stating how most Iraqis want the
U.S. out. The authors do, however, point out that for many Iraqis “the upheaval of the last
eight years…has transformed their country beyond recognition without…significantly
improving their lives.” However, once again there is an omission of U.S. responsibility in

237

this upheaval and a removal of the context for why there is so much resentment towards
the Americans, for example, the numerous failures to bring to justice U.S. military
personnel for crimes committed against civilian populations in Iraq. One of the effects of
this presentation of Iraqis is to put them in an unfavorable light, at least to American
audiences, as they are shown to be ungrateful or unappreciative of American sacrifices.
The effects of such a discourse are that it may perpetuate negative sentiments about Iraq
and generate a public mood that justifies ‘abandoning’ Iraq.

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
The following sentence captures how different meanings can be constructed
depending on word choices: “the upheaval of the last eight years…has transformed their
country beyond recognition.” The words “upheaval” and “transformed” are euphemisms
for war and destroyed respectively. Their usage negates the negativity attributable to the
U.S’s actions in Iraq. The vocabulary and writing style of the article also mirror the
somber tone established by the “small scale of the farewell pageantry” of the ceremony;
thus, matching the reference to the war in Iraq drawing “to a quiet close” in the headline.
As Carvalho (2008) points out these dimensions of discourse impact the constitution of
meanings (p. 168). Adjectives such as “unspectacular” and “ambivalent conclusion” to
the war, add to the sense of somberness and quiet reflection rather than creating an
impression of victorious celebrations. The authors are also careful to highlight that the
“American war in Iraq” has ended, not that the war in Iraq has ended because of the
ongoing state of violence in Iraq. In this way, the WP’s coverage diverged from Obama’s
positive rhetoric about “a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq.” (Obama, 2011b).

238

Discursive Strategies
As was the case in the NYT article discussed above, this WP article did not revert
to the discourse presented by Obama about the War in Iraq nor did it contain a
congratulatory tone about the achievement of the U.S. in Iraq. Instead, the authors
understate the role of the U.S. in Iraq, presenting the Americans as peacekeepers, there to
provide training to the Iraqis security forces. The article does not dwell on the realities of
life for Iraqis such as the damage to infrastructure, lack of civilian health, educational or
energy facilities, the everyday hardships Iraqis now face, or the burdens of dealing with
the traumas of injuries and deaths of loved ones. No summary or overview of America’s
contribution to the war in Iraq is provided. It is almost as if the war is presented as having
existed before the Americans arrived in 2003, and now that “the American part draws to a
close” the war will go on. For example, the authors write that the departure of the soldiers
could “rekindle latent power struggles,” which suggests that the stability in the region
only exists as a result of the American presence. This normalizes the state of violence in
Iraq as though it preceded the American invasion. Elsewhere, the expression that the U.S.
wanted to stay in Iraq to help “build the country’s almost non-existent conventional
defenses” implies that such conventional defenses have never existed. Such a positive
representation of the U.S. role in Iraq ignores the fact that the security apparatus of Iraq
was deliberately dismantled by the American policy of “De-Ba’athification” following
the invasion in 2003. These discursive strategies function to remove American agency
from many of the problems Iraq faces.
The authors do give voice to the perspective of a majority of Iraqis who want the
Americans to leave, but there is no commentary included by Iraqis about how the

239

American invasion and American involvement has impacted their lives. In other words
what the American legacy in Iraq is, according to Iraqis. One can only speculate on the
reasons for the exclusion of this from an article that is about the war’s conclusion, but if
opinion polls of how Iraqis feel about American involvement in their country are
anything to go by, it is unlikely most of them would have positive words to say. The
absence of such commentary is juxtaposed by the paraphrased words of Gen. Austin who
spoke of opportunities “U.S. troops had created for the Iraqis to live freely and prosper.”
The built-in assumption here being that without American involvement in Iraq, Iraqis
could not be free or prosper.

Ideological Standpoints
As pointed out above, the omission of many of the details of the negative
consequences of the war point to a discursive intervention that is designed to construct a
“reality” of the war that mitigates the U.S.’s contribution to the aforementioned
destruction of Iraq’s civilian infrastructure. The decision to include certain details such as
the number of deaths but remove American agency in those deaths has the effect of
appearing to be neutral or balanced, when in fact, the authors are still coming from a
certain, perhaps patriotic, ideological perspective that compels them to present a positive
image of the U.S. The authors of the article do not parrot the rhetoric of the Obama
administration or try to present the war as a success; yet, they also fail to offer more
balanced commentary on the widely acknowledged negative impact of the war, not only
for Iraq but also on the image of the U.S.

240

Trying to ascertain the dominant ideological perspective through van Dijk’s
schema (2009a), enables us to deduce that ultimately, it is the U.S. perspective that
dominates the article. The authors and quoted sources report on selected American
actions in the war as well as explicating the reasons for those actions. None of these are
challenged by opposition voices, for example, critical Shia or Sunni voices from within
Iraq, or even the opinions of U.S.-based critics of the war. The relations with other
groups are also defined by the American voices, particularly through statements about the
American commitment to Iraq expressed by Panetta who said “the U.S. will stand by the
Iraqi people” and an earlier statement in the article about “promises that the United States
would not abandon Iraq.” The journalists’ ability to dominate the public discourse allows
the U.S. to be characterized as loyal and honorable. In this regard, there is still some level
of congruence between the message of the White House about the success of the U.S.
troops in Iraq and the perspective of the WP encapsulated in this article and elsewhere.

6.6 Textual Analysis: The Wall Street Journal
Barnes, Julian E., Dagher, Sam, and Hodge, N. Exit From Iraq: U.S. Closes Its Mission
on Uncertain Note --- Troops Depart Iraq, Leaving the World's Largest
Diplomatic Presence Behind, as Tensions Rise Between Shiites, Sunnis. WSJ,

No Author. World-Wide: What’s News: The U.S. military formally ended its mission in
Iraq. WSJ, Friday, December 16, 2011, 2011, A, p. 1 (71 words).

Layout and Structural Organization
The front page of the WSJ contained a brief news bulletin announcing the troop
withdrawal and formal end to the war; the bulletin was located at the top of the daily
‘What’s News’ section; also published on the front page was the leading image drawing
241

readers’ attention to the caption which read “End of an Era: U.S. Marks the Conclusion
of the War in Iraq.” Readers were then directed to the article by Barnes, Dagher and
Hodge which appeared on page A6. The front page placement of the Iraq War news
indicated the high priority attached to the story by the WSJ. The brief bulletin was only
71 words and also directed readers to page A6 for the full story about the withdrawal.
The headline to the page A6 article alludes to several key events in the narrative of the
withdrawal; one key element is the reference to the “uncertain note” on which the
Americans are leaving followed up by “as Tensions Rise Between Shiites, Sunnis.” In
other words, the main emphasis of the headline is on the ongoing instability in Iraq,
which is accurate and reflective of the situation in the country at the time.

Objects
In the news bulletin, the principle discourse object of interest is the reference to
“the end of a nearly nine-year conflict.” This, as well as the caption accompanying the
photograph remarking on the “End of an Era” create a sense of conclusion and finality to
the war. This construct of the war’s end is continued in the Barnes, Dagher and Hodge
article, which also makes reference to the mission’s end as well as containing a
cautionary note on the uncertainty of Iraq’s future. The principle discourse objects
established in the context of the ending are: 1) the American sacrifices to free Iraq; and 2)
the uncertainty over the future of Iraq.
The war is presented as a war of liberation, with the Americans sacrificing 4,487
lives and spending “more than $800 billion” in order to free Iraq. The authors paraphrase
the words of Mr. Panetta, writing that “American services members have given Iraqis the

242

opportunity to make their own future. The hardships and losses endured by America’s
military, he said, weren’t in vain because they led to a free Iraq.” Panetta is quoted as
saying to the American troops at the ceremony: “You leave with great pride…secure
knowing that your sacrifice has helped the Iraqi people begin a new chapter in history.”
The authors ignore the sacrifices of the Iraqis and make no mention of the hardships that
they have endured, and will continue to endure for many years to come because of the
invasion. There is one mention of “tens of thousands of Iraqi and American casualties” in
the lead of the article but the figures of deaths are considerably lower than many
estimates of civilian deaths. In addition, the mention of American deaths alongside the
deaths of Iraqi civilians downplays the disproportionate suffering of the civilian
population of Iraq.
The presentation of the uncertain future Iraq faces is also a running theme in this
article. Consider the following excerpts, which establish Iraq both as an object and actor:
But as the last units were departing, tensions flared up among Iraqis, and
unresolved issues -- over regional efforts for greater autonomy, dividing
the country's oil wealth and establishing an impartial judicial system
among them -- were clear.
And:
The dual-dynamic underscored the uncertainty and anxiety about the U.S.
pullout in both nations and pointed to the array of political and security
challenges that now confront Iraq's leaders.
The premise of the first paragraph contains what is known in the pragmatics branch of
linguistics as an implicature; that is, the first part of the sentence refers to the troop

243

withdrawal and the second part to the flaring up of tensions, leaving the reader with the
impression that tensions flared up because of the troop withdrawal, even though that is
not explicitly stated. The effect of this is to add weight to the perception of Iraq needing
the U.S. military to ensure peace; and also adding to the positive self-image of Americans
as peacekeepers rather than invaders. The second paragraph also contributes to the
narrative that the Americans are needed by suggesting that there is anxiety in both Iraq
and the U.S. about the security of Iraq.

Actors
The key social agents developed in the WSJ’s two articles can be divided into two
broad categories, 1) the U.S. as represented by Panetta and military leaders; and 2) the
Iraqis who are constituted by competing factions. Firstly, the social actors that represent
the U.S. are afforded more framing power in determining the topics being discussed in
the article. For example, the authors quote Army Gen. Lloyd Austin (the U.S. commander
in Iraq), Army Gen. Martin Dempsey (the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) and the
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. The quotes from all three converge to amplify
essentially the same message, namely, that the American troops served with moral
courage, and sacrificed for Iraqis to be free. The narrow range of opinions enables the
authors to keep the discourse centered on the principle objects of American sacrifices and
challenges for Iraq.
Broadly speaking, the Iraqi actors in the text express a range of different opinions
about different issues but the general identity of the Iraqis that is constructed in the text is
that they are portrayed as ungrateful by expressing grievances or problems. Firstly, the

244

Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s office is mentioned issuing “a terse” statement about
the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq (although no explicit reference to it is made). This sense of
indifference to the American effort is carried through in the description of Sadr City
where “most shopkeepers were busy watching a soccer match...and paid scant attention to
the U.S. ceremony.” The WSJ also reports that there was no reaction from Moqtada alSadr to the withdrawal but he is quoted as criticizing al-Maliki’s visit to the U.S. for the
“blood spilled on the homeland’s soil because of the occupation and its soldiers”.
Another Iraqi is said to have declined an interview and elsewhere an Iraqi is quoted as
saying “I think the withdrawal is a lie and the Americans are still present, their concrete
walls are still here and so are their towers and communications wires.” There is less
uniformity of opinion in the textual construction of the Iraqis but the authors should be
praised for providing some space for dissenting Iraqi opinion in a piece that is otherwise
bereft of critical commentary on the war’s legacy and the significant responsibility on the
Americans for the destruction that ensued following the invasion and occupation for
nearly nine years.

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
Barnes, Dagher, and Hodge avoid the use of any overt literary tropes to shape the
discourse of the war’s end in a particular way. Instead, it is the overall informational
content of the article that is most revealing of the ideological perspective of the authors.
The difficulty in detecting ideological biases and leanings based on the linguistic features
of this text illustrates that an approach that relies purely on linguistic analysis of lexical
or syntactical aspects is insufficient in extrapolating the workings of ideology.

245

The sense of an end to the American mission is reflected in the following excerpt
from the article: “The job of assisting [Iraq’s leaders] will be left to a U.S. diplomatic
mission that is the biggest in the world and includes thousands of private security
contractors and other support personnel.” In this example, the syntax of the sentence has
been arranged in a way that positions the Iraqi leaders at the beginning, and the U.S.
diplomatic mission afterwards. In other words, the emphasis of the sentence in this
arrangement is on the need of the Iraqi leaders for help from the Americans. Whereas,
constructed differently, the sentence could read: “A U.S. diplomatic mission consisting of
thousands of private security contractors and support personnel will remain to assist
Iraq’s leaders.” The effect of this alternative syntactical arrangement is that it deemphasizes the sense of American departure by activizing American involvement and
therefore runs contrary to the notion of a free and stable Iraq.

Discursive Strategies
As Carvalho’s (2008) model highlights, a discursive intervention need not be
illegitimate but is one that alters the type of reality that the discourse presents. There is
little in the article about the consequences of the war and the American responsibility for
the destruction that ensued in Iraq; instead the authors select American voices that glorify
the American achievement in Iraq as one of selflessness and honor. The omission of
responsibility is a discretionary choice to construct a certain version of reality. The article
does allude to the uncertain future of Iraq with regards to the security situation but it does
not address the reasons for this. Reasons such as the dismantling of the state apparatus of
Iraq and failure to alleviate the poverty that resulted from the war are ignored. Failure to

246

address these points enables the authors to organize the discourse in a way that does not
run contrary to the principle “achievement” and discursive construction of the article,
which are the American sacrifices for Iraqi freedom. Thus, fitting in the positive selfrepresentation that was also reflected strongly in the coverage of USA Today and to a
lesser degree in the NYT and the WP.
The presentation of the Iraqis as fractious, complaining, paranoid, and ungrateful
has the effect of undermining the criticisms of the Americans that do surface in the text.
For example, mentioning Iraqi disbelief in the American military exit highlights the
invalidity of their opinions when the article clearly presents an image of military
departure. There is also an omission of the reasons for why Iraqis feel the way they do.
For instance, by omitting the reasons for their mistrust or anger towards the Americans,
Iraqis are presented as unreasonable; the effect of this strategy is it invalidates or
delegitimizes their voice.

Ideological Standpoints
This article contains noticeable absences of reflection on the negative
consequences of the war, especially for the Iraqi people, which effectively silences
alternative discourses. The article’s pointed focus on the military sacrifices, which freed
the Iraqi people, simplifies the conflict and existing state of affairs in Iraq. This
simplification is perhaps best encapsulated in the resort to the theme of patriotism, which
is familiar and comforting for many in the American audience.
An example of symbolic imagery that adds to the dominant U.S. narrative in the
article of American military sacrifices to create a free Iraq, is evident in describing the

247

official closing ceremony. The authors describe how Gen. Austin “took down the flag
that symbolized the American mission and soldiers prepared it for a journey home” and
inform the reader that “[i]n the coming days, the last of the 4,000 U.S. military personnel
still in Iraq will follow the flag and head home.” Speaking of preparing the flag for a
“journey home” evokes varied imagery from American history, such as the long journey
of the first settlers to America, and although the flag is not entirely personified, the act of
preparing the flag and following it, gives it human-like qualities. The American flag is
perhaps the most potent symbol of patriotism in the U.S. and to many Americans it
symbolizes the freedoms protected by the U.S. constitution, American cultural values and
the nation’s history amongst other things. The scene depicted above renders the
completion of the job of establishing “freedom” in Iraq; now achieved, the loyal troops
“follow their flag,” their leader, homewards. Coating the symbolism of the discourse of
the ending with a glaze of patriotism makes the workings of ideology subtle but potent in
generating images and the values of America.

6.7 Textual Analysis: USA Today
Brook, Tom V. Panetta: Iraq to ‘begin a new chapter in history’; U.S. Defense chief
declares war over during ceremony, USA Today, Friday, December 16, 2011,
NEWS Section, A, p.6A. (537 words).

Layout and Structural Organization
The headline “Panetta: A free Iraq was worth sacrifice” appeared prominently
above the fold of the front page in the December 16 edition and directed readers to the
article selected for analysis, which appeared on page A6. The front page headline
appeared with a small photograph on the left side of the page showing U.S. soldiers
248

lowering the flag at the closing ceremony of the war. Although not the lead story, the
front page location and inclusion of a photograph are indicative of the importance the
USA Today attributed to the issue. The headline on the front page and the page A6
headline both alluded to Iraq’s new found freedom; thus, presenting the war as an overall
success. The article was only 537 words but is not atypical of the USA Today’s coverage.

Objects
The main objects that are constructed regarding the Iraq War are: 1) the ending of
the war; 2) a ‘free, democratic Iraq’; and 3) future U.S. policy. The headline and lead
establish both the official end of the war as well as the proposition of a ‘free, democratic
Iraq;’ thus, bringing about a positive conclusion to the lengthy conflict. The ending of the
conflict is normalized by the lowering of the flag of the U.S. forces “for the last time”
and numerous other references that assert the end to the war in Iraq such as “Panetta
declared the war over” and speaking about the war in the past tense.
Secondly, the war is presented to have been a success due to the establishment of
what Panetta is quoted as saying is an “independent, free and sovereign Iraq.” Brook
refers to the war as having been won, and quotes sources that further the sense of
progress in Iraq, such as the Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) who refers to the “gains” made,
and President Obama, who is quoted as saying Iraq was now able to “handle its security.”
Thirdly, Brook highlights the disagreement over future U.S. policy in Iraq
between those like Sen. McCain who believe the U.S. should have extended its stay in
Iraq, and those like Obama, who argued it was necessary to bring the troops back. This
discourse object is the least developed in the article as the author does not offer any

249

commentary of his own on the direction future U.S. policy on Iraq should take. The effect
of presenting just these two options in policy discounts examining the effects of
preemptive war policy and the lengthy occupation of a country. Brook does not bring into
question U.S. foreign policy, for example, in Afghanistan or for dealing with future wars.

Actors
This article, more so than any of the other articles examined for the 2011 ending,
relied on official sources from the Obama administration as well as military leaders. For
example, the U.S. perspective is represented predominantly by the Defense Secretary
Leon Panetta, who made the main speech in the ceremony in Baghdad, but there are also
quotations from President Obama, two military generals and Senator John McCain,
Obama’s opposite number in the 2008 Presidential race. Other than a brief mention of a
meeting between Obama and Maliki earlier in the week, the article contains no Iraqi
representation or perspectives. The author also tiptoes around the issue of the
disagreement at the time between the Democrats and Republicans about future U.S.
policy in Iraq and keeps the focus primarily on representing the end of the war as a U.S.
victory. The discourse within the text is dominated by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta,
whose quotations are examples of political rhetoric designed to present the war as a
success that is attributable to the sacrifices and professionalism of the U.S. armed
services. Brook’s reliance on official voices results in the reproduction of the White
House (elite) discourse of the war’s conclusion and renders the article largely devoid of
insightful political commentary that illuminates accurately the present state of affairs in
Iraq.

250

Language, Grammar and Rhetoric
Some of the authorial choices representing the war and celebrating its success
have the overall impact of further solidifying the perspective of the government narrative;
as many critical discourse analysts have shown the language that is adopted about an
issue becomes constitutive of the discourse on the issue. The vocabulary in the article at
times reflects the language of victory; for instance, referring to how the U.S. “deposed
Saddam’s regime and beat down an insurgency backed by al-Qaeda terrorists and
sectarian killings that threatened to destroy the country.” This listing of the achievements
of the Americans represents the end of the war as a success using the ‘rule of three’ or
what is sometimes referred to as ‘tripling’ in rhetoric to buttress the presentation of an
argument. This is a well-known technique used in rhetoric and argumentation and
surfaces in the quotation by Army Gen. Austin too, who states the war “tested our
military’s strength and our ability to adapt and evolve” – again the triad of information
aids in cementing the argument that the development of the “new counter insurgency
doctrine that helped win the war and is being used in the Afghanistan War,” thus
implying that it will also help win the war in Afghanistan.
Closely related to this ‘rule of three’ is Panetta’s reference to an “independent,
free and sovereign” Iraq, which is an example of hendiatris – a figure of speech designed
to add emphasis by using three different words to express a single idea. This also has a
mnemonic quality making this professed outcome of the war easier to recall. In this way
discourse is able to become part of our consciousness and political knowledge base.
There are also examples of grammatical choices that delete agency or mask
responsibility for mistakes. For example, following the reference to the war being

251

launched because of the Hussein government’s refusal to allow U.N. inspectors access to
sites (an inaccurate representation that is discussed in detail in the section on discursive
strategies below), the sentence “None were found” concludes the paragraph. The author
does not imply failure in this short sentence, and specifically not a U.S. failure which
based the rationale for the war on the premise of illicit weapons. The removal of an agent
in this sentence takes away American culpability, and perhaps more importantly the
significance and wider consequences of this failure are not discussed further (e.g. the
weakening of the United Nations as an organization that is responsible for helping settle
international disputes).
One of the recurring patterns with regards to syntactical choices is in the
presentation of propositions that are built into the declarative sentences, whether they are
Brook’s own or quoted sources. When the author does state a negative proposition, which
runs counter to the discursive reality being put forth, it is usually followed up with a
positive one that acts to counter balance the earlier statement, thereby having the effect of
reducing the importance attributed to the earlier part. The following excerpts from the
text exemplify this point:
The cost was high – in blood and treasure for the United States and also
for the Iraqi people…But those lives have not been lost in vain. (Panetta)
And:
The war tested “our military’s strength and our ability to adapt and
evolve” but “the development of the new counterinsurgency doctrine
helped win the war.”

252

In these ways, there was always a positive take on the negative aspects of the war, which
fits into the “history as a story of progress” discourse that permeates many American
cultural myths promoting the American dream or other notions of American
exceptionalism.

Discursive Strategies
To begin with, the contextual information provided about the start of the war is
misleading of the circumstances leading up to the conflict. Brook writes that “[t]he
invasion was launched after Saddam Hussein refused to give U.N. inspectors access to
sites suspected of having weapons of mass destruction.” However, this is completely in
contrast to the views of Hans Blix, the U.N.’s chief weapons inspector between 2000 and
2003, who faulted the hastiness of the Bush administration and had stated on numerous
occasions that the Hussein government had begun fully cooperating with inspectors in
2003. The effect of this is to justify the war and shift the blame for the destruction that
followed on to Saddam Hussein rather than on the U.S.-led coalition for invading a
country without the legal approval from the U.N.’s Security Council members. The fact
that the author refers to the U.N. inspectors creates the impression as though the decision
to invade was mandated by the U.N. but as stated, there was overwhelming opposition to
the U.S.-led invasion amongst member states.
What is evident in Brook’s article is a pro-American bias and positive selfrepresentation that is fostering the reality that the Iraq War was a righteous war, in which
the U.S. military sacrificed for the humanitarian reason of liberating Iraqis. There are still
the remnants of the Bush ‘War on Terror’ frame, which was largely abandoned by the

253

NYT, WP, and even WSJ by 2011. For example, Brook’s references to the Americans
defeating “al-Qaeda terrorists” as one of the achievements of the war, excludes the key
point that al-Qaeda terrorists were not present in Iraq at the time of the invasion.
However, the article presents this outcome in order to further legitimate the war.
Furthermore, the other reference to al-Qaeda is from Sen. McCain who warns that it is
“still present” in Iraq; the effect of this is to normalize the presence of al-Qaeda in Iraq as
though they were always there. This type of discursive distortion constructs a reality that
does not have basis in truth or historical events.

Ideological Standpoints
It is surprising to find a headline story on the Iraq War in 2011 so adamantly
defending the invasion and characterizing it as a success when the dominant public and
media perspectives were starting to openly discuss the war’s failures, specifically in the
faulty intelligence that led to the war; the bloody aftermath; and the failed mission to
install a pliant Western-style democratic regime in Iraq. What runs through the coverage
is what Herman and Chomsky (1988, p. 305) refer to as “elemental patriotism,” which
refers to an overwhelming desire on the part of the journalist to think well of ‘our’
institutions and ‘our’ leaders. Brook’s dependence on and utilization of official sources to
report on the ending of the war represent his adherence to a patriotic ideology in which
the U.S. is always just. This is reflected by the exclusively positive presentation of the
U.S. actions in Iraq and the complete omission of any negative actions, even the widely
acknowledged ‘mistakes’ of torture, deliberate civilian killings, and much of the news
media’s slavish support for the war in 2003 are overlooked.

254

6.8 Summary
Following the contextual analysis of the 61 articles addressing the ‘ending’ of the
war in 2011, it was surprising to find that the war as a success discourse remained in
place across the four newspapers. Given the course of the war and its growing
unpopularity amongst the American public, it was surprising that American journalists in
USA Today and WSJ had not severely criticized those who supported the war or the
legacy of the war itself. This was especially surprising for USA Today, which had offered
the most balanced coverage in 2003 of the newspapers selected in this study. The NYT
and WP had become more critical since 2003 and had published some articles that
condemned many of the failures of the war but also highlighted the war’s apparent
successes, therefore keeping the ‘war as success’ discourse alive.
The contextual analysis also revealed that the consequences of the war in 2011
were discussed in the news in a more streamlined fashion. In other words, it was easier to
code categories of consequences as the news discourse in general did not discuss as many
or as diverse consequences as it had in 2003. That there were nearly sixty percent fewer
articles published on the war’s ending in 2011 compared to the period analyzed in 2003
may have been a possible explanation for this, as well as specific consequences of the
war (such as lack of security, the political stalemate, the destruction of Iraq’s
infrastructure, and civilian deaths), which had become the most discussed in the news.
The negative consequences of the war, such as Iraqi suffering through death,
displacement, injury, and destruction of civilian infrastructure, hardly found their way
into the news discourses of the WSJ and USA Today. These and other consequences did

255

surface in the NYT and WP but not always in the context of highlighting the Iraq War as
an injustice or mistake.
Examining the 61 articles also showed that it was extremely rare across all four
newspapers for responsibility for the negative consequences of the war to be assigned
specifically to the U.S. Instead, the NYT and WP, which did offer more balanced and
critical commentary on the legacy of the war, would apportion blame for negative
consequences, such as the political stalemate in Iraq, to both the Americans and Iraqis.
However, what was more revealing was that positive consequences of the war, such as
the apparent improvement in Iraq’s economy, were almost always credited to the U.S.
This was a pattern that was also prevalent in the coverage of the WSJ and USA Today
(see above as well as Appendix B, specifically Tables B.9 to B.12).
The textual analysis of the selected articles complemented the results of the
contextual analysis, as these detailed micro-level examinations demonstrated exactly how
specific discourses on the outcomes, consequences, and responsibility were being
constructed within each newspaper. The results provided valuable insights in that they
showed how patriotism and nationalism influenced news commentary on the legacy of
the Iraq War. There were varying degrees to which different articles in different
newspapers adopted a pro-American perspective, but a commonality that ran through the
selected articles of the NYT, WP, and USA Today was the removal of U.S. responsibility
for many of the negative consequences. The WSJ articles also did this but levelled
numerous criticisms of the Obama administration’s handling of the exit from Iraq, as its
position had been to support a continued presence in Iraq.

256

As the principle actors also changed over the course of the war, an examination of
the representation of different actors in the textual analysis also highlighted the
emergence of Iran and a discourse surrounding Iran’s negative meddling in Iraq. This
discourse surfaced predominantly in the WSJ but also found its way into the coverage of
the WP and NYT. There was a consistent characterization of Iran as having a negative
influence and undermining the U.S. efforts in Iraq through its alleged support of Shiite
militias as well as forming close ties with some in the Maliki government. The findings
of the textual analysis also mirrored some of the findings of the contextual analysis: for
instance, the omission of U.S. responsibility for the negative consequences in the news
coverage and, instead, the attribution of blame on others such as the Maliki government,
Iran, or Iraq’s diversity (characterized as sectarian differences) for the country’s ongoing
problems. One of the effects of this collective discourse was a construction of reality that
downplayed problems with American foreign policy in Iraq and around the world
generally. In addition, the news discourse also marginalized the reality of the resentment
many in the Middle East region felt towards the U.S. for its role Iraq. In doing so, the
news discourse was able to present a positive and pro-American perspective to the
American public that reinforced existing positive myths of American exceptionalism and
the notion of the United States as a force of good around the world.

257

CHAPTER 7
HISTORICAL-DIACHRONIC ANALYSIS
7.1 Outline
The historical-diachronic analysis is a vital component to the CDA approach
adopted in this study as it seeks to address the diachronic dimension of the news
discourse as it evolved from 2003 to 2011. Examining this aspect of the Iraq War is
necessary to ascertain how dominant or embedded certain discourses and representations
become in the news. Carvalho’s (2008) method has been adapted in a way that enables a
focus on the representations of reality of the war’s ending that news discourse
engendered. This chapter is therefore organized in a way to facilitate comparison between
coverage of different news media from the two periods, with sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4
addressing outcomes, consequences and responsibility respectively. The historicaldiachronic analysis is based on both the findings from the contextual analysis as well as
the textual analysis presented in Chapters Five and Six. Furthermore, it draws on some of
the existing historiography and other secondary sources on the Iraq War that were
summarized in the literature review presented in Chapter Two. Finally, Section 7.5 sets
out to provide a summary of the key points from the historical-diachronic analysis.

7.2 Outcomes
As outlined earlier in Chapter One, the discourses that surfaced regarding the
outcomes of the war were determined in relation to the war aims set out by the Bush
258

administration, which were to find banned WMD; uncover evidence linking Iraq and alQaeda; to overthrow the Hussein government; initiate a policy of De-Ba’athification of
society; and install a democratic government that would improve the lives of Iraqis as
well as maintain strong ties to the U.S. Therefore, it was not surprising that a great deal of
the newspapers’ coverage addressed similar outcomes of the war in 2003 and in 2011.
In 2003, all four newspapers overwhelmingly characterized the war as a success
by focusing the discourse of the war’s ending on the military victory in Iraq, the toppling
of the Hussein government, and the progress being made towards the other war aims such
as quelling the remaining loyalists of the Hussein government, and working towards the
improvement in the lives of ordinary Iraqis. The overall sequencing of events in this way
presented the mission as clearly defined, as though progress was being made as planned.
Discourses that countered this narrative of success did not emerge strongly in
2003 in the NYT and WSJ, but did so in the coverage of USA Today (and less so in the
WP), which more frequently drew attention to the ongoing challenges and consequences
of the war. At the time of the American withdrawal of troops marking the official ending
of the war in 2011, the “war as a success” discourse remained in-tact and retained similar
constitutive elements as the 2003 news discourse on the ending of the war. These
elements included the removal of Hussein’s government and discussions about ‘progress’
with regards to the setting up of a democratic government and plans for helping Iraq get
back on its feet. Whereas in 2003, USA Today had offered numerous counter narratives to
the “war as a success” discourse, in 2011, this was not the case as the discourse of
success was by far the most hegemonic in its coverage. It was not because USA Today
included a lot of different elements to convey the notion of success in Iraq, but rather due

259

to the lack of emphasis on the war’s failings. USA Today did not draw readers’ attention
to the problems that Iraq faced to the same degree that it had done so in 2003.
Furthermore, the coverage emphasized the upbeat sections of President Obama’s
speeches on Iraq that conveyed the U.S. having met its principle goals. For example:
President Obama hailed Iraq on Monday as a nation that will be seen as a
beacon of democracy in the Middle East and vowed an enduring
partnership with the nation as the last U.S. troops are set to leave Iraq this
month. "Our goal is simply to make sure that Iraq succeeds," Obama said
at a joint news conference with Iraq's Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki,
about the two countries' future relationship. "We think a successful and
democratic Iraq could be a model for the entire region." (Madhani &
Jackson, 2011, p. A2)
The tone of the excerpt is positive, forward looking, and stressing the unselfishness of the
U.S. in wanting to see a successful Iraq. This was characteristic of much of USA Today’s
discourse on the ending of the Iraq War. This positive tone was amplified because of the
relative absence of counter-discourses that highlighted the problems Iraq still faced. This
representation of reality ignored the force of anti-American feeling as well as fueling of
sectarian violence between mostly Shiite militias that opposed the American presence
and Sunni militias (some of which later became affiliates of al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia,
and some eventually ISIS), some of whose members had been first brutalized by the
American occupation (through arrests, detentions, torture and abuse, and then later by the
Iraqi security forces of a predominantly Shiite make up).

260

It is only possible to speculate on the reasons for why there was such a dramatic
change in the coverage of USA Today when comparing 2003 to 2011. The newspaper’s
coverage had seemed to become more patriotic and nationalistic, and was also more
positive about the outcomes of the war. One possible explanation could be the political
allegiance of the editors of the newspaper. For instance, in 2003, USA Today provided a
fair amount of criticism of the Bush administration’s decision to go to war which could
have been motivated by a liberal or pro-Democratic bias. By 2011, a Democrat president
was in office, and therefore the newspaper was more likely to follow President Obama’s
lead and offer less criticism of his policies. Another explanation could be that adopting a
stance that is deemed too critical of U.S. policy would not be welcomed by a generally
patriotic public that often views the American role in world affairs as positive. Therefore,
adopting such an anti-American position could potentially have jeopardized its sales as
well as long term standing in the news media marketplace.
Compared to 2003, the collective coverage of the NYT and WP in 2011 included
more direct criticism of the decision to invade Iraq as well as more commentary on the
challenges that lay ahead for Iraq. Therefore, both papers did not allow the “war as a
success” discourse to entirely dominate their coverage. At first glance, the findings seem
to correspond closely with those of King (2014) who examined the NYT and WP
coverage up until the announcement of the end of the combat mission by Obama in
August 2010. King found that the NYT and WP both diverged from the President’s
framing narrative, and cast the war in a negative light. She says of the coverage:
[e]ven as Obama attempted to achieve closure with a unifying and
uplifting narrative of success, the media refused to follow his framing

261

lead, first constructing a far less positive tale of war’s end and then
virtually banishing the subject from their reportage. (King, 2014, p. 187)
It was true for the coverage in 2011 that the NYT and WP did forge their own frames as
well as offer more balanced coverage than was the case in 2003; however, both
newspapers did not completely abandon the “war as a success” discourse either.
Importantly, in the articles selected for this study, there was very little introspection and
reflection from the NYT or WP on their own roles in supporting and endorsing the
invasion in the first place. Although some journalists in both newspapers had issued
apologies for supporting the war or had changed positions by now viewing the war as a
mistake, there was no news coverage about the media role itself.
From a CDA perspective, this may suggest that the overtly celebratory newspaper
representations of the war in 2003 impacted the adumbrated versions of “success” that
appeared in 2011 for the NYT and WP. This is an example of how discursive
representations of realities can impact later representations. The more balanced coverage
of 2011 may have been a result of the heavy criticism the U.S. media received
(particularly the NYT) for its failure in questioning or scrutinizing the Bush
administration’s policies after 9/11. It was also evident that President Obama was careful
to avoid the same type of victorious rhetoric that followed President Bush’s declaration
of victory on May 1, 2003, frequently remembered as the “Mission Accomplished”
speech. Once again illustrating how discourse can not only alter future discursive
constructions but also have material effects, encapsulated by Obama’s relatively low-key
exit from Iraq that emphasized the return of American troops and prioritized the domestic
agenda rather than dwelling on the triumphs of the war.

262

The WSJ’s 2011 coverage of the outcomes differed from 2003, in the sense of
alarm and opposition the newspaper expressed towards President Obama’s adherence to
the timetable of withdrawal. Whilst still hailing the achievements of the U.S. forces in
Iraq, an editorial titled “Iraq after America,” stated:
Iraq may be the country most Americans would prefer to forget…Yet U.S.
interests in consolidating an alliance with Iraq have never been greater.
With that alliance, the U.S. may find a pillar for its position in the Middle
East, especially if Egypt abandons that role. Without the alliance, Iraq is
likelier to fall prey to Tehran's encroachments, or collapse into sectarian
violence, or again become a haven for a re-constituted al Qaeda. (Iraq after
America, 2011, p. A22)
In the assessment of the WSJ, Iraq had been liberated, but it was vulnerable to the alleged
threats from Iran or al-Qaeda. This excerpt is also typical of the characterization of U.S.
troops as a force of good ensuring the security of the country in a peacekeeping capacity
rather than as occupiers.
One of the key differences therefore between the characterization of the outcomes
of the war in 2003 and 2011 was the stronger presence of alternative discourses in 2011
that highlighted the war’s failings. This was predominantly the case for the NYT and WP
unlike the WSJ and USA Today, which hardly contested the “war as a success” discourse
or drew attention to the problems or questioned the war’s justification. For example, the
WSJ’s coverage rarely brought up the faulty rationale for war, and as pointed out above,
when concerns about Iraq’s precarious security were raised these were done so in the

263

context of extending U.S. presence in Iraq, not in the context of it being the legacy of the
war or the consequence of failed U.S. policy in Iraq.
In December 2011, the NYT coverage contained plenty of scathing criticism about
the war, referring to the war as “misguided” and success as “a long shot” and blaming the
Bush administration for starting the war on “manipulated intelligence.” It was not
difficult to find criticisms of the Bush administration for the war but even within the
criticism, the fundamental discourse of a War on Terror, or the U.S. policy of unilateral
military action as a response to 9/11 was rarely, if ever, brought into question. The
discourse within the NYT (or any of the other newspapers) did not contest the illegality of
the war and illegitimacy of the U.S.’s aims to invade a sovereign state based on a premise
that was highly dubious even at the time of the invasion. The WP also highlighted many
of the failings and problems facing Iraq which contradicted President Obama’s message
of a “stable and self-reliant” Iraq as the troops prepared to exit. Throughout, the news
coverage the ongoing security problems of Iraq were a prominent feature. Such
information countered the notion of a “success” but did not necessarily attribute blame to
the U.S. or bring U.S. foreign policy into question.
Across all four newspapers in 2003, the removal of Hussein from power was
celebrated as a key event in the beginnings of liberty and democracy for the Iraqi people.
However, in 2011, especially in the WP and the NYT, criticisms of Maliki’s government
were growing. The WP reported “Maliki has pursued a sectarian agenda focused on
consolidating power and monopolizing control of the state and security forces under his
Dawa Party.” (Kagen & Kagen, 2011, p. A21). This type of criticism of Maliki was
frequent in the WP and NYT; but the USA Today and WSJ focused less on these areas, as

264

these ran counter to claims of a successful U.S. mission and a liberated and democratic
Iraq.
The discourse of “uncertainty” facing Iraq was present throughout the coverage in
2003 and 2011. In 2003, it was USA Today that mostly emphasized the challenges that
Iraq faced. Six day’s following Bush’s “end of major combat” announcement, USA
Today reported in a front page story:
Having easily won the war for Iraq, the United States has yet to win the
peace. Iraqis say they view the U.S. military occupation with suspicion,
anger and frustration. Many even say life was in some ways better under
the regime of Saddam Hussein: The streets, they say, were safer, jobs
more secure, food more plentiful and electricity and water supplies
reliable….[Ret. Lieutenant] Garner's administration hasn't made much of
an impact yet. A new Iraqi government seems a distant dream. As a result,
many Iraqis feel they are adrift, their destination uncertain and their future
bleak. (Wiseman & Walt, 2003, p. A1).
In this excerpt, the discursive construction of uncertainty raised question marks over the
actual benefits of the invasion for the Iraqi people, and brought attention to the ongoing
hardships faced by Iraqis due to the abrupt destruction of the government and police
apparatus. By 2011, USA Today’s coverage still raised the issue of Iraq’s uncertain future
but contestation of the discourse of “success” had become less pointed. For example,
another front page story described the post-U.S. troop withdrawal situation as follows:
It would be a typical community meeting in much of the world, but in
Anbar Province, which was among the deadliest regions during the Iraq

265

War, the meeting is a remarkable turnaround. Five years ago Anbar's
provincial capital of Ramadi was a war zone as U.S. Marines fought
through rubble-strewn neighborhoods against a dug-in insurgency. Large
sections were under the thumb of al-Qaeda, the terrorist group that had
declared Ramadi its Iraqi capital. But the crushing of the insurgency here
and in most other parts of Iraq following more than eight years of war has
improved security and given rise to a rudimentary democracy and
improving standard of living for many Iraqis.
What worries most Iraqis now is whether this transformation will
survive the departure of the Americans. The gains that cost more than
4,000 American lives can be reversed in a country where old sectarian
grudges simmer, Iran is aiding radical militias, al-Qaeda is still mounting
attacks and the U.S. troops that helped keep a lid on it all will have left.
(Michaels, 2011, p. 1A).
The war is described using the past tense, hence, signaling its end. Use of the words
“transformation” and “turnaround” to describe the situation in Iraq convey a sense of
great achievement and progress. Referencing the “crushing of the insurgency here and in
most other parts of Iraq” by American Marines convey victory and American supremacy.
Noticeably the Iraqis are left out of this narrative of success and it is only the “more than
4,000 American lives” that are mentioned in the sacrifice to achieve this success. The
cost of the lives of Iraq’s security personnel, the lives of non-US coalition forces, the
lives of the fighters of the Sunni Awakening militias who helped the Americans during
the months of the troop surge, or the sacrifice of the Iraqi people are all omitted from this

266

discursive construction of American success. When uncertainty is mentioned, it is in the
context of other groups that are to blame and it is not because of the invasion or the war
itself that such uncertainty exists. The above excerpts represent the way in which USA
Today’s coverage grew more patriotic and supportive of the war by 2011 than it had been
in 2003.
Another indicator of how the endgame discourse changed was the newspapers’
discourse on the reconstruction of Iraq. In 2003, there had been more emphasis in the
coverage of the WSJ, NYT and WP about the ways that the U.S. was going to be helping
restore services, build industry partnerships, and modernize the oil sector to increase
output. By 2011, as the American withdrawal drew closer, there was less optimism in this
outcome in the coverage of the NYT, WP and also the WSJ. Responsibility for this was
increasingly portrayed as a problem for Iraqis not one facing the Americans. It was clear
that Iraq’s infrastructure had not recovered to pre-invasion levels, with sewage and
electricity facilities still woefully inadequate in many parts of the country, and oil output
still well-below the levels necessary to help kick start Iraq’s economic recovery. What
had also become clear was that the U.S. was not able to resolve the ongoing security
problems due to what were simultaneously a civil war as well as a war against a foreignoccupation. However, the newspapers did not dwell on the lack of recovery of the
country’s infrastructure as a failure of the American occupation but as a circumstance of
the war, so it did not form a central part of the coverage of the NYT or the WP. USA
Today continued the recovery and reconstruction discourse as it fit within the positive
self-presentation that characterized the overarching discourse of the war as a success.

267

In summary, the discursive construction of the outcomes by all four newspapers
legitimated the war in 2003 by crediting the Americans with apparent improvements and
progress in Iraq, such as the removal of Hussein from power and initiating economic
changes that were designed to help lift the standards of living in the country. In 2011, the
coverage of the WSJ continued to represent the outcomes of the war as a success but also
offered numerous direct criticisms of the Obama administration’s decision to withdraw.
USA Today in 2003 had balanced the war as a success discourse by emphasizing the
challenges and uncertainties of the outcomes as well. But, by 2011, its coverage had
become more supportive and pro-American regarding the outcomes of the war. However,
by 2011, the NYT and WP discourse had changed as it became increasingly clear that the
outcomes of the war were not entirely successful. The discourse that emerged as a result
of the failed outcomes sheds light on the shifting of responsibility and how the discourse
on responsibility changed; in short, a great deal more of the blame and responsibility was
directed on to the Iraqi government by suggesting that Iraq’s future was now in the hands
of its own leaders. For example, the WP reported that:
[I]t will be Maliki… who will ultimately determine whether any of the
goals of the war will be achieved. The U.S. presence in Iraq is ending on a
note of uncertainty, with most of the fundamental issues thrown up by the
2003 invasion still unresolved and new sources of friction, such as the
unrest in neighboring Syria, surfacing to create fresh tensions.” (Sly, 2011,
p. A11)
Such perspectives of Maliki’s government presented the outcomes of the war as the
responsibility of the Iraqi government in 2011, which in turn reinforced President

268

Obama’s message that Iraq was now a “sovereign, stable and self-sufficient,” country
(2011b). Once presented in these terms, it was easier to shift the blame for ongoing
problems faced by Iraq on to Maliki’s government and away from the U.S. decision to
invade the country in the first place.

7.3 Consequences
The focus of this section is on how the discursive construction of the
consequences of the war changed between 2003 and 2011; and how these different
representations privileged different meanings of the ending of the conflict. In the case of
discourses, the description and argumentation strategy employed to present a certain
consequence of the war reveals a great deal about the type of interpretation being
presented. Many of the same consequences of the war that appeared in news discourse in
2003 also remained in place in 2011. For example, consequences such as the worsening
security situation, the political problems, the growing anti-Americanism, and the number
of civilian deaths remained part of the discourse for all four newspapers but to varying
degrees. However, in 2011 consequences such as the growing threat from Iran and
consistent references to U.S. military deaths also became part of the discourse of the
war’s end. It was also evident that the context in which the consequences were being
presented, such as the apportioning of responsibility (or removing it) changed.
As Chapter Five showed, much of the discourse in 2003 on the war’s ending in
the NYT and WSJ (and to a slightly lesser degree in the WP) was positive, highlighting
the successes of the war and largely excluding from news reports the burden of suffering
that the Iraqis faced. Part of the reason for this was that all three newspapers were

269

strongly in favor of the war and followed President Bush’s lead in viewing Iraq as part of
the War on Terror. The invasion had only taken place about six weeks before and the
insurgency was still in its infancy. However, in 2011, the consequences of the war
became a more prominent part of the discourse on the war’s ending for the NYT and WP;
and the coverage of these two newspapers became more critical about the U.S.’s role in
Iraq and the failures of the war in general. It was difficult for news outlets to ignore the
ongoing security problems, or the inability of the American occupation and later Iraqi
government to defeat the powerful militias that emerged because daily stories of
bombings, kidnappings, and mass killings continued to be reported. By 2003, USA
Today’s discourse on the ending constructed quite a different picture of the reality in Iraq,
principally through omitting much of the negative news from Iraq, as this news would not
concur with the narrative of a successful and worthwhile campaign that USA Today had
carried through much of its coverage in 2011. The WSJ reported the consequence of the
precarious situation only in the context of buttressing its argument in favor of a continued
American troop presence in Iraq; thereby, constructing the U.S. as peacekeepers rather
than occupiers.
In 2003, USA Today was the most likely to report on the anti-American
sentiments of the Iraqi population that were growing as a result of the failure of the
occupying powers to restore services or a functioning civilian infrastructure. Such
coverage was almost absent in the NYT and WSJ. However, by 2011, USA Today barely
featured any coverage that addressed the growth in anti-Americanism in Iraq as well as
the wider region. This was congruent with the rest of its coverage which depicted the
Americans as liberators and having made a positive impact and contribution on Iraq. The

270

NYT carried quite a different tone; for instance, highlighting the damage to the image of
the U.S. following the Abu Ghraib abuse and torture scandal, as well as quoting Iraqis
who expressed anti-American feelings:
[In Falluja]…[t]hey came on Wednesday to bury the war: clerics and
sheiks, children and widows from across this scarred city. In the shadow
of an overpass, they waved banners, burned an American flag, displayed
photos of their dead and shouted well-worn denunciations of departing
American forces. (Healy, 2011, p. A16)
And:
BAGHDAD -- Almost nine years after the first American tanks began
massing on the Iraq border, the Pentagon declared an official end to its
mission here, closing a troubled conflict that helped reshape American
politics and left a bitter legacy of anti-American sentiment across the
Muslim world. (Shanker, Schmidt, & Worth, 2011, p. A19)
And:
“I just heard from you that they've withdrawn,”' Mustafa Younis, an auto
mechanic in Mosul, said to a reporter. “We've been waiting for this day
since 2003. When they invaded us, we carried our machine guns and went
out to fight them. We decided to do suicide operations against them. They
committed many crimes, and we lost a lot of things because of them.”
(Arango & Schmidt, 2011, p. 6)
One of the most striking differences of the NYT reporting in 2011 when reporting antiAmericanism in Iraq was the presence of the voice of Iraqis that expressed outrage at the

271

Americans, often quotes that conveyed the sense of injustice and anger felt towards the
Americans. The above passages were not isolated examples but featured when
discussions of the American legacy in Iraq surfaced. The WP also contained coverage
that conveyed this sense of anti-Americanism which tainted the American legacy in Iraq
but did not give as much prominence to Iraqi voices as the NYT did. The WSJ constructed
a very different picture of Iraqi sentiments, often presenting arguments that suggested the
Iraqis were desperate for the Americans to stay to ensure their security and using this as
an indication of Obama’s flawed exit strategy.
The discourse on anti-Americanism as a consequence of the war did not
necessarily suggest that the NYT or WP provided rationalizing explanations for why the
Iraqis held such feelings. The fact that the discourse on Iraqi civilian deaths, which was
probably the single biggest factor for the anti-American feelings amongst the Iraqi
population, was not as salient in 2011 in the coverage of the NYT or WP illustrates how
the sequencing of events in the reports can impact meaning. In 2011, the majority of the
discourses on the legacy of the American invasion and occupation did not always preface
the anti-Americanism within the context of the enormous amount of civilian deaths and
civilian suffering brought upon by the invasion and occupation. Furthermore, even when
civilian deaths were mentioned in 2003 and 2011, there was a removal of agency
explaining how the deaths occurred. While it is difficult to ascertain how many civilians
died at the hands of American airstrikes, at security checkpoints, or being caught in the
crossfire of battles with insurgents, the omission of American responsibility naturalized
the deaths as an inevitable consequence of the sectarian conflict rather than as a result of
American actions.

272

The newspaper coverage of 2011 also differed from 2003 in the lack of visibility
devoted to the issue of the destruction of Iraq’s civilian infrastructure. In 2003, the issue
of civilian infrastructure destruction was fairly salient in the coverage of the NYT, WP
and WSJ, but the responsibility for the problems with Iraq’s infrastructure were
frequently blamed on the previous regime as highlighted in Chapter Five. Furthermore,
these newspapers’ aided the construction of the identity of the Americans as do-gooders
occupying Iraq in order to help re-build it. By 2011, these newspapers did not emphasize
the destruction of Iraq as a consequence of the American invasion and occupation. Baker
and Adriaensens (2012) demonstrated the destruction to Iraq’s educational institutions;
Al Azawi (2016) reported on the tremendous environmental harm caused by intensive
bombing; and there were already numerous reports in the media about the damage to
Iraq’s cultural heritage sites. However, none of these issues about destruction were
addressed by any of the four newspapers when examining the legacy of the War in Iraq in
2011. There were frequent references to the lack of electricity but rarely references to the
fact that civilians had had electricity before the invasion, and that the failure to restore
services was a consequence of the invasion and responsibility of the invading and
occupying powers. Such items did not preface the discussions of anti-American
sentiments highlighted above; the effect of this was to present the Iraqis as irrational for
hating the Americans without sound reasoning. Furthermore, the American audiences
were left with an incomplete picture of the negative impact of the U.S. forces on Iraq, and
a misrepresentation of the harm caused by launching devastating bombing campaigns
which were frequently referred to as “airstrikes” suggesting precision and targeted
bombing.

273

In 2003, the discourse in USA Today, WP and to a lesser degree NYT had touched
on several problems caused by the invasion and removal of the Hussein government such
as unemployment and food shortages. These issues were not raised as part of the
American legacy in Iraq. The reduction in visibility of such problems portrayed a version
of reality to American audiences that did not convey the full extent of suffering inflicted
upon the Iraqi people as a result of the invasion. There are numerous speculative
interpretations of the impact these representation of war have, for example by occluding
the reality of war American audiences are more likely to continue to support military
operations in the future. Hence, reminding us of Baudrillard’s observation that
“information is directly destructive of meaning and signification, or that it neutralizes
them.” (1981/1994, p. 79). In this case, a loss of the true meaning of war (human
suffering) as a result of the information or absence of information presented through the
mass media.
Another widely acknowledged consequence of the war in both 2003 and 2011 was
the political quagmire that emerged from the vacuum left by removing Hussein from
power but also resulting from the policy of de-Ba’athification, which was initiated by the
U.S. to prevent former members of the ruling Ba’ath Party from holding important
positions in government or in the energy sector. The political situation in 2003 was
entirely different and not really comparable to the situation in 2011 as the Coalition
Provisional Authority was responsible for the country and no Iraqi government had yet
been formed. By 2011, there had been several attempts at forming a representative
government, holding elections, and reaching consensus on legislation. However, the news
discourse about Iraqi politics was dominated across the four newspapers by highlighting

274

the mistrust between Shiites and Sunnis and the ongoing sectarian killings. This was
presented in much of the Western media, included the four newspapers analyzed here as
indicative of the inability of the Iraqis to reach compromises to settle differences. This
was especially the case in the coverage of the WP and NYT in 2011, where the discourse
focused on the political instability and the impact this would have on other areas such as
security, the economy and rebuilding Iraq. The discourse of political instability, although
acknowledged in USA Today and the WSJ, did not detract from their overall positive
representation of U.S. policy in Iraq as successful.
As the circumstances changed in 2011 with the emergence of different actors,
including a different U.S. administration, the Maliki government, Iran, and populist
movements such as that of Moqtada al-Sadr as well as well-supported Sunni militias, it
was no surprise that elements of the news discourse also changed. In 2011, one of the
most highlighted negative consequences of the war was the growing influence of Iran in
Iraq. The discursive effects of introducing Iran as an external ‘threat’ to U.S. interests in
Iraq are discussed in section 7.4 below. Most of the continuity in this discourse was
visible in the attribution of responsibility for the problems Iraq faced which more often
than not deflected blame away from the U.S. (see section 7.4 below). From examining the
discursive constructions of the consequences in the overall coverage across all four
newspapers, what emerges is a pattern of information selection and control where the
composition of descriptions and arguments presented, privilege a discourse that
downplays the negative effects of the U.S. invasion on the lives of Iraqis. Such a
discourse is not necessarily a result of the discursive intervention of any specific editor,

275

author or news outlet but rather the product of a much larger culture that is deeply
patriotic and reverent towards the core doctrine of American exceptionalism.

7.4 Responsibility
It is the purpose of this section to demonstrate the ways in which the attribution of
responsibility for the consequences of the war changed between 2003 and 2011. This
analysis is not based on a comparison of quantitative data of the number of times
responsibility was assigned to a particular actor in 2003 and 2011, but on the
accumulative designation of responsibility. Beyond the changing of important ‘actors’ in
the Iraq War that came with a change of U.S. government administration, the analysis
here is concerned with understanding how the evolving representations of the war
impacted the meaning of the war’s ending. In other words, it was not merely in
documenting how responsibility was attributed differently in the news articles, but how
assigning responsibility contributed to the overall meaning. Or in some cases, the nonattribution of responsibility was just as important, as it was not always that newspapers
assigned responsibility for a consequence of the war which had the effect of masking
agency by removing association between an actor and an outcome. The attribution of
responsibility and blame are telling signs of beliefs, values and political positions on
matters and therefore can be revealing of underlying ideological perspectives.
The newspaper coverage for 2003 and 2011 was remarkable for the absence of
designating responsibility to the U.S. for launching the invasion and conducting a
bombing campaign which led to the destruction of so much of Iraq’s society. Across all
four newspapers, the destruction of Iraq’s civilian infrastructure or cultural heritage was

276

rarely portrayed as a consequence of American actions in Iraq. As was highlighted in
Chapter Five, most of the responsibility for the destruction was placed on Hussein’s
regime or looters or other criminal elements. In 2011, it was not sustainable to suggest
that Saddam’s forces were still in place, fighting the Americans and trying to undermine
the American operation in Iraq, so the agency for destruction was shifted by utilizing
nominalizations such as “the battle against the insurgency” or the “near civil war,” as the
causes of the destruction. For instance, in 2011 USA Today reported:
But Saddam's end only opened the door to more years of conflict as Iraq
was plunged into a vicious sectarian war between its Shiite and Sunni
Arab communities. The near civil war devastated the country, and its
legacy includes thousands of widows and orphans, a people deeply
divided along sectarian lines and infrastructure that remains largely in
ruins. (The Associated Press, 2011, p. A6)
In the excerpt above, while some of the consequences of the war are vividly described,
U.S. involvement in describing the process of how “Iraq was plunged into vicious
sectarian war” is entirely absent, and so is any sense of American responsibility for why
Iraq’s infrastructure is described to be “in ruins.” Instead, the agency is attributed to the
processes of “Saddam’s end,” and “near civil war” which in essence functions like a
nominalization. As highlighted in Chapters Five and Six such a presentation of reality
was a regular feature of the coverage. Removing agency and causality in the way
described above had an impact on the version of ‘self,’ that is the U.S. identity that the
text projected. In essence, it was a version that projected a positive self-image by
removing negative information about the U.S.

277

The removal of American responsibility was also aided in 2011 by emphasizing
the shifting role of Americans as helping to rebuild Iraq. In, 2011 for example, it was
reported in the NYT that even after the withdrawal, “a few hundred military personnel and
Pentagon civilians will remain, working within the American Embassy as part of an
Office of Security Cooperation to assist in arms sales and training to the Iraqis.”
(Shanker, Schmidt, & Worth, 2011, p. A19). In the discourse, the role of the Americans
was changed from an invading force to one that was responsible for nation building and
ensuring the peace by improving security.
Another critical aspect of the war that caused a great deal of controversy was the
civilian death toll. Of all the newspapers the WP was the most consistent from 2003 and
2011 in mentioning U.S. culpability when the issue of civilian deaths was raised in a
report. The coverage of the NYT, USA Today, and WSJ in 2003 and 2011 were
remarkable for consistently avoiding the designation of blame or highlighting causality
for how civilians died. On the surface, a possible explanation is because civilian deaths
have always been understood to be an unfortunate byproduct of any war. However, such
omission of responsibility is not consistently the case when it comes to the U.S. media’s
reporting of wars in general. For example, in recent cases such as the Syrian Civil War
(2012- present) the American media were quick to report on the alleged atrocities
committed by Assad’s forces against civilians, but less inclined to report the allegations
about those committed by insurgents or “rebels” against Assad’s supporters. This process
of vilification of the perceived enemy is quite typical of politicized media discourse and
is an example of the type of ‘binarism’ that differentiates ‘us’ from the enemy (Lazar &

278

Lazar, 2004). It also illustrates how the deletion of agency creates a ‘silence’ which is an
effective discursive strategy that curtails the parameters of debate.
Whilst the above examples focus on removing U.S. association with the negative
outcomes of the war; another important discursive strategy that reflects the workings of
an ‘ideological square’ (van Dijk, 1998) are the process of positive self-representation. In
this regard, the newspapers did follow the lead of President Obama in his praise for
American troops for bringing democracy and stability to Iraq. In both 2003 and 2011, an
overwhelming majority of the coverage across all four newspapers, when addressing the
positive outcomes of the war, credited the U.S. with responsibility for these rather than
the Iraqis. In 2003, the Americans received much of this praise for the removal of
Hussein’s government and enabling the prospects of democracy, as well as for assisting
Iraq’s recovery and reconstruction. In 2011, it was essentially the same message of
removing Hussein from power and liberating Iraqis that Americans were credited with.
This narrative does not take into account the opinions of Iraqis who lost family members
and livelihoods, and now lived in a situation where the risk of dying a violent death was
far higher than under the Hussein government.
The way in which the discourse of the exit in 2011 was constructed also
effectively shifted responsibility for the future of Iraq on to Iraqis. There were numerous
reports in 2011 that conveyed this message, following the lead of White House who in
official statements since 2010 had stressed that the U.S. had fulfilled its obligations to
Iraq (King, 2014, p. 128). For example, USA Today reported: “U.S. officials say,
America has set the conditions for success. Now it is up to the Iraqis.” (Michaels, 2011,
p. A1). And going on to quote Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the top U.S. military

279

spokesperson, who stated “My greatest hope is they take advantage of all the
opportunities they have.” (Michaels, 2011, p. A1). The NYT reported “After so much pain
and sacrifice, Iraqis now have the responsibility for making their own better future” but
acknowledged that the U.S. still “has a major role to play: encouraging, supporting and
goading Iraq's leaders to make the long-delayed political compromises that are their only
hope for building a stable democracy.” (A formal end, 2011, p. A42 ). The same message
in the WP was reiterated by Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who spoke of the “enormous opportunity” the Americans had given the Iraqis. (Jaffe,
2011, p. A19). One of the aims of CDA in textual discourse is that it seeks to highlight
what parts of media discourse are emphasized more than others; in much of the coverage
in 2011, it was increasingly stressed that the Iraqis were now responsible for their own
destiny. Such a discourse gave the impression of Iraqi sovereignty, democracy and the
leaders having actual choices; but, it overlooked the reality of the dysfunctional state that
the Americans were not only leaving behind but responsible for creating. This discourse
on Iraq’s new found sovereignty and responsibility for its destiny echoed the fundamental
values of the American dream, that if one works hard and makes the right choices, one
would be able to achieve the full potential of the possibilities available. By placing Iraqis
in such a position after the trauma of a war that was ongoing, this ignored the reality of
the daily challenges faced by Iraq and its leaders. In some ways, such an argument would
be equivalent to characterizing recently-freed slaves during the American Reconstruction
Era as having all of the necessary means for success, despite the terrible conditions they
faced. One of the effects of characterizing the predicament of Iraq in this way is that it

280

absolved the U.S. of responsibility for any future disasters that Iraq would encounter by
advancing the notion of an independent Iraq in the present.
Security problems remained a concern in Iraq from the time of the invasion until
the U.S. troop withdrawal in December 2011. In 2003, much of the responsibility for the
problems with violence was placed on Hussein loyalists or sometimes unidentified
extremists. This was inevitable as there had not been enough time for an insurgency or
resistance to the invaders to emerge. As the occupation wore on and a power struggle
erupted from the vacuum left by Hussein’s removal from power, sectarianism became the
principle reason reported in the news discourse for the ongoing violence. This was not
particularly controversial or necessarily a misrepresentation of reality as most of the
violence was being committed between different political factions usually drawn along
ethnic and religious lines. However, at the time of the withdrawal, the news discourse
rarely addressed the American policy of De-Ba’athification and how the dismantling of
the Iraqi security apparatus in 2003 had created the conditions for the lawlessness and
violence which ensued. Although such criticism of the U.S. may have surfaced
sporadically, much of the security discourse remained fixated on the threat posed by
insurgents and militias in the wake of an American withdrawal rather than on policy
failures that had caused the conditions for sectarian violence. For example, the WP
reported that the war had removed Hussein from power “but also set in motion a sectarian
conflict suppressed for decades by his brutal rule.” (Wilson & Nakamura, 2011, p. A3).
Similarly the NYT stated that Iraq was a “land defined on sectarian lines” (Arango, 2011,
p. A1) with the implication being that sectarian violence was inevitable; thus, creating the
impression that the conflicts between Shiites and Sunnis were age-old.

281

However, this ignored the resentment the Sunnis felt towards the Americans at the
time of the invasion, for the arrests and detainments of thousands of young men for
interrogations about links to terrorism or knowledge of the alleged Iraqi WMD program.
Such policies were later adopted by the Maliki’s government under the guise of fighting
‘terrorists.’ It is not the purpose here to suggest that the NYT or WP did not at all criticize
U.S. policy as there were a few occasions in these two newspapers were the U.S. was
directly blamed for problems in Iraq. However, such criticisms did not come to dominate
the discourse about the ongoing security problems and were marginalized in comparison
to discussions about Iraq’s age old tribal or sectarian differences.
It is worth re-visiting one of the key findings from the analysis of the coverage in
2003 that showed that USA Today did cite failed American policies for the post-war
political problems, especially the lack of planning on behalf of the Bush administration. It
also did not blame Iraqis or insinuate Iraqi responsibility for the political strife that
emerged from the overthrow of the Hussein government. However, by 2011 the discourse
in USA Today was radically different and more likely to follow the official lead, which in
essence presented the political quagmire as a consequence of the Maliki government and
sectarian divisions rather than the result of American policy failures. The NYT offered far
more balanced coverage in 2011 than it did in 2003, with numerous articles highlighting
the failure of American planning and preparation for the aftermath of the invasion.
Discourses are sites of constant struggle and contestation, one of the ways in
which a historical-diachronic analysis can be helpful is by examining how a change in the
circumstances of an event such as the emergence of a new social agent impacts the
existing discourse. In May 2003, the four newspapers did not report on the ‘threat’ Iran

282

posed to the stability of Iraq. However, by 2011, Iran was referenced consistently across
the coverage of the NYT, WP and WSJ, principally as a de-stabilizing force that was
“preying” on a vulnerable Iraq. In U.S. political and media discourses, Iran had
historically been labelled a rogue state that was considered a threat to peace in the region
(especially for its strong pro-Palestine stance and outspoken rhetoric on Israel). So, when
Iran was mentioned in the news discourse, it was mentioned in the context of its preexisting relationship to the U.S., as an adversary and characterized in a negative light. As
pointed out in Chapter Six, the emergence of Iran, and consistent references to Iranian
meddling and support for Shiite militias, offered a new scapegoat to blame for Iraq’s
security and political problems and deflected attention away from the failures of U.S.
policies.

7.5 Summary
From a CDA perspective, it is not single instances of masking agency in the case
of civilian deaths or the destruction of infrastructure that is of particular interest; rather, it
is the repeated patterns of discourse which can help investigate the overall effects of such
discursive representations on the construction of meaning and identity. What emerges
from this historical-diachronic analysis is a pattern of media discourse strategies amongst
the WSJ, NYT and to a lesser degree the WP that, in 2003 tended to highlight the positive
outcomes of the war and support the American military operation in Iraq. When negative
consequences of the war were highlighted, these were backgrounded or drowned out by
the presence of contrastive news and the strong emphasis on the pro-war position. The
CDA was most revealing when it came to examining how responsibility was attributed

283

for the negative consequences. Usually, U.S. culpability was overlooked or downplayed.
In the few occasions that civilian deaths were raised, there was a tendency (except for in
USA Today) to justify or explain the circumstances in a way that would negate American
responsibility. Consider the following examples from the same article in the NYT:
In Tikrit, the birthplace of Mr. Hussein and the nation's stronghold for his
Baath Party, the American military conducted a raid in which it arrested
20 people. One Iraqi was killed after he reportedly tried to grab a rifle
away from an American soldier, the military said.
And:
There were, however, no new demonstrations in the city of Falluja, where
local residents have said that American soldiers killed 18 Iraqis this week
in two anti-American protests. The military reported in both cases that
soldiers were fired on by demonstrators, though residents said the marches
were peaceful. (Fisher, 2003, p. 10)
In both excerpts, U.S. military actions are explained with information that helps remove
American responsibility. In the first, the circumstances are hardly investigated or
questioned; the close proximity of the mention of Hussein and the Ba’ath Party further
legitimize the raid and death of a civilian. In the second, the facticity of the claim that 18
Iraqis were killed by Americans is brought into question because it was reported by local
residents who are mentioned in the same sentence as “anti-American” protests which
again has a de-legitimizing effect. Furthermore, the deaths are justified because “soldiers
were fired on.” It was in such ways that reporting the war’s ending in 2003 was proAmerican and supportive of U.S. actions. As concluded in Chapter Five, such a discourse

284

amounted to a Manichean discourse which sought to win the U.S. public’s approval for
the invasion.
Compared to 2003, by 2011 the news discourse in the NYT and WP had become
more balanced and showed a greater tendency to critique the outcomes of the war. The
coverage of USA Today showed the most dramatic change from 2003, in that the reality it
conveyed to its readers about the situation in Iraq was more upbeat and tended to follow
the White House’s line of assessment. For example, it reproduced President Obama’s
discourse that emphasized the removal of Hussein from power, and the prospects for
democracy that had only become possible thanks to the sacrifices of American troops and
their families. The WSJ remained consistently hawkish in both 2003 and 2011, reflecting
its strong Republican ideological leaning by echoing prominent Republican criticisms of
Obama’s policy of withdrawal, favoring instead a continued presence of American troops
in Iraq but under the pretense of the apparent desire of Iraqis for a continued American
presence in order to secure them from al-Qaeda as well as ‘Iranian- Shiite militias.’
King (2014) in her analysis of several media outlets including the NYT and WP
found that President Obama’s endgame narrative was contested by the NYT and WP. The
historical-diachronic analysis here would concur that in 2011 these elite press organs did
not simply reproduce exactly the same discourse and did challenge it at times. However,
this did not mean that some of the themes that King identified from Obama’s rhetoric on
the ending of the war were not present in the NYT or WP’s coverage. King highlights five
interrelated themes in Obama’s narrative on Iraq since he took office, these were:
1) the U.S. fulfilled its responsibilities and met its commitments in Iraq; 2)
U.S. troops served with honor and met success; 3) the war’s benefits

285

outweighed the costs; 4) America must refocus on the real security threat;
and 5) Iraq could now achieve a democratic destiny. (2014, p. 128)
From the analysis in this study, the NYT and WP’s discourses on the ending still
contained themes 1, 2 and 5 fairly consistently.
To sum up, the principle conclusion to be drawn from the historical –diachronic
analysis is that the news coverage across the four newspapers over time is inherently
ideological. It is reflective of the dominant cultural values and mainstream perspectives
such as patriotism and a nationalistic outlook that are widespread in American society
which view the U.S. as a force of good in the world. Despite the overwhelming evidence
of the destructiveness of the war, and rampant anti-American sentiment in the Middle
East, the news media discourse never brought the fundamental values of American
foreign policy into question. In this sense, despite the professional values of practicing
fairness or balance “journalists typically agree that patriotism is a good thing…On this
matter, they are openly political, yet see no conflict between this and an obviously
contradictory claim to neutrality.” (Jensen, 2005, p. 80). This chapter has sought to
underline how the packaging of information is culturally conditioned and how the final
information product, that is news is not independent to the effects of this process. The
theoretical implications of this for LIS are addressed in the concluding chapter.

CHAPTER 8
CONCLUSION
8.1 Discussion
In bringing this study to a close, it is important to draw attention once again to the
aims of this study before addressing the specific questions that guided this research. The
aims were to (1) to shed light on the dominant discourses that are embedded in news
coverage of the ending of the Iraq War in four major national newspapers (The Wall
Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today); (2) to
demonstrate using CDA how meaning of the ending of the war was discursively
constructed in 2003 and 2011; and (3) to illustrate how news is an informational product
that is not free of ideology by discerning patterns and thematic structures of discourses
within the coverage that either discursively reproduce or challenge the injustices of the
Iraq War. In addition to these specific aims, there are the broader aims of CDA such as to
bring to light discourse formations and other properties of text that facilitate the
reproduction or reification of the dominant discourses, thereby illustrating how these can
become hegemonic. These hegemonic discourses have material consequences such as the
shaping of public debate by impacting public perceptions (values, beliefs and opinions);
through information control (the quality and accuracy of information people have access
to); and, ultimately on government policy, legitimated through public approval or
support for elected leaders. Thus, CDA scholars seek to question and criticize discourses
in order to highlight illegitimate power relations and the boundaries of what can and
287

cannot be said; thereby, contributing to the resolution of injustice and giving voice to
victims. In this light, it has been the aim of this study to contest and interrupt the
dominance of media discourses on the ‘ending’ and legacy of the Iraq War.
This study found that interest in the Iraq War declined over time judging by the
number of articles published in newspapers about the ending which went down from 158
in 2003 to 61 in 2011. In part, this was because the Obama administration sought to refocus attention from Iraq to the War in Afghanistan, where the U.S. since 2009, had been
escalating the war against the Taliban and its supporters. Since before taking office,
President Obama had maintained that Iraq was not the key arena for the War on Terror,
once referring to it as a “dumb war” but he later advocated approval for a gradual
drawdown of U.S. troops. In addition, President Obama and his administration wanted to
move on from what was a costly and unpopular war at a time when the domestic agenda,
especially in light of the ongoing global financial crisis was beginning to take center
stage. These arguments would indicate the extent of the power of the White House to set
the political agenda for media organizations. Another, possible explanation for the fall in
media interest is that news organizations driven by the need to make profit, seek to offer
an informational product (news) that is ‘new.’ But, the American public had apparently
grown tired or lost interest because Iraq was an ‘old’ story where the same issues of
sectarian violence and political in-fighting had remained constant throughout the war;
thus, making a narrative of progress and success difficult to believe. Finally, the financial
incentives and needs of news media organizations to be profit-oriented and publish
stories that are palatable to their commercial clients (responsible for a much larger

288

portion of their revenue through advertising than readers’ subscriptions) could also have
been a factor in the drop in media interest.
From the analyses conducted in this study, the sustained discourses that appeared
in multiple texts over the two different periods were brought to light. In the context of the
ending of the war in 2003, these culminated in a representation of reality that suggested
the war was an overwhelming success, especially in the WSJ and NYT coverage, and less
so in the WP and USA Today. The ‘war as a success’ discourse naturalized the war’s
‘ending’ with coverage celebrating its triumphs such as the removal of the Hussein
government, the swiftness of military victory, or citing the capitulation of the Iraqi state
security and armed forces. Equally important to this construction of the ending of the war
was the role of the pre-existing War on Terror discourse that the Bush administration and
subsequently the mass media, had contextualized Iraq as a part of. The War on Terror
discourse that had defined the U.S. foreign policy response since 9/11 had established
Iraq as a threat because of its alleged WMD and links to al-Qaeda. Once both of these
accusations were proven to be baseless, the discourses of liberation and democracy in
Iraq were addressed extensively and formed a central part of the outcomes of the war in
all four newspapers. However, USA Today also contained significant alternative
discourses that challenged the success narrative, this was achieved by focusing on the
challenges that Iraq was facing as well as by attributing responsibility for some of the
problems of American policies in Iraq.
There was a great degree of congruence between the findings from the contextual
analysis and the textual analysis, with the latter providing clear examples of how
discourses are constructed and how they function in texts. The dominant discourses to

289

emerge in the 2011 ‘ending’ of the war were very similar to those in 2003, suggesting
there had not been a dramatic change in the representation of the war in the four
newspapers. The success narrative remained intact in 2011, and indeed gained
momentum in the coverage of USA Today. However, the ending of the war in 2011 was
no longer exclusively portrayed as a ‘success’ and there were competing discourses that
also highlighted the war’s failures, especially in the coverage of the WP and NYT. In
addition, there was less reliance by the news media on the War on Terror discourse that
had been so predominant during the Bush Presidency; perhaps this was influenced by the
Obama Administration’s wish to move away from the association with President Bush’s
foreign policy and legacy, especially in Iraq.
In 2011, similar discourse themes on the outcomes and consequences emerged,
although varying in degrees of emphasis by newspaper. The changes in the dominant
discourses from 2003 to 2011 in the WP and NYT could possibly be explained by the
widespread criticism these media outlets received for backing the war in 2003 without
thoroughly questioning the Bush administration’s rationale for war. Therefore, these
newspapers attempted to restore their reputations as stalwarts of the American news
media. However, the change in the NYT and WP’s reporting could also have been because
of the change in American public opinion about the war which increasingly mirrored the
deterioration of conditions on the ground in Iraq (Holsti, 2011, p. 74). For example, the
results of a Pew Research Center (2011) poll showed that the number of Americans who
felt taking military action against Iraq was the right decision had fallen from 73 percent
in 2003 to 48 percent in 2011 (it had remained below 40 percent until the 2011 survey). It

290

is difficult to gauge whether newspapers were influencing or influenced by public
opinion on the war by 2011.
The collective picture that emerged from the four newspapers in 2011 (that was
also consistent with the coverage in 2003) was a tendency to employ a pro-American
leaning and what neatly fit van Dijk’s (1998) description of the ideological square. That
is, the dominant discourses contained an ‘us vs. them’ frame, whereby the news reports
emphasized actions or outcomes that cast the Americans in a favorable light squared
against the negative properties and actions of the ‘other.’ Furthermore, there was
extensive textual evidence from the newspapers that demonstrated mitigation of the
negative actions of the U.S. This was discursively achieved through a variety of
argumentation strategies that involved but were not limited to, omission of U.S. agency
and responsibility; downplaying the negative actions of the U.S. whether it was those of
its military or U.S. government’s policies; and offering explanatory reasoning for
negative U.S. actions, for example, if civilians died during protests, casting demonstrators
as aggressive and provocative. Finally, the ‘ideological square’ was completed by the
mitigation of the positive actions of the ‘other.’ Over the course of the War, the identity
of the ‘other’ was constituted by different actors (that is individuals, groups,
organizations, governments) depending on the news story. The ‘other’ in 2003 was
constituted mostly by the enemy, either those cast as Hussein loyalists, terrorists,
criminals, or extremists. By 2011, the ‘other’ included the Iraqi government, Shia and
Sunni militias, outside actors such as Syria and Iran, as well as the aforementioned
constituents. In the news reports on the legacy of the conflict, there was a dearth of praise
for the Iraqi government, Iraq’s security forces, and the Sunni Awakening groups that

291

had helped the Americans in 2007 and 2008, which fit within the expectations of the
ideological square of downplaying the good actions of ‘them.’
As the ideological square revealed, there was a strong pro-American bias that
permeated the news discourse in both 2003 and 2011 which, has implications for the
democratic and educational function of news as an informational product. The presence
of this patriotic perspective is most revealingly illustrated in the discourses on the
attribution of responsibility for the negative consequences of the war. As Chapters Five,
Six and Seven showed, there was a tendency to blame the negative consequences of the
war such as the precarious state of security and ongoing violence and political stalemate
on ‘others,’ whether it was the Hussein loyalists and criminals in 2003, or terrorists or
Iranian-backed Shia militias in 2011. In addition to articles actively assigning blame, one
of the most effective strategies used was to shift blame, or anonymize responsibility for a
negative action through the deletion of agency in sentences. Such omissions of
responsibility were effective in disassociating the U.S. with the negative consequences of
the war.
This leads to another major finding of this study, which was to bring to light the
workings of “silence” in the news discourse. In essence, this is the absence of
information, of alternative voices, explanations, or perspectives; it is the active removal
of important features of the issue which enshrouds a truer picture and understanding of
reality. There are many such silences that operate within texts; these are not only
indicative of the boundaries of discourse, in other words, what is permissible to say but
also work alongside and in conjunction with the what is said in the text (Foucault,
1978/1990). Examples of silences included, overlooking the causes of problems such as

292

civilian deaths or civilian infrastructure destruction and thereby treating these as though
they just happened without any agent. Silences also influenced the discourse by the ways
that framing was utilized either in terms of how an issue was presented, as well as by how
much context was included as part of the background. In addition, the accumulative
effects of presenting from pro-American and patriotic angles enabled such ideological
standpoints to become pervasive and eventually hegemonic in the news discourse. The
hegemony achieved by this discourse marginalized other discourses that occasionally
sprouted in the news and these ended up being faded out as background noise due to their
scarcity in the coverage.
As the textual analyses for each of the articles showed, the workings of language
are not neutral but always reflect some kind of political position; in the articles examined
in this study, this position, more often than not encapsulated a nationalistic and patriotic
discourse. This explains the pro-Americanism, and the consistent positive selfrepresentation that was a staple feature of much of the coverage across all four
newspapers. Discursively this was achieved in numerous ways such as drawing from
well-established American myths, symbols and histories that resonated culturally and
psychologically with a majority of Americans. For instance, the reconstruction discourse
following the toppling of the Hussein regime Iraq was presented as a story or progress
and improvement, one that resonated with American historical narratives such as
manifest destiny, the frontier, benevolent expansion and the notion of economic
opportunities. Such myths had been called upon throughout American history in order to
justify conquest, whether it was wars against Native American tribes or against Mexico
following the annexation of Texas by the U.S in 1845. Such discourses are part of the

293

larger discourse of American exceptionalism which conveys the idea of the U.S. as a
chosen nation that was righteous and Divinely ordained; “a worldview to which
presidents from Washington to Obama have given full throated endorsement.” (King,
2014, p. 5).
Much of the reporting about the Iraq War in both 2003 and 2011 contained the
American exceptionalism discourse which manifested in the positive self-representation
that also portrayed the American involvement in Iraq as noble and righteous. In 2003 the
NYT, WP, and WSJ strongly supported and adopted the War on Terror discourse and idea
of fighting the enemy that was responsible for 9/11. By 2011, the American role in the
war was cast in a different light; having now liberated the Iraqis and established
democracy, the Americans pledged to offer training for Iraq’s military and assistance to
the new government of Iraq. Hence, there was a shift in the media discourse across all
four newspapers that recontextualized the Americans from defenders of freedom in 2003
(as opposed to invaders of the sovereign state of Iraq) to nation-builders and
peacekeepers that respected the rule of international law, evidenced by numerous
expressions of American concern for Iraq’s security.
News discourses conveyed American concern for Iraq’s security along with
expressions of worry about the growing Iranian influence or meddling in Iraq. However,
this was always through a perspective of American exceptionalism. For example, the on
December 12, 2011 the WP reported the need to secure America’s “core interests in Iraq”
which included: “[p]romoting an Iraq that abides by its international responsibilities; and
[c]ontaining Iranian influences that are harmful to U.S. interests in Iraq and the region.”
(Kagen & Kagen, 2011, p. A21). The report went on to stress that:

294

Iraq is a signatory to numerous treaties and a member of international
organizations obliging it to respect human rights, ensure due process of
law, and refrain from arbitrary or political detentions. Responsible nations
should insist that Iraq demonstrate its commitment to those obligations.
The president should tell Maliki in no uncertain terms that Washington
will hold him to account in the international arena if Iraq does not. (Kagen
& Kagen, 2011, p. A21)
In these examples, the expression of expectation that Iraq abides by its international
obligations contains the implication that the U.S. also does, despite the Iraq War being
launched by the U.S and its allies without a resolution from the U.N. Security Council
authorizing war. The WP’s analysis here did not see any discord between presenting an
argument stressing the requirements of Iraq to follow international law yet, overlooking
the U.S. failure to do so in the case of launching the war. Thus, exemplifying the
discourse of American exceptionalism within news discourse; this was not unique to the
WP, as the NYT, WSJ and USA Today also adopted such positions without hesitation.

8.2 Limitations and Further Study
In addition to the limitations of the scope of this research, the critiques of CDA,
and questions regarding reliability and validity which have all been addressed in Chapters
One, Three and Four respectively, there are additional issues that come to light towards
the conclusion of such research projects. Firstly, the research questions and the aims to
examine how discourse changed over time required an analysis of a significant data set to
conduct a meaningful contextual analysis that would offer valuable insights into the

295

outcomes, consequences and attribution of responsibility. This was a labor intensive and
time-consuming enterprise, even with the aid of data analysis software such as NVivo 11
Pro. What emerged from the analysis were broad patterns in the data which served the
purpose of illuminating context in the news coverage. However, this meant the number of
articles that were selected for detailed textual analysis had to be reduced in order to make
the study feasible. While examining fewer articles is not atypical of CDA studies, it
would be valuable to extend the detailed textual analysis to a larger sample of newspaper
articles as it would shed further light on whether the results from the contextual and
textual analyses would retain the same degree of congruence. Having said that, the
sample of 8 articles that were selected for detailed textual analysis is still considered quite
large for the type of detail that CDA seeks to obtain. As both the contextual and textual
analyses are highly interpretive processes, the researcher is required to prioritize some
elements of the text over others, which means that it is quite possible that other
discourses are also embedded in texts. In fact, the more an analyst engages with a text,
the greater the number of discursive features s/he is likely to become aware of, this is
especially the case where intertextuality is involved. CDA is a messy process and
imposing strict methods on how it is conducted are always at the expense of alternative
approaches.
Secondly, the Iraq War is still ongoing and as a result, there remains a scarcity of
historiography to draw upon, which is only likely to broaden and improve over the
coming years. As a result, many of the findings of this study, especially relating to the
historical-diachronic analysis could be enhanced by drawing from historical material that
gives further insights into the socio-political contexts that fueled the cultural and

296

informational output in present times. Compared to 2011, there is a greater body of
scholarship available on the initial war period, including the memoirs of key figures such
as members of governments, military generals, and press secretaries that expand and
deepen our understanding of the workings of discourse in news. As key figures from the
Obama administration release memoirs, and a greater amount of documentation is studied
by scholars, the findings of this research could be further validated or challenged.
Thirdly, the focus of this research is on media representation of the ending of the
Iraq War and therefore, gives only a partial picture of the strength of a discourse in
society; as how a particular discourse formation manifests, i.e. impacts policy, public
dialogue and the lives of those involved in the conflict requires additional engagement
with important social actors such as government figures, humanitarian aid agencies, and
those on all sides caught up in the crisis. Therefore, there is a tendency in CDA studies to
point further research in this direction.

8.3 Contributions of the Study
One of the motivations for this study as stated in the introduction was to address
the gap in LIS scholarship that sidestepped the politics of the Iraq War, specifically its
consequences and injustices. This study acknowledges the inter-relatedness of political,
media, and academic discourses; as such, it was the intention, as a CDA study, to
interrupt and contest the dominant discourses, and the discursive treatment of the Iraq
War in existing LIS scholarship by filling the political void in the literature. This study
also addressed one of the least studied areas of the war; the ending of the war and its
representation in media provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how discourses

297

(and realities) are socially constructed. Contrary to the positivist tradition that dominates
LIS scholarship and its principle (cognitive) theories on what information is, what an
information user is, and what information needs are, etc., this study draws attention to the
“silences” that operate within informational texts and contexts. In other words, this
research makes a compelling case illustrating that information extends beyond what is
there in a text to include and consider what is not there. As what is excluded from the
discourse on an issue has a critical impact on how that issue is portrayed and understood,
in essence the ontology of information is altered by what is absent.
Another major contribution is that the interdisciplinary approach taken in this
study demonstrates the advantages of utilizing the contributions from a variety of fields
as it allows an expansion of the theoretical possibilities for LIS scholars to reach beyond
research that is insular and confined to traditional subject boundaries. Inspired by the
works of Budd (2006), Budd & Raber (1996), R. Day (2000, 2005), Frohmann (1992a,
1992b, 1994), and Radford (1992, 1998, 2003), this study has tackled a research problem
that has fascinated scholars of a wide variety of disciplines, and by doing so it is hoped
that it will demonstrate to those inside and outside LIS, the valuable contributions such
research can make to the body of knowledge of important topics such as the Iraq War. In
this way, LIS can join the wider conversation with media and communication scholars,
historians, linguists, sociologists and political scientists and engage in debate about the
Iraq War rather than remain on the periphery and anxious about a diffusion of the
disciplinary identity of LIS.
Finally, this study underlines the need for critical information literacy programs as
it has demonstrated how news discourse can be manipulated to construct knowledge and

298

social realities which end up reinforcing existing power structures rather than questioning
or challenge these. Through deploying CDA, this study has demonstrated the process of
how discourse is constructed in news media, and the role language plays in how
information is packaged and presented. The full potential of information literacy or
critical media literacy courses and programs in LIS remains confined until the discipline
as a whole can embrace the theoretical challenges of poststructuralist thought by letting
go of ideas of objectivity and neutrality when it comes to conceptualizing information.

8.4 Conclusion
One of the criteria for judging validity of a CDA study mentioned in Chapter Four
was the sense of convergence and agreement that exists with other studies. This study
found there to be a strong presence of nationalistic ideology that characterized the news
discourse of all four newspapers in both 2003 and 2011. This concurs with the some of
the important findings of King’s (2014) Obama, the media, and framing the U.S. exit
from Iraq and Afghanistan which highlighted the American exceptionalism discourse that
surfaced in both the Presidential rhetoric and in the news coverage of different media
outlets. This study found there to be a great deal of uniformity in the coverage and
adoption of dominant discourses across all four newspapers which diverged from the
findings of studies such as that by Feldman, Huddy, and Marcus (2015) of media
performance in the lead up to the Iraq War. They found there to be sufficient evidence of
counter-narratives and counter-discourses that challenged the government’s perspective
when it came to supporting the war. Similarly, King (2014) also found that the NYT and
WP challenged Obama’s framing of the ending of the Iraq War. However, this study

299

found that while there were some challenges to the official rhetoric, these newspapers
never questioned the underlying logic behind American foreign policy in the Middle
East. The widespread presence of a Manichean discourse with patriotic sentiments
revealed there was an inherent assumption in the goodness and righteousness of the
American cause. Within this narrow confinement of discourse, there was an expression of
divergent opinions, principally reflective of the conservative or liberal leaning of each
newspaper.
As Fairclough argues, the more mechanical and automatic the functioning of an
ideological assumption in discourse, the less likely its workings can be detected, and
therefore the greater its security and strength (its hegemonic power) (1989, pp. 85-6).
The presence of the nationalistic ideology is so pervasive in American culture that its
discursive re-enactment in news media texts is rarely questioned or viewed as
problematic. The effects of this on discourse are a promotion of patriotic values and
symbols as a form of persuasion, designed to garner public support for specific
government policies such as military action or all out wars. The presence of patriotic and
nationalistic ideology is not necessarily unique to American media but highlighting its
existence aids in questioning notions of journalistic neutrality, balance and objectivity. It
is hoped that further studies like this can help to highlight the subtle workings of
illegitimate power abuse and injustice as it manifests in news media discourse. This study
has also advocated and made a case for a greater appreciation in the field of LIS for the
role played by language and discourse in designating meaning to information.

APPENDIX A: 2003 NVIVO CODING SUMMARIES
Table A.1 2003, NYT, Summary of coding of discourses on outcomes
Discourse / Code
War as a success

Description
Emphasis of military
operation as a success; Iraq is
now heading toward
modernity; Iraq is now
secure; a success for regional
politics

Example
Prominence
“For now, though, the point was to declare 39 out of 56 articles
an end to the combat phase of the war in
(70%)
Iraq…No fair-minded person would
begrudge Mr. Bush …this celebratory
moment. America's armed forces
performed courageously in Iraq, dislodging
a brutal dictatorship in a swift, decisive
campaign. They deserve the nation's thanks
and a warm welcome home.”

2

Removal of
dictatorship

Liberated Iraqis of Hussein’s
dictatorship; democratization
is underway; women’s
liberation; justice for Iraqis
by holding former regime
officials to account

“… the Pentagon would like to see
celebrations that emphasize the recognition
of the troops' accomplishment in toppling a
dictator, and is considering setting up a
task force to help organize events.”

U.S. reconstruction
of Iraq

Emphasis on U.S. re-building
and positively transforming
Iraq; including such issues as
improving Iraqi infrastructure
and industries

“Civil affairs forces have been focusing on
restoring essential services and helping
Iraq get back on its feet. But they, too,
have been targets.”

23 out of 56 articles
(41%)

=4

Uncertainty over
Iraq’s future

Coverage expresses
uncertainty in terms of
outcomes related to war aims
(namely, WMD threat,
removing terrorist threat, and
establishing political stability
through a democratic
government)

“The situation in Iraq is now so uncertain
that American forces plan to keep rules of
engagement that allow them to initiate
offensive operations even as they make the
transition to "peace enforcement."”

16 out of 56 articles
(29%)

Critical coverage
questioning ‘success’
discourse

Questioning outcomes and
failure to find WMD or find
evidence linking Hussein to
al-Qaeda; resulting negative
impact on U.S. international
relations

“ALL right, so weapons of mass
destruction haven't yet been found in Iraq.
And no firm link has been established
between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.”

16 out of 56 articles
(29%)

6

Removal of WMD
and terror threat

Coverage expresses optimism
in finding WMD, and
emphasizes removal of WMD
and terror threat

“One senses, though, that liberals so detest
Mr. Bush that they refuse to acknowledge
the simple good that has come from ending
Saddam's tyranny -- good for Iraqis and
good for America, because it will inhibit
other terrorist-supporting regimes.”

9 out of 56 articles
(16%)

Table A.2 2003, USA Today, Summary of coding of discourses on outcomes
Discourse / Code
War as a success

Description
Emphasis of military victory;
positive coverage of preemptive war policy; stressing
other successes of war

Example
“Bush celebrated the swift success of U.S.
and allied forces in the three-week conflict
in Iraq but made clear that battles lie ahead
as the United States roots out threats to its
security.”

2

Uncertainty over
Iraq’s future

Coverage expresses warning
over risks and challenges
facing U.S. military in Iraq;
numerous discourses on
political vacuum and hostility
towards U.S. occupation

“The U.S. military -- and the civilian
10 out of 27 articles
(37%)
administration… have barely begun to fill
the vacuum left by the collapse of
Saddam's government.…A new Iraqi
government seems a distant dream. As a
result, many Iraqis feel they are adrift, their
destination uncertain and their future
bleak.”

=3

Critical coverage
questioning ‘success’
discourse

Questioning outcomes and
failure to find WMD or find
evidence linking Hussein to
al-Qaeda; stressing political
failure of Iraq War; emphasis
on ongoing violence as
evidence of failure

“For while the Iraq War has been many
things, it is not the ultimate endorsement
for the policy of preemption that some
conservative backers of the administration
see. At least not so far. In spite of Bush's
claim Thursday that "we have removed an
ally of al-Qaeda," the U.S. has yet to prove
strong links between Saddam's regime and
the terrorist group.”

Removal of
dictatorship

Liberated Iraqis of Hussein’s
dictatorship; democratization
is underway; discovering
evidence of crimes of
Hussein’s regime

“From start to finish, President Bush has
led the United States and its coalition
partners to the most important military
victory since World War II. And like the
allied victory over the axis powers, the
liberation of Iraq is more than the end of a
brutal dictatorship: It is the foundation for
a decent, humane government that will
represent all the people of Iraq.”

5

U.S. reconstruction
of Iraq

Emphasis on U.S. re-building
and positively transforming
Iraq; U.S. is getting Iraqi
economy back on its feet

“Companies that want work in the new Iraq 7 out of 27 articles
(26%)
swamped a sold-out reconstruction
conference Monday, many grumbling they
can't find anybody to listen to their
business pitch. The U.S.-led Iraqi
