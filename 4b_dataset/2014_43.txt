RESTAGING THE RECORD:
THE ROLE OF CONTEMPORARY ARCHIVES IN SAFEGUARDING AND
PRESERVING PERFORMANCE AS INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE

Tonia Sutherland, PhD
University of Pittsburgh, 2014

Bounded by and framed within the question of the role of contemporary archives in preserving
expressions of intangible cultural heritage, this dissertation examines the existing ways
performed and event-based cultural heritage are fixed and represented; problematizes prevailing
notions of information as evidence in archives; and disrupts issues of archival custody. The
dissertation offers new ways of thinking about the points where archives and intangible cultural
heritage intersect; as such, the project analyzes these intersections by examining three differing
modes of performance-based archivy.
With an eye toward existing archival theory and practice as well as an understanding of
“the archive” grounded in performance studies, this dissertation uses three unique case studies to
analyze and interrogate the perceived disconnect between “the archive and the repertoire,” as
well as to expand the body of research on the preservation of event-based cultural heritage. The
cases selected for this study, representative of the digital humanities, local practice and
international policy, are: the Live Performance Simulation System’s Virtual Vaudeville
prototype; the Katherine Dunham Archives and the Dunham Technique; and the implementation
of the United Nations Scientific, Educational and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s 2003
Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

iv

These cases collectively interrogate boundaries between archive and repertoire,
illuminating the existing ways contemporary archives document, safeguard and preserve eventbased cultural heritage. At the same time, each individual case investigates instances of eventbased archivy, highlighting necessary shifts in archival theory and practice to better support the
preservation of performative means of cultural expression.

PREFACE
I am because we are.
- Ashanti Proverb

Writing a dissertation is a thing that splits you open. It requires you to think about the world, your world,
the world you have created in ways that make you uncomfortable, scared, sometimes small, often
distracted and many times a little mad. A project such as this does not happen in isolation and I did not
journey this path alone. I am because we are.
I want to thank my committee – Alison Langmead, Brian Beaton, Dean Ronald Larsen, Lenny
Berkman and my advisor, Richard Cox—for answering questions, offering thoughtful feedback, talking
me down off the ledge, and for patiently allowing me to do my own thing in my own time, always
believing my passion for the topic would see me through.
I will be forever grateful to my interview subjects: to Dr. David Saltz, Dr. Susan Kattwinkel, and
Dr. Bruce McConachie for providing background on the Virtual Vaudeville project and for sharing their
time and their records with me. I am particularly indebted to David Saltz for hosting me in Atlanta and
showing me the magic in the machines. Without Ron Hutson, Dr. Albirda Rose, and Dr. Halifu Osumare,
I would never have known Katherine Dunham. Thank you for introducing me to Miss Dunham and
reminding me why I loved dance first. I am confident that you are making her proud. Alicia Blake, Omela
Reid, and Lutalo Massimba informed my work on Trinidad and Tobago. I am grateful to them for their
time and for welcoming me home to Trinidad after a long absence. I am equally grateful to Colleen
Quigley at Memorial University for her immediate enthusiasm for the project and for connecting me with
Dale Jarvis in The Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador. Similarly, I am grateful to Dale
for taking the time to share his passion for intangible cultural heritage with me and for making a critical
connection with the ICH team in Belgium.

I would not have begun this journey without the encouragement and absolute faith of Dr. Geof
Bowker, whose steadfast support continues to lift me up; and Dr. Susan Leigh Star, who first believed I
could succeed in a doctoral program and whose memory shines bright in each success I’ve enjoyed along
the way. Similarly, my decision to undertake a study on archives and performance was greatly influenced
by the late, great Dr. Bernadette Callery. It was my honor to know her and I wish she could be here to see
what this project has become. I found the movement, Bernadette. Thank you.
My friends and colleagues in the Archival Education and Research Institute have been true grit
supporters and sources of constant encouragement: Michelle Caswell, Bridget Lawlor, Mario H. Ramirez,
Jamie Lee, Rebecka Sheffield, Jonathan Dorey, Devan Donaldson — I hope to someday return the
kindness you have shown me. I have been similarly encouraged and supported by my fellow doctoral
students at the University of Pittsburgh who have diligently listened to every idea I’ve ever had, taken
notes, provided feedback, cheered me through the low points and celebrated each milestone of success. I
am grateful to all of you for your willingness to engage: Nora Mattern, Heather Soyka, Lindsay Kistler
Mattock, Jessica Benner, James King, Joel Blanco and Janet Céja.
There are several people whose love and compassion and support and generosity have known no
bounds and I’d like to take a moment to call them by name. To put their names in my mouth in a moment
of humility and gratitude:
Ilana Turner, thank you for reminding me to always play to win. Shilo Rae McGiff, without you,
this project would have been 1200 pages of drivel. Like breath, sister. In every moment, you are loved
like breath.
Asa, thank you for learning to make French press coffee and for the most tender hugs a mother
could ever desire. Thank you for being outraged when I was outraged, sad when I was sad, and happiest
when I was happy. You are my mirror and my guide.

xiii

To my partner in life and in crime, Kevin Swofford, thank you for being by my side though this
entire process, for listening as I talked through ideas, for reminding me to eat, sleep and drink water, for
careful editing and constant love. There is no farm like “Us Farm,” Kevin.
And finally, my parents, Sandra and Olson Sutherland and my brothers Omar and Erik
Sutherland. I am because we are.

A NOTE ABOUT TERMINOLOGY
This dissertation interrogates the role archives play in documenting performative practices. For
many cultures, performance is a deeply rooted aspect of cultural tradition and part of a system of
complex statements about colonialism, identity, agency and collective memory. In the United
States, as with other secularized and industrialized societies, these kinds of culturally-based
performative practices are less common. Rather, performance in these societies is more
frequently conceived of as music, dance and theater—that which is stageable. While these forms
also carry cultural importance, they do not immediately conjure concerns about the deep human
ramifications of potential loss. The term “performance” is therefore used broadly in this
dissertation to encompass all manners of performed acts, inclusive of all of humanity’s
performative qualities and occasions.
UNESCO uses the term “intangible cultural heritage,” which is, as explained in more
detail in Chapter 6, a term that has emerged from proclamations, recommendations, conventions,
charters, and codes addressing cultural heritage issues over the past century. UNESCO defines
intangible cultural heritage (ICH) as “a living form of heritage which is continuously recreated
and which evolves as we adapt our practices and traditions in response to our environment. It
provides a sense of identity and belonging in relation to our own cultures.” 1 UNESCO’s concept
of intangible cultural heritage encompasses oral traditions and expressions, performing arts,
social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning universe and nature,
and traditional craftsmanship. This study conceives of intangible cultural heritage as cultural

inheritances that cannot be touched, held, boxed, shelved, fixed, or put on permanent display.
Rather, intangible cultural heritage is akin to living heritage. It allows for new understandings
and accountings of changes in cultures, customs and traditions over time; the cultural impacts of
colonialism and migration; and cultural creation, reinvention, rights, and protection.
Discussions of intangible cultural heritage are present throughout this dissertation, not
only in the chapter on UNESCO: Katherine Dunham’s dance pedagogy is based on elements of
intangible cultural heritage from the French and British West Indies, and the Virtual Vaudeville
team, whose work focused on re-presenting both the tangible and intangible aspects of past
performances, came together at a cultural heritage conference. In this study, the term intangible
cultural heritage can be thought of as synonymous with “event-based cultural heritage,” and
“performed cultural heritage.” Terms such as performed acts or performance refer to
performance, broadly conceived, as discussed above.
UNESCO further stipulates that when working with intangible cultural heritage, one
cannot separate the tangible from the intangible. For example, in Trinidad, Carnival traditions
incorporate both tangible and intangible elements. A person who “plays Mas” (engaging in the
Carnival masquerade tradition) will dance to Calypso and Soca music in brightly colored
costumes such as feathered headdresses. To effectively safeguard Carnival as an element of
Trinidad and Tobago’s ICH, one must consider both the tangible (costumes, musical
instruments) and the intangible (dance, music) together. It is important to note here that a
tangible element may produce an intangible element and vice versa: a steel pan drum (tangible)
produces steel pan music (intangible) and a food tradition such as making roti (intangible)
produces a tangible, edible element. For these reasons, it is vital to recall that the tangible and the
intangible do not exist in isolation; rather, each one informs and defines the other.
xvi

Safeguarding is also a word used by UNESCO. It implies the continuity of a cultural
heritage practice. It does not imply fixity. In contrast to safeguarding, preservation is an
information stewardship term that does imply a degree of fixity. Both terms are used in this
dissertation to represent the act of fixing or ensuring the continuation of a performed act, as
appropriate, whether it be representative of Trinidad and Tobago’s cultural heritage or a
reproduction of a vaudeville act—or both.

I. PROBLEM STATEMENT

I.A. BACKGROUND

In the field of archival studies—as well as the broader library and information science field—
professional standards and frameworks for documenting and preserving event-based cultural
heritage as evidence remain noticeably absent. 2 While it is true in general that standards for
archival preservation are few, existing standards do not address the specific needs of intangible
records. 3 Similarly, while the bodies of literature that address archives and performance are vast,
there are few points of intersection in the scholarly discourse which connects them. Similarly,
few scholars address issues of safeguarding performed heritage and even fewer are in the field of
archival studies, those perhaps best positioned through craft, training and scholarship to develop
theories and methodologies for the preservation of event-based records. Although Library and
Information Science scholar Deborah Turner has addressed the existence of “oral documents”

While standards are few, tools have been developed that may aid in constructing methods or frameworks
for intangible cultural heritage. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), a
conceptual entity-relationship model developed by the International Federation of Library Associations
and Institutions (IFLA), provides for events and custodial relationships to be defined as entities and for
relationships between those entities to be defined as well. In a similar vein, the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has created a thesaurus of authorized
terms for cultural artifacts which includes intangible cultural heritage; the UNESCO thesaurus is useful
in describing ephemeral and event-based artifacts.

Specifically, the Society of American Archivists has endorsed ISO 16363 and ISO 16919 which define
recommended practices for assessing the trustworthiness of digital repositories as preservation
standards.

(and by extension “oral records”), and others have called for new ways of representing and
preserving cultural expressions, no significant empirical studies have been conducted in archival
studies in this area. 4 Similarly, the fields of performance studies and cultural anthropology have
developed bodies of literature that address the archive as an embodied space, but do not speak to
archives as physical spaces or as realms of distinct professional expertise. These conversations
about how to achieve something permanent from something fleeting and event-based are
happening concurrently, but not in collaboration. This study speaks to the intersection of
concerns raised by scholars in the abovementioned fields: those that seek to pluralize archives
and give voice/create counter-narratives where process and power have created gaps, vagaries
and silences; and those that have expressed anxiety about a limited ability to capture or
document the experience of live performance.

I.B. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY

In addition to practical concerns about the current limitations of event-based archivy, a gap exists
in the body of research that addresses archival theory outside the realm of cultural heritage that
can be deemed tangible. Ephemeral art and cultural events have enormous social and cultural
value, yet archives and other memory institutions do not have robust theoretical frameworks
which support their preservation. Discussions about archives in the performance studies
literature, on the other hand, focus primarily on an “embodied archive,” suggesting that modes of
reception and transmission are best employed to ensure the permanence of performed cultural
heritage. For example, performance studies scholar and New York University professor Diana

Taylor, in her seminal book The Archive and the Repertoire: Performing Cultural Memory in the
Americas, draws attention to what she deems a radical difference between archival traditions and
what she calls “the repertoire,” an aggregate of embodied gestures and practices. This study
hypothesizes that while such a disconnect might currently exist, contemporary archivists might
re-conceptualize archival traditions such as custodial relationships with records creators, as well
as collaborating with scholars in fields such as the digital humanities, creating new possibilities
for archives and archivists to embrace the work of preserving or safeguarding event-based and
other intangible cultural heritage. Performance, as a temporal mode of cultural production, is
particularly at risk for loss over time. Reframing performative acts as archival evidence mitigates
concerns about the completeness of the record. Working with performers as communities of
practice to better understand the evidentiary properties of performed records also addresses
concerns about loss. Taylor’s work lays a foundation for understanding the gaps between the
archive and the repertoire. Furthering Taylor’s analysis, this study maps these gaps, finding
points of connection and opportunities for intervention.
The temporal nature of performance naturally raises questions about the ability of
archivists to capture and preserve performed works. Archivist Hugh Taylor, writing for The
American Archivist in 1979, provides context for the archival community’s current approaches to
documenting performed cultural heritage, saying:
First, we should recognise [sic] that archival principles, as we
know them, were formulated and developed by scholarly
bureaucrats from a careful study of textual public records based on
the registry and the filing cabinet, and this is reflected in our
stewardship over the past century. Non-textual material showed
little evidence of a time series and obstinately resisted an original
order between inclusive dates. 5

Even though challenges arise when attempting to document performance in archives,
many performing arts archives have been established through direct working experience with
artists and live arts collections. As such, the materials which generally comprise their collections
are uniquely related to the performance professions and do not have their counterparts in
standard print collections. If, however, the archivally captured performance simply reflects
tangible artifacts (e.g. costumes, scripts, light plots, choreographic notation) to what extent can
the records be considered an accurate record of the performance? What comprises a reliable
record of performance? Sophia Lycouris, British scholar and Graduate Program Director at the
Edinburgh College of Art, views the representations archivists currently create as a
‘‘manifestation of registered concerns,’’ rather than an attempt to reconstruct the original.
Lycouris goes on to suggest that to capture the essence of a performance is more organic than
attempting to reflect a reality. 6
With an eye toward existing archival theory and practice as well as an understanding of
“the archive” grounded in performance studies, this dissertation uses three distinctive case
studies to analyze and interrogate the liminal spaces between the archive and the repertoire, as
well as to expand the body of research on the preservation and safeguarding of intangible
cultural heritage. The cases selected for this study are: The Live Performance Simulation
System’s Virtual Vaudeville prototype, the Katherine Dunham Archives and the Dunham
Technique, and the implementation of the United Nations Scientific, Educational and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO)’s 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural
Heritage.

The Virtual Vaudeville prototype is the product of collaboration among a diverse group
of United States scholars including computer scientists, 3D modelers and animators, theater
practitioners and historians of both theater and music. Funded by a $900,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation, the objective of the project was to use digital technology to
address issues of cultural transmission and representation in live performance. Using motion
capture technology—among others—the project aimed to represent an historical performance
tradition using a virtual reality environment. The project further sought to simulate the
experience of attending a live performance: an experience that would necessarily need to
incorporate not only elements of sight and sound, but also the interactive nature of a live
audience experience. Scholars immersed in the Virtual Vaudeville project were, in part, testing
hypotheses about historical performance practices and engaging with historical performance
traditions as performance (rather than as theater or film). Furthurmore, the project sought to use
digital technologies to answer the question: “Is it possible to archive a live performance?”
Building on an understanding of performance-based archivy established in the analysis of
the Virtual Vaudeville prototype, the second case study examines how the work of dancer and
choreographer Katherine Dunham have been persistently represented in archives and interrogates
the efficacy of The Dunham Technique as an embodied “archival” practice. Katherine Dunham’s
pioneering dance pedagogy, based on her own anthropological studies in the West Indies, is a
rare example of how cultural transmission works in Western societies. Dunham extrapolated her
field work in Trinidad, Martinique, Haiti and Jamaica to create a new form of dance informed by
the cultures of these island nations. Combined with her classical ballet training, Dunham’s dance
work—foundational to The Dunham Technique—is “safeguarded” and endures in the bodies of
her dancers. At the same time, Dunham’s archives hold her field notes, choreographic notes,
5

correspondence and visual evidence of her work. Together, these embodied practices, the
embedded cultural knowledge and the archival record comprise Dunham’s legacy in dance.
Dunham’s use of transmission as a safeguarding practice is one that is echoed in the theoretical
underpinnings and practical implementation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural
Heritage.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
advocates for the transmission of intangible cultural heritage from one generation to the next as a
primary means of preservation and safeguarding. In 2003, UNESCO adopted the Convention for
the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage which identifies and creates a framework for
representative aspects of intangible cultural heritage in need of safeguarding around the globe.
UNESCO employs both modes of transmission and conventional archivy in safeguarding
intangible heritage. On an organizational level, UNESCO’s deployment of the 2003 Convention
provides an existing framework for how cultural transmission and archivy work in tandem. This
case study explores “the archive” and “the repertoire” from the perspective of a global,
intergovernmental organization, providing a broader lens through which to analyze the role of
archives in preserving performed cultural heritage.
These three cases, considered collectively, shed light on the perceived boundaries
between archive and repertoire, allowing for a robust discussion of how contemporary archives
can best support the safeguarding and preservation of event-based cultural heritage. At the same
time, each individual case provides an opportunity to interrogate event-based archivy, creating a
space in which both archivists and performers can speak to the need for potential shifts or

6

adaptations in archival theory and practice and identify ways that archives might better support
the preservation of performance as a means of cultural expression.

I.C. RESEARCH QUESTIONS

The larger questions underpinning this dissertation are too broad to be adequately addressed in
one study. Questions such as What is the role of contemporary archives in safeguarding
expressions of intangible cultural heritage? and What constitutes an authentic record of
performance? describe lifelong research agendas. This study therefore addresses the following,
more narrowly constructed, questions:

Q1: What can a case study of three existing approaches to
performance-based archivy reveal about the archival role in
safeguarding and/or preserving event-based cultural heritage?
Q2: How might existing archival theories and practices need to
shift to more effectively attend to event-based cultural heritage?

II. LITERATURE REVIEW

II.A. INTRODUCTION

This literature review synthesizes scholarship from multiple disciplines related to records of live
events and performances. The dissertation examines the relationship between contemporary
archives and records of intangible cultural heritage. The literature review is therefore framed
around the project’s three case studies, each of which examines this relationship through the
lenses of archive and repertoire; form and function; and evidence, materiality, and custody.
Specifically, The Live Performance Simulation System’s Virtual Vaudeville prototype case
study speaks to the evidentiary properties of records, while the archives of the dance work done
by anthropologist and choreographer Katherine Dunham addresses issues of performativity and
materiality. The deployment of UNESCO’s 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible
Cultural Heritage, then, unites these discussions, integrating archive and repertoire—form and
function—on a global scale. Working within this frame and bearing in mind the guiding question
for the larger research agenda—What comprises a reliable record of performance?—this review
examines the literature relating to information as evidence as well as scholarship on archives and
performance; it also explores shifting views on archival custody.
The larger project underpinning this dissertation questions the current ways archives
record and preserve expressions of intangible cultural heritage, including acts of performance.
8

The project also seeks to navigate an apparent gap between transmitting cultural heritage as a
safeguarding or preservation measure and applying conventional archival practices where
performance is concerned. No cohesive body of literature exists on the specific topics engaged
by this research project; this gap in the literature is particularly evident in the extant archival
studies research. This review synthesizes archival articulations in the performance studies
literature and locates scholarship about performance in the archival literature. Finally, to address
the gap in the literature around event-based archivy, this discussion highlights spaces for further
study in event-based archivy.

II.B. EVIDENCE: FUNCTION OVER FORM

The Archive is made from the selected and consciously chosen
documentation from the past and from the mad fragmentations that
no one intended to preserve and that just ended up there … In the
Archive, you cannot be shocked at its exclusions, its emptinesses,
at what is not catalogued. 7
The act of creating records means different things to different cultures and societies. Records are
assigned meaning not only by their creators, but also by subsequent custodians, researchers and
scholars. As a result, records are imbued with cultural significance and the repositories in which
they are held are located in our consciousness as sites of memory, legacy and in some cases,
survival. Just as the act of records creation implies a desire to create a documentary record and
imbues artifacts with cultural meaning, the creation of archives implies a desire to systematize
and support the preservation of cultural evidence and societal memory. Archives also have a long
history of acting as agencies of accountability. Accountability in archives is connected to notions
7

Carolyn Steedman, “The Space of Memory,” History of the Human Sciences 11, no. 4 (1998): 67.

9

of trust, transparency and responsibility. Accountability is also closely linked to an
understanding of archives as keepers of evidentiary records.
Evidence is a term that has different meanings in different contexts whether legal,
scientific or historical. Archival theory and practice around evidence have been influenced by
diplomatics, history, law, textual criticism, management theory and library science. 8 Evidence is
often used as the basis for constructing legal arguments and testing scientific theories.
Traditionally, “evidence” in the archival sense has been defined as “the passive ability of
documents and objects and their associated contexts to provide insight into the processes,
activities, and events that led to their creation for legal, historical, archaeological, and other
purposes.” 9 The concept of “evidence” in archival discourse appears as early as Hilary
Jenkinson’s description of the archivist as one committed to the “sanctity of evidence.” 10
Archival pioneer Theodore Schellenberg’s articulation of evidence recognizes a distinction
between the evidential and the informational value of a record, suggesting that the evidential
value of a record lies in the documentary significance of the circumstances of its creation while
its informational value is more closely tied to its content. 11 Throughout the 1990s and during the
early part of the 21st century, confronted with the advent of electronic records, many archival

as recordkeeper. 12 Contemporary archival scholars have problematized the discourse on records
and evidence, suggesting that a preoccupation with evidence and reliability in Western archivy
has inappropriately narrowed the lens through which archival work is viewed. 13 Archivist Brien
Brothman, for example, argues in his article “Afterglow: Conceptions of Record and Evidence in
Archival Discourse” that appending words such as “evidence,” “truth” and “reliability” to
records undermines their inherent authenticity. 14 By contrast, Yale archivist Jennifer Meehan
asserts in her 2006 article, “Towards an Archival Concept of Evidence,” that: “drawing upon
legal conceptions of evidence need not place undue limitations on archival notions of record and
evidence.” 15 As is the case with much of the archival discourse, however, scholarship on records
and evidence focuses almost wholly on tangible and text-based records. This historical trend

notwithstanding, archivists have more recently begun to examine notions of information as
evidence, broadening the scope of scholarship on the evidentiary value of archives. 16
In the January 2005 published proceedings of the American Society for Information
Science and Technology (ASIS&T), Jonathan Furner, Marcia Bates, Michael K. Buckland and
Anne J. Gilliland-Swetland, members of the University of California Los Angeles Center for
Information as Evidence, suggest that while material with evidentiary properties may be
conceptualized as information, among scholars affiliated with the information sciences “only the
archival scientist commonly treats artifacts primarily as evidentiary records of the occurrence of
historical events.” 17 Anne J. Gilliland-Swetland, taking the archival science view of the
evidentiary properties of information holds that, “the key to conceptualizing, and, by implication,
managing information as evidence lies in understanding the potential nature and use of
individual or accumulated information objects for probative or interpretive purposes.” 18
Jonathan Furner, associate professor in the Department of Information Studies at the
University of California Los Angeles, stresses that evidence can be mental or physical – or, to
expand Furner’s concept, intangible or tangible. Furner states in his 2004 article, “Conceptual
Analysis: A Method for Understanding Information as Evidence, and Evidence as Information”:
Just as we often speak of mental entities – things that exist in our
minds, such as ideas, thoughts, and beliefs, and classes of such
entities, such as propositions – as being evidence, we also often
speak of events, objects, or situations in the physical world

context please see Jonathan Furner, “Conceptual Analysis: A Method for Understanding Information as
Evidence, and Evidence as Information,” Archival Science 4 (2004): 233–265; see in particular pages

external to our individual minds as being evidence (or sources of
evidence). 19
Furner goes on to suggest that both form and content contribute to the evidentiary value of
information. For Furner, content can be conceived as “anything that serves as the physical
expression or representation of human ideas or thoughts,” and may include intangible content
such as utterances. 20 The theoretical underpinnings employed by Furner may prove useful in
delineating new concepts of “record-ness” for performance-based archivy as well as in
determining the evidentiary value of intangible cultural heritage.
Extending Furner’s argument and reworking Brien Brothman’s “afterglow” metaphor,
archivist Jennifer Meehan suggests shifting the focus from the relationship between record and
evidence to the relationship between event and record. With this reconfiguration, Meehan makes
explicit a relationship that is often assumed and establishes the relationship between event and
record as the foundation for conceptualizing any consequent relationships. 21 Meehan’s
repositioning of Brothman presents an opportunity to consider the event in the archival process;
an opportunity previously stunted by an archival tendency to bypass a consideration of the event
as record.
Archival scholar and educator, Richard J. Cox also suggests in his book Managing
Records as Evidence and Information that, “the physical entity of the document, which in the
past dictated aspects of access, security, and maintenance, has so changed as to call all such

functions into serious re-evaluation as to their applicability.” 22 Although Cox is referring to
electronic records, the assertion holds true for event-based records: the physicality of the record
is secondary to its function as evidence of a transaction or activity. 23
Linked to discussions about evidence are notions of accountability. Because scholarship
on accountability has been shaped by political and social events as well as technological
advances, notions of accountability in the archival profession are closely tied to personal
experience and reflect the manner in which archival traditions have developed in different parts
of the world. 24 As such, the tenets of public accountability will manifest differently in different
cultures and societies. In the Western tradition, archives which maintain public records function
as repositories of documentary evidence, preserving in their records such things as acts, deeds,
land grants, titles and edicts which speak to issues of ownership and responsibility. The Western
public archives tradition has supported political movements and policy production as well as
reflecting and sustaining cultural norms. Dutch archivist Eric Ketelaar in his 2001 article, “Tacit
Narratives: The Meanings of Archives,” asserts that:
[archivists] are learning (or relearning) from anthropologists,
sociologists, philosophers, cultural and literary theorists to look up
from the record and through the record, looking beyond - and
questioning - its boundaries, in new perspectives seeing with the
archive (to use Tom Nesmith's magnificent expression), trying to
read its tacit narratives of power and knowledge. 25

Archivists, archival scholars and archival educators seem to agree: archives are, in effect,
evidence of past actions that serve multiple interests through their documentary functions. The
evidentiary value of the record does not change regardless of its form. Extending this
understanding of function over form in the record provides a basic framework within which to
examine archives and performance.

II.C. PERFORMANCE: FORM OVER FUNCTION

The possibility of enabling a more accurate, objective, and accessible memory of live
performance is the primary promise of the performing arts archive. 26
Victor Turner, whose foundational work in the anthropology of ritual, symbols and performance
has inspired myriad scholarly interventions on the converging performative modes of play,
drama and community, asserts that performance is critical to the reproduction of culture and that
life and art will imitate one another according to an essential cultural feedback mechanism which
operates in perpetuity. 27 The discipline of performance studies was institutionally inaugurated by
collaborative efforts between Turner and Richard Schechner, professor of performance studies at
the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. 28 Emerging as academic departments in
the late 1960s, performance studies as a discipline challenges the boundaries of performance in
secularized and industrialized societies and expands the definition of performance to include

such things as oral traditions, rituals, commemorative rites, festivals, carnivals and parades; the
performance studies view of performance explodes the limits of performance to embody all of
humanity’s performative qualities and occasions. The definition of intangible cultural heritage
used by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) echoes
this interpretation of performance; the dissertation also utilizes this expanded definition, i.e.
“performance” is not limited in scope to that which is stageable.
Richard Schechner, professor and editor of The Drama Review: The Journal of
Performance Studies, has written extensively on performance studies—as opposed to the more
bounded term “theater studies”—suggesting that as a discipline, performance studies is based on
the premise that anything can be studied as performance. The methods and tools employed in
performance studies are derived from the social sciences, history, gender studies, psychoanalysis
semiotics, game theory, popular culture studies, and media studies. 29 According to Schechner,
something is performance when,
[A]ccording to the conventions, common usages, or traditions of a
specific culture at a given historical moment, an action or event is
said to be a performance. This expansion was at first driven by a
strong avant-garde and by increasingly sophisticated interactions
between non-Western and Western cultures. Later the expansion
was driven by the emergence of the Internet—with a resulting
blurring of the boundaries between the actual and the virtual,
between so-called art and so-called life. 30
The performing arts, particularly in Western cultures and academic domains, have often
Richard Schechner, “Performance Studies in/for the 21st Century,” Anthropology and Humanism 26,
no.2 (2002): 60. Archival scholar Francesca Marini echoes this sentiment in her article “Archivists,
Librarians and Theatre Research,” Archivaria 63 (2007): 18. Marini links the larger field of
performance studies to activities and events such as circus and political performances and reinforces
Schechner’s belief that performance studies builds on other disciplines such as anthropology and
sociology and is “inherently interdisciplinary.” For more on the interdisciplinary nature of theater and
performance studies, see also Marvin Carlson, “Theatre History: Methodology and Distinctive
Features,” Theatre Research International 20, no. 2 (Summer 1995): 90–96.

been defined as theater, dance and music. Most colleges and universities offer these three options
as majors in their performing arts programs, which is to say that one can be a theater major, a
dance major or a music major. Francesca Marini, Archives Director at the Stratford Shakespeare
Festival, affirms this, noting that “[a]mong others, the two disciplines of theatre studies and
performance studies, which are distinct, although overlapping at times, both look at performance
in its many incarnations. Historically rooted in literary studies, theatre studies developed as an
independent academic discipline throughout the last part of the nineteenth century and over the
course of the twentieth century. Today theatre studies programs exist in universities all over the
world.” 31 As a result, many university archives are familiar with the detritus of these kinds of
performance and have developed systems, which are addressed later in this literature review,
with which to appraise, preserve, represent and arrange provisions of access to those materials. 32
As has been noted, however, the realm of performance studies encompasses much more
than the conventional modes of performance inherent to theater, dance and music; one might
anticipate that archival practices vis-à-vis performance—writ large—could arguably be less
conventional as well. As the shift from theater arts programs to performance studies programs
occurred in the United States, university archivists began to see changes in the kinds of
performance materials making their way into their institutional archives. At the University of
Massachusetts Amherst, for example, collections that address campus performances are no
longer limited in their contents to such things as play scripts, programs, playbills, posters,
promptbooks, stage models, stage plans, costume and prop pieces, libretti, and scores. Rather,

Library Association also offers periodic updates about theater holdings in university archives.

17

with the emergence of the Asian Arts and Culture Program in 1993, campus-sponsored programs
at the university’s Fine Arts Center began to produce programs such as Chinese acrobatics and
traditional puppet plays that leave different kinds of traces of the performed work behind. Now,
large dragon masks and pieces used in traditional tea ceremonies have joined the scripts,
drawings and photographs that formerly comprised the University’s archives of performance.
Archivists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, much like archivists on university
campuses everywhere that have seen an outgrowth in performative genres and styles, have
simply learned to adapt conventional archival methods to these collections, albeit with necessary
adjustments.
Regardless of the need for alternative methods of archival practice, the essential tenets of
performing arts archivy remain the same. Issues of appraisal, representation, preservation,
outreach and access all continue to be pillars of archival theory and practice and provide
fundamental guidelines for performance materials housed in archival repositories. For example,
writing in 2007 about collecting and outreach activities at Dalhousie University, Kathryn Harvey
and Michael Moosberger assert in their article, “Theatre Archives’ Outreach and Core Archival
Functions” that for a strong theater archives, the existence of non-archival reference materials is
just as important to researchers as the collections themselves:
[A]rchivists need to assess their documentary universes and define
levels of acquisition they consider to be appropriate … [This
approach] balances the needs of users against the fact that archives
cannot document everything for everyone. 33
Tangible records of performance have multiple purposes. Some will be factual such as
databases which document an event taking place at a particular place and over a period of time.

Others will attempt to capture the event so others can experience it. When documenting dramatic
periods and events such as demonstrations, battles, and outpourings of grief such as public
funerals, however, how does the archivist capture the mood of the time or reflect what it meant
to take part in or live through such experiences? Can the archivist provide evidence of the past
through the records selected and/or created for posterity, when human experience is inherently
interactive, experiential, and performative? Many artists and theorists reject the notion of fixedform documentation. 34
Australian performing arts librarian Richard Stone asserts that “[c]ommon to all the
performing arts is a progression from creative impulses and inspiration, to preparation and
execution, to the ultimate performances before an audience. At any point of this process objects,
documents and publications are generated. All of them [have] potential for heritage
consideration, for being collected and preserved.” 35 Stone’s essay goes on to raise the question of
how one documents performance, which is itself not an object but an expression of personal or
cultural identity—or, an interaction between artist and audience.
Current archival practice recommends that subsequent to a performance, the work is
“preserved” in various forms: scripts, stage managers’ and assistant directors’ notes, dance
notations, musical scores, costume renderings, set designs, lighting plots, videos, photographs,
sound recordings, posters, playbills, programs, audience and press accounts, and remaining
artifacts such as props and costume pieces. 36 It is these remains that enter the archive, these

36
There is an enormous amount of potential data (including newspaper articles, blogs and press releases)
that documents the holdings of tangible remnants of performance in existing performing arts archives.
Although this manner of documenting performance is typical, this study is primarily concerned with
34

19

traces which must be preserved in a way that characterizes their interrelatedness if these
remnants (what British theater scholar, Matthew Reason, calls the “detritus” of live performance)
are to communicate the “aura” of the original performance. 37 Representations of performance in
archives can be misleading, however. Because performance is an iterative practice, it is not
always clear, for example, if the archival detritus stem from rehearsals or from a specific
performance, or if they simply reflect ideas that were discounted.
Universities and public libraries nonetheless maintain large holdings of performancerelated materials and employ traditional methods of archivy to appraise, preserve, describe and
provide access to these collections. Among the most notable in the United States are the Harvard
Theatre Collection at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the New York Public
Library’s Performing Arts Library. The Harvard Theatre Collection includes documentary
material related to the history of the performing arts including theater, dance, opera and musical
theater. The Harvard Theatre Collection, unlike many other performing arts archives,
foregrounds their collecting interest in other forms of popular entertainment such as magic and
conjuring, music hall and variety, pantomime and extravaganza, puppetry, toy theater, circuses
and menageries, fairgrounds, pageants and outdoor drama, festivals and spectacles, film, and
minstrelsy. Among the materials that fall outside Harvard Theatre Collections collecting scope
contemporary archivy, which has begun to reimagine the boundaries of archives in such a way that new
paradigms for safeguarding or preserving performance are possible. Some of these holdings will be
used as potential data sources (in the Virtual Vaudeville case study, for example, vaudeville archives
will be culled for data; the Katherine Dunham archives will as well). For a more generalized sense of
the holdings of existing performing arts archives, see for example: Kevin Winkler, ed. Their

are items such as actual costumes, stage sets, backdrops, large stage properties and large stage set
models. Because in performance traditions such as Caribbean Pre-Lenten Carnivals these larger
items constitute the tangible record of the performance, it is critical to examine the collecting and
appraisal policies of archives of performance as they are currently written.
The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts houses one of the world’s most
extensive archival collections in the performing arts field, including vaudeville records and a
small collection of the Katherine Dunham Dance Company’s business records. The Library is
known for its large collection of performance-based materials such as historic recordings,
videotapes, autographed manuscripts, correspondence, sheet music, stage designs, press
clippings, programs, posters and photographs. The Library holds a comprehensive dance archive,
stating that it is “part museum, part film production center, and part consulting service to the
professional dance community. It preserves the history of dance by gathering diverse written,
visual, and aural resources, and it works to ensure the art form's continuity through an active
documentation program.” 38 Similarly, the Library holds an extensive music collection with a
curatorial mandate to capture the creative output of contemporary composers as well as an
archive of recorded sound which aims to be a leader in developing technology that allows sound
to be transferred from obsolete to accessible formats.
In addition to university and public archives and libraries, some arts institutions and
performers have chosen alternatives to housing their materials in institutional archives. For
reasons such as those discussed in Marini’s study (the need for ongoing access to materials, for
example), some performing arts groups have opted to maintain their own archives, in-house,
often with the assistance of a trained archivist. Some examples of this are the San Francisco

Ballet, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, all of whom retain
archival materials onsite and employ at least one trained archivist. One exceptional example of
this process in action is the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, which was the life work of
dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham.
Before his death in 2009 at the age of 90, Cunningham developed a “legacy plan” to
preserve the dance work of his company as well as his original choreography. 39 The Legacy
Plan comprises a Legacy Tour, a Digital Preservation plan for Cunningham’s dances, and
arrangements for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s closure and transfer of all Company
materials to the Merce Cunningham Trust. The Legacy Tour commenced in February 2010 with
a two-year celebration of Cunningham’s life’s work and gave international audiences a final
opportunity to see the original dances of Merce Cunningham. Of particular interest is the
creation of what Cunningham called “Digital Dance Capsules,” digitized documentation related
to 86 of Cunningham’s dances. Cunningham’s dance knowledge, largely pulled from the
Cunningham archives, and inclusive of lighting, music, set design, choreography, and costumes
are being systematically described, digitized, and entered into a database for restaging
Cunningham’s work.

The Merce Cunningham Foundation is attempting to preserve

Cunningham’s key works so that “future generations can study and perform these dances with
knowledge of how they originally came to life.” 40
Research by archivists Sarah Jones, Daisy Abbott and Seamus Ross suggests that since
many performers use archives as sources of inspiration for new works, performance records
should be more creative and experimental in nature, focusing on the potential for the artistic

community to reuse documentary records that would otherwise be considered inactive archival
records. Of documenting performance Jones, Abbott and Ross assert that
[t]he temporal nature of performance causes tension: the fear of loss leads to an
urgent desire to counter this through documenting, while the loss inherent in this
process leaves many dissatisfied with the outcome. The representations that are
usually created, such as the photographs and drawings, are often discounted as
inadequate and unfaithful—they provide a window onto an event yet do not
recreate the experience. 41
The characteristics of any given record can provide critical evidence that lends context to
a documented work; the same is true for records of performance, whether they are to be reused,
transmitted or housed for long-term preservation and future access. 42 Matthew Reason, in
questioning the efficacy and validity of the performing arts archive, contends that archivists are
overly concerned with a self-imposed moral imperative to save or rescue the attributes of cultural
heritage and legacy inherent in all of human performance by reducing them to two-dimensional
representations of live arts.
Archival documentation, the message is clear, must be conducted at the center of
creation itself. As you perform you must record, and as you create you must
document. Here it is possible to see the transformation of a valuation of live
performance’s ephemerality into a fear of ephemerality and a subsequent
valuation of documentation and the document.” 43
He further maintains that as a result, the only histories of performance that enjoy persistent
credibility are the records of performances that remain fixed and stagnant in archival
repositories. As is discussed in more detail later in this chapter, the limitations of Reason’s
argument become apparent when engaging with the scholarship of archivists and archival
educators such as Jeannette Bastian. Bastian provides an historical overview of archival custody,

suggesting that access be foregrounded over custody. 44 This postcustodial approach is one that is
arguably more appropriate for event- and performance-based archivy.
Matthew Reason is not alone among his peers, however, in his understanding of the
archives as stagnant. The literature in performance studies that addresses “the archive” can
generally be characterized as either positioning the archive and archivist as sanctioned keepers of
history or as being corporeal, embodied. Diana Taylor, whose book The Archive and the
Repertoire: Performing Cultural Memory in the Americas is a touchstone for scholars interested
in South and Latin American performance, addresses “the archive” in the Derridean sense,
meaning the archive which encompasses the whole of human meaning and memory. 45 Taylor’s
notion of the archive is one that extends to the physical body, whereby performance, or what
Taylor has termed “the repertoire” is, quite literally, an embodied archive. Although Taylor’s
concept of “archive” is not how archivists think of the practical aspects of their work, there is a
small but growing body of literature—particularly in performance studies journals—on the
archive itself as liminal, embodied and performative. 46 Per Taylor, “The live performance can
never be captured or transmitted through the archive;” however, “the archive and the repertoire
[described as ‘embodied memory’, e.g., gestures, movement, orality] have always been
important sources of information [each] exceeding the limitations of the other, in literate and
semiliterate societies. They usually work in tandem and they work alongside other systems of

transmission—the digital and the visual, to name two.” 47 This dissertation challenges Taylor’s
argument and asserts that rather than working in tandem, one following the other, the archive and
the repertoire operate more effectively in concert.
Like Taylor, André Lepecki, Associate Professor in the Department of Performance
Studies at New York University, discusses the corporeal, or embodied, archive in his article,
“The Body as Archive: Will to Re-Enact and the Afterlives of Dances.” For Lepecki, the
question of returning to a dance, or “re-enacting” it, is one that speaks to dance’s ability to
“escape Orpheus’s curse of being frozen in time.” 48 Lepecki introduces a specifically
choreographic “will to archive,” which he establishes as echoing, yet differing from, art critic
and historian Hal Foster’s notion of the “archival impulse” in contemporary art. 49
Despite annual conferences and meetings which focus specifically on archives,
professional organizations—such as the Theater Library Association, the American Society for
Theatre Research and the Congress on Research in Dance—and their members have found no
better solution to event-based archivy than archivists. Two performance studies journals were
established in the United Kingdom during the late 1990s to bring to the forefront issues of
documenting and preserving performance, Performance Practice and Studies in Theatre
Production. These efforts emerged out of both a real and perceived need to record, contextualize,
and share new directions and experiments in performance documentation, and—of equal
importance—to somehow negotiate ways to capture and render eternal an almost wholly

transitory practice. 50 Research conducted from 2002-2005 by Francesca Marini, Archives
Director at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, entitled “Sources and Methodology of Theater
Research in the View of Scholars and Information Professionals,” provided a picture of theater
research from the points of view of theater scholars and of performing arts archivists and
librarians. Marini interviewed scholars and practicing archivists and librarians in Italy, France,
Belgium and the United States. Among Marini’s conclusions was a recognition that performing
arts archivists and librarians must themselves be versed in knowledge creation in performance
disciplines and must also act continuously as researchers themselves. 51
Because Taylor, Lepecki and others have identified “the repertoire” as distinct from “the
archive(s),” their scholarship has created a binary whereby archive and repertoire are necessarily
separate. They have failed to navigate the potential spaces between archive and repertoire
wherein the two may work cooperatively and symbiotically. This dissertation, through careful
examination of instances of both archive and repertoire, traverses and bridges this gap. The
Katherine Dunham case study, in particular, speaks to both archive and repertoire; Dunham,
concerned about cultural inheritances of African-Americans, used modes of transmission
(discussed below) in her dance work. The dances of the African diaspora were intended by
Dunham to survive in the bodies of her dancers. Mapping the space between Dunham’s dance
archives and dancer as archive speaks to potential points of intersection.
This research study is also distinguishable from Francesca Marini’s project, which
addressed theater research specifically. This dissertation is broader in scope in that it concerns
more than research practices in theater arts; rather, the case studies represent dance traditions,

theatrical traditions and the broader performance traditions identified by UNESCO as “intangible
cultural heritage.”
Before the early 20th century, discussions about cultural heritage were restricted to
artifacts, monuments and sites with little or no attention given to the intangible forms cultural
heritage may take. As the significance of human interaction with cultural heritage objects
became more apparent, the language of cultural heritage documents shifted to include
considerations of more ephemeral notions of heritage such as performance. Similarly, the
recognition that intangible forms of cultural heritage merit the same institutional considerations
as tangible cultural heritage expanded the realm of cultural expression considered worthy of
preservation. 52 In 2003, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.
UNESCO’s concept of intangible cultural heritage encompasses oral traditions and expressions;
performing arts; social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practice concerning the
universe and nature; and traditional craftsmanship.
Under the terms of the 2003 Convention, to safeguard intangible cultural heritage is to
continuously recreate and transmit it from one generation to another. The concept of
transmission as it is being used by UNESCO is based in cultural anthropology and comprises the
passing of cultural meaning from one generation to the next. 53 Transmission is one of several
preservation or “safeguarding” methods employed by UNESCO in their strategy to safeguard

Preserving Intangible Heritage,” eJournal USA 15, no. 8 (2010): 5.

This definition of transmission is not intended to be comprehensive. Beyond the automotive definition,
transmission has been used in epidemiology to define the spread of illness; in telecommunications to
describe the transfer of information over distances; and in Buddhism to designate the moment of
spiritual awakening, for example.

intangible cultural heritage such as rituals, festivals, oral traditions and other manifestations of
cultural performance.
Recognizing the risk of cultural obsolescence, UNESCO maintains that safeguarding
intangible cultural heritage is best accomplished through transmission. 54 One component of the
Convention is a mandate that all requests for the inclusion of an intangible cultural heritage
element on the urgent safeguarding list originate from the group or community currently
responsible for the element’s care. 55 One example that crosses social, national and cultural
boundaries is oral traditions and storytelling. Present in nearly every culture in which there has
been a history of orality and/or a strong narrative tradition, stories, legends, folktales, myths,
cultural lessons and ceremonial rites are passed from one generation to the next; most often,
these cultural instruments are never “set” or fixed by inscribing them in textual terms.
Before the advent of the written word, information was stored in bodies, in cultural
memories, and in oral traditions, enacted only in their performances. In his 1982 book Orality
and Literacy historian and philosopher Walter Ong examines the ways in which orality can be
considered a technology. Per Ong, some cultural information is available only in sound, in
bodies and performances, and in fixed, formulaic oral phrasings that act as mnemonic devices or
memory aids. Ong asserts that the knowledge stored in bodies is passed, generation to
generation, through performance. Ong maintains that the way a culture stores and retrieves its
important information is intricately tied to how individuals in that culture think. Most cultures of
the world are oral cultures. Ong notes that of tens of thousands of languages spoken across the

This emphasis should not negate the reality that UNESCO still finds value in partnering with local
archives and other memory institutions to safeguard the tangible detritus of intangible cultural heritage,
much in keeping with Western archival traditions around performing arts archivy.

world, only 106 have written forms. 56 In oral cultures, words hold power: “The spoken word is
always an event.” 57
One quality of oral traditions is their lack of textual fixity. Fixity, or permanence, is a
core archival concept. However, writing on the idea of “permanence” in archives in 1989,
historian James O’Toole suggests that by
emphasizing certain characteristics that enhanced the memory—
the use of formulaic language and rhythm; the embodiment in
ritual of important stories, values, and pieces of information; the
association of physical objects with certain events; the reliance on
social and interpersonal communication of things to be
remembered — all oral cultures, even those that survived into the
twentieth century, achieved a degree of permanence in what they
knew, preserved, and handed on to the indefinite future. Some
degree of timelessness was achievable in such cultures: a kind of
permanence was possible. 58
Modern information science is still grappling with utterance as mode of information
transfer and has proffered, via Deborah Turner, Assistant Professor at the iSchool at Drexel
University, the concept of an oral document. To arrive at this concept, Turner turns to the work
of Milman Parry (founder of oral tradition studies) who demonstrates that Homer's poetry,
previously thought to be based in literate traditions, arose from works that survived orally for
generations prior to being fixed in print. An oral document, per Turner, is a type of document
that incorporates evidence or information made available in what is said (content) and by how it
is uttered (structure). 59 Where content analysis and conversation analysis involve analyzing turns

in talk, the technique used to identify oral documents involves determining what evidence an
utterance retains of the practices used to create or maintain it.
The process of identifying an oral document specifically involves determining whether an
utterance incorporates any of the following six properties:
•
•
•
•
•
•

materiality: practices that give a document substance or weight;
institutionalization: practices that help a document perpetuate a context;
social discipline: practices involving training and oversight that surround a document;
historicity: practices that ensure a document's relevance over time;
structure: practices that inform the order in which information within a document is
conveyed; and,
boundaries: practices used to help mark the document's beginning and end. 60
Four approaches to analyzing utterance encourage the exploration of new ways that

information scientists can contend with oral information. Content analysis facilitates the
articulation of intentions, meaning and values evident within contributions to a discourse made in
oral (or written or another) media. Discourse analysis aids in understanding what ideology,
rhetoric and similar phenomena are reflected in utterances that are not routine or not a part of
daily life. By contrast, conversation analysis suggests that every day or routine talk manifests and
perpetuates these phenomena. Finally, the research strategy used to identify oral documents
demonstrates that practices shaping oral information can produce an oral artifact. 61
Jeannette Bastian, well-versed in the preservation of cultural meaning where issues of
cultural performance and archivy are concerned, uses the record attributes prescribed by
contemporary archival theory of structure, content and context in conjunction with Michael
Buckland’s non-textual definition of documents to support a theoretical framework that allows
for performed cultural events (such as pre-Lenten Carnival celebrations in Central America and

the West Indies) to be signifying objects and, by extension, documents. 62 This argument suggests
that the evidential nature of a document supersedes its need to be text-based. 63 Carnival is
therefore presented by Bastian as an archival “document” – through the lens of a cultural
production replete with context, structure and content. Carnival, like other performances, in its
purest and most authentic living and temporal form cannot be permanently fixed in boxes or on
shelves. 64
Similarly, scholars writing on Mesoamerican recordkeeping have drawn attention to the
missed opportunities for cultural understanding that occur through privileging strictly
alphanumeric, text-based records in archives. 65 Mesoamerican written culture comprised
pictographs, ideographs and logographs; it represents, in its essence, a system of recording
information based on images. In his 1994 writing on text and bodies, John Monaghan, professor
of anthropology at the University of Illinois Chicago, asserts that anthropologists view the
Mesoamerican codices not only as archival documents, but as scripts to be performed. Songs in
the Mesoamerican tradition were composed to transmit historical tales of events such as feasts

and battles as well as reconstructing elite genealogies. 66 These “scripts” do not work in isolation,
however, lending credence to the idea that marrying the archive with the repertoire preserves
both tangible records and embodied practices as evidence of human information culture.
Recognizing limitations in the existing tenets of archival science has encouraged new
paradigms in archival theory and practice where issues of performance are concerned. Because
UNESCO’s methods focus so heavily on transmission, it is worth noting that many forms of
cultural performance and expression beyond the North American continent do not translate to
scripted theater or dance and musical notation; UNESCO’s approach to the safeguarding of
performance traditions stands in contrast to the performing arts archives discussed earlier in this
literature review. Because the UNESCO methods articulated above are notably different from
those employed for protecting tangible heritage, the UNESCO case study provides a perspective
complementary to the Katherine Dunham archives. Historically, the preservation of tangible
heritage has been conducted in brick and mortar archives in the custody of trained archivists.
There are two overlapping areas, however, between the UNESCO model and the conventional
archive. The first is the recognition by UNESCO and other cultural organizations that some
tangible elements are often associated with intangible cultural heritage. The 2003 Convention,
therefore, includes in its definition of intangible cultural heritage the “instruments, objects,
artifacts and cultural spaces” associated with the intangible cultural heritage which are preserved
in institutional archives. The second area of commonality can be found in the aforementioned
traditions of performing arts archivy. Traditional archives that are called upon to preserve
records of ephemeral and temporal events continue to grapple with similar issues as those who

66

32

seek to safeguard, through transmission and other means, intangible cultural heritage as defined
by UNESCO. 67
UNESCO’s model is only one possible solution. Archivists might also consider issues of
custody in event-based archivy. The records and information management profession provides a
deep body of literature on non-custodial relationships with records creators.

II.D. STEWARDSHIP: MAINTAINING FORM AND FUNCTION

In the past thirty years, discussions have appeared in the archival literature concerning shifting
views on maintaining the custody of and provisions of access to archival records. In the records
and information management profession, issues of custody are often linked to litigious concerns
(such as an “auditable chain of custody” in cases of eDiscovery). 68 In diplomatics, concerns
about the authenticity of the record are also linked to custody. From the earliest days of
formalized archival practice, a direct chain of custody from records creator to archives was
carefully established, documented and maintained. The archival principle of provenance was
considered the primary means of preserving evidence of the functional relationships between
records that were created, maintained, and transmitted to the archives as a unified whole. That

eDiscovery is a legal and records management term that refers to electronic discovery requirements
during lawsuits. Records management journals such as Information Management Journal and white
papers published by ARMA, the professional association for records and information managers, provide
up-to-date content on eDiscovery rules and regulations.

body of records was also designated as separate from those of other creators in an effort to
maintain their contextual information: the framework in which they were created and used.
The custodial role of the archivist in the United States has some of its roots in the
formation of the National Archives. In 1877 a Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
appointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes, suggested constructing a building designed
specifically for the centralized storage of inactive government records. The proposed “hall of
records” was intended to operate as a storage facility to house these records. The plan was for the
records to remain the property of their originating offices; they would not be available for
research outside the originating office. Between 1906 and 1911, historian J. Franklin Jameson
began working to change the proposed hall of records into a “national archives.” This new
nomenclature reflected Jameson’s view that originating offices should surrender intellectual and
physical custody of their inactive records and that procedures should be designed to permit future
use of government records without oversight from the office of origin. 69
Shifting trends in archival theory, however, suggest that archival principles such as
original order, respect des fonds, and the chain of provenancial custody, intended to guarantee
the authenticity and reliability of the record, have now come to be considered “historically
contingent, not universal or absolute.” 70 As early as 1981, F. Gerald Ham, writing for the
American Archivist noted that archivists have long been concerned with the uniqueness of the
materials in their care and have taken very seriously the call to preserve the materials in their

custody. 71 Ham goes on to argue, however, against fully custodial roles for archives. Although
Ham’s main contentions with custody had more to do with what he foresaw as emerging
technological trends and a vast overabundance of materials over which to try to maintain
(responsible) custody, aspects of his argument ring true for contemporary archives of
performance. Ham writes,
[Archives] now realize they must encourage and assist other
institutions and organizations such as local historical societies,
public libraries, municipalities, voluntary associations, businesses,
and so forth, to share this responsibility. In effect, they must
encourage planned proliferation and decentralization … [A]rchival
centers have begun to accept this role, limiting their accessions
program and enlarging their program of extension services. The
dynamic new role has many facets. One is that of an archival
service center providing traditional services in a new cooperative
setting … [which] might include cooperative purchasing of
supplies … records survey and appraisal, and records processing. 72
Ham supported the notion of “private” archives wherein corporations took responsibility for
maintaining their own records. The corporate archives model is one that we take for granted in
today’s archives and records management environments. Ham’s vision is not too far afield of
modern archival theory; both archival scholar Jeannette Bastian and Francesca Marini, Archives
Director at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, advocate postcustodial models for archivists
working with archival materials from community-based performance practices. 73 Marini’s
previously discussed 2002-2005 study found that,

Depending on the characteristics of the archives and libraries in
which they work, archivists and librarians described varying
degrees of control over the sources held. For example, stronger
control is possible when the sources are no longer in use by their
creators, compared to the theatres and festivals where materials get
consulted or reused for new productions and, in some cases, never
entirely cease to be active. In working theatres, conflicts may arise
between the archives and the different departments, which do not
always transfer what they should, or return materials requested for
internal exhibitions, in a timely manner. Active theatres and
festivals are often more focused on day-to-day operations. In these
cases, archives are not a priority, resulting, at times, in inadequate
support and missed opportunities. 74
Similarly, international archival scholars have suggested post-custodial archival roles for
indigenous and aboriginal materials which may be culturally sensitive or require unique access
provisions. Internationally, Canadian archives have adopted a more proactive approach to
indigenous collections while still retaining exclusive control and custody of the vast majority of
records and artifacts; they have developed consultation services and involve Aboriginal peoples
in decisions about the handling of culturally sensitive artifacts. Requests for the repatriation of a
limited array of objects and human remains have been considered. Canadian legislation has yet
to embrace a fully inclusive approach toward Aboriginal involvement, however. A true comanagement of archival materials does not yet seem to exist, although New Zealand is also
moving in that direction. 75
A 1999 article published in Archivaria echoes the idea of loosening the custodial control
of records as one way to better serve the needs of researchers. Past-SAA President Timothy L.

Paschild offers a cautionary tale about resource management in community archives projects in,

Ericson and University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Archivist, Joshua Ranger, advocate for loaning
archival collections in their article, “'The Next Great Idea': Loaning Archival Collections.” 76
Using the University of Wisconsin’s longstanding archival interlending program as an example,
Ericson and Ranger assert that:
University archivists have built strong programs around their
ability to benefit undergraduates, graduate students, faculty,
administrators, and other researchers by bringing together critical
masses of primary resources pertaining to a variety of chosen
topics. Among other benefits, the ability to borrow archival
collections from neighboring institutions has dulled the
competitive zeal that some archivists instinctively feel regarding
acquisitions, and has laid the groundwork for cooperative efforts in
user services that would otherwise be impossible. 77
Finally, concerns have been raised in the archival discourse around stewardship and digital
records. 78 The earliest and most outspoken critic of archival custody in the virtual environment
was David Bearman, a museum professional who served as Deputy Director of the Office of
Resource Management at the Smithsonian in the mid-1980s. Bearman’s critique of custody
maintained that the ongoing costs of managing digital records was unsustainable given the
available resources of most archival programs and that management of digital records by creators
would ensure that the original remained fully functional and accessible. 79 Australian archivists

were also quick to embrace a post- or non-custodial model, seeking to integrate archival and
records management functions in the early 1990s. 80
As digital scholarship (D-scholarship) projects become more prolific, one might anticipate a
similar shift in the discourse to address issues of stewardship and large-scale digital projects, and
the resulting “big data.” The creation of the Virtual Vaudeville prototype was supported by
tremendous amounts of data and in turn, was also the source of much data. Because one of the
guiding questions for the Virtual Vaudeville prototype design was, “Is it possible to archive a
live performance?,” the case offers an opportunity to explore these emerging issues of
representation and custody in digital humanities environment. 81

II.E. CONCLUSION

Whether the archival model adheres to a conventional custodial trajectory, follows a less
conventional non- or post-custodial path, is corporeal or embodied, mimics UNESCO’s
transmission model, or some combination therein, archivists are still determining the best
methods of fixing ephemeral events and other expressions of intangible cultural heritage. The
literature discussed above examines both the need to preserve performance and existing methods
of doing so. The reviewed literature suggests a variety of beliefs and knowledge practices where
event-based archivy is concerned. Despite these variations, there is currently no perfect system.
Many who work with intangible cultural heritage have expressed concern over the privileging of

text-based and other tangible forms of cultural heritage in archives. Others are concerned about
issues of custody and access. Because of the ephemerality of the intangible record, new ways of
thinking are necessary to address gaps and vagaries in the archival corpus that are the result of
textual privilege and archival custody. The dissertation project examines the extant frameworks
and foundations of archival theory and practice for intangible cultural heritage and offers
potential new frameworks for future work in this area.

III. METHODOLOGY

The adequacy of a research method depends on the purpose of the research and the questions
being asked. For some, the choice of method is both political and moral; critics of quantitative
methods, for example, have rejected the idea of turning people into numbers, preferring instead
to rely upon qualitative methods. 82 The decision to engage in a qualitative study of archives and
performance stems primarily from the human endeavor that performance requires. In a study
such as this one, it is critical to elucidate the meaning behind human decisions, rather than to
simply note quantitatively that a decision was made.
Although quantitative research methods provide raw data and experimental designs tend
to yield comparison data, neither quantitative research nor experimental design uncover the
“why” behind the quantitative data. Because this study asks, in part, about the need for
theoretical or practical shifts in performance-based archivy, analyzing why and how tangible
representations are selected as placeholders for ephemeral events is arguably more important
than stating quantitatively, for example, that scripts are present in a significant percentage of
theatrical collections. While it may be clear from a quantitative study (such as a survey
instrument) that only tangible artifacts are preserved in archives, interview data from a

Sciences (Beverly Hills: Sage, 1981) and Brian Fay, Critical Social Science: Liberation and Its Limits
(Ithaca: Cornell, 1987).

40

qualitative study offers instead theoretical alternatives to traditional archivy through a more
holistic examination of the issues and concerns of stakeholders.

III.A. CASE STUDY RESEARCH

Many of the variables that interest social scientists such as democracy, power and political
culture are difficult to measure because, for example, a process that is “democratic” in one
cultural context may be decidedly undemocratic in another. Achieving a deeper understanding of
processes and other conceptual variables is considered the principal objective of case study
research. 83 Case study research is optimal for studies where surveys and experimental designs
fall short of explaining an existing phenomenon, such as the archival tendency to reduce a
performance to its tangible artifacts. For this dissertation, case study research provides an
opportunity for “an intensive, holistic description and analysis of a single … phenomenon.” 84
Case study research is one of several qualitative methods that allow investigators to
identify and measure the indicators that best represent culturally sensitive theoretical concepts
(ethnography is another example). 85 Because performance is often categorized as cultural
expression, this methodology allows for cultural meaning to be a consideration in analysis and
reporting. As an inquiry that focuses on understanding individual processes, organizations and
cultures, case study emerges as an appropriate method because each of the cases selected for this

study are based in different cultural traditions. 86 The case of the United Nations Education,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of
Intangible Cultural Heritage, for example, is rooted in protecting cultural practices, as is the
Katherine Dunham case. The Virtual Vaudeville case is similarly culture-oriented as vaudeville
was considered both a theatrical and cultural movement. The Virtual Vaudeville and UNESCO
cases also stand as process-oriented case; they are examples of what results from collaborative
efforts among scholars from multiple disciplines.
This research study was approached through collective and comparative case study
methods. A collective case study involves reviewing a collection of similar cases to determine
trends, issues, or problems. Each of the three cases selected for this study yielded comparable
data points. Text-based, tangible artifacts such as scripts and notations, publicity materials,
policy documents, contracts and agreements, oral histories and other recordings comprise a
significant amount of the data sources for this research, elaborated and reinforced by data
obtained from informal and informational interviews. Finally, a comparative analysis (i.e.
comparing data across the three cases) strengthens the reliability, validity and generalizability of
the research. 87 In deploying collective case study methods for this project, collected data was
analyzed independently and then synthesized to identify commonalities among the three cases.

suggested more than a dozen strategies for deciding upon a sampling method, the most common
sampling involves selecting critical cases, extreme cases, typical cases and varied cases. The
power of purposeful sampling, particularly for this study, lies in selecting information-rich cases
for in-depth study. 88 The cases selected for this study were chosen because of their unique
performative attributes. Each case represents a performance tradition based in a particular culture
or cultural movement. The cases also present approaches to permanence that combine traditional
archivy with modes of information transmission and reception, whether that transmission takes
place between and among humans or occurs digitally. These cases suggest three distinct ways
that archives might function as keepers of intangible cultural heritage as well as revealing
attributes of traditional archivy that do not work as well when working with performed works.
The three cases selected for this study are:

III.B.1. The Live Performance Simulation System: Virtual Vaudeville Prototype

The Virtual Vaudeville project is a prototype of the Live Performance Simulation System. The
product of collaboration among a diverse group of United States scholars including computer
scientists, 3D modelers and animators, theater practitioners and historians of both theater and
music, the prototype is a single-user 3D computer game that allows users to enter a virtual
theatre to watch a simulated performance. The Virtual Vaudeville project team attempted to use
digital technologies to answer the question: “Is it possible to archive a live performance?” Using
motion capture technology, 3D animation and human actors, the project aimed to represent an
historical performance tradition using a virtual reality environment to simulate the experience of

attending a live performance. Virtual Vaudeville scholars were, in part, testing hypotheses about
historical performance practices and engaging with historical performance traditions as
performance (rather than through the mediation of scripted theater or film).
The Virtual Vaudeville case is extreme in its grounding in the digital humanities; few
performance-based artistic communities have attempted to document or preserve their work in a
digital or digitized arena. While it is also typical in its use of traditional performing arts archives
(culling theatrical materials from archives such as scripts, playbills, newspaper clippings and
photographs from the American vaudeville era, ca. 1880-1930) to support the creation of the
prototype, what makes this case particularly compelling is the conflation of traditional archivy
with the digital humanities to address preservation concerns.

III.B.2. The Katherine Dunham Archives and the Dunham Technique

Katherine Dunham (1909-2006) revolutionized American dance in the 1930s by combining
ritual-based Afro-Caribbean dance styles with her training in classical ballet. In 1935, as a
graduate student in anthropology at the University of Chicago, Dunham accepted a grant to
travel to Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique and Trinidad to study the dances of the West Indies. Dunham
is widely regarded as a pioneer of the anthropological dance movement and is credited with
bringing African, Caribbean and Brazilian dance styles to a then Eurocentric dance canon. 89 By
1940 she had also founded the Dunham Dance Company and had begun developing a repertoire
which combined her interpretations of Caribbean dances, traditional ballet, African rituals and

African American rhythms to create a dance pedagogy known as The Dunham Technique.90
Dunham continued to expand her choreography and refine The Dunham Technique transmitting
dance knowledge to several generations of dancers before her death in 2006.

III.B.3. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s 2003
Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage

UNESCO’s concept of intangible cultural heritage encompasses: oral traditions and expressions;
performing arts; social practices; rituals; festive events; knowledge and practice concerning the
universe and nature; and traditional craftsmanship. UNESCO has indicated a commitment to
safeguarding intangible cultural heritage through conventional archival means as well as through
modes of transmission. UNESCO’s Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural
Heritage (outlined below) and its related materials are a current and concrete example of how
transmission and archivy work together on an international and organizational level. In 2003,
UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, with
four stated purposes:
1) to safeguard the [world’s] intangible cultural heritage;
2) to ensure respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the communities, groups and
individuals concerned;
3) to raise awareness at the local, national and international levels of the importance of
the intangible cultural heritage, and of ensuring mutual appreciation thereof; and
4) to provide for international cooperation and assistance. 91

The 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage is the only existing
international document of its kind. It has been ratified by 161 nations (excluding the United

States and the United Kingdom), most recently the Bahamas in May 2014.
Three countries were selected for close reading in the UNESCO case study: Belgium,
Canada (specifically the province of Newfoundland and Labrador), and Trinidad and Tobago.
These countries were selected in part because of geographic dispersion and in part because of
their willingness to participate in the study. Each nation offers a distinctive view of the
Convention, UNESCO politics and policies, the relative benefits of ratifying the Convention and
how the Convention is deployed. At the same time, these three nations, considered collectively,
offer a broad view of the Convention and the global stage on which it operates.

III.C. DATA COLLECTION

Data for this study was collected from observation, interviews and unobtrusive data sources such
as archival and institutional records. The observational data for this study is primarily comprised
of unstructured direct observations and site visits: unstructured observations involved observing
physical facilities and professional practices. Site visits provided the opportunity to conduct both
interviews and unstructured observations, such as in Trinidad and Tobago where traditional
Divali celebrations were underway at the time of the research visit.
Data collection for the Virtual Vaudeville case study included four interviews, three of
which were conducted in person: Bruce McConachie, Professor of Theatre at the University of
Pittsburgh, David Saltz, Principle Investigator and Associate Professor of Theatre at the
University of Georgia, and a former grant reviewer from the National Science Foundation who
participated in the study on the condition of anonymity. One interview was conducted via
telephone with Susan Kattwinkel, Associate Professor of Theatre at College of Charleston.
46

Observational data also provided evidence for the Virtual Vaudeville case; a site visit to Atlanta,
GA to interview David Saltz allowed the researcher to view and better understand the multiple
technological apparatus used to create the prototype (explained in detail in Chapter IV).
Additionally, the case study calls on data from internal project documents provided by Saltz and
the original project proposal which was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The Virtual Vaudeville Prototype and
secondary sources completed the dataset for the Virtual Vaudeville case.
Similarly, the Katherine Dunham archives were used for observational and unobtrusive
data. The Katherine Dunham Archives are comprised of the Katherine Dunham Collection at the
Library of Congress, The Katherine Dunham Papers, 1919-1968 at Southern Illinois University,
and the Katherine Dunham Correspondence, Contracts and Interviews at New York Public
Library. The Katherine Dunham Collection at the Library of Congress is a collection of 1,694
still and moving images that document Dunham’s career including her early anthropological
explorations in the 1930s, her work as a choreographer, her dance technique and teaching
method, performances and her anthropological analysis of the dances and rituals of the African
diaspora. 92 The moving images include ethnographic footage collected by Dunham of vodoun
rituals and other dance forms. The Dunham Technique is captured on several videotapes in the
collection, demonstrating Dunham’s teaching style and providing a glimpse into her methods of
transmitting dance knowledge. Many of the images (both still and moving) are available for
remote viewing online.
The Katherine Dunham Papers at Southern Illinois University are comprised of 50 cubic
feet of correspondence, writings, scripts, notes on dance techniques, and musical scores.

47

Although personal correspondence comprises the bulk of the collection, some of Dunham’s
anthropological dance notes are also among the Papers. The Performing Arts Library at New
York Public Library (NYPL) holds a small collection of Katherine Dunham’s correspondence,
contracts and interviews among their Performing Arts Research Collections. Additional Dunham
materials are held in the Jerome Robbins Dance Division of NYPL and can be found in the
papers of her devotees, Lavinia Williams (Lavinia Williams Papers, 1940-1989) and Dr. Glory
Van Scott (Glory Van Scott Collection, 1974-2000) as well as in the American Ballet Theatre
Archives.
In addition to the primary and observational data, three interviews with former Dunham
dancers/current Dunham instructors and one informal interview with a Dunham archivist
completed data collection for this case. Ron Hutson, Dunham Dance Instructor at Point Park
University, Dr. Albirda Rose, co-founder of the Institute for Dunham Certification, Dr. Halifu
Osumare, co-founder of the Institute for Dunham certification and Southern Illinois University
archivist Matthew Gorzalski provided critical interview and correspondence data. Historical
newspapers and secondary sources completed the data for the Dunham case.
The data collected for Chapter Six, UNESCO’s Convention for the Safeguarding of
Intangible Cultural Heritage, was culled from interviews with cultural heritage workers and
documents related to the Convention. Interviews were conducted in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad in
November 2013 with Alicia Blake and other representatives from the Ministry of the Arts and
Multiculturalism and culture-bearers from Trinidad and Tobago including Omela Reid and
Lutalo Massimba (a.k.a. Brother Resistance). Colleen Quigley, archivist at Memorial University
of Newfoundland was interviewed in New Orleans, Louisiana at the Society of American
Archivists annual meeting while Intangible Cultural Heritage Development Officer for the
48

province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Dale Jarvis, participated in a telephone interview.
Additional data came from email correspondence and documents obtained directly from
UNESCO officers in Trinidad and Tobago and Belgium; the 2003 Convention for the
Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage and other supporting documents from UNESCO;
recordings of ICH elements from UNESCO; historical newspapers; and secondary sources.
Interviews for this study serve as a complimentary method to other methods in the
evaluation process; as suggested above, interviews provide crucial data in addition to clarifying
other data. Informal and informational interviews were conducted with people involved in each
case. Unobtrusive data, or data that originates from objects rather than people, were used both as
a data source and to corroborate observational and interview data. Non-textual sources such as
recordings of Katherine Dunham’s technique, dance classes, fieldwork in the Caribbean, oral
histories and video documentation of intangible cultural heritage safeguarded through
UNESCO’s 2003 Convention also provided sources of robust data.
Data collection resulted in complementary field notes which were coded for analysis. Points
of comparison across the three cases, such as interview data and data from text-based primary
source materials, provided a context within which to analyze existing frameworks for preserving
event-based cultural heritage, thus addressing the primary research question: What can a case
study of three existing approaches to performance archivy reveal about the archival role in
safeguarding and/or preserving event-based cultural heritage? The second question, How do
existing archival theories and practices need to shift to more effectively attend to event-based
cultural heritage?, is addressed directly in the cross-case analysis. Through identifying instances
where archives have succeeded and/or failed to produce a satisfactory record of performance, the
cross-case analysis highlights three areas of comparative study.
49

III.D. DATA ANALYSIS

Professor Emeritus of Education at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Robert E.
Stake, observes that quantitative and qualitative methods differ most at the stage of data
analysis. 93 Qualitative researchers are involved with analysis throughout the study while
quantitative researchers build their research on the statistical significance of one test or a
collection of statistical data. In qualitative research, a good narrative description of the findings
and a careful analysis of the data collection and coding are considered enough to replace the
statistical findings in a quantitative study.
A cross-case analysis, such as the one applied in this study, focuses on common
themes. 94 Considering multiple cases in multiple settings enhances generalizability; for this
reason, three varied cases were selected for this study. In addition to concerns about
generalizability, cross-case analysis allows for assertions and causative interpretations. Through
cross-case analysis, explanations for trends or patterns that may emerge from these varied cases
can be examined in different configurations. 95 The cross-case analysis for this study began with
the raw data, followed by case-by-case analysis. Using data from all three cases, themes were
developed to more effectively and efficiently organize data. These themes were derived from the
data set itself.

Coding is assigning abbreviated designations to collected data. As is standard for
qualitative case study research, coding for this study occured at two levels: identifying
information about the data and selecting interpretive constructs related to the analysis of the
data. 96 Professor of Adult and Continuing Education at the University of Georgia, Sharan B.
Merriam asserts that category construction is tantamount to data analysis. It was therefore critical
to establish codes and categories early in the study for purposes of consistency. Themes or
categories from the relevant literature formed the basis of some codes, but “in vivo codes,”
words or themes derived directly from the data set, were the primary codes used. 97 Two
commonly used frameworks for coding are grounded theory and analytical induction. Grounded
theory was used for this research project.
Grounded theory pioneer, Barney Glaser, and other grounded theorists have contended
that slices of data from many different sources are much more compelling than data from one
source. 98 Grounded theory involves constantly comparing themes within the data from
interviews, observations, narrative data and note-taking. Unlike empirical data, grounded theory
emerges as the case or evaluation unfolds in a naturalistic fashion. 99 Grounded theory involves
using open coding and line-by-line analysis to dissect the data while looking for emerging
themes.
To address the research question of the role of contemporary archives in event-based
archivy, it was critical to understand and analyze the actions of both archivists and performers
both within the context of records creation and in regard to strategies for performance

documentation and preservation. Open coding as a mode of analysis separated this data into
discrete parts, while axial coding collated the data by making connections between themes or
categories. 100 Axial coding as a strategy for data analysis aided in identifying relationships
among separate pieces of data and focused on conditions such as the context, actions, strategies,
and consequences of actions. 101 Both open coding and axial coding were useful in this study in
analyzing each case independently and comparing data across cases.

III.E. VALIDITY, RELIABILITY, REPLICATION

Social science research specialist Robert K. Yin recommends using multiple sources of evidence
to establish a chain of evidence to construct validity. 102 Yin further suggests maintaining a chain
of evidence to increase the reliability of the case study. This chain of evidence helps to ensure
quality control throughout the evaluation of the program or case. 103 The chain of evidence in this
research study began with the research questions and ends with the case study report (this
dissertation). The research questions have defined and dictated the case study protocols
previously outlined. 104 Data collection and analysis were supported by the creation and
maintenance of a database in the form of an Excel workbook, from which the foundation for the
dissertation narrative emerged.

Some researchers have argued that replicability is not possible because of real world
changes and the uniqueness of individuals. Catherine Marshall and Gretchen B. Rossman
conclude in their 2006 text Designing Qualitative Research (4th edition), that researchers should
allow others to inspect their procedures, protocols, and decisions by keeping all collected data in
well-organized, retrievable formats. 105 The data for this study was maintained in a Microsoft
Excel workbook and can be produced upon request. This research study addressed concerns
about replicability through ongoing communication with interview subjects as well as providing
transparency about procedures, protocols and decisions through dissertation committee
oversight.

III.F. LIMITATIONS

All research studies have limitations. Limitations are the characteristics of design or
methodology that impact or influence the application and/or interpretation of the results of the
study. Because the researcher is the primary instrument of data collection and analysis,
qualitative case studies are most often limited by the sensitivity and integrity of the investigator.
Sample size and generalizability are two additional potential limitations of case study
research. Although the sample size for this study is limited to three cases, it was still possible to
cull meaningful data. Any conclusions drawn from this study could be said to represent the
behavior of one group at one particular moment in time; concerns were therefore addressed by
the scope of each case study. For example, the UNESCO case study offers an array of instances

of global intangible cultural heritage being safeguarded, from which a purposeful selection of
several differing examples were made. In addition to a close reading of three nations’
interpretations of the Convention, the chapter also provides examples from other countries in an
effort to proffer a view of the Convention that offers both depth and breadth.
No causal conclusions have been drawn from this research because it was impossible to
rule out alternative explanations for any observed phenomena. For example, because the Virtual
Vaudeville project is no longer active, there was an opportunity to discuss why it was shortlived; no direct causal conclusions have been drawn about the pro tem nature of the project,
however, because the timeframe and the scope of this research study did not allow for all
possible explanations to be examined in detail.
Finally, the scarcity of significant prior research on the subject of archives and
performance or archives and intangible cultural heritage means there is only a limited foundation
on which to build an understanding of the research problem. This limitation was addressed by
examining related research in archival theory and practice as well as existing research in other
fields as was appropriate.

IV.

THE LIVE PERFORMANCE SIMULATION SYSTEM:
THE VIRTUAL VAUDEVILLE PROTOTYPE

This chapter examines how archives of performance were used to support the creation of the
Live Performance Simulation System’s Virtual Vaudeville prototype and explores the
applicability of existing archival theory and practice for scholars reconstructing historical
performances in digital environments. Finally, the chapter considers the efficacy of endeavors
such as the Virtual Vaudeville project as future models for archives and archivists who strive to
help societies safeguard performed events as cultural heritage.
The chapter therefore provides brief historical context for vaudeville as a mode of
performance at the turn of the 20th century; discusses the Virtual Vaudeville Prototype and the
archival evidence upon which it was built; and finally, unpacks the Virtual Vaudeville prototype
as both an evidence-based project fashioned from archival research and as an archival record.
The case study employs data from an array of internal project documents including the
original project proposal which was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request from the National Science Foundation (NSF); interviews with four key project
participants including the Principle Investigator, David Saltz, and an NSF project manager
familiar with the project and its funding history; the Virtual Vaudeville Prototype itself; and
secondary sources.

55

IV.A. BACKGROUND

This case study investigates one early digital humanities project that sought to revolutionize
present-day representations of past performances by moving an historical performance into a
digital environment. The objective of the Virtual Vaudeville project was to use digital
technology to address a problem fundamental to performance scholarship and pedagogy: how to
represent and communicate the phenomenon of live performance using media. For the project
team, this problem was especially pressing because the goal was to represent a performance
tradition from the past. 106
One strategy to address the problem of representing historical performance traditions has
been to build physical reconstructions of historic spaces and to stage performances in them, such
as with London’s famous Globe Theatre reconstruction. This solution, however, requires an
unsustainable investment of money and land, and is feasible in only a limited number of cases.107
As David Saltz asserts in the Virtual Vaudeville project description, "[P]hysical reconstructions
are available only to people at one geographic location, and they implement only one
interpretation and so cannot be used to evaluate conflicting scholarly interpretations of the
historical evidence." 108 Another mode that has been employed to represent historical
performance traditions has been to collocate printed archival detritus, thereby creating a
performance-specific archive. For example, the Annenberg/Corporation for Public Broadcasting
Multimedia Collection created a CD-ROM containing documents pertaining to Henrick Ibsen's
play A Doll's House. Although the disk contains video clips of filmed performances, documents

written by Ibsen, and sketches of costume and set designs, no attempt was made to recreate what
an original performance would have looked like. 109 Finally, a third strategy that has been
employed to represent historical performance traditions is the virtual recreation of theatrical
spaces such as the Chestnut Street Theatre Project, spearheaded by University of Washington
professor Jack Wolcott. The Chestnut Street Theatre Project recreates the Chestnut Street
Theatre in Philadelphia in the 18th century. 110 The interior drawings are impressive and viewers
enjoy an impression of what the theatre looked like from multiple angles. Again, there is no
attempt to recreate an actual performance within this virtual environment. 111
The Live Performance Simulation System’s Virtual Vaudeville prototype was conceived
as a response to the problem of performing arts archivy. The product of collaboration among a
diverse group of United States scholars including computer scientists, 3D modelers and
animators, theater practitioners and historians of both theater and music, the prototype is a
single-user 3D computer game that allows users to enter a virtual theatre to watch a simulated
performance. Initiated in 2001, the project sought to use digital technologies to answer the
question: “Is it possible to archive a live performance?” Using motion capture technology,
artificial intelligence techniques, a 3D game engine and a human actor, the project aimed to
represent an historical performance tradition using a virtual reality environment to fully simulate
the experience of attending a live performance. These scholars sought to proffer an archive of
experience, one that would incorporate elements of sight and sound in addition to the
interactivity of a live audience. Scholars immersed in the Virtual Vaudeville project were, in

part, testing hypotheses about historical performance practices and engaging with historical
performance traditions as performance (rather than through the mediation of scripted theater or
film).
The Virtual Vaudeville Project aimed to test the potential of virtual environments to
provide high-quality theater experiences to remote audiences. One objective of Virtual
Vaudeville was to simulate a feeling of “liveness” in a virtual theatre: the “sensation of being
surrounded by human activity onstage, in the audience and backstage, and the ability to choose
where to look at any given time (onstage or off) and to move within the environment.” 112 In what
was a radical departure from existing methods, the Virtual Vaudeville team proposed using
motion capture technology to capture real-world performances by professional, highly skilled
actors, singers, dancers, acrobats and musicians, thus recreating an historical performance for a
digital environment. In so doing, they hoped to make important advances in the design and
implementation of virtual environments, advances which would build on prior successes in
creating photo-realistic simulations of real 3D environments by introducing a large quantity of
complex human performance data. Virtual Vaudeville was intended to constitute an invaluable
work of applied scholarship and provide an “unprecedented resource for visualizing past
performances and testing hypotheses about historical performance practices.” 113
The long-term goal of Virtual Vaudeville, then, was to develop a flexible set of
techniques and technologies that scholars and theatre practitioners could use to simulate a wide

Saltz, “Virtual Vaudeville: Project Summary.”
David Saltz, “Virtual Vaudeville: A Digital Simulation of Virtual Theatre,” (PowerPoint Presentation,
National Science Foundation, 2002). The Virtual Vaudeville Project Summary elaborates on this idea
saying that the technologies and strategies developed through Virtual Vaudeville have applications
which extend well beyond the simulation of theatrical performances; the same requirements and
obstacles arise in the attempt to simulate any kind of performative event, including political congresses,
coronations, parades, festivals, battles, rituals, riots, and so on.

range of performance traditions, from Classical Greece to Japanese Noh Theatre. As Principle
Investigator David Saltz argued in his proposal to NSF,
Virtual Vaudeville offers scholars in all disciplines in the humanities a model for
a new kind of “critical edition.” A conventional published monograph can pick
and choose details to examine, and so lacuna and even contradictions in the
historical analysis are easy to overlook. The imperative of precisely recreating
both on-stage and off-stage events will demand an unprecedented degree of
scholarly thoroughness and rigor … It will provide an unprecedented resource for
students to engage with historical performance traditions as performances (and
not as literature or film). 114
Saltz’s “critical edition” model is particularly useful for representing vaudeville as a
performance tradition. While archives have traditionally struggled to document, maintain,
represent and ensure provisions of access to performance of all kinds, vaudeville presents a
specific challenge as a popular art form. “High culture” is a term that was introduced in the late
19th century by English poet and cultural critic Matthew Arnold. Arnold conceived of culture as
the “best that has been thought and said” in the world. 115 In contrast to popular or mass culture,
Arnold saw high culture as a force for moral and political good. Vaudeville, as a form of popular
culture that emerged just following the publication of Arnold’s seminal book, Culture and
Anarchy, did not qualify as “high culture” or “high art.” As such, vaudeville, as a popular form,
was even less likely to attract the attention of a nascent archival field concerned primarily with
historical manuscripts and government records. Today, the significance of this history is
immediately apparent for vaudeville scholars. Each Virtual Vaudeville team member interviewed
for this project identified lack of archival documentation as a motivating force behind creating
the Virtual Vaudeville prototype.

IV.B. VAUDEVILLE

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the entertainment industry in the United States grew
rapidly. Circus, sports and minstrel shows were joined by two new forms of variety
entertainment—burlesque and vaudeville. Together, these performative practices comprised the
nexus of the post-industrial popular culture industry. Variety entertainment consisted of several
short acts performed consecutively; it often included feats such as ventriloquism, acrobatics and
magic tricks.
Vaudeville was variety entertainment. A highly visual, non-literary, form of American
entertainment with a complicated delivery system, the remnants of vaudeville survive in stand-up
comedy, stage and film musicals, and other modern performative practices. 116 From its earliest
days, vaudeville struggled against prevailing Victorian values: early forms of variety theater had
an insalubrious reputation, and in the late 1800s, a growing realm of inexpensive amusement
inspired the cultural elite in the United States to attempt to “reclaim music, drama and the arts
from the unwashed masses.” 117 This self-selecting cultural noblesse sought to preserve art, to
save artistic expression for those who truly appreciated quality and beauty. Vaudeville
represented the opposite of this “high culture,” paradigm. Associated with rough-housing and
prostitution, vaudeville was pure popular entertainment, consisting of a highly diverse series of
very short acts, known as "turns." The turns ranged from singing groups to animal acts, from
comedians to contortionists, from magic tricks to short musical plays.

Vaudeville had an effect on popular culture that is still evident: for example, many
contemporary film and television ethnic stereotypes—Jewish, Irish, Italian, African American—
derive from the ethnic caricatures that were strongholds of vaudeville comedy. Vaudeville era
comedian Frank Bush, the single complete act in the Virtual Vaudeville prototype, exemplifies
this brand of ethnic humor. 118 After the Civil War, many comedians performed in blackface or
donned Irish or German costumes and makeup. Frank Bush specialized in “the Jew” and “the
Yankee.” He made his name as the solemn, bespectacled character of Isaac Levy Solomon
Moses. Dressed in a long black peddler’s coat and sporting a pointed beard, he set the standard
for what were considered “benign” Jewish characterizations on the stage. 119 The historical era
predating the terms “politically correct” and “culturally sensitive” in the United States is
exemplified by 1900s audiences and their hearty response to Jewish character comedy and
blackface. Frank Bush flourished as a “Jew comic” from the 1870s-1890s. There were also
ample ethnically Jewish performers, but they were performing in blackface or engaged in singing
and dancing acts. 120
In its prime, vaudeville appealed to a broad cross-spectrum of the public, representing every
class and ethnic group. The wealthiest patrons could purchase exclusive box seats, while
working class spectators could purchase inexpensive seats in the galleries. Vaudeville, as an
event-based cultural form, had something for everyone. 121

Virtual Vaudeville allows the user to switch between two very different ways of experiencing the
simulated performances. In what we call 'invisible camera' mode, viewers fly through the 3D
space to observe the performance from any position in the theatre and zoom in as close to the
performers as they please. Alternatively, the viewer can adopt an embodied perspective,
watching the performance through the eyes of a particular member of the audience. 122
In September 2000, the National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage (NINCH) held a
“Building Blocks” conference in Washington, D.C. The conference was designed to bring
together 90 humanities scholars to articulate by field and across disciplines the most pressing
needs in the humanities that could be addressed by networked computing. Funded by the
Rockefeller Foundation, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Gladys Krieble Delmas
Foundation, Building Blocks was the first step in a new Computer Science and the Humanities
Initiative, designed to “create a framework of shared understandings and vocabulary with which
[humanities scholars could] build practical agendas for working with computer scientists.”123
The specific and immediate goals of Building Blocks were to map a long-term research agenda
for joint humanist-scientist work and to outline a series of short-term projects to answer the most
pressing of the identified needs. Another goal of the NINCH project was for scholars to leave the
conference with the beginnings of a grant proposal to submit to NSF. NINCH was, in many
ways, NSF's way of reaching out to the humanities.
Among those selected to participate in NINCH’s Building Blocks session were
performance studies scholars David Saltz (University of Georgia), Bruce McConachie

(University of Pittsburgh) and Susan Kattwinkel (College of Charleston). Grouped together as
much by chance as design, these scholars brainstormed digital initiatives they felt would support
their scholarship and pedagogy. 124 The group considered circus, earlier forms of variety
entertainment as well as minstrelsy. Kattwinkel and McConachie, however, both vaudeville
scholars, were particularly interested in blackface, immigrant performers, and working class
audience issues. 125
Following the NINCH session, David Saltz, whose work at the University of Georgia was
in the use of interactive technologies in live performance and who had unfettered access to a
cutting-edge computer department and information technology scholars, took the lead on what
was then termed the Live Performance Simulation System project. 126 The group, which consisted
of the aforementioned scholars (Saltz, McConachie and Kattwinkel) was joined by several
theater historians who focused on the acts represented in the prototype as well as music and
theater architecture. Lastly, the project team included computer scientists from the Georgia
Institute of Technology and the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who brought
3D animation skills and motion capture technology to the project. 127 In the end, the Virtual
Vaudeville team comprised a diverse array of scholars from around the country, including
computer scientists, 3D modelers and animators, theater practitioners, and theater and music
historians.
The group selected vaudeville as an object of study not only because Kattwinkel and
McConachie were vaudeville scholars, but also because the literary aspects of vaudeville are its
least significant attributes. While published sketches exist, these do not capture what is most

arresting about vaudeville: they do not capture the energetic variety or the larger-than-life style.
Also, historically speaking, until recently there has been a dearth of theater scholarship devoted
to popular forms; rather, theater scholarship has traditionally focused on “high art.”128
Vaudeville, therefore, presented a perfect unit of study: not only is vaudeville a visually
demanding art form, but there was still a significant amount of raw research to be done.
Temporally, vaudeville also provided rich ground for reconstruction:
I really like it because it’s recent enough that you can really reconstruct it with a
good bit of detail. So let’s say we were doing Greek theater. There’s so much
speculation involved in every detail that it would be hugely speculative. Any little
detail: what the actor’s costumes looked like, how they moved, what the set
looked like. You know, all of these core issues. Whereas with Vaudeville, there’s
tons of material. It’s right at the dawn of the film age, so even a lot of these acts
are recorded a lot of them aren’t, so it’s not like it’s redundant. But we do have
that kind of information. 129
Finally, the group selected vaudeville because it would allow them to explore cultural norms in
the turn-of-the-century United States. From the 1880s through the 1920s, several kinds of
vaudeville acts served as typical parts of larger vaudeville productions including blackface
comedy acts, dance numbers, contortionist performances, juggling acts, singing groups, comic
monologues and skits of full-length plays. In short, as a result of the diversity of acts and
audience members in early vaudeville, simulating a vaudeville performance would offer scholars
more than simulating the performance of a “classic” piece of dramatic literature such as the
aforementioned A Doll’s House by Henrick Ibsen or, for that matter, a circus. 130
The proposal for the Virtual Vaudeville prototype was submitted to the NSF in response
to a call for proposals for Phase II of their Digital Libraries Initiative which began in 1998. Phase

I of the Initiative had begun in 1994 with six proposals funded from 103 submissions. Highly
competitive, Phase II of the Digital Libraries Initiative received over 400 proposals of which
approximately 50 were funded, Virtual Vaudeville among them. 131 At the time, various inquiries
were made regarding live performance that fell within the NSF’s areas of interest. Some were
associated with dance and choreography and a considerable amount were linked to human
motion, gesture recognition and sign-language recognition. Many of the researchers were
seeking funding to simulate human capabilities in robotics. 132 While the National Endowment
for the Humanities (NEH) or the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) might have been a
more natural fit for funding a project such as Virtual Vaudeville, NSF at the time had a budget in
excess of $5 billion while NEH labored under a budget closer to $150 million. 133
The NSF awards were selected based on peer-review process and program manager final
decision on project funding. Virtual Vaudeville was considered a unique proposal in that it was
one of a few proposals dealing with intangible cultural heritage. NSF had received a number of
proposals related to endangered languages and oral traditions. They also had several dealing with
performance, but Virtual Vaudeville was generally considered a strong proposal and NSF had
high hopes that it would break new ground not only in establishing a line of research that was
taken and would be received as legitimate within the computer science community (which was at
that point very conservative, and still is, in terms of what they consider legitimate topics for
research) but the hope was that Virtual Vaudeville would also further human understanding of

virtual environments and the ability to capture virtual reality environments in a way that people
would find appealing and informative. 134
Key to the Virtual Vaudeville proposal was the depth of the proposed collaboration
between technology, scholarship, pedagogy and art. Virtual Vaudeville was created to make a
significant contribution to all four domains simultaneously, rather than merely using any one in
the service of the others. 135 David Saltz had been working with a group of scholars aiming to
integrate theater and digital performance, using Shakespeare. He understood that the Virtual
Vaudeville team was naïve about the ease with which a project such as this could be
accomplished. It was for this reason, in addition to his access to technological resources at the
University of Georgia, that he was selected as Principal Investigator on the project. 136 The scope
of the project, as proposed, was much larger than what was eventually funded by NSF. Initially
the project team requested $3 million to reproduce four vaudeville acts in a virtual environment.
The project was whittled down to one act with the idea that later endeavors would see the
remaining acts completed. 137 In the end, the Live Performance Simulation System was funded
by NSF through their Digital Libraries Initiative with a grant for $900,000 which was
supplemented by an additional $110,000 from the State of Georgia. 138 With this funding, the
project team created the Virtual Vaudeville Prototype.
The complete Virtual Vaudeville prototype (1) simulates a single act by vaudeville
comedian Frank Bush using a live actor and motion and facial capture, (2) offers a “flythrough”
of B.F. Keith’s Union Square Theatre as it would have appeared during the vaudeville era, and

(3) presents possible responses from six individual spectators. To accomplish the Frank Bush act,
David Saltz—as he would in any theatrical production—wrote a script, hired an actor (George
Contini) and directed a scene. He blocked the actor’s movements and made decisions about tone
and quality. The difference in the case of Virtual Vaudeville was that Contini was equipped with
an optical motion capture suit and later with optical facial motion capture markers.
Optical motion capture relies on a series of light reflective markers placed at key places
on the body. Markers are typically placed at joints, but can be placed as necessary to capture
data. Facial motion capture uses a larger number of makers placed on the facial muscles to
capture the intricacies of facial expression. When artists use motion capture for animation, fewer
markers are desirable allowing animators to further manipulate rudimentary movement and
design their own characters. A typical motion capture system uses anywhere from 4 to 32
cameras to capture the subject’s movement. The Virtual Vaudeville team at the University of
Georgia used 8 cameras placed strategically around a small studio black box theater. They chose
Autodesk Filmbox (FBX) for their motion capture software to capture data from the markers and
analyze position, angle, velocity, and acceleration. The team then animated the movement with
Maya, Autodesk’s 3D computer graphics software, reproducing Contini’s movements on a 3D
model of Frank Bush. 139 This process is, in part, recreated on the Virtual Vaudeville website. 140
The flythrough of the Union Square Theatre, on the other hand, was created from visual images
mapped into Maya. Frank Mohler, Virtual Vaudeville’s designer, had done extensive archival
research into the Union Square Theatre and created a set of blueprints from the dimensions he
uncovered in the archives. David Saltz took a series of photographs representative of vaudeville

era architecture and interior theater design. Details from these images were painstakingly
reconstructed in the Maya animation environment.
The prototype opens up for historical investigation a range of ethnic, gender and class
interactions during America's industrial age. 141 From the perspective of audience interaction, the
team intended for viewers to have the ability to select one of four spectators, each representing a
different socio-economic group common in 19th century America. These spectators enjoy rich
and complex biogrpahies: Mrs. Dorothy Shopper, a wealthy socialite attending the performance
with her young daughter; Mr. Luigi Calzilaio, an Italian immigrant “fresh off the boat,” attending
the performance with his more Americanized brother; Mr. Jake Spender, a young “sport” sitting
next to a Chorus Girl (with whom he may or may not strike up a relationship, depending on the
viewer's choices); and Miss Lucy Teacher, an African American schoolteacher watching the
performance with her boyfriend from the second balcony, where she is confined by the theatre's
segregation policy. 142 These biographies, created for them from course-based archival research in
the theater department at the University of Pittsburgh, were written to motivate the intentionally
individuated responses of each audience member. The team envisioned an interactive audience
experience:
The people in the boxes, a woman in the booth, Dorothy Shopper and her
daughter; then the Italian and the Irishman sitting in the balcony and the African
American in the balcony. We did elaborate biographies for them. And the idea
was that there would be some artificial intelligence so you’d be sitting there and
you have like an avatar and you could applaud or laugh or make a joke – a joke
that was appropriate to you. And that person would respond appropriately to your
joke. So the [Naval Postgraduate School team] actually provided us with a game
engine so we could script those interactions 143

The interactions were subsequently scripted, and some of the audience responses are actualized
in the prototype: there are a set of six pre-rendered audience-members who react to Frank Bush’s
comedy act. Their facial expressions were informed by the archivally researched biographies and
captured by optical facial motion capture technology. Acting students at the University of
Georgia were used for this motion capture. The highly interactive audience experience that the
Virtual Vaudeville team sought to deliver, however, was never fully realized.
Many vaudeville acts reflected the enthusiasms and anxieties of their time, particularly
the integration of new immigrant groups into mainstream American culture, and the
marginalization of African-Americans from that same culture. 144 As David Nasaw suggests,
vaudeville gradually “deracialized most immigrant groups, but continued to categorize blacks as
racially separate and radically Other.” 145 To this end, there was a strong desire to tackle the issue
of blackface and minstrelsy in America’s theatrical past. Asking questions such as “through
whose eyes do we see,” “how do we construct Otherness?,” and “on what does the construction
of our own identity depend?” were important to the team of scholars working on this project:
they sought to bring critical questions of class, race and gender to the educational table, using
archival evidence and emerging technologies to examine these themes.
The team was acutely aware that it was imperative to consider both the strengths and
weaknesses of simulation as a representational method; among their chief concerns was
“Disneyification,” or presenting an idealized view of past and perpetuating historical stereotypes
and prejudices. Discussions about how to address this concern precipitated an internal team
controversy about including blackface in the prototype.

[B.F. Keith’s theater] had an ethnically mixed audience. It had the balcony, you
know, with segregated African American spectators and that was something that
we wanted to be able to look into and explore, too. And then we were deciding,
‘All right, well, what acts are we going to do?’ and we came up with four acts that
we were gonna be researching: one was going to be Sandow the Magnificent, one
was going to be the Four Cohans, one was going to be Maggie Cline and then we
were going to do some sort of ethnic humor which was the sort-of definition of
Vaudeville humor and at that point the group decided blackface would be a good
thing to study. I was there. And I said, from the sort-of scholarly table, that that all
sounded reasonable and good. And so we decided on that. 146
Each of the team members recollects that blackface was part of the initial discussion
among the Virtual Vaudeville team. The particular recollections, however, vary: “The way I
remember it, [we were] interested in doing blackface and when [David Saltz] was getting ready
to put in the NSF proposal he was told that some Congressman sent it back and told them that he
wouldn't allow American tax dollars to pay for filth for his kids to watch on the internet.” 147
A representative from the National Science Foundation was interviewed for this research
study. He contends that the National Science Foundation does not make a practice of censoring
the work of scholars funded under their programs. There are, nonetheless, requirements that
projects must meet to qualify for NSF funding. Among those requirements is, for example, a
stipulation that projects must be based in the United States. This rule influenced the Virtual
Vaudeville team’s decision to use American vaudeville as a unit of study. Also, because NSF
funding is sourced from the federal government of the United States, all limitations that apply to
the application of federal funds also apply to NSF-funded projects (such as alcohol exclusions,
etc.). Because of these limitations and exclusions, and because of the work involved in
submitting a grant proposal to NSF, it is not uncommon for researchers to contact NSF program

directors to inquire about NSF’s interest in or potential willingness to fund a given project. 148 It
is unclear whether a conversation about blackface specifically was ever held with an NSF project
manager.
David Saltz, whose participation in the project was uniquely liminal—part scholar and
technology specialist, part artist and theatrical director—realized that in simulating the scene he
would have to have real actors, real people, in blackface. At the same time, Saltz received word
from team members at the Naval Postgraduate School and Georgia Institute of Technology that
doctoral students working on the project were concerned about losing their funding as a result of
their involvement in a project that utilized blackface. From Saltz’s perspective, the difference
between studying blackface and simulating it was significant:
Well, we’re simulating it. And what are the implications of simulating it? So I’m
going to actually have to have a white actor do blackface? And then how do we
deal with that? … Once you start doing blackface and putting it out there it is
extremely sensitive … [F]rom a scholarly standpoint, studying blackface, yes, but
how are we going to simulate it? What does that mean? 149 One of the interesting
theoretical issues with simulation in general is that when you’re looking at it
there’s one risk that -- whenever I give a talk about this, I say one of the dangers
in general is the distanciation. That you sort of create this vision of completeness
that’s not real. And we work against that by providing all of our scholarly sources
and materials in the footnotes, but it’s still a[n] immersive experience. So when
we were talking about it with the blackface we were actually propagating
blackface. And somebody can read into it and provide all the commentary they
want about it, but if they don’t – and even if they do! – the first experience is
blackface. 150
Another team member recalls that,
there was a lot of legitimate conversation amongst ourselves about that. About,
‘Well, how is the site going to be used?’ and if we did a blackface performance,
how might that get in the way of what we were trying to use the site for and how
might that cause the site some issues and how might that obscure our purpose of
it? We can put it in there and have a scholarly conversation about it like every

other aspect of the show, but not everybody would be able to do that. So, I recall
that I was actually okay with waiting on that. My thought was, ‘Well, if we’re
going to think big, it’ll get bigger.’ … But there certainly would have been at least
some blackface characters somewhere, if not like really a minstrel act. I don’t
remember the word ‘filth’ being used. I do remember that there was some outside
pressure not to do that. 151
Finally, Saltz concluded, “[Beyond the issues of simulation] we talked about what would be a
good representation of vaudeville and, well, [blackface] should have been at the very beginning
of the project. If we wanted to look at blackface, which was fascinating, then first of all, we
needed a different group. We were all white [laughs], none of us had that specialization and we’d
need to spend a lot of time reflecting on exactly how we were doing it.” 152
Over time, project team members also developed conflicting expectations of the project.
For Saltz and the historical/creative team, the goal was to create a polished tool. For the technical
team, on the other hand, it was a proof-of-concept project. Working separately, the technical
teams from the Naval Postgraduate School and Georgia Tech delivered minimal prototype
functionality. The Naval Postgraduate School team delivered the artificial intelligence, but it was
never implemented by the team at Georgia Tech. Eventually, in the face of halted progress, funds
were diverted from Georgia Tech to create the website as it exists today, with eight pre-rendered
audience-member perspectives. 153
Although NSF project managers were disappointed by what they deemed “minimal
reporting” back to the agency from the project team, they also report that they did not receive a
proposal for the renewal of the Virtual Vaudeville project. 154 When asked why the team did not
apply for additional funding, Susan Kattwinkel stated that “Essentially [NSF funding] allowed us

to basically solve the problem: ‘How would this project get done.’ And then once we had solved
the problem, NSF wasn’t interested in us actually completing the project. They were like, ‘Well,
you’ve created the system, you’ve created the technology, you’ve worked together and that’s
what we wanted.’ And then they weren’t interested in doing it anymore.” 155
The Virtual Vaudeville project team strove to create a prototype that was realized in a
fully immersive game environment. From the beginning, the focus was on creating the world of
the performance: 3D models of the theater, a house populated with audience members, the stage
act and multiple “player” perspectives. They imagined a virtual environment in which the user
could use embedded hyperlinks to retrieve historical information culled from archives.

IV.D. THE ARCHIVE AND THE REPERTOIRE

Manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, films, and recordings are artifacts that can be preserved and
archived for subsequent generations to appreciate and analyze. Live theatre, however, is
ephemeral. Is it possible to archive a live performance? 156
Vaudeville producers such as Tony Pastor in the 1880s and, especially, B.F. Keith and E.F.
Albee in the 1890s gave birth to vaudeville by turning earlier forms of variety theatre into
“respectable” family entertainment. Keith and Albee introduced “continuous vaudeville,” which
became standard practice at the turn of the century. 157 The performances ran non-stop all day and
into the evening, allowing spectators to enter the theatre at any time and stay as long as they
liked — not unlike modern television. The Virtual Vaudeville prototype is set in 1895 in B.F.
Keith's New York vaudeville venue, the Union Square Theatre. This theatre embodied all of the

73

“respectable” practices that Keith and Albee had established in theaters in Boston and
Philadelphia, and it set the pattern for subsequent vaudeville theatres throughout the country.
Unfortunately, the Union Square Theater no longer exists, and archivists to date have not
unearthed photographs of the theater's interior during the period in which the Virtual Vaudeville
simulation is set. As previously stated, Frank Mohler, Virtual Vaudeville’s designer, developed
the basic reconstruction design for the Union Square Theatre after conducting extensive archival
research into the theatre's history. He discovered that the 19th century Union Square Theatre, at
58 E. 14th Street in Manhattan existed in three distinct versions, the result of renovations. The
reconstruction of the theater for the prototype was based on Mohler’s archival research. He
found the evidence in newspaper clippings, drawings, theater programs, New York City building
code laws, dimensions recorded in monographs from the time and photographs of the exterior of
the theater. 158 Although there are few published studies which provide a close reading on Tony
Pastor and his theater, there is an archival record of the vaudeville acts performed there and of
Pastor’s theater in general. There are also substantial artist and business records from Pastor’s
theater which provide logistical information such as stage size and scenic instructions. 159
In the 1990s, theater historians, working without the benefit of cultural resource
managers, encountered anxieties over intellectual property rights in an array of digitization
projects with which they were involved. So, too, did the Virtual Vaudeville team. 160 Historically,
from as early as the Elizabethan Age, theater artists resisted the printed script due to copyright
concerns: in part, scripts meant anyone could perform your work. Of equal importance, however,

was the understanding that theater was temporal. It was a form of art and entertainment that was
meant to be performed, rather than read. As Susan Kattwinkel asserts:
Ben Johnson [1572-1637] was the first one to really publish his scripts as
literature. So we did that with legitimate theater but not with vaudeville, not with
popular theater. Even the scripts that existed for popular theater wouldn’t have
been published. People didn’t read them like literature the way they do regular
plays. So when we have them it’s because they were part of usually some
manager’s collection that just didn’t get thrown out. 161
As a result, script research for the vaudeville era proved challenging. Theatrical scripts, while
among the most prolific source of theatrical records, are nonetheless “notoriously difficult to find
for historical performances.” 162 That performing arts archives now place a high premium on
collecting and preserving theatrical scripts is a reaction to a two-fold problem: scarcity in printed
scripts in archival repositories and a high demand for these printed materials from performance
studies and literature scholars. In part because performance is notoriously difficult to capture,
there is a reverence for the dramatic script. If a scholar is conducting research in “legitimate”
theater, scripts are among the detritus s/he might expect to find. This, however, is not the case for
vaudeville:
Up until recently nobody was saving TV scripts, scripts for TV shows. It was just
something that ‘Well who would save that?’ But now, people do. Now, these are
archived and saved. But I think you'd be hard-pressed to find scripts of I Love
Lucy and stuff that was popular entertainment. People wrote it, they tossed it
away. It was on TV, that was the end of it. They didn't save those things. And
popular theater was the same way. 163
It is true that in the United States it is difficult to recover recordings of such things as television
shows prior to the early 1970s because the videotapes studios used to record them were then used

again for subsequent recordings. From the perspective of performance, many seminal
performances—that were videotaped—are gone. 164
Despite the challenge of finding vaudeville recordings from a time when film was new
and documenting and preserving popular culture was not a priority, there are vaudeville joke
books to be found in relative abundance in performing arts archives—short sketches that were
published for performers and amateurs alike. Harder to find in these same repositories are longer
scripts such as those performed by the Four Cohans, a second act the Virtual Vaudeville team
intended to restage. This also proved challenging for the Virtual Vaudeville team as they
conducted their archival research. 165 Despite these challenges, the team was able to locate
unabridged theatrical scripts of Four Cohan plays, as they existed. A wholly separate endeavor
involved trying to find the associated sheet music. 166 Because many vaudeville performances
were musical acts, locating a script in an archival repository without accompanying music
renders the record incomplete. Among the most treasured finds in the vaudeville archival
research was an item that was not found in an archival repository. As far as scholars and
researchers know, no film footage exists of vaudeville comedian and Virtual Vaudeville “star,”
Frank Bush. This was, in part, what drew Virtual Vaudeville team members to attempt to
recreate his act. In their research, they discovered that an Edison wax recording of Bush existed,
which they subsequently tracked down and retrieved from the only existing source: a seller on
EBay. 167

small pieces on the cement floor.

In addition to scripts and early film footage, Virtual Vaudeville research included
photographs and cabinet cards—early trading cards for theatrical artists. In the cabinet card
tradition, one could purchase postcards of performers in various roles, posed as if they were on
stage. However, as project member and College of Charleston professor Susan Kattwinkel
cautions, “[the actors are] always posed for a camera. People use those things for research, for
trying to reconstruct what a performance might have looked like, but of course you've got to be
very very careful with that kind of material because it was staged for the still camera.168
Kattwinkel’s note is well-taken: the mediation of the pose and the camera render these images
problematic in determining historical facts. Archival research for representative images beyond
the cabinet cards was done at the Harvard Theater Collection, the Library of Congress, New
York Public Library, the Harry Ransom Institute in Texas and the City Museum of New York. 169
One area in which the Virtual Vaudeville team found significant amounts of tangible archival
evidence was the composition of vaudeville audiences. Theater critics at the time paid particular
attention to the role and reactions of the audience as did individual performers. Archival
Dr. Susan Kattwinkel, interview with author, August 7, 2013. Kattwinkel here is referring to an early
photographic intervention. Historian Robert Taft, in his 1938 work Photography and the American
Scene, posits that the invention of photography and its subsequent technical refinements during the
nineteenth century had a profound influence on the American theater. Photography, says Taft, was
instrumental in the development of a “cult of celebrity” that had preoccupied the country by the year
1865. Many upper-class families considered it their duty to “have available in every parlor and sitting
room a picture book of illustrious Americans.” These illustrious Americans, due in part to the
technological enhancements of Walter Benjamin’s “mechanical reproductions,” began to include stage
performers; as such, theatrical photographs in the 19th century were images experienced not only on
personal levels, but on commercial and social levels as well. The manipulative power inherent in
images was put to work by promoters, managers and performers as soon as it became economically
viable and technologically possible to do so. José Maria Mora, one of the leading theatrical
photographers of the late 1870s, reported that in one year he sold more than 300,000 pictures of
celebrities for a total of more than $90,000. According to Henderson’s Broadway Ballyhoo!, “Every
large city had its shops lined with bins of reproductions of familiar faces of presidents, politicians,
orators, writers, and – especially – actors.” (See Mary C. Henderson, Broadway Ballyhoo:The American
Theater Seen in Posters, Photographs, Magazines, Caricatures, and Programs [New York: Harry
Abrams, 1989], 49 and Robert Taft, Photography and the American Scene : a Social History, 18391889 (New York: Macmillan Co., 1938), 316.

documentation of audiences exists in newsprint, diaries, autobiographies. There is substantial
evidence about audience behavior as well as some evidence of who these theater-goers were,
where they sat in the theater and how they might have behaved. 170 From this archival research
students in one of Bruce McConachie’s courses created detailed biographical sketches for the
four aforementioned interactive audience members. Finally, in an inspired turn toward restaging
the archival record, the 3D model of Sandow is based on measurements taken of Sandow in 1894
by Dr. Dudley Allen Sargent of Harvard University. 171
As previously stated, members of the Virtual Vaudeville team strongly assert that the
archival holdings related to vaudeville are scarce and insufficient:
The Library of Congress records for vaudeville are not good. There’s a lot of
stuff—again, I’ve been there looking for Tony Pastor stuff—they have a lot of
records for things that used to be registered there where they used to have copies
and then they just didn’t anymore. It was Vaudeville stuff and people just threw
them out. They don't exist anymore … You know, we picked some of the main
acts, the big Vaudeville acts from the period. We used B.F. Keith’s big house
because there was a lot of information on that, but, because vaudeville continues
to be sort of under-analyzed, and library collections didn't keep their stuff it's a
really good thing for putting online and using the materials that we have to pull it
all together from various places and put it in one place so that we can look at it
altogether because the information on vaudeville, even now, is scattered. 172
In speaking with members of the Virtual Vaudeville team discrepancies between how archivists
understand archives and information stewardship and how other fields understand the term
“archives” arise. Here, Kattwinkel misunderstands the nature of archives, suggesting that format
dictates archival status:
Dr. Susan Kattwinkel, interview with author, August 7, 2013. Kattwinkel goes on to say that: “Beyond
that, I suppose it was just a matter of extrapolating to humanity. Cognitively, people were the same then
as they are now. So modeling expressions and that kind of thing was pretty much, ‘Take the equivalent
of that audience member today and what are they gonna do? What might they laugh at?’ I think there
was a lot of sort of just human nature involved in that. People haven’t changed. Society has, but people
are essentially the same.”

[Interviewer: “Did you use newspapers?”] “For this particular project, not that I
recall. Most of the vaudeville work I do now, I'm sort of like married to every
single 19th-century historical newspaper collection online, both in the UK and
here. But back then, I think most of the online research was Library of Congress
stuff. That was the primary online source that was available. Everything else was
archival.” 173
Kattwinkel’s misconception is not uncommon. Indeed, it is part of the archival myth that this
dissertation dispels for those outside the archival field, and for some within the field as well. As
the Virtual Vaudeville project illustrates, the material qualities of the record—the record in this
case being the Virtual Vaudeville prototype itself—are archivally less significant than the
evidentiary properties of the record.
Virtual Vaudeville team members were interested in scholarly engagement and debate.
They were hoping that other scholars might take issue, providing evidence that refuted their
vision of vaudeville. 174 While this did not happen, the prototype does successfully demonstrate—
in an historical snapshot—the archival potential of motion capture technology and digitizing
historical performances. It has proven its educational value as well; it has been used in
introductory theater courses at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Georgia. The
prototype is also one that can be read as an archive: it is a point-of-view, locked in time. It is an
historical work rooted in the 1990s and manifested in the earliest parts of this century that speaks
to the questions performance studies scholars were asking at the time and to the evidence
available to them. It speaks to a time when performance studies scholars were concerned with
recreating historical spaces and digitizing historical performances. The archives that supported
the creation of the Virtual Vaudeville prototype—the Library of Congress, the Harvard Theatre
Collection, the Performing Arts Library at New York Public Library/Lincoln Center and the

archives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign—are all print and digitized records.
They do not capture or represent vaudeville in the same visual, experiential way that the Virtual
Vaudeville prototype does. Although Virtual Vaudeville is mediated through the lens of theater
and music historians, 3D animators and game designers, it nonetheless provides an aggregate
view, based on historical, archival evidence, of the cultural artifact that is American vaudeville.
The Virtual Vaudeville website—more specifically, the server on which it resides—is the
only place where all of the Virtual Vaudeville information is collocated, making it one of the
most robust single repositories of vaudeville materials in existence. It is also an artifact of what
was technologically available at the time. Given the creative and scholarly work that David Saltz
and Frank Mohler undertook to restage the theater architecture, the prototype arguably takes on
additional archival qualities. The model itself is evidence: the blueprints were created from
narrative descriptions and the photographs that Saltz took were digitally mapped onto the virtual
reality canvas that became the prototype. 175
The Virtual Vaudeville prototype is currently housed on a server in the theater
department at the University of Georgia where it is checked with some frequency by David
Saltz.176 What will happen, however, when and if Saltz leaves the university?
The issue of preserving technology, I could go on about that ad infinitum. But
that’s one of the problems with all of the stuff. I heard all of these amazing
presentations, but nobody ever knew anything about them. Like this super high
res[olution] version of Michelangelo’s David. I think it’s part of the mindset of
the research community particularly in the sciences where you do this proof-ofconcept research. They develop it but they don’t do anything with it. The
sustainability of the technology was at the forefront of our minds from the
beginning. 177

If no archival intervention occurs, the prototype will also be lost or become obsolete. As a
record, the prototype creates the same problem team members were attempting, in part, to solve.
The prototype and its attendant components require the same kind of archival thinking in this
century that vaudeville did 100 years ago. Here is a clear opportunity for traditional archival
intervention. Archives and archivists are specifically—and uniquely—qualified to manage the
preservation and stewardship of digital culture. Even if archivists did not take physical custody
of the prototype, acting in an advisory role for Saltz and other team members is one appropriate
way to move forward. This study finds time and again that collaboration is critical between
archivists and performers if performed acts are to endure as representations of society’s cultural
heritage.
The central question of this research study speaks to the role of archives in safeguarding
and preserving performed acts. Can motion capture and other digital technologies aid in
preservation efforts by transmitting the embodied knowledge of the actor? Many technologies
that could serve this function fail to connect the human element. Motion capture data, on the
other hand, is a direct representation of human movement. Although this data can, as this case
study shows, be manipulated, it is one way that cultural transmission happens in digital
environments. For example, the Hachimura Laboratory in Japan has been working with motion
capture as part of a comprehensive plan to safeguard Japan’s intangible cultural heritage. 178
Working toward a digital archive of traditional Japanese performing arts, Dr. Hachimura
combines motion capture data with digitized dance notation (specifically labanotation) to record

178

81

motion related to traditional forms such as noh and kabuki theater. 179 Similarly, 3D animated
motion capture data has been used as a tool to assist dancers in learning choreography. Such
systems use motion capture data to render 3D images and streaming video to be combined with
narrative description and dance notation.
None of the existing technologies for capturing, preserving and transmitting performance
is perfect. The way that transmission of cultural knowledge is currently framed requires one
person or group of people to transmit information to another person or group. Motion capture, on
its own, does not solve the capture/preservation problem, but combined with technologies that
utilize information visualization, such as with Virtual Vaudeville, motion capture may offer the
closest alternative to human transmission. Without diminishing the human factor, it is crucial to
note that Virtual Vaudeville, as a record and as an educative or transmissive tool, functions
effectively as both archive and repertoire. The movements Contini made were captured along
with attendant cultural information—gestures, facial expressions, audience responses, etc.—that
the Virtual Vaudeville team was able to convey.
Archivists, as knowledge managers and information stewards, are increasingly involved
in digital curation, digital humanities and big data projects. Becoming conversant in technologies
such as motion capture and working collaboratively with records creators to develop better tools,
systems and infrastructures that transmit cultural knowledge—while also preserving that
knowledge in a way that is meaningful to historians, artists and others who will ultimately use
these records—presents an opportunity for archivists to begin establishing practices for records
that are in continuous use. At the same time, it provides an opportunity for archivists to reframe

Dance notation can be compared to a musical score while motion capture data is similar to a GPS
system. Each movement is recorded in reference to a series of points on the body in space and
represented as coordinates on a plane.

event-based archivy as a collaborative process, one that is adaptive and responsive to the needs
of all stakeholders.

IV.E. SUMMARY

While performing arts archives supported the creation of the Virtual Vaudeville prototype, its
creators were, from the outset, dissatisfied with the existing archival materials available to them.
That a group of performance studies scholars sought to create their own archive, without the
benefit of an archivist speaks directly to the inadequacy of the archival endeavor where eventbased cultural heritage is concerned. Jeannette Bastian has proffered a theoretical framework that
creates a space wherein performed cultural events are signifying objects and, by extension,
documents. Similarly, Richard Cox has suggested that the physicality of the record is secondary
to its function as evidence of a transaction or activity. Extending this scholarship, this chapter
argues that that the evidentiary qualities of the Virtual Vaudeville prototype—as a record—
supersede its need to be text based.
Virtual Vaudeville is an example of a non-textual record that has clear and specific
evidentiary properties and exists outside a custodial archival paradigm. It is one example of how
the archive and the repertoire work in concert. In this case, the Virtual Vaudeville prototype acts
as both archive and repertoire: as repertoire, it maintains the broad, comical gestures associated
with vaudeville acts through Saltz’s direction and the actor’s knowledge of vaudeville; as
“archive,” the prototype is attentive to vaudeville’s role as a symbolic representation of the
cultural diversity of early 20th century America. Vaudeville—an amalgam of centuries-old
cultural traditions, including the English Music Hall, antebellum minstrel shows and Yiddish
83

theater—was the earliest entertainment form to cross racial and class boundaries. The Virtual
Vaudeville prototype safeguards this cultural knowledge by deftly navigating the liminal spaces
between archive and repertoire. Another example of a performance tradition that successfully
navigates this apparent dichotomy can be found in the dance pedagogy and archives of
anthropologist, dancer and choreographer, Katherine Dunham.

V. THE KATHERINE DUNHAM ARCHIVES AND THE DUNHAM
TECHNIQUE

This chapter examines how the dance work of anthropologist, dancer and choreographer,
Katherine Dunham has endured through archival intervention and Dunham’s dance pedagogy,
the Dunham Technique. The chapter explores codification and transmission as apparatus for
ensuring the continuation of culturally informed movement such as the Dunham Technique.
Finally, the chapter analyzes the relationship between archive and repertoire, positioning
Katherine Dunham’s dance work as a space with tremendous creative and collaborative
potential.
The chapter therefore provides historical context for Katherine Dunham and introduces
the Dunham Technique; considers archival efforts to document and preserve Dunham’s dance
work; discusses the Dunham Technique as a mode of cultural communication; asserts that
codification and visual literacy are vital to readings of gestural languages; and, finally, reads the
interplay between the Dunham archives and the Dunham Technique as one successful
negotiation between archive and repertoire.
The case study employs data from interviews with Dunham dancer and Point Park
University Dunham instructor Ron Hutson and Co-Founders of the Institute for Dunham
Certification, Drs. Albirda Rose and Halifu Osumare; archival oral history interviews with
Katherine Dunham; recordings of Dunham’s fieldwork in the Caribbean, Dunham Company

dances and the Dunham Technique; historical newspapers; records from the Katherine Dunham
archives at Southern Illinois University, Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival and the Library of
Congress; writings by Katherine Dunham; and an array of secondary sources.

V.A. KATHERINE DUNHAM

Known through journalistic coinage as “Katherine the Great” or “Anthropological Katie,”
Katherine Dunham was born in Chicago in June 1909. She completed her bachelor of philosophy
at the University of Chicago in anthropology in 1936, focusing on the dances of the African
diaspora. Her first dance company, Ballet Nègre was established in 1930 as the premier Negro
ballet company in the United States.
Dunham was trained in classical ballet, her formative training influenced by artists such
as Ludmilla Speranzeva and Vera Mirova. Speranzeva, who came to the United States with the
Chauve-Souris, a Franco-Russian vaudeville troupe, was one of the first ballet teachers to accept
black dancers as students. Speranzeva introduced Dunham to Spanish dance and dancers,
including La Argentina, Quill Monroe, and Vicente Escudero. In the late 1920s, just before the
economic collapse of 1929, Dunham studied ballet with Vera Mirova; through Mirova, Dunham
was exposed to East Indian, Javanese, and Balinese dance forms. 180
Dunham was particularly interested in dances and rhythms as they applied to her own
ethnic and cultural background. Upon entering the University of Chicago, she began teaching her
own style of dance, partly to explore her theoretical beliefs about the rhythms of the Negro

people, and partly to meet the financial demands of private university education. As a scholar,
Dunham’s anthropological thesis for the University of Chicago was to be titled, “A Comparative
Analysis of Primitive Dance.” It was eventually amended to the more bounded “A Comparative
Analysis of the Dances of Haiti: Their Form, Function, Social Organization, and the Interrelation
of Form and Function.” Dunham theorized that in the West Indies,
peasant natives (primarily the Negroes of Koromantee, Ibo, Congo, Dahomey,
Mandingo, and other west coast derivation, mixed perhaps with a little Carib
Indian and varying degrees of European stock) think very much and behave
basically very much as did their African forebears. Consequently they dance very
much in the same fashion. Differences there are, of course, due to the shift from
tribal to folk culture, to miscegenation, cultural contact, and other items making
for social change. But the elements of the dance are still what, in my analysis,
would be termed “primitive.” 181
This shift from tribal to folk culture in Africans transplanted to the West Indies formed the basis
for Dunham’s dance anthropology. Her scholarship focused on the survival of dances in the
midst of this shift. Dunham believed that the political, economic and social organization imposed
by Europeans in the West Indies had ceased to be tribal and that the structure of social and art
traditions which had been based upon tribal forms had therefore lost their functional validity. 182
In selecting countries for her case studies, Dunham asserted that French colonizers were less
interested in cultural domination than their English counterparts. Subsequently, she argued, the
integrity of African culture and the sanctity of African religious traditions persist more readily in

Francophone island nations such as Haiti and Martinique than other Caribbean countries,
including Jamaica and Trinidad. 183
By 1932, Dunham had consulted with her former ballet teacher, Ludmilla Speranzeva,
about her desire to open a school for young, black dancers where she would teach them about
their African heritage. Speranzeva advised her to forgo ballet, to focus instead on modern dance,
and, most importantly, to develop her own style. 184 In 1935 Dunham was awarded a Julius
Rosenwald Fellowship to conduct field work in the Caribbean, where she studied the survival of
traditional African dance in the face of European colonization and acculturation. Nervous about
the disappearance of dances from many “tribal” and “folk” communities, Dunham proposed
using film to document these traditions as well as to preserve her own technique. 185 As early as
the mid-1930s, Dunham was utilizing a Kodak 16mm camera to record her field studies in the
Caribbean in what was, at the time, an innovative approach to fieldwork. 186
Fieldwork in Martinique yielded, for Dunham, a familiarity with not only national dance
forms such as the beguine and the valse creole, but with fighting dances such as l’ag’ya.
L’ag’ya, a cockfight in its most essential form, is performed throughout Martinique where
multiple versions, derivations and significances of the dance once thrived. Also known as
damier, the movements of l’ag’ya resemble those of a living chess game, with dancers dancing

Dunham, “The Negro Dance,” 996. Dunham goes on to express that although some of these dance
traditions have endured in the coastal United States (such as off the South Carolina coast), the
Caribbean offers a more fertile ground for “an analysis of the survival of the dance in its shift from
tribal to folk culture.”

only in the squares of the chessboard. 187 L’ag’ya movements are also stylistically similar to
Brazilian capoeira and the French savate. 188
When Dunham returned from the Caribbean, she became a supervisor for the Works
Progress Administration’s Federal Writers’ and Theatre Projects. The role of the Federal Theatre
Project was the re-employment of theatre workers who were then on “relief rolls” including
actors, directors, playwrights, designers, vaudeville artists, stage technicians and others in the
theatre field. The broader purpose was to establish theaters “so vital to community life that they
[would] continue to function after the work of the Federal Project was completed.” 189 Dunham’s
arrangement with the Works Progress Administration Federal Writers’ Project lasted
approximately six months. Through this position, she received funding to produce her first ballet,
appropriately titled L’Ag’Ya. The Federal Theatre Project agreed to fund a staging of the ballet
and Dunham cast it with the “proletariat or lumpen”: cooks, chauffeurs, maids and typists, all
out-of-work in the thick of the Depression. 190 Inspired by her Caribbean field study, L’Ag’Ya
debuted in January 1938 at the Federal Theater in Chicago and is regarded as Dunham’s first
significant artistic breakthrough. Dunham described l’ag’ya, saying:
L’ag’ya was a fighting dance, in Martinique when I was there. Sunday afternoons,
instead of being horse racing, this, that or the other for the average person it was
to go and see an ag’ya, a fighting dance. It had drum accompaniment and a
certain kind of motions that were pure dance and other kinds of motions that were
actually lethal. I guess its closest form would have been the kickboxing that are
still found in parts of Gambia. And the ag’ya was, well, when one heard there was
going to be an ag’ya, it just meant that everybody came from near and far to see

it, participate in it, to bet on who would win. They had the favorite ag’ya – they
would call them fighters, I would call them dancers. And the ag’ya was the
climax of our ballet which was of the same name, in which the hero was killed in
this particular scene. And it took me actually months to be able to feel that I could
teach a person not raised in that culture to be able to give the impression of a
lethal dance movement. It sounds easy, but it was not. Finally we did have ag’ya
mastered, and we did it as a ballet. And when the scene of the fight itself took
place some people in the audience would respond as though they were seeing
boxing or a wrestling fight. 191
L'Ag'Ya is a classic example of Dunham’s style. Although the story about a tempestuous love
triangle can be found in many concert dance repertoires, the movement vocabulary originated
from the authentic Martiniquais fighting dance. Dunham’s L’Ag’Ya is also culturally dynamic: it
is born of American creative sensibilities but informed by African and European culture. 192
Although best known as a choreographer and dancer, Dunham constructed new kinetic
models that tested traditional “high culture” paradigms. 193 Dunham was a scholar first and
foremost; she was an anthropologist who sought to maintain scholarly engagement through
artistic endeavor:
For one thing I was seeking to maintain an academic level. I knew that dance was
something that I had to do; I had no choice in it at all. And I knew that it was
regarded in a certain position in the world of art, but it had no position whatsoever
in the academic world – even sports would have been considered closer, I think,
than dance. So my problem was to remain an investigator, an intelligent
investigator, a productive one in academics where certainly, anthropology, it was
a new science but very much respected. And my problem, my strong drive at that

time, was to remain in that academic position that anthropology gave me, and at
the same time continue with the strong drive for motions. Rhythmic motions. 194
Dunham’s scholarly contributions furthered the study of comparative diaspora religions,
including Hatian Vodun, Cuban Santería, Jamaican Obeah and Brazilian Candomblé. Through
her work in cultural anthropology and work—which together comprise the Dunham
Technique—Dunham established movements that analyze the legacy of slavery and espouse the
worth of African-influenced traditions. Dunham’s dance work embodies a “lived dimension of a
theoretical construct” of the African diaspora. 195
The Dunham Technique emphasizes cultural contextualization in movement as well as
attention to spiritual well-being. Sharing the principles of this Technique was among the primary
objectives of the Dunham School of Dance and Theater in New York City. Established at the end
of World War II, the Dunham School offered an extensive curriculum in the humanities. 196 The
school was unique in that it not only gave professional dance classes in several genres besides
Dunham Technique, but also taught music, drama, languages, and anthropological fieldwork
techniques. Following its inception in 1944, the Dunham School became the institutional base
where Dunham Technique was developed and codified, offering certificates of completion that
were accredited by nearby Columbia University. 197

In 1951, despite warnings from the United States Department of State, Dunham
premiered her ballet Southland in Santiago, Chile. Southland, which exposed the practice of
lynching in the American South and showed the United States in poor light; following its
presentation, Dunham’s company was effectively blacklisted by the U.S. government and
financial support withheld. It was an act of retribution that Dunham scholars and dancers believe
led eventually—albeit indirectly—to the demise of the Dunham Company in 1965. As Dr. Halifu
Osumare, co-founder of the Institute for Dunham Certification explains,
[Southland] was a direct statement about racism in America. It came at a time in
the 1950s when the Civil Rights movement was gearing up and she wanted to
make a statement about the brutality of lynching. She had a stage, an international
forum. The State Department really didn’t want that kind of image of the United
States being advertised around the world. There were efforts by the State
Department to get her not to premier the piece, including somebody from the
State Department calling John Pratt [Katherine Dunham’s husband]. The way the
story came down to me was that he just laughed. That’s America. She went ahead
with it and then they went to France and she did the piece again in Paris. It was a
major embarrassment to the United States. They really blackballed her from any
kind of state support after that—not that they were giving her much support
anyway—but there was a concerted effort to make sure that the company did not
get certain dates anymore. Any kind of way of curtailing her ability to perform
internationally—the State Department set out to thwart those efforts. That was the
beginning of the end of the Katherine Dunham Dance Company. So Southland
has a place in the Dunham repertoire as the beginning of the end. She was already
having such a hard time keeping fifty dancers, musicians going, that the State
Department curtailing her touring was just the end. 198
After the Dunham Company disbanded in 1965, Dunham returned to the Midwest and
began working within the community of East St. Louis, Illinois. By 1979, Dunham’s memoirs
“A Touch of Innocence” and “Journey to Accompong” were out of print; of Dunham’s dances
inspired by African, Caribbean and American folk forms, only one, Choros, had been performed
by a major company (Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater) since her own company’s last New
York performance in 1962; only two of her former dancers, Charles Moore and Pearl Reynolds,

Beatty, Eartha Kitt and Josephine Premice had achieved national recognition, they were not
identifiable choreographically as “Dunham descendants.” 199
Concern over the loss of Katherine Dunham’s legacy and a desire to preserve and
perpetuate Dunham Technique prompted Albirda Rose, co-founder of the Institute for Dunham
Certification, to codify Dunham’s dance work; this same archival impulse eventually led to the
establishment of the Dunham Technique Seminars. 200 The first Dunham Seminar was held in
1984; by 1990 early efforts to codify Dunham Technique had already begun with the publication
of Rose’s book Dunham Technique: A Way of Life. In 1994, as another means of codification,
instructors began to be certified in Dunham Technique. 201 Other efforts to preserve Dunham’s
dance work were occurring at the Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) which Dunham
established in East St. Louis, IL.
PATC is affiliated with Southern Illinois University, which holds a large collection of
Dunham’s personal and professional papers. The Training Center offers academic, performing
and community service initiatives to the local community. As one of only two groups permitted
to perform Dunham’s choreography, PATC plays a vital role in preserving Dunham Technique.
Other institutions play a role in preserving the Dunham oeuvre, including the Katherine Dunham
Dynamic Museum and the Institute for Intercultural Communication at the Katherine Dunham
Center for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis, MO. 202 University of California, San Diego
literature professor and Dunham scholar Sara E. Johnson suggests that Dunham was “an archivist

at heart,” one whose legacy is forever linked to bridge-building and creating institutions. 203
These Dunham institutions, Johnson argues, like Dunham Technique, are mechanisms for
producing, preserving and disseminating knowledge. “[T]he Dunham Technique, and her vast
corpus of written and film work, function as archives that institutionalized decades of
research.” 204
Given Dunham’s directorship of one of the first African-American dance companies to
tour internationally, her creation of a new dance technique, and a career that spanned close to 70
years, her relatively low profile is cause for critical conjecture. Sara E. Johnson, in her
Introduction to Kaiso!: Writing by and About Katherine Dunham, suggests that it is perhaps the
breadth of Dunham’s accomplishments that is responsible for the underappreciation of her work,
that because Dunham “creat[ed] paths where there were none,” her contributions resist easy
categorization. Dunham, Johnson asserts, “has catalogued, interpreted and transformed New
World, African-derived sensibilities from the vantage point of multiple disciplines, consistently
putting them into dialogue with other epistemological frameworks.” 205
Halifu Osumare, Co-Founder of the Institute for Dunham Certification argues that Dunham’s
anthropological work offsets theoretical deficiencies long current in the study of other cultures
and develops an integrative, participant-oriented approach to fieldwork that was decidedly
postmodern in a time preceding the ubiquity of the term. Dunham’s “research-to-performance”
methodology exemplifies critical innovation; Dunham’s dance work demonstrates that profound
humanism emerges from a deep knowledge of cultural specificity. 206 Dunham’s dance work not

V.B. THE KATHERINE DUNHAM ARCHIVES

The Katherine Dunham Archives are comprised of the Katherine Dunham Collection at the
Library of Congress, The Katherine Dunham Papers, 1919-1968 at Southern Illinois University,
and the Katherine Dunham Correspondence, Contracts and Interviews at New York Public
Library. Materials on Dunham also exist in the archives at the Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in
western Massachusetts and the Missouri History Museum. 208 The Katherine Dunham Collection
at the Library of Congress is a collection of 1,694 still and moving images that document
Dunham’s career including her early anthropological explorations in the 1930s, her work as a
choreographer, her dance technique and teaching method, performances and her anthropological
analysis of the dances and rituals of the African diaspora.

The moving images include

ethnographic footage collected by Dunham of vodun rituals and other dance forms. The Dunham
Technique is captured on several videotapes in the collection, demonstrating Dunham’s teaching
style and providing a glimpse into her methods of transmitting dance knowledge. Many of the
images (both still and moving) are available for remote viewing online.

The Katherine Dunham Papers at Southern Illinois University consist of 50 cubic feet of
correspondence, writings, scripts, notes on dance techniques, and musical scores. Although
personal correspondence comprises the bulk of the collection, some of Dunham’s
anthropological dance notes are also among the papers. The Performing Arts Library at New
York Public Library (NYPL) holds a small collection of Katherine Dunham’s correspondence,
contracts and interviews among their Performing Arts Research Collections. Additional Dunham
materials are held in the Jerome Robbins Dance Division of NYPL and can be found in the
papers of her devotees, Lavinia Williams (Lavinia Williams Papers, 1940-1989) and Dr. Glory
Van Scott (Glory Van Scott Collection, 1974-2000) as well as in the American Ballet Theatre
Archives.
The Dunham archival materials hold sentimental value for those with whom she worked
and who are charged with her legacy. Halifu Osumare suggests that the Dunham archives at
Southern Illinois University are particularly inspiring:
I’ve spent days pouring over those archives [at Southern Illinois]. Programs,
newspaper articles. Things that you just heard about through the grapevine and all
of a sudden you’re seeing letters from famous people that you didn’t even know
she knew. Letters from Langston Hughes. Everyone knew Katherine Dunham.
The general intelligentsia in the world. She was a woman who was so interested
in everything. In culture, in art, in philosophy. She was always engaging the
thinkers of the world. I’m so proud to be carrying on her legacy. There’s no
money in it. It’s always an uphill struggle. But it’s her legacy and it’s so
important that it doesn’t die. 209
Although Dunham’s dancers are aware of these printed materials and moving images, for them it
is primarily footage of Dunham Technique—sanctioned by Dunham herself before her death and
housed at the Library of Congress—that retains research value. That instruction in Dunham

Technique was recorded offers another layer of codification; Dunham’s dancers assert that it is
through this codification that her dance work is fixed and therefore endures.

V.C. THE KATHERINE DUNHAM REPERTOIRE: THE DUNHAM TECHNIQUE

“Dunham Technique is a way of life.” – Katherine Dunham
In her essay, “Notes on the Dance,” Dunham suggests that dance is a constitutive and
foundational determinant in all societies:
The emotional life of any community is clearly legible in its art forms, and
because the dance seeks continuously to capture moments of life in a fusion of
time, space, and motion, the dance is at a given moment the most accurate
chronicler of culture pattern … Alone or in concert man dances his various selves
and his emotions and his dance become a communication as clear as though it
were written or spoken in a universal language. 210
Katherine Dunham described Dunham Technique as “a series of movement patterns, isolations,
progressions and exercises based on primitive rhythms in dance. These patterns create an
awareness of time, space, form and function derived from their most basic interrelationship.
Dunham technique is a series of exercises and movement forms, that if mastered, will flow in a
logical order into a combination of movement and choreographic patterns.” 211 The Technique
has also been used as a tool by both the amateur and professional dancer to facilitate an
understanding of culture.

In asserting the need for Dunham Technique, Dunham said, “The techniques that I knew
and saw and experienced were not saying the things that I wanted to say. I simply could not, with
purely classical ballet, say what I want to say. I could do a story, of course, ballet as you know,
so much ballet is just a narrative, but to capture the meaning in the culture, in the life of the
people, I felt that I had to take something directly from the people and develop that.” 212
Dunham traveled to Haiti, Martinique, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico and Brazil
to better understand the cultural significance of movement. While there, she used a movie
camera to capture the ceremonies she was permitted to view. Of this experience Dunham said,
And of course it was rather difficult for me because already I was infringing on
some of their taboos by being there. Some of the time I was where women were
not normally permitted to be. Some of the time I was where outsiders and
strangers were not permitted to be. And, um, I had to overcome that and at the
same time they did not know what was in this box that I carried and pointed at
them. But like most people in societies other than their own, they don’t like to
have things pointed at them. So I had to find a way to fix that camera so it could
be taking and recording what they were doing without making them
uncomfortable. And this was my big task; I haven’t quite overcome it. There are
times when I still film and feel that I’m intruding. 213
During her field work, Dunham found that certain dances had specific form and specific
function within a given culture. L’Ag’Ya, for example, incorporates the mysteries of vodun
religion. L’Ag’Ya is a full ballet about being put under the spell of another. Its story is one that
exists in other cultures (primarily European cultures); as such, there is a similarity in story style.
Dunham, however, set the story in Martinique and embedded Martiniquias culture and form.

This cultural significance is immediately apparent in the ballet.214 This transmission of culture
through anthropologically and culturally informed dance work forms the core of the Dunham
Technique. This work was—and still is—essential; American slavery broke cultural bonds and
induced enduring cultural disruptions. Dunham sought to restore them.

For me, I came up during Civil Rights and because I was a dancer I was exposed
to African-Haitian, African, African-American culture through dance. In those
forms you begin to find out something about the person who designed those forms
and what was going on in those forms. So Haitian was my first knowledge base
and Haitian culture was so similar to what I knew about my own ancestry. My
ancestry comes out of New Orleans in Louisiana. When I first went there with
them in the 1960s nobody spoke English, everybody spoke Creole. It was a direct
relationship to be directly involved in the Haitian culture. Not only in terms of the
dance forms but also the linguistic connections to the Yoruba tradition, the Ise
religion. So many links were destroyed during slavery but the context of the
language and the rhythmic concepts of the blues and gospels and spirituals you
begin to see that transferred knowledge. So what Miss Dunham was able to bring
to dance, there was a definite transference of knowledge from one cultural center
to another. 215
This attention to cultural transmission fundamental to Dunham Technique took a specific and
distinctive form. There are three theoretical models developed by Dunham each of which is
necessary to properly execute Dunham Technique. They are: Form and Function, Intercultural
Communication and Socialization through the Arts. 216 These theories formed what Dunham
referred to as “The System,” which was the foundation of Dunham Technique.
Used primarily to understand discrete dances and specific dance movement, Dunham’s
theory of Form and Function unthreads the ways dance relates to the overall cultural patterns
inherent in a given culture’s belief system. Dunham understood that movement has a particular
form based on a specific function in a given set of circumstances; translating this cultural

knowledge into staged dances for Dunham precipitated cultural exchange. Information, she
believed, was being passed from her choreographic research to her dancers and then, through
them, to the audience. 217 Explicating this in 1941, Dunham wrote that, “In the funeral dance the
externalization of grief; the social dances, exhibitionism and sexual selection along with social
cohesion; in the ceremonial dances, group ‘ethos’ solidarity in an established mechanism of
worship, whether through hypnosis, hysteria, or ecstasy.” 218 L’Ag’Ya is only one example of
many ballets in which Dunham depicts a way of life and its underlying belief system. L’Ag’Ya
was, for Dunham, the first stage of developing and understanding the importance of form and
function.
Dunham’s theory of Intercultural Communication builds on the theory of Form and
Function. This method is used as a means for gaining a universal understanding and acceptance
of others. Dunham believed that through dance, information could be gathered about one’s own
culture and the cultures of others. In describing Dunham’s work, Joyce Aschenbrenner gestures
at this epistimolgical argument saying, “without such communication, [Dunham] can be neither
anthropologist nor artist, since the conscious mental set of her audience is foreign to the insights
she tries to convey.” 219 As an anthropologist, Dunham recognized the intersection of movement
and life patterns; the dance work she saw in the Caribbean was linked to specific cultural
perceptions of life and preparations for life events such as birth, love and death.

Predictably, these two theoretical models lead to the third, Socialization through the Arts.
Dunham used this model to train people as both artists and communicators. Dunham believed
that, given the opportunity, people would learn important information about themselves through
the art forms of their given culture(s), situating them within a global context and again promoting
intercultural awareness and appreciation. 220
Dunham Technique, while it consists of a system of learnable and transferable qualities,
is also dynamic; it continues to incorporate and merge methods of teaching style and application
from earlier generations with the contemporary ideas, methods and philosophies which emanated
from and were taught by Katherine Dunham. 221 Albirda Rose, co-Founder of the Institute for
Dunham Certification, asserts that the Dunham Technique “allows one to understand a culture,
or many cultures, through dance. [Dunham] found that an understanding of different cultures
takes place when one is immersed in the culture. Through experiencing other ways of living,
especially through the dances, knowledge is acquired.” 222 This assertion that dance is one way of
knowing about culture lays the groundwork for a discussion of how the codification and
transmission of culturally informed movement—such as the Dunham Technique—is a potential
archival mode for preserving or safeguarding performed heritage.

V.D. THE ARCHIVE AND THE REPERTOIRE

“Long before the written word, information was stored in bodies, in cultural memories, and in
oral traditions, enacted only in their performances.” 223

As is discussed in the Literature Review of this dissertation, Library and Information Science
scholar and Drexel University Assistant Professor Deborah Turner argues that, viewed through
the theoretical lens of social constructionism, documents can be oral. Turner’s concept of oral
documents complements and extends the assertion made in the previous chapter: the evidentiary
properties of the record supersede its need to be text-based.
Turner’s assertion is based on the premise that document studies, with its focus on
tangible forms of evidence, has allowed information scholars to “better understand issues
involved in the systematic transmission, storage, and retrieval of informational objects.”224
Turner posits that a recent increase in the use of social constructionist theory (which emphasizes
the significance of language and its centrality to the production of knowledge) among library and
information science scholars is related to an increase in work that recognizes that information
made available orally plays an essential role in knowledge production. Turner’s work in orality
and knowledge production concludes that the transmission of oral information leads to
knowledge-based outcomes similar to those of physical documents; that is, information—
regardless of format—is transmitted, and knowledge is constructed from that transmission. 225
Turner’s work focuses on orality in institutional settings. She holds that “orality not only
helps reflect and maintain institutional contexts, it simultaneously perpetuates them.”226
Historian and anthropologist Jan Vansina, whose work focuses on African societies prior to
colonization, asserts that the oral tradition plays a dual function in representing both the past and

the present. 227 Taken together, Turner and Vansina’s arguments suggest that information passed
through non-textual means is capable of maintaining and perpetuating institutional contexts
while also representing the past. These two capabilities—maintaining context and representing
the past—are both key foundational concepts in North American archivy. Extending this
argument to information transmitted through gestural means, one can begin to construct an
understanding of how the Dunham Technique, a codified repertoire of cultural information
transmitted through gesture (dance), functions in ways similar to conventional, brick and mortar
archives: these codified, information-rich gestures form a vocabulary. This dance vocabulary is
rendered “readable” through the same kinds of visual literacies one uses to “read” sign language
and various other forms of artistic expression, and these readable vocabularies, which convey
meaning, function as gestural documents, much the same as Turner’s oral documents. This
argument for “reading gesture” as a document or a record is reinforced by a demonstrated
national interest in gesture and sign-language recognition. As stated in the previous chapter, as
long ago as 1998, the National Science Foundation’s Digital Libraries Initiative (Phase II)
received in excess of 400 applications, many of which were requests to fund studies on human
motion, gesture recognition and sign-language recognition in digital environments. 228 The term
“recognition” in a digital environment can be seen as synonymous with the term for “human”
gesture recognition: visual literacy.
Visual literacy refers to the ability to understand visual forms of communication. As with
other types of literacy, visual literacy in artistic terms is concerned with form, context and

content. 229 Defining these terms, form refers to the arrangement of the visual elements or the
formal qualities of the image; content concerns the “sensory, subjective, psychological or
emotional properties in response to an image” such as the emotional or intellectual message;
while context indicates the set of circumstances or facts that surround a given event, including
historical information about the artist or issues referenced in the art. 230 Visual literacy suggests
that images, or what is seen, can be read and that meaning can be communicated through visual
cues. Those who create visual images—such as choreographers—do so purposefully. In order to
“read” or analyze an image, the audience must be able to understand the artist’s purpose and
recognize the techniques that have been used. In dance terms, this means that the form of dance
must have recognizable elements that have been codified, or set, and can be combined and
repeated in any order, retaining their meaning even as context shifts. For Katherine Dunham,
codification was a means of “fixing” her dance vocabulary—it was an opportunity to allow a
culturally informed movement speak for itself and to (re)present and reinvigorate the cultural
traditions of African diaspora peoples most at risk for loss or obsolescence.
In addition to visual literacy, this chapter has made several references to the codification
of Dunham Technique. Codification is a legal and linguistic term that refers to the act or process
of arranging something in a systematic form. Codification may also denote the result of such an
act or process of arrangement. Linguistically, codification indicates that a language has been
standardized, that it now adheres to a norm and that it can be read and understood by those who
possess the proper literacy tools. Normalizing and standardizing a movement vocabulary has
similar implications. For example, ballet—also a concert dance form like Dunham Technique—

was codified in the 17th century in the French courts of Louis XIV. Ballet enjoys its own
vocabulary which is based on French terminology; as a result, those conversant in ballet
terminology can hear a command for a jeté and know immediately that they are expected to
jump. 231 Likewise, when one sees a ballet dancer execute a jeté it is instantly recognizable as
such. A jeté is comparable to a single word in the ballet lexicon. Combined with other “words”
or codified gestures, a series of dance movements form a sentence, also recognizable as a
“phrase.” Indeed, phrase is a dance term for exactly this—a series of connected movements
which transmit meaning. In the Dunham lexicon, for example “fall and recover” is a phrase, both
linguistic and gestural, recently codified by Dunham’s dancers. The phrase requires a release at
the midsection dropping the head to the floor, and a subsequent recovery to a standing
position. 232 As scholars in the Arts Media and Engineering program at Arizona State University
assert, “Phrases are a sequence of movements that exist at a higher semantic abstraction than
gestures. The problem [of phrasal detection] is important since phrasal structure in dance plays a
key role in communicating meaning.” 233 This understanding of phrasal structure in movement as
capable of conveying meaning mirrors Deborah Turner’s assertion that meaning can be
transmitted through oral documents. This chapter further argues that, like text-based and oral
documents, a gestural document—one comprised of codified gestures or phrases—is capable not
only of communicating meaning, but also of serving the archival functions of maintaining and
preserving context and representing the past. For Dunham Technique, the meaning and context

are specifically cultural. Dunham sought to restore a cultural past to a group of people from
whom history, traditions, cultural expressions and cultural identity had been violently wrenched
through the offenses of slavery. Codification of Dunham Technique renders it effective as a
gestural document, allowing it to be read and understood visually. It is a mode of cultural
communication which is encompassed in Taylor’s definition of the repertoire. In speaking to the
need to codify Dunham Technique, Point Park Dunham instructor Ron Hutson asserts:
That’s one of the things that gives ballet and modern dance such dignity, is that
there is this whole body of recorded information on them. They are all codified.
And people don’t look at Afrocentric dance forms, art forms, as having this kind
of codification. 234
Hutson is correct in his analysis. Dance critics from the 1940s through the mid-1960s, when
Dunham’s company disbanded, categorized her choreographic work as “Negro” or tribal dance,
subtly implying in their reviews that these dance forms—and Dunham’s work—lacked the
seriousness and “high art” qualities of their Western counterparts. For example, Dunham was a
contemporary of John Martin, who is widely regarded as the most influential dance critic in the
United States. Of Dunham (and Dunham Technique), Martin wrote in The New York Times:
This is quite in character with the essence of the Negro dance itself. There is
nothing pretentious about it; it is not designed to delve into philosophy or
psychology but to externalize the impulses of a high-spirited, rhythmic and
gracious race. That Miss Dunham's dances accomplish this end so beautifully can
mean only that she has actually isolated the elements of the folk art upon which
more consciously created and sophisticate forms can be built as time goes on.
This is cultural pioneering of a unique sort. 235
In part as a result of this perception of Afro-Caribbean dance as primitive and unsophisticated,
and the knowledge that codification contributes to a sense of institutional and societal credence,

codification of Dunham’s repertoire is the primary way in which Dunham’s dancers continue her
legacy and preserve the Dunham Technique.
Initial codification of Dunham Technique was done by Katherine Dunham with the help
of Albirda Rose. In 1986, Albirda Rose spent six months with Katherine Dunham poring over
her materials in preparation for writing Dunham Technique: A Way of Life. As part of this
process, Rose endeavored to work with Master Instructors of Dunham Technique to codify the
terminology of Dunham Technique. 236 Joyce Aschenbrenner’s book Katherine Dunham:
Dancing a Life, a critical study of Dunham’s work, had previously been published by the
Congress on Research in Dance (CORD), and Rose used these choreographic critiques of
Dunham’s work from the 1940s through the 1960s along with the drawings and descriptions of
Dunham Technique (sketched by Dunham dancer Lavinia Williams) which appeared as an
appendix in the back of the book. 237 Dunham’s lesson plans and curriculum from the Performing
Arts Training Center and video footage of instruction in Dunham Technique and Dunham
Company rehearsals rounded out Rose’s data collection. Of this process, Rose says:
I started looking at that and comparing that and reading some materials. That with
my observations in classes and from the seminars, then with my peers we would
sit down and write. We had to write out the exercises that we were taught and we
had to draw them. This was the start of Dunham Technique: A Way of Life the
book that I wrote. It was a codification of some of the basic terminology
Katherine Dunham used. The necessity of that terminology came out of, well
what we on the West Coast called ‘fall and recovery,’ Ruth Beckford called ‘fall
and return.’ So it was different things like that in codifying terminology – second
position, pliés, the placement of the hand. 238
Dunham dancer Ruth Beckford has said that there are three generations of Dunham Technique.
By the time Rose wrote Dunham Technique: A Way of Life, she was able to discuss a 4th

generation of Dunham Technique that began with the Dunham Seminars and continued until
Dunham’s death. Rose asserts that the 4th generation of Dunham dancers are the last generation
to be trained by Katherine Dunham herself, and that one is able, when looking at these dancers
compared to Dunham’s dancers in the 1940s, to see the evolution of Dunham Technique over
time. 239 For example, Dunham’s dance company performs in the opening credits of the 1957
movie Mambo; later in the film is footage of a dance class that is representative of Level 1
Dunham Technique (which is no longer taught). To the trained eye, compared with the archival
footage at Library of Congress, the differences are striking. This, then, raises questions about
codification and authenticity. What is the true Dunham Technique? Rose asserts,
People who studied at the center in New York or people who danced with her,
now I’m hearing this word being thrown out ‘authentic’ Dunham. If you danced
Dunham long enough you would understand that that word is a difficult word
because Miss Dunham did not stay static for the 95 years she was alive. She did
not stay static. Every year we would come to that seminar, Miss Dunham had
something new and different and in-depth that she was reaching for, not only on a
technical level but also on a cultural level and what I would classify as a spiritual
level. 240
In an effort to guarantee that Dunham Technique is codified and transmitted in a unified
voice, ensuring that Dunham Technique endures is now handled by committee. Theo Jamison,
Keith Williams and Rachel Tavernier, all trained by Dunham at the Performing Arts Training
Center in East St. Louis, currently head the Institute for Dunham Certification. 241 There is, as
well, a DVD of Dunham Technique housed at the Library of Congress. Together with Rose’s
book, the DVD and the embodied knowledge of Dunham’s dancers create additional layers of

codification. 242 Codification, again, is an attempt to bring all of Dunham’s work under the same
umbrella: it is a way to make it last and to perpetuate the work. 243 Along with Jamison and
Williams, Rose wrote a manual for Dunham Certification that provides a pedagogical basis for
an elementary Dunham class. This manual provides descriptors of the Technique and standards
for instructors to follow. 244 Of codification and certification, Albirda Rose asserts:
There is a vocabulary [of Dunham Technique]. It is codified. We, at the Institute
for Dunham Certification, are in the process of writing down all the elements of a
proper beginning Dunham Technique class, a proper intermediate Dunham
Technique class and an advanced level. Some of that was written down during
Miss Dunham’s time here. Some of it was not, so we’re in the process of doing
that. We do have a DVD that she sanctioned with the various levels of the
Technique … so we have that to go on. We have notes that she left with the people
that went to the Library of Congress and taped that particular DVD. We are
currently getting down on paper all of the various exercises that go with each
level. 245
Dancers being considered for certification in Dunham Technique go through a rigorous program
that begins with understanding how dance, society and culture are intertwined. One must have
previous dance training in Dunham Technique and evidence a working knowledge of the
Dunham vocabulary. Certification involves pedagogical training, peer education, written
examinations based on an established Dunham bibliography and the money to afford attending
annual certification seminars for several years running (they cost $475/week). During Dunham’s
lifetime, she alone certified instructors. This work, too, now falls to a select, hand-picked group
of her most devoted dancers including Albirda Rose and Halifu Osumare. 246

Dunham Technique effectively represents Diana Taylor’s repertoire. Upon closer
inspection, however, one can see the ways in which Dunham Technique functions in relationship
with the Dunham Archives. Dunham Technique consists of a series of codified, culturally
informed phrases which can be read as a gestural document. Like other archival records, this
gestural document is capable of maintaining and preserving cultural context as well as
representing a culturally-informed past. The Dunham Archives satisfy a societal need to maintain
the tangible aspects of Dunham Technique and the Dunham Technique itself, as repertoire,
satisfies a similar societal need to maintain movement within a cultural context. As Dunhamtrained Point Park University dance professor Ron Hutson suggests, to properly safeguard
Dunham Technique, a marriage of archive and repertoire is essential:
There’s no question for me that Dunham’s true archive is in her dancers’ bodies. I
think that the written word has value, I am a scholar, but I think some people who
are in the field of dance are totally body-oriented and I think some of us, and I
think that we are fortunate, are physically as well as verbally oriented and
expressive. The scholarly aspects, the written aspects, are important. It helps
people who haven’t danced – and even people who have danced – understand
dance … There’s a place for that. But there’s a transference of information from
body to body that’s very much like oral traditions. Oral tradition has been
important since the dawn of time, and even though we write things down now, we
codify, the oral tradition still works. From body to body as a learning tool, that
still works too. 247
Around the globe one can find examples of codified gestures which, with the proper visual
literacy, can be read, understood and used to transmit knowledge. As previously suggested in this
chapter, sign language is one such example, and, as Hutson affirms, ballet is another. Like sign
language and ballet, Dunham Technique is comprised of a set vocabulary of movements which
can be combined in varying ways to convey meaning and transmit knowledge.

V.E. SUMMARY

Archives currently support the maintenance and preservation of Dunham Technique through
collecting tangible artifacts. Although this collecting takes place in conversation with Dunham
dancers, when archives take custody, Dunham Technique, like any performed art, is flattened,
becomes two-dimensional and is relegated to folders, boxes and shelves. Even the materials
made available online lack the three-dimensionality of live performance.
As with the Virtual Vaudeville prototype, the Dunham case suggests that to have
performance endure, information professionals must allow artists to maintain their own work in
the most appropriate ways. In the case of the Dunham archives, it is these two-dimensional traces
of Dunham’s work that are maintained by archival repositories while the broader cultural
heritage dimensions of Dunham’s work survive in the minds and bodies of her dancers. The
apparent duality between archive and repertoire meet here: Dunham’s work endures because of
both archive and repertoire, each informing the other and tempering any gaps between them.
Taking an advisory rather than a custodial role and providing the necessary infrastructures—such
as standards and built systems—is one way that archives can help to safeguard performed acts
and other articulations of intangible cultural heritage. The United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization has modeled this non-custodial relationship in the policy document
that is the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. As is discussed
in the following chapter, one can see evidence of this relationship at work in the countries that
have ratified and deployed the Convention.

VI. THE UNITED NATIONS SCIENTIFIC, CULTURAL AND
EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION’S 2003 CONVENTION FOR THE
SAFEGUARDING OF INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE

This chapter examines the ways that archives support or are otherwise involved in the
deployment of UNESCO’s 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural
Heritage. Approaching the discussion of archive and repertoire from a global perspective, the
chapter offers a close reading of three interpretations of the Convention—Belgium, the Canadian
province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and Trinidad and Tobago. Also discussed are the
relationships between and among UNESCO as a large, Western, policy-driven organization,
national governments, heritage communities and cultural heritage institutions. Finally, the
chapter considers the affordances of collaboration in safeguarding performed works.
The chapter provides an overview of UNESCO, defines “intangible cultural heritage” and
unpacks the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Next, it
explores, in depth, three distinct efforts to deploy the Convention, arguing that it is dispersed
models, such as UNESCO, that most successfully navigate the space between archive and
repertoire. Finally, the chapter offers interventions for contemporary archivy inspired by the
UNESCO model.
The case study employs data from: interviews with representatives from the Ministry of
the Arts and Multiculturalism and culture-bearers from Trinidad and Tobago; an interview with
112

the Intangible Cultural Heritage Development Officer for the province of Newfoundland and
Labrador; documents obtained directly from UNESCO officers in Trinidad and Tobago and
Belgium; the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage and
supporting documents from UNESCO; recordings of ICH elements from UNESCO; historical
newspapers; and an array of secondary sources.

VI.A. UNESCO

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was
established in 1945 after World War II. UNESCO’s founding was based on the belief that in the
face of two world wars in one generation, “political and economic agreements are not enough to
build a lasting peace.” That, instead, “peace must be established on the basis of humanity’s moral
and intellectual solidarity.” UNESCO’s mission is to build networks among nations that enable
solidarity through (1) mobilizing for education, (2) building intercultural understanding, (3)
pursuing scientific cooperation and (4) protecting freedom of expression. 248
UNESCO is governed by a General Conference, which comprises the representatives of
UNESCO's Member States. The General Conference meets every two years; each country has
one vote, regardless of size or contribution to the UNESCO budget. UNESCO’s General
Conference sets policies and establishes work for the Organization. It is empowered to determine
both programming and budget; elect members of the Executive Board; and appoint, every four

113

years, the UNESCO Director-General. 249 UNESCO’s Executive Board is comprised of fiftyeight members elected by the General Conference. UNESCO’s website notes that, “skillful
negotiations may be needed before a balance is reached among the different regions of the world
in a way that will reflect the universality of the Organization.” 250 Headquartered in Paris, France,
UNESCO is a large, policy-driven organization that provides oversight and acts in an advisory
capacity. Despite claims about the “universality of the Organization,” involvement with
UNESCO is a politically and financially complex affair. The United States is just one of several
nations not represented in UNESCO’s General Conference. The choice of these representatives,
while largely a reflection of the diversity of the cultures they represent, is also fraught with
political complexities. For example, in November 2013, the United States lost its vote in
UNESCO’s General Assembly after two years of non-payment of UNESCO dues. The U.S.
withdrew financial contributions to UNESCO in 2011 over a disagreement about the admission
of Palestine as a full UNESCO member. Despite concerns that the move “[undermines]
America’s ability to exercise its influence in countries around the globe through [UNESCO’s]
educational and aid programs,” and concerns at UNESCO over the loss of its largest source of
external funding, the United States’ and UNESCO’s hands were effectively tied by their own
policies. In the U.S., Congress enacted laws in the 1990s decreeing that the United States stop
providing money to any United Nations agency that extends an offer of full membership to
Palestine. Under UNESCO’s constitution, any country that fails to pay dues for two years loses

General Conference and sees that its decisions are properly carried out. The functions and
responsibilities of the Executive Board are derived primarily from the Constitution and from rules or
directives laid down by the General Conference.

its vote in the UNESCO General Assembly. 251 As a result of this history, U.S. archival theory
and practice is largely absent from the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible
Cultural Heritage; the Convention was already in the works when the U.S. rejoined UNESCO in
2002 after an 18-year absence. The political and financial ramifications of this are wide-ranging
as well; the United States has effectively de-funded its interest in UNESCO, contributing to a
sense of the “West and the rest” in implementing the 2003 Convention. It is important to keep
the reality of these complexities in mind when traversing the interconnected network of
UNESCO’s intangible cultural heritage Convention.

VI.B. INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE

Intangible cultural heritage is a term that has emerged out of the varying proclamations,
recommendations, conventions, charters, and codes addressing cultural heritage issues over the
past century. UNESCO conceives of intangible cultural heritage (ICH) as “a living form of
heritage which is continuously recreated and which evolves as we adapt our practices and
traditions in response to our environment. It provides a sense of identity and belonging in
relation to our own cultures.” 252

UNESCO’s definition of intangible cultural heritage

encompasses oral traditions and expressions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive
events, knowledge and practices concerning universe and nature, and traditional craftsmanship.
Further, “[t]his intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is

constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their
interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and
continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.” 253
The government of Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern region of Belgium (a country
whose ICH policies and relationship with UNESCO are explored at length in this chapter), notes
that ICH
encompasses those habits, customs, knowledge and practices that are inherited by
a community or group or can be placed in a historic continuum, and which the
community or group decides in consensus to be sufficiently important to be
transmitted to future generations. It always concerns intangible and therefore
immaterial expressions of the interaction between man and his environment.
Intangible cultural heritage is dynamic. As it evolves in time and interacts with
the environment, it assumes new meanings and its use or function changes. The
designation as intangible cultural heritage is linked to time and place. 254
In addition to recognizing the temporal and spatial affordances of intangible cultural heritage, it
is also important to note what intangible cultural heritage is not. In her 2004 article, “Intangible
Cultural Heritage as Metacultural Production,” anthropologist, museologist and performance
studies scholar Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett complicates UNESCO’s concepts of intangible
cultural heritage, invoking “high” and “low culture”:
Thus, the Bolshoi ballet and Metropolitan Opera do not and are not likely to make
the list, but Nôgaku, which is not a minority or indigenous cultural form, does
make the list. All three involve formal training, use scripts, are the products of
literate cultures, and transmit embodied knowledge from one performer to
another. […] By admitting cultural forms associated with royal courts and statesponsored temples, as long as they are not European, the intangible heritage list
preserves the division between the West and the rest and produces a phantom list

of intangible heritage, a list of that which is not indigenous, not minority, and not
non-Western, though no less intangible. 255
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett’s assertions about “high”/”low culture” and indigenous cultural forms
coupled with a growing sense of the “West and the rest,” in deploying the Convention, speak
specifically to the inherent complexities that arise when a large, functionally Western
organization writes broad-stroke global policies such as the 2003 Convention for the
Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

VI.C. THE 2003 CONVENTION FOR THE SAFEGUARDING OF INTANGIBLE
CULTURAL HERITAGE

In the 1990s, a reorientation occurred in UNESCO's approach to folklore, away from a
European-inspired archival model to an East-Asian paradigm most commonly associated with
“living national treasures” programs in Japan and Korea. This reorientation reflected widespread
disappointment with UNESCO’s 1989 Recommendation for the Safeguarding of Traditional
Culture and Folklore and growing dissatisfaction with the 1972 UNESCO Convention
Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Along with its
predecessors, such as UNESCO's Living Human Treasures program and the Proclamation of
Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, the 2003 Convention is a
response to this dissatisfaction. Another reason for a reorientation was UNESCO’s conclusion
that globalization and social transformation frequently lead to deterioration, disappearance and
destruction of intangible cultural heritage, largely the result of insufficient mechanisms for
Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, “Intangible Cultural Heritage as Metacultural Production,” Museum
Studies International 56, nos. 221-222 (2004): 57.

255

117

safeguarding or protecting ICH from obsolescence. On the other hand, however, UNESCO
recognizes that globalization frequently creates opportunities to appreciate, support and enrich
cultural diversity. The 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage
serves to complement the 1972 World Heritage Convention.
The 2003 Convention was adopted with four stated purposes: (1) to safeguard the
ICH; (2) to ensure respect for the ICH of the communities, groups and individuals concerned; (3)
to raise awareness at the local, national and international levels of the importance of ICH,
ensuring mutual appreciation; and (4) to provide for international cooperation and assistance. 256
The Convention is an interventive tool; it is a normative model which at the same time raises
issues of value, threat, and moral obligation and informs people's relationships to their own
cultural practices. As such, the Convention was conceived as a “permissive document;” much of
the language in the text of the Convention is non-prescriptive. The Convention was designed to
allow national governments flexibility in their approaches to implementation. Although loosely
defined, the Convention does require ratifying States Parties to adopt “appropriate measures” at
the national and international level to “encourage and foster all forms of international
cooperation aimed at safeguarding intangible cultural heritage” (UNESCO, 2003).
Finally, in Articles 11 through 15 the Convention imposes a number of obligations on
States that ratify the Convention. 257 Specifically, the obligations outlined in the Convention and
in the Operational Directives for implementation are that States Parties are required to:
•

take necessary measures to ensure safeguarding of intangible cultural
heritage present in its territory

budget of UNESCO).
periodically submit reports to the Intergovernmental Committee on the
legislative, regulatory and other measures taken to implement the
Convention. These reports include information on the status of all ICH
elements that have been inscribed on the Representative List and the
Urgent Safeguarding List. 258

The Convention mandates that States Parties pursue policies that value intangible cultural
heritage because, per UNESCO, intangible cultural heritage is a mainspring of cultural diversity
and a guarantee of sustainable development. 259 Each ratifying country has chosen to deploy the
Convention differently. A key component of the Convention is a mandate that consideration of
an ICH element for safeguarding originate from the group or community in whose hands care of
the cultural “object” currently falls. In this way, UNESCO hopes to remove the possibility of
cultural appropriation and the intentional misuse of cultural heritage.
As detailed below, in deploying the Convention, most of the reporting States have
responded to the requirements of the 2003 Convention by introducing new legislation and/or
revising existing legislation. A common legislative goal is to fulfill the UNESCO mandate to
establish a national inventorying system. Setting safeguarding policies is another common

objective of new legislation. In some cases, the new legislation also establishes a new institution
or designates an existing one to safeguard intangible cultural heritage. 260
Although the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage is not
flawless, it is the only existing international document of its kind. In what is often a three-stage
process, the Convention has been accepted, approved or ratified by 161 nations, notably
excluding many large English-speaking countries, namely the United States, Canada, Australia
and the United Kingdom. It was most recently ratified by the Bahamas in May 2014. 261

VI.D. DEPLOYMENT OF THE 2003 CONVENTION FOR THE SAFEGUARDING OF
INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE
VI.D.1. Belgium

VI.D.1.a. About Belgium Belgium is a Federal State and cultural policy is set by linguistic
region. Each of the three linguistic Communities—Flemish, French and German-speaking—
displays independence in their approach to safeguarding intangible cultural heritage and is
responsible for the cultural policy in their respective linguistic regions.
While each linguistic region governs its own policy to implement the Convention,
structures are also in place to promote the exchange of information. For example, the Agency for
UNESCO, “Examination of the reports of States Parties on the implementation of the Convention and
on the Current Status of Elements Inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural
Heritage of Humanity,” (Report of the 8th Session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the
Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, Baku, Azerbaijan, December 2013).
261
Despite an apparent reluctance on the part of the United States to adopt or ratify the 2003 UNESCO
Convention, the U.S. enjoys a rich history of intangible cultural heritage. Among the many intangible
heritage claims the U.S. could add to UNESCO’s ever-growing list are the annual Mardi-Gras
celebration in New Orleans, the Philadelphia Mummers and the rich body of living history and war
reenactors that populate U.S. national parks and engage a sense of national pride.
260

120

Arts and Heritage is responsible for preparing, implementing and evaluating the intangible
cultural heritage policy. 262 The Flemish and French Communities are also partly responsible for
the cultural policy in the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. This division of
responsibility results in three different kinds of cultural policies and initiatives.

By law,

however, the three Communities must seek consensus; this was applicable, for example, in 2006
when Belgium ratified the UNESCO 2003 Convention on Safeguarding Intangible Cultural
Heritage. This is also the case for proposing elements for the Convention’s Representative List,
the Urgent Safeguarding List and for the Register of Best Practices. Belgium’s three linguistic
Communities must speak in one voice in UNESCO’s ICH General Assembly and
Intergovernmental Committee. The Flemish Community participated actively in the creation of
the 2003 ICH Convention, together with the French Community under the Belgian flag. Due, in
part, to the high level of ICH activity in the Flemish Community and, in part, to the willingness
of representatives of the Flemish Community to participate in this study, this chapter specifically
considers the efforts of Belgium’s Flemish Community to deploy the 2003 ICH Convention. 263

VI.D.1.b.

The Government of Flanders: Deploying the Convention

In 2010 the

Government of Flanders instituted their Policy on Intangible Cultural Heritage. The ICH policy

offers ‘communities, groups and individuals’ involved in intangible cultural
heritage opportunities to recognise [sic], designate and transmit the intangible
cultural heritage; focuses on identifying, inventorying and documenting the
intangible cultural heritage; provides an international reference framework of the
intangible cultural heritage in Flanders; allows expertise to be shared and
knowledge to be exchanged with cultural heritage communities in Flanders and

121

elsewhere in the world by focusing on the processes of appropriation and the
transmission of intangible cultural heritage. By doing this, the Flemish
Community carries out a (safe)guarding policy. 264
When first developing ICH policies, the Flemish Community in Belgium began by
working from existing popular culture policies which primarily addressed transmittable
traditions, customs, knowledge and techniques. A 1997 Cultural Heritage Act defined and
recognized both “popular culture” and “intangible cultural heritage” and worked in tandem with
two Flemish non-profit organizations—the Vlaams Centrum voor Volkscultuur (the Flemish
Centre for Popular Culture) and Tapis Plein, a non-profit heritage organization subsidized by the
Government of Flanders—to raise public awareness and set the stage for the 2003 UNESCO ICH
Convention. 265

With traveling exhibits, children and youth workshops, an educational

publication, training sessions and an interactive website, Flanders’s “Un-Touchable” project
targeted children and youth, asking them critical questions about the endurance of their traditions
and customs.
The 1997 Flemish Parliament Act on Cultural Heritage introduced another term in
Flemish heritage policy that would impact a forthcoming ICH policy: the term “heritage
communities.” The Flemish Parliament Act on Cultural Heritage defines a heritage community
as a “community that consists of organisations [sic] and/or individuals who value specific

Schauvliege, Minister for Environment, Nature and Culture of the Government of Flanders, published
the paper [Vision Paper — ‘A Policy for Intangible Cultural Heritage in Flanders’] at the end of 2010.
Since then, it is considered to be one of the key texts for decisions within the cultural heritage field, and
serves as the basis for further development of the policy for the intangible cultural heritage within the
Flemish Community.

122

aspects of cultural heritage which they wish, within the framework of public action, to sustain
and transmit to future generations.” 266
In Belgium, heritage is considered collective property. Heritage communities must come
to consensus on the meaning and function of their cultural expressions. The designation of a
cultural expression as “heritage,” then, is temporally fixed and defined by both geography and
community. This conceptual fluidity allows for subsequent generations to reconsider the value of
a given cultural expression, thereby meeting another requirement of UNESCO’s ICH
Convention: that communities be responsible for designating their own heritage and determining
its cultural value. 267
In deploying the 2003 ICH Convention, the government of Flanders, Belgium began, as
UNESCO mandates, with a national inventory. Flanders responded to the UNESCO ICH
Convention by introducing regulations, such as The Flemish Parliament Act on Cultural
Heritage, on the basis of which the Inventaris Vlaanderen voor Immaterieel Cultureel Erfgoed
(Inventory of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Flanders) could be created. The Inventaris
Vlaanderen (Flanders Inventory) served as an awareness-raising mechanism in regards to the
communities, groups and individuals concerned. At the same time, it addressed requirements for
inclusion on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
As will be discussed later in this chapter, in Belgium—as in other nations—inclusion in the
Inventaris Vlaanderen or on a UNESCO list is considered especially important. 268
In terms of performance, Flanders maintains a network of experts for cultural heritage
that falls within the field of performing arts, inclusive of music as well as theatre and dance.

Because these forms are also comprised of “important movable heritage such as archives and
collections,” there are several networks or “nuclei of expertise.” 269 For the arts sector,
collaboration with the Muziekcentrum Vlaanderen (Flanders Music Centre) and the Vlaams
Theater Instituut (Flemish Theatre Institute)—which also includes dance—is necessary. Similar
partnerships with the amateur arts sector are also required. 270 The Government of Flanders
expects a Flemish Community cultural heritage organization to devote attention “not only to the
movable heritage (such as archives and objects), but also to the intangible cultural heritage which
belongs to performing art.” 271
The Flemish Parliament Act on Cultural Heritage introduces a practical and theoretical
model whereby one designated organization is subsidized, and serves to anchor a heritage
community: that is, to guide the heritage community and to maintain and disseminate knowledge
and expertise. Archives, libraries and museums, as cultural heritage institutions, are expected to
fulfill this function, and are mandated to make available the disciplinary knowledge they have at
their disposal. In Flanders, the government aims to create a network of cultural heritage
organizations which addresses all aspects of preservation and access, and which negotiates the
relationship between heritage communities and the general public. 272 The organizations within
this network prepare and draft application files for inclusion in the Flemish ICH inventory and
on UNESCO ICH lists and registers. As such, Flemish cultural heritage centers, organizations for
popular culture, and nationally recognized museums and archives are required to share their
knowledge and expertise with heritage communities, fulfill the aforementioned anchor function
and develop activities that are culturally relevant for all of Flanders. There is an additional

international education and outreach mandate as well; these institutions are expected to elaborate
ICH activities in an international context, provide heritage communities with access to
international expertise and encourage the heritage community to develop best practices. 273
To achieve these goals, the Government of Flanders has proposed creating an ICH
database. This relational database would house inventories; place a central focus on interaction;
allow for the exchange of knowledge and expertise; and emphasize individual elements as well
as relationships between and among ICH elements. As it is currently conceived, data entry would
fall to the heritage communities, assisted by cultural heritage organizations. Archives, libraries
and museums are expected to support heritage communities’ safeguarding decisions; establish
links with experts; identify other elements with similar characteristics; and work with heritage
communities to “transmit processes that belong to the same heritage group.” At the same time,
these institutions will be asked to define projects based on data in the database and ensure an
appropriate clustering of elements and best practices. The database will be managed by a
consortium (“whether or not with its own legal personality”) and the Flemish Community has
been designated as the owner of the database. This proposal is based on an existing, successful,
model; Archiefbank Vlaanderen (Archives Database Flanders) is organized in this way;
experience with this database offers sufficient evidence for the Government of Flanders that such
a system of decentralized entry and joint management is effective. Nonetheless, the Flemish ICH
policy still needs work. Definitions, notions and concepts need to be more clearly defined. For
example, the relationship(s) among ICH, popular culture, ethnology, authenticity and tradition
need to be more finely crafted. Translating these concepts in multiple languages is also a

challenge for the Flemish. In Flemish, for example, there are four possible translations of the
word “safeguarding,” each with different connotations. 274
In the spirit of the Convention, the Government of Flanders works cooperatively with
other nations to establish best practices in safeguarding intangible cultural heritage. One such
cooperative relationship is with The Heritage Foundation in the province of Newfoundland and
Labrador, Canada.

About Newfoundland and Labrador Like the United States, Canada has an

historically complicated relationship with UNESCO. And, like the United States, Canada is not
a signatory to the 2003 UNESCO ICH Convention. The reasons for Canada not being a
Convention signatory are both political and practical. In part, the Canadian government has
resisted signing the Convention due to concerns that it may interfere with ongoing and
contentious Native land claims cases. Another possible historical reason that has been
proffered for not ratifying the Convention is that the governmental department which held the
original UNESCO ICH portfolio was largely run by archaeologists and architectural historians
(as opposed to anthropologists or folklorists); government culture suggested a lack of
practical knowledge about how to best steward Canada’s intangible cultural heritage.275

The Government of Flanders, Policy on Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage, 152. Currently the
Flemish use ‘beschermen’ as translation of safeguarding, but there is some disagreement over this term
versus the alternatives: ‘(waar)borgen’, ‘vrijwaren’ and ‘koesteren’.

Despite not being signatories to the Convention, the Canadian province of Newfoundland
and Labrador has had an intangible cultural heritage office since 2008. 276 The Heritage
Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador is instead one of several NGOs that enjoys Observer
status with UNESCO. 277 The Heritage Foundation is a UNESCO-accredited NGO that works
specifically on issues of intangible cultural heritage. 278 Working in tandem with the Department
of Folklore at Memorial University, The Heritage Foundation works to safeguard intangible
heritage within the province. Similar efforts are underway in Quebec and Alberta, indicating
grassroots movements for safeguarding ICH throughout much of Canada. 279

The Heritage Foundation: Deploying the Convention In 2006, The Heritage

Foundation of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador held an intangible
cultural heritage conference which was followed in 2008 by the establishment of an
intangible cultural heritage office which established strategies for the preservation of living
heritage. At the time, however, the initiative lacked the personnel to oversee and enact the new
strategies. When Dale Jarvis, a folklorist in the province who is now the Intangible Cultural
Heritage Development Officer, was installed in the ICH office of The Heritage Foundation, he
established programming, workshops and community events to promote ICH in the province.280

Dale Jarvis, interview with author, 30 January 30, 2014. Jarvis expands on this, saing, “There’s a
process, there’s language in the Convention whereby organizations that have ICH in their mandate can
apply for Observer status. I think there are about 150 NGOs worldwide that have that kind of
accreditation. It’s very lengthy, I think it took three or four years for us to get everything in place for
that. The American Folklore Society in States has the same accreditation.”

Newfoundland and Labrador considers the work of safeguarding intangible cultural
heritage “public sector folklore.” As such, the province has adopted a strategy for safeguarding
that is aligned with the UNESCO ICH Convention, but remains unique to Newfoundland and
Labrador. The strategy has four components: inventorying, as is mandated by the Convention
and is effectively an act of records creation; celebration, such as festivals and other programs
which draw attention to traditions and/or tradition-bearers; transmission, or projects that
encourage the transmission of skills and knowledge between generations and within
communities; and cultural industry, or building a sustainable environment for intangible cultural
heritage. Each program that originates in the ICH office is designed to incorporate as many of
these four elements as possible. A celebration, therefore, might also include an opportunity for
skill-building and will be recorded as part of the province’s ethnographic record. 281
Among the successes of the Newfoundland and Labrador ICH program is an annual
folklife festival, modeled after the Smithsonian Folklife Festival which takes place annually on
the National Mall in Washington, D.C. 282 Similarly, The Heritage Foundation has established a
festival centered on the Christmas tradition of Mummering. Mummering is a disguise tradition
wherein celebrants travel door to door during the 12 days of Christmas in disguise, in the hopes
of fooling their neighbors. Mummering was a popular tradition in rural Newfoundland and
Labrador, the decline of which was spurred by population decline, an aging population and the
effects of urbanization. The Heritage Foundation chose to reinvigorate this dying tradition
through creating a festival. In the 1800s, Newfoundland and Labrador was known for their
Mummer’s Parades; however, prior to this intervention, a parade had not been held in over a
century. The decision was therefore made to run a month-long festival celebrating the Mummer

tradition including lectures, workshops, costume parties and, of course, a parade. ICH officer
Dale Jarvis says of the event,
[I]t was participatory. It challenged people’s assumption of what a parade was.
We thought we’d be happy if we got 70-80 people. Mummering here is something
that people are very passionate about people take very seriously so that first year
we got closer to 600 people. It was always intended that it would be a one-year
event, but it was so popular that we just kept going with it. And now they’ve
formed their own Board of Directors. So my role was just to get things started and
help [them] incorporate and they started fundraising and it’s a yearly event. We
partnered with The Rooms, which is a local museum. So last year, The Rooms,
which has a capacity of 1700 or something, they had over 3000 people show up
for this event. So we outgrew the venue and this year we had to go outdoors, and
we brought in performers from Ireland. We completely reinvigorated a
tradition. 283
Despite successes, however, scope remains an issue; without national government buy-in,
the ICH office in Newfoundland and Labrador remains small, as does their budget. They are,
therefore, heavily reliant on community organizations and other heritage organizations. They
maintain strong partnerships with umbrella groups such as the museums organization and the
archives organization. Depending on the project, the nature of the collaboration might be with an
individual archives, museum, historical society, town council, food security network or
community center. If a community organization is interested in a living heritage project, The
Heritage Foundation works in partnership with them, offering interventions and support as they
are able.
Among the anxieties the Heritage Foundation expresses regarding performance is
concern over the loss of micro-expressions and micro-variations of cultural expression:
Communities have a very strong folk dance tradition as well as musical traditions
around the island. We have a great tradition of set dancing. So we have these
communities with sort of a long history of folk dancing, these set dances, and then
rock ‘n’ roll came in and those traditions started to disappear so communities are
283

Dale Jarvis, interview with author, 30 January 30, 2014.

129

concerned that these dances will disappear. They’re all sort of derived from the
same tradition and many of them have the same movements or the same figures
but they have over generations become highly localized so the community dance
in one community might be slightly different or have slightly different steps or
movements than in another community. So we’re worried that some of the microvariations or micro-traditions might die out in an amalgamation to one single
tradition. 284
Similarly, traditional dancers across the province expressed dismay over the loss of dance
heritage in Canada. To address these concerns, Heritage Foundation and the ICH office worked
collaboratively with the Department of Ethnomusicology at Memorial University and with a
local contemporary dance festival company to bring together dancers from a multitude of
genres, including English and French country dance, traditional dance, jazz, contemporary dance,
ballroom dance, belly dance, burlesque and hip-hop, to create Dance Newfoundland and
Labrador (DanceNL). Now run by its own Board of Directors and operating under a mandate to
safeguard dance and to make dance a part of the Newfoundland and Labrador educational
curriculum, DanceNL is the first sectoral dance association for the province. Its stated mandate is
to “preserve, promote and support all forms of dance and dance activities throughout the
province.” In 2010 DanceNL conducted a survey which helped them build a “picture of the
breadth of dance activity happening across the province and to understand what kind of work the
dance community both wants and needs DanceNL to undertake on its behalf.” 285
In Newfoundland and Labrador, in keeping with the spirit of the 2003 UNESCO ICH
Convention, a high value is placed on the role of community in determining the ICH to be
safeguarded and the means by which safeguarding is best accomplished. The challenge to this,
however, is the specific mandates to which community organizations must adhere and whether or

284
285

Dale Jarvis, interview with author, 30 January 30, 2014.
DanceNL, “About,” http://dancenl.ca/about-dancenl/ (accessed 30 April 2014)

130

not that mandate includes a facilitator role. For heritage institutions such as archives, libraries
and museums, the Convention presents both problem and promise: there is a need to be more
sustainable, to do outreach and to engage new audiences; ICH initiatives offer a means by which
to accomplish all of these goals, but they often conflict with existing policies. One solution is for
heritage institutions to more broadly interpret their mandates:
The thing about archives, especially small archives, town archives, is that they
become all about maintaining a collection and they forget that their real role is to
help communities understand themselves better. And a lot of times small
museums, their staff become property maintenance specialists and it’s a lot of
‘How do we make enough money to keep the electricity on?’ and ‘How do we
afford climate control?’ and it becomes less about history and more about just
maintenance. That’s a real concern for a lot of museums and archives. 286
Training is a significant aspect of the work of the Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage
Foundation. The ICH office offers professional skills training in areas such as oral history,
ethnographic documentation, audio recording equipment use, using Google Maps and
digitization workshops in conjunction with a local archives association. In addition to this, they
conduct training in more traditional or “folk” skills such as dance workshops or workshops on
particular craft traditions, such weaving or making hobby horses for Christmas celebrations. The
goal of these training programs is essential capacity-building within local community
organizations. Like their colleagues in Flanders, the ICH personnel in Newfoundland and
Labrador seeks to empower communities with the skills to inventory their own heritage and
document themselves. Also like their colleagues in Flanders, they have established a central
database where all of the ethnographic information is stored. 287

In Newfoundland and Labrador, the ICH office works collaboratively with the archives
association (The Association of Newfoundland and Labrador Archives – ANLA). Recently
ANLA conducted a collections survey which uncovered unexpected ethnographic material,
including oral history and video collections. The ICH office worked with ANLA to develop a
workshop that they titled “Boxes Under the Bed.” The central idea behind the workshop was that
archives “had these boxes of stuff that they had collected over time that had been just gathering
dust, no one was actually seeing it.” For Dale Jarvis, whose mantra was that in order for stories
to live they “can’t just be in archives, they need to be back out in the community,” this level of
access was insufficient. 288
So we went out to communities and the archives association talked about archival
procedures – how you catalog and inventory and preserve your physical objects,
you know what you do with those videotapes … and how you get your collections
ready – and we talked about digitization and access and making those projects
accessible back to the community. And along with that, we took on several
digitization projects to help get some of the materials back out into the public. 289
Digitization is the primary means of preservation and access that countries report
undertaking to safeguard the archival detritus of ICH expressions. The Heritage Foundation’s
most recent collaboration with ANLA, one that is just now beginning, involves offering
community workshops on scanning still images. These workshops begin with the most basic of
skills – turning on the scanner – and extend to intellectual and physical control and provisions for
access. 290

specifically on recipes as part of a series on local community knowledge and knowledge practices.
Recipes function as the hook: the hope is that community members will bring old, handwritten recipe
cards, vintage cookbooks and/or annotated cookbooks to foster a dialogue about local cuisine and food
ways/traditional foods while teaching digitization skills as a preservation technique. The materials will
be digitized and a small online collection around local community food practices will be created. This

Trinidad and Tobago

VI.D.3.a. About Trinidad & Tobago
“[W]hat I do is because of the community. I am because we are. Everything I do is because of
the community.” 291
The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago comprises two islands in the southernmost part of the
Lesser Antilles islands, bordered on one side by the Caribbean Sea and by the Atlantic Ocean on
the other. Located seven miles off the coast of Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago was a Spanish
colony which changed hands several times before eventually falling under colonial British rule in
the earliest part of the 19th century. Trinidad and Tobago gained independence in 1962 and
became a Republic in 1976, two hundred years after the United States declared its independence
from British colonialism.
The destabilizing cultural marks of colonialism are still apparent in Trinidad and Tobago,
making the country a unique case for understanding the complexities of the ICH Convention and
the attendant complications of a national government’s relationship with an international
organization such as UNESCO. Trinidad still operates under a Parliamentary government,
another residual effect of colonization; as such, in Trinidad and Tobago, the care of intangible
cultural heritage falls under the purview of the National Ministry of the Arts and
Multiculturalism.
workshop will be offered twice: once in the capital city of St. John and once in a smaller, rural
community (Cupid) where the focus is on training the “archivists” – those working in historical
societies and small archives who lack formal archival training – in digitization and other technical
skills. To culminate the Cupid workshop, a community tea and recipe swap will be held to bring the
archivists together with the community. At the culminating community tea, scanners will be set up for
immediate use allowing archivists to acquire new materials for the recipe collection and demystifying
the archival process for the community.

Trinidad and Tobago has interpreted the Convention to mean that they must create an
“enabling environment” in which intangible cultural heritage can flourish. For them, ratifying the
Convention, agreeing to the provisions of the Convention and creating this enabling environment
are all synonymous: by signing the Convention they have agreed to create this “enabling
environment” for individuals and communities and groups for the continuity of their intangible
cultural heritage. 292
VI.D.3.b.

The Remember When Institute: Deploying the Convention Faced with the

knowledge that existing records such as documents and recordings are underpublicized and the
public unaware of their existence, Trinidad and Tobago’s Cultural Research Unit, housed
within the Ministry of the Arts and Multiculturalism, has proposed an institute—The
Remember When Institute—to make provisions for public access to the country’s intangible
cultural heritage. The Remember When Institute is intended to be an instrument that will reflect
Trinidad and Tobago’s intangible cultural heritage; as such, its creators sought to model it
after an existing international policy, consulting with cultural resource managers at the
Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. and the Jamaican Memory Bank in Kingston,
Jamaica. The goal is for the Institute to be semi-autonomous, although it will remain
under the purview of the Ministry of the Arts and Multiculturalism.293
Although the physical entity has not yet been established, the proposed Institute will
work in partnership with the country’s other cultural establishments: the National Library
(NALIS), the National Museum, the National Art Gallery, the National Carnival Commission,
The Carnival Institute of Trinidad and Tobago and the National Archives. The Remember When

Institute is intended to function as a “repository for the memories of Trinidad and Tobago;” in its
current incarnation (a website), it holds information about the Cultural Research Unit’s extensive
audio-visual library which contains audio recordings, video recordings and oral histories. 294 The
National Culture Council was responsible for creating the recordings, of which there are
thousands, now housed in the offices of the Ministry of the Arts and Multiculturalism, rounding
out what the Cultural Research Unit calls their “cultural archive.” These recordings are slowly
being digitized. The process is one of real time transfer, however, and only one employee can be
dedicated to this digitization work. The recordings, which date to 1971, were placed in a hot
storage facility (one lacking environmental controls) in the valley village of Diego Martin.
Trinibagonians are now just getting the importance of preserving cultural heritage
and preserving records and such. You would see a piece of paper or a recording
and you would just throw it away. So in storage in Diego Martin a lot of the
recordings were damaged. But what we saved, those are here and that’s what we
are digitizing. And after [our] National Culture Council disbanded, this research
unit was created to continue the work. And we are under the Ministry of the Arts
and Multiculturalism. 295
Trinidad and Tobago ratified the Convention in 2010 and began their National Inventories
Project (also known as the We’re Trinibagonian Project) on 2 June 2012. 296 The communitybased inventorying project was a joint collaboration sponsored by the Ministry of the Arts and
Multiculturalism, the National Commission for UNESCO in Trinidad and Tobago, and the
UNESCO Kingston (Jamaica) cluster office.
Their first inventorying task was to create a website through which the public could
submit nominations of ICH elements to include in the inventory. To solicit submissions the
Cultural Research Unit used social media, print media and radio. The call for submissions and an

electronic submission form were posted on the Remember When website. The data from the
form was ingested into a database which, despite frequent technical glitches, is still publicly
viewable on the Remember When Institute webpage. 297 Following the creation of the National
Registry of ICH, a selection of experts comprised of local specialists was convened to review the
submissions. This panel consisted of representatives from the national cultural agencies
including the National Archives, faculty from the University of the West Indies and other
Trinidadian universities and representatives from other stakeholder organizations who reviewed
and added details to the existing inventory. 298
In one of their first acts of safeguarding, in 2013 the Cultural Research Unit of the
Ministry of the Arts and Multiculturalism sponsored an interactive exhibit focused on the
country’s intangible cultural heritage. The exhibit included live drumming, storytelling,
instruction in traditional game play (such as Ring-Around-The-Roses and Brown-Gal-in-theRing), information about popular folktale characters and childhood stories, displays about
secular and sacred rituals with accompanying information about how to participate when
appropriate, among other attractions. This interactive exhibit, in form and function, is the model
for Trinidad and Tobago’s proposed Remember When Institute. Working in partnership with
cultural heritage organizations (including the National Archives), the Institute is intended to
function as an interactive learning space where performed cultural memory endures. 299
In addition to the inventory, UNESCO mandates that States Parties conduct a pilot
project. In Trinidad and Tobago, this pilot project was a festival called La Davina Pastora (The

Black Mother or The Black Mary). 300 In documenting La Davina Pastora, the Cultural Research
Unit surveyed community members about what was important to preserve about the festival and
offered classes to stakeholder heritage communities on how to use video equipment. The goal of
deploying the Convention in all of the countries in this study is always, in part, to empower
communities to maintain their own heritage elements and identities. 301
People have been coming to the Ministry asking us to document. I think that is
what is beautiful about Trinidad and Tobago, there’s an eagerness to share your
culture. There are certain aspects of religions that people might say, ‘Well we
don’t want you to document this,’ because it’s sacred. For instance, they might
say this aspect is private, but other aspects you can document. For Divali, the
organizations come and request that we document. 302
To safeguard Divali, the Hindu festival of lights, the Cultural Research Unit sponsored
and curated a Divali exhibit at Piarco Airport in Port-of-Spain in October and November 2013.
Prior to that, they sponsored and curated, in collaboration with the Trinbago Unified
Calypsonians’ Organisation [sic] an exhibition on Calypso History Month focusing on
Calypsonians who won the Carnival Calypso competition from 1939-2013. 303
Calypso is part of the Carnival tradition. Because Carnival is such a complex mix of
religious, musical, parade, dance and costume traditions, for the Cultural Research Unit to
undertake a safeguarding project might require breaking Carnival down into constituent parts:
the Steel Pan, the Mas (masquerade) and the Calypso; adding a layer of complexity, in southern
Trinidad, Carnival is celebrated differently than in the capital city, Port-of-Spain. Mas, or the

One of Trinidad and Tobago’s unique cultural qualities is the shared religious practices of two
disparate devotional communities. The Hindu and Christian traditions exist mostly in parallel in
Trinidad and Tobago; the festival of La Davina Pastora, however, is one of several areas of true
intersection.

masquerade tradition in Carnival as a practice is replete with tangible artifacts such as costumes
and masks. This makes safeguarding Mas as a Carnival practice even more complex: the 2003
Convention stipulates that the tangible may not be separated from the intangible. Because
safeguarding practices are based on how the heritage community views the element, it is possible
that it would be preferable to Carnival communities to document the tradition as a whole.
Separate from Carnival itself are the Carnival Arts, which comprise making costumes, making
instruments, making foods, etc. Whether or not to inscribe these elements as part of one large
Carnival tradition is a question with which the Cultural Research Unit and heritage communities
in Trinidad and Tobago are struggling. 304
Like other musical traditions in Trinidad and Tobago (Soca, Rapso), Calypso is not
religious, despite its penchant for Biblical references. Commentary Calypso grew out of the
history of Carnival; one will, for example, hear references in Calypso of familiar Carnival
characters including the Midnight Robber, the Pierrot Guinnard and the Chanteuelle. 305 In
Trinidad, the Calypso headquarters are headed by Rapso artist Lutalo Massimba, also known as
Brother Resistance. Brother Resistance self-identifies as a “promoter of the Word;” writing and
performing poetry is his life’s work. Seated during the 2013 local elections, Massimba oversees
the The Trinbago Unified Calypsonians’ Organisation (TUCO). His organization has
administrative responsibility for Calypso as an art form, particularly where Carnival is concerned
(including Calypso competitions and Calypso tents during Carnival). Outside of Carnival, the
organizations’ first responsibilities are to their members because it is a member organization.306

The organization operates under a mandate to ensure the continuation of Calypso as a cultural
tradition. Says Brother Resistance,
Calypso is still the music which have given credence and provided the glue,
really, that keeps us together as a nation. Calypso will come to you in so many
different ways, it’s a part of the life rhythm of the nation. 307 Rapso is the, sort of
defined as ‘the power of the word,’ ‘the rhythm of the word.’ It is essentially the
poetry of Calypso, or for the younger people, the consciousness of Soca.
Essentially it is the voice of the people, articulating their struggle for true
independence, their struggle for self-determination and self-definition. So it, when
they say Rapso it’s more than an art form, actually, it’s an attitude in the struggle
for self-definition and making a statement in the world … the rhythms come from
the power of the drums. The drums represent the foundation, so when we
synchronize the rhythm of the voice with the rhythm of the drums, that fullness is
the Rapso music or the Rapso rhythm.308
As of November 2013 TUCO is working toward creating a Museum of Calypso History. Their
hope is to have a virtual museum with digitized materials made available for public access. After
working collaboratively with the Ministry of the Arts and Multiculturalism on the Calypso
History Month exhibit, TUCO members felt that the Ministry could embrace Calypso with more
vigor and do more work to promote Calypso as an art form in the Carnival tradition. 309 Here one
sees the downside of collaborative efforts: collaboration can be difficult even among the
country’s heritage officers because of competing politics, community desires and functional
needs. To promote Rapso and Calypso, TUCO runs community-based writing workshops. 310
There are few tangible resources for Rapso and Calypso artists who want to learn about this
aspect of their cultural heritage:
[T]hey didn’t have no books. I had to talk to the elders, talk to the old drummers.
People like Shabba who are now deceased. I talk to them and get a sense of
understanding about what they’re talking about. They had a different time, a

different experience. And they mightn’t even want to talk to you too much
because they feel you’re prying. Because the published word was so scarce, you
know, maybe J.D. Elder who had a doctoral thesis, and more recently, Dr. Hollis
Liverpool. Rituals of Power and Rebellion is a seminal work. Generally they
didn’t have much published works. It was always a searching. There’s a network
[of people] but you have to look for it. [Calypso] is so anti-the establishment. It is
in fact a revolutionary action. Through the masquerade, through the power of the
drums, through the rhythm there is this rebelliousness, this revolution. And
because it is against the system, you’ll find that the system will not recognize it or
even give it a space to come through. 311
Documentation efforts have been minimally successful to date. As such The Trinbago
Unified Calypsonians’ Organisation [sic] is creating a Research and Education Unit that, with a
Memorandum of Understanding already in place with the University of the West Indies (St.
Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago), will operate in partnership with the National Archives
and the National Carnival Institute. Brother Resistance laments that while a relationship exists
with archivists and collectors of artifacts, recording and photographs, TUCO lacks the expertise
to bring these groups together. Again invoking the Smithsonian, Massimba expressed dismay at
TUCO’s lack of documented history and the Trinidad government’s failure to step in and
assist. 312 The National Archives in Trinidad and Tobago’s primary holdings are government
records and historical newspapers. They have an entire department whose sole responsibility is
the conservation of historical newspapers. As such, the relationship between the National
Archives and other cultural heritage institutions is a complex one. With no mandate beyond
government reocrds, safeguarding performance has not been a national priority until now. The
National Archives in Trinidad and Tobago are not well-equipped to function in an advisory role
for performed cultural heritage.

Like their counterparts in Newfoundland and Labrador, ICH workers in Trinidad and
Tobago work with local schools to transmit knowledge and information about the nation’s
intangible cultural heritage. They have roving exhibitions that they send out to schools. This is
one outreach effort among many that the Cultural Research Unit has undertaken. 313 Nonetheless,
outreach, as well as access, remain a challenge in Trinidad and Tobago. The Cultural Research
Unit struggles with the limitations of their website because they share server space with the
entire country’s Culture Division. When they have a standalone URL and a dedicated staff
person to upload data to the website, they expect their web presence to be stronger. 314

VI.E. THE ARCHIVE AND THE REPERTOIRE

UNESCO’s model is one of both global cooperation and decentralization. The language of the
2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage states explicitly that it is
designed to promote global partnerships, encouraging and fostering “all forms of international
cooperation aimed at safeguarding intangible cultural heritage.” How does the relationship
between archives and repertoires function on a global scale? That is to say, if one takes into
account global partnerships and decentralized archival practices, how does the nature of
relationship shift?
One of the primary ways that safeguarding practices are engaged on a global scale is
through inclusion on one of UNESCO’s ICH lists. Inclusion on a UNESCO list is akin to
codifying Dunham Technique: inclusion carries with it the weight of legitimacy. When a nation

elements to the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, the
Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity and/or the list of
Programmes [sic], Projects and Activities for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage
Considered to Best Reflect the Principles and Objectives of the Convention. Inclusion on one of
these lists has economic and touristic potential for States Parties, and decisions about which
elements from which countries will be included on these lists are politically fraught. Despite the
Government of Flanders assertion that, “Above all, [inclusion on a list] should increase the
probability to transmit intangible cultural heritage,” and that “[i]nventories and international lists
are thus not a target in themselves, but a means of achieving the Convention’s objectives,” the
lists remain a point of both national pride and international contention as politics play a crucial
role. 315 For many countries ratifying the Convention, the focus on legislative infrastructures and
the prestige of inclusion on a UNESCO list has marred the path to actual safeguarding activities.
As Alicia Blake noted in Trinidad, “I think people were so concerned about getting on the list
that they forgot that they were supposed to be safeguarding and including the community. They
missed the purpose which is to ensure the continuity of the element. They aren’t putting
measures in place to ensure that this will still be around in ten years.” 316
Because of the preoccupation with the list and attention to legislative intervention to meet
the mandates of ratification, there is little actual safeguarding activity on which to report in many
countries. In theory, the archives that support heritage communities in safeguarding activities are
expected to take on an outreach role as well as acting in an advisory capacity. Working closely
with government units and within specific policy guidelines, archives are being asked to serve a

broader function than is typically seen in Western archival institutions. These archives will serve
not only an information stewardship role and act as agents for the public good, but will also be
expected to operate as training facilities, structural entities and collaborators in safeguarding
repertoire practices. Data—particularly interview data—from Trinidad and Canada suggests that
the existing relationship between archive and repertoire is nuanced and complex, bringing to
light practical and political issues around mandates, intellectual property, ownership and
stewardship.
In addition to these complexities, UNESCO’s concept of intangible cultural heritage is so
broad that performative practices are rarely isolated from other ICH elements. Rather, there is a
theoretically holistic approach that ratifying nations share. Similar in theory to Canada’s “Total
Archives” concept, the data supports ICH officers’ contentions that multi-faceted elements—like
Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago—are best protected by describing them as a whole, then
subsequently safeguarding their component parts. The concept of Total Archives, a “strategy to
document the historical development and all segments of a community by acquiring both official
administrative records as well as related personal papers and corporate records,” emerged in the
1980s as a response, in part, to concerns about cultural loss as the result of colonialism. 317 For a
complex series of reasons, among them lack of community trust in archival repositories and the
impracticality of collecting at such a large scale, Canada has since retreated from the notion of
Total Archives. While the Total Archives concept of holistic documentation has proved
imperfect at best, the spirit of the idea is an inspiring one when documenting and
preserving/safeguarding performed acts. In a 1980 report to the Social Sciences and Humanities
Research Council of Canada, The Consultative Group on Canadian Archives explains Total

317

SAA Glossary, “Total Archives,” http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/t/total-archives.

143

Archives as an “attempt to document all aspects of historical development, seeking the records
not just of officialdom or of a governing elite but of all segments of a community.” 318 Although
it may not be possible to document all aspects of a performative practice in equal measure,
attempts should be made to document the heritage community’s vision of their cultural practice
in as much depth and breadth as possible.
Because the Convention dictates that the tangible and the intangible cannot be separated,
Trinidad and Tobago continues to struggle with decisions about Carnival. As previously
mentioned, Carnival comprises many individual elements and, at the same time, can be seen as
one unified element. As Blake explains, “You can choose how you want to handle the element.
So with Carnival we might not get too specific, we might just cover the element and not get into
all of the different aspects. But we’ve been warned that the more general the element, the less
likely it is to get on the Representative List.” 319 Countries do have the option of proffering joint
nominations to the list. However, the cooperative relationships between and among countries
becomes complicated when political alliances come to bear. This is true not only for the lists, but
also for the UNESCO ICH Fund. Through the Fund UNESCO supports projects from countries
with less administrative power. In 2008, the General Assembly of UNESCO approved a series of
ICH operational directives. The operational directives define the rules, procedures and criteria
for inscription on the lists and the register and for receiving contributions from the Fund of the
Convention. 320 Since 2008, immediately following the approval of the operational directives by
the UNESCO General Assembly, the Government of Flanders has contributed about 15,000 €
annually to the Fund. Countries that ratify the Convention may seek funding assistance from
Consultative Group on Canadian Archives, Canadian Archives, Report to the Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council of Canada (Ottawa: SSHRC, 1980): 63-64.

UNESCO to aide in getting ICH initiatives off the ground. Regular assistance [from UNESCO]
for which countries must apply is about US $25K. Emergency assistance, if the element is in
urgent need of safeguarding may be more substantial. 321 UNESCO provides training assistance
as well. Of note, Japan offers independent assistance to other countries for ICH initiatives
through the Japan Funds-in-Trust Program. 322 The program gives monetary assistance to
countries to assist in inventorying efforts. Trinidad and Tobago received assistance from the
Kingston Cluster Office (Kingston, Jamaica) to offer an eight-day workshop in June 2013 on
conducting a national inventory, sharing best practices and garnering community engagement. 323
Reporting is done annually to UNESCO about progress on ICH initiatives. Toward this
end, most reporting nations indicate digitization and database construction among their most
common safeguarding methods. The databases are preliminary infrastructures for tracking and
managing cultural heritage artifacts. They also serve as tangible records of intangible practices.
Concerns about levels of and provisions for access remain an issue for many. For example, The
Heritage Foundation in Newfoundland and Labrador is bridging the gap between archives and
community by providing broader access to archival materials through digitization efforts and
outreach. Dale Jarvis reported being “in conflict” with archives over concerns about access and
asserted his belief that everything should be freely available. As such, The Heritage Foundation
uses Creative Commons for copyright; Jarvis confirms that it is part of their metadata

Reporting is done annually to UNESCO. The Director of Culture in Trinidad and Tobago is an
Executive Member on the National Council for UNESCO, however, and in this role facilitates ongoing
conversation between UNESCO and the Ministry of Arts and Multiculturalism. Another way that the
Ministry of Arts and Multiculturalism stays abreast of changes and amendments to the Convention is
directly from UNESCO. Several times per year, UNESCO sends bulletins to States Parties. These
updates are also available for download from the UNESCO website.

protocol. 324 In Trinidad and Tobago, staff at the Cultural Research Unit posit that issues of
access begin with debates about documentation.
In Brazil they had a major thrust where they would go and inventory and
interview, but the government was so involved that, I don’t want to say they lost
their authenticity, but it was more research oriented than communities really …
When the thrust comes from the people they don’t necessarily go about
inventorying the ‘right way’ and there are some things that they just aren’t going
to want to show. [Interviewer: Levels of access?]. Yes. When researchers come
they want to expose all aspects of the element even if that’s not appropriate.
There’s a problem with the dialectic there. They have the element, we, as the
Government have the education. We need to educate them and not interfere. And
yet they need to pass through us to get certification so that UNESCO can
recognize it as a national element. It forces the two parties (the government and
the communities) to work together, but it also creates this terrible catch-22. The
government can say they want to include it and the community can say no. You
have to have community approval. Signed community approval. There’s a form.
In certain communities there’s an obvious hierarchy like the First Peoples of
Trinidad and Tobago (the Carib, the Arawak – the indigenous people of these
islands). On the other hand, for a case in Ireland where they were looking at this
national festival: it was one big national festival and different communities
celebrate it differently. It’s very difficult because these communities are less
formalized. Neighborhoods. Who do you go to for ‘permission’ to ‘document’? 325
Similarly, UNESCO speaks specifically to access in its examination of reports from States
Parties, noting that,
access to intangible cultural heritage documentation is provided for researchers,
other specialists, the general public and the cultural communities, with special
arrangements being made in some cases for information relating to ‘their’
intangible heritage. In many cases, this access is provided through making the
archival collections (housed in national archives and libraries, national, regional
and local museums, the archives of the cultural heritage protection body, etc.)
open for public consultation. In other cases documentation is made available in
digital form through electronic databases, web portals, etc. 326
For example, the Europeana.eu database is one such resource, containing 12,000 digital records
from Bulgaria, including recordings of traditional songs, and approximately 90,000 records from

Hungary. The Glob@l Libraries - Bulgaria Programme likewise aims to “improve access to
information, knowledge, communications, digital content and community services through a
network of public libraries in towns and villages country-wide.” 327 In Senegal, there is a plan to
establish databases of local cultural heritage—once an inventory has been undertaken—in
regional community centers which are expected to greatly aid local communities’ access to
documentation. 328 Continuing their analysis of the current state of access, UNESCO asserts:
[a]n important issue relating to communities’ access to documentation remains the
means by which the access of remote bearer communities to their and others’
intangible heritage can really be ensured, especially if they do not have Internet
access. In this regard, the movement towards establishing documentation centres
in local museums and cultural centres, some custom built for specific elements,
could be considered a positive move. Another issue that needs to be borne in mind
relates to the treatment of secret and/or sacred heritage held in publicly accessible
archives. In Côte d’lvoire, certain elements have a sacred character and access to
them is limited by customary practices that are respected in research studies as
well as safeguarding policies and measures.
Concerns about levels of access are not new to information stewards. Archivists in Canada and
the United States, among other nations, have been contending with levels of access in relation to
Native American Protocols. Several examples of this exist, but one notable example is the
Plateau People’s Web Portal, a joint collaboration between the Plateau Center for American
Indian studies at Washington State University and tribal consultants from the Umatilla, Coeur
d’Alene and Yakama nations. The portal acts as a gateway to Plateau people’s cultural materials
in the Washington State University’s Libraries, Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections as
well as the Museum of Anthropology and several national donors including The National
Anthropology Archives at the Smithsonian Institution. All of the materials included in the portal
were selected and are curated by the tribal nations. In addition to providing the digital portal for
327
328

147

access to tribal content, the project aims to reimagine existing paradigms for the “curation,
distribution and reproduction of Native peoples’ cultural materials.” 329 When materials are
uploaded to the portal, tribal administrators may add additional knowledge, edit published
information, tag materials or flag them as culturally sensitive. Private collections, when added,
can be set at differing levels of access, ensuring adherence to tribal codes and ethical standards.
Because each tribe adds their own content and develops their own descriptive subcategories, the
resulting representation is not filtered through a Western lens; rather, it provides a layered
narrative and a rightfully complex foundation for understanding the history of the Plateau
peoples.
Prior to Christen’s work on the Plateau People’s Web Portal, she was involved in an
Australian initiative called Mukurtu. Like the Plateau People’s Web Portal, Mukurtu was
designed to allow indigenous people to preserve their cultural property on their own
terms. Mukurtu is, in essence, a web-based curation suite—or content management system—that
allows tribal community members to define unique permissions on multiple levels that determine
who can and cannot access the cultural materials housed on the Mukurtu servers. The Mukurtu
project began in the remote Central Australian town of Tennant Creek with the creation of the
Mukurtu Wumpurrarni-kari Archive. The project was born from the needs of the Warumungu
Aboriginal community who “wanted a system to archive and organize their digital cultural
materials in line with their cultural protocols.” 330 Despite the United States’ and Canada’s
complicated relationships with UNESCO, assisting UNESCO nations with infrastructures which

allow varying levels of access is one area where U.S. and Canadian practices may support global
safeguarding activities at the intersection of the tangible and the intangible.
As has been discussed, performed events resist easy capture and documentation because
of their temporal nature. Additionally, for efforts at safeguarding or preserving performance to
succeed on a global scale, there must be political will. Governments must be invested because
the money for safeguarding endeavors can rarely be found elsewhere. Indeed, Virtual Vaudeville
was funded by the National Science Foundation, a government agency. Similarly, when
Katherine Dunham’s State Department support ended after the performances of Southland in
Chile and Paris, the Dunham Company lacked the resources to continue performing. Without
financial and political will, global efforts to marry the archive and the repertoire may fail.
Nonetheless, grassroots efforts have seen results in safeguarding and preserving performance.
From these international community-based efforts the threads of solution begin to knit:
collaborative efforts between heritage institutions and heritage communities within and among
nations have yielded the most success. 331

VI.F. SUMMARY

For example, like Canada’s province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Hungary employs county-level
intangible heritage coordinators who act as a bridge between local communities and Government, while
in Senegal ICH work is done through Regional Cultural Centers (CCRs) situated in the country’s 14
regions that serve as the interface with local communities. Likewise, in Turkey there are regional
Intangible Cultural Heritage Boards and Expert Commissions in each of the country’s 81 administrative
units which function as a coordinating mechanism. Finally, Bulgaria also undertakes much of its
safeguarding through nearly three dozen Community Cultural Centers. See: UNESCO, “Examination of
the reports of States Parties on the implementation of the Convention and on the Current Status of
Elements Inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,”
(Report of the 8th Session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible
Cultural Heritage, Baku, Azerbaijan, December 2013).

Deploying the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage takes as
many forms and formats as nations involved. As UNESCO attests, “[States] Parties are
safeguarding intangible cultural heritage within a great variety of contexts, according to their
differing social realities, geographical conditions and other factors. 332

Intangible cultural

heritage is put under pressure as a result of globalization. The lack of sufficient resources to
safeguard ICH or insufficient attention to the richness of ICH elements also contribute to this. In
all three cases in this chapter, interviewees argue that for reasons of political will, placing value
on intangible cultural heritage increases its chances of being safeguarded. In this case
globalization can be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat as increasing cultural
globalization facilitates access to knowledge about and increases international opportunities to
become acquainted with intangible cultural heritage in the world.

333

Despite tendencies—as evidenced in this chapter—to centralize ICH policy making and
implementation, one striking aspect of many national policies in creating ICH institutions and
centers is a tendency toward decentralization. In Trinidad and Tobago, this decentralization or
distribution takes the form of the Remember When Institute, whereby many cultural groups and
organizations come together under on institutional umbrella but maintain their autonomy.
Similarly, Belgium applies a bottom-up approach through networking and relying heavily on
heritage communities and NGOs. Many of the nations who have ratified the Convention have
specialized “documentation institutions” comprised of some or all of the following: a national
archives and/or library, museums (national and/or local), the national authority responsible for
For example, there are more than eighty different nationalities (ethnically distinct groupings) in
Ethiopia. The wide geographical distribution of peoples and the diversity of ethnic groups with diverse
languages and cultures have made the task of identifying, inventorying and safeguarding Ethiopia’s
intangible cultural heritage a slow and challenging one.

intangible heritage or Ministry of Culture, research institutes, universities, regional or local
libraries and resource centers, and some specialized NGOs or other associations. In Belgium,
Canada and Trinidad and Tobago a large number of institutions and other bodies (many of them
NGOs) collect and/or hold documentation on intangible cultural heritage and a network of these
bodies is being developed.
Performance is only one type of intangible cultural heritage that UNESCO has identified
for safeguarding initiatives. Nevertheless, previous assertions about archival custody hold true.
Those who have deployed the convention have found novel, collaborative ways of documenting
and safeguarding performance as intangible cultural heritage. With particular attention to
tangible infrastructures such as national inventory databases, and collaborative relationships with
archives and other cultural heritage institutions, ratifying nations and their concomitant heritage
communities have come to similar agreements on best practices even when operating in relative
isolation or without the benefit of archival intervention. This renegotiation of the archival
paradigm raises questions about the most appropriate role for archives where performance is
concerned. The Comparative Analysis of this dissertation seeks to answer these questions and
proposes a series of possible realignments in thinking about the liminal space between archive
and repertoire.

151

VII. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

In order to answer questions about the role archives play in safeguarding and preserving
performative acts as a means of cultural expression, the preceding chapters explore and analyze
contemporary archivy through an examination of the Virtual Vaudeville prototype; the Katherine
Dunham archives and Dunham Technique; and the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the
Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. This chapter offers a comparative analysis of the
preceding cases to identify key issues in performance-based archivy and to address the second
research question: How might existing archival theories and practices need to shift to more
effectively attend to event-based cultural heritage? This discussion draws on data from an array
of sources including interviews, archival records, historical newspapers, internal project
documents, national and international grant proposals, international policy documents and a host
of secondary sources.
Each

custody; tangible infrastructures for intangible cultural heritage; and thriving cultures of
collaboration.

152

VII.A. HERITAGE COMMUNITIES AND ARCHIVAL CUSTODY

In each of the cases selected for this study, archival institutions maintain a portion of the record
while the community or community of practice retains another: the repertoire of embodied
practices that form the remainder of the complete record. This study has evidenced that the traces
of performance that remain in archival repositories are those which can be read as fixed text or
fixed images; the repertoire, by contrast, is a living and mutable archive of the identifying
characteristics and, often, the cultural inheritances of a given community. For some communities
these inheritances may come in the form of narrative or music traditions. For others, it may be a
traditional dance. For others still, the inheritance may be a “low art” form of variety theater that
allows for an escape on a Friday afternoon. Regardless of the form of the cultural inheritance,
these communities, who perform, operate without traditional archival intervention. Nonetheless,
they have found solutions to problems that archivists consider uniquely archival. Issues such as
preservation and provisions for access are at the center of discussions about the “repertoire” in
each of the three case studies. These issues are, indeed, archival. They require a re-negotiation of
a traditional archival paradigm: archival custody.
Fifteen years ago, in 1999, Jeannette Bastian, then a doctoral candidate in Library and
Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, wrote a dissertation that interrogated issues
of archival custody and access in the Danish West Indies. Bastian noted then, at the turn of the
20th century, that for colonized people, ownership of their records assists in negotiating identities
and forming collective memories. Extending this argument to address concerns generated by
what was already an escalation in the production of electronic records, Bastian concluded, in
part, that “solutions to [dilemmas of archival custody] depend on redefining the principle of
custody itself in broader more inclusive terms that will accommodate societal needs for access to
153

collective memory.” 334 This study, building on Bastian’s work, further suggests that not only are
provisions of access to the records of one’s past critical to developing stable social and cultural
societal structures, the act of ownership itself is closely linked to some communities’ experiences
of agency and justice.
In the United States, for example, slavery remains an issue fraught with complex feelings
and deeply held beliefs. It is an undisputed fact, nonetheless, that slaves were property and as
such, could not themselves own property. When freed, African-Americans were legally enabled
to exist politically and economically; one of the ways this new freedom was expressed was
through the simple act of ownership. Owning things was a means by which to prove one’s
existence, to work against the notion that a person could have so little economic control as to
effectively disappear.
Discussions about ownership, custody and access converge in archival thinking where
definitions of “archival” mandate the physical custody of records in an archival repository.
Custody, in United States archivy, means the assumption by archival repositories of both
physical possession (physical custody) and legal responsibility (legal custody) of records from
the records-creators. Despite debates over the appropriateness of custodial archival relationships
in the face of mounting pressures to manage an ever-increasing influx of electronic records, this
custodial standard persists in North American archivy.
Electronic, digital and digitized records are not the only record-type, however, that resist
traditional custodial solutions. Performed acts—whether they be traditional performing arts,

New Century. Archivaria, 53 (2002): 76-93.

334

154

expressions of intangible cultural heritage or other modes of performance—also resist the
custodial paradigm. In part as a result of the temporal nature of performance, determining which
part(s) of the record should cross the archival threshold becomes a complex negotiation between
record-creator and archivist. How, for example, does one decide which is the true representation
of any given performance?
Each of the cases in this study detail a relationship between the archive and the repertoire
and suggest a scholarly need to critically disrupt issues of archival custody. In the case of Virtual
Vaudeville, the project team found it difficult to locate archival materials because capturing
popular entertainment was not an archival priority in the United States during the vaudeville era.
Project team members differentiate vaudeville as “popular” theater rather than “legitimate”
theater, further suggesting that at the turn of the century vaudeville would not have been
considered important enough to cross an archival threshold. 335 That the Virtual Vaudeville team,
with the benefit of hindsight, would recognize the breadth and depth of cultural expression
inherent in vaudeville performances as an educative tool in a culturally charged moment (the
United States “culture wars” of the 1990s) could never have been predicted by turn-of-thecentury American archivists—of whom there were few and whose mandate was largely the care
of historical manuscripts and government records. Vaudeville performers, likewise, were too
busy traveling and performing—creating art—to be concerned with preserving their work for
future generations. Vaudeville, then, is effectively a lost cultural moment, the value of which
took a million dollars in federal and state funding to reclaim and reinvigorate.
Similarly, Katherine Dunham’s anthropological recordings and the origination of the
Dunham Technique are one woman’s efforts to avoid the same cultural obsolescence for an

155

underserved community. Dunham’s attempts to educate African-Americans in the United States
about their own cultural inheritances through performative practices were, in effect, her efforts at
creating an archive. Although Diana Taylor’s framework relegates Dunham Technique to the
realm of repertoire, in the absence of archival intervention the Dunham Technique functions
effectively as a repository of cultural knowledge: each codified, culturally informed movement
contributes to a gestural language that, with the proper visual literacy, can be read, understood
and transmitted. The more recent addition of the Dunham archives adds an additional layer of
documentation and codification; the Dunham Technique, however, is the primary repository.
This repository exists outside the framework of traditional archivy. There is no custodial
relationship between dancers’ bodies and archives, nor is a relationship such as this necessary for
the continuation of the Dunham Technique. Rather, Dunham Masters (those certified to train
others in Dunham Technique) work collaboratively with archivists to maintain the Dunham
archives which support the continuity of the Dunham Technique.
This non-custodial, advisory arrangement is echoed in the countries that have deployed
the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. In each of the sites in this
study (Belgium, Newfoundland and Labrador and Trinidad and Tobago) national and private
archives work to provide advisory support to heritage communities in safeguarding their own
traditions. The detritus of these traditions already appear infrequently in archival repositories;
working collaboratively with heritage communities increases the scope of traditional archival
documentation and, at the same time, provides crucial professional expertise in information
management and stewardship to communities who lack this knowledge. For example, the
Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador works closely with communities to teach
basic technical skills such as digitization while in Trinidad and Tobago, the Ministry of Arts and
156

Multiculturalism offers training in conducting oral histories and video documentation. This new
documentation contributes substantially to the archival record and helps to address existing gaps
and vagaries.
Non-custodial agreements do not necessarily require archives and archivists to abandon
notions of public access. In each of these three cases, provisions of access were paramount to the
communities working with performed acts. For Virtual Vaudeville, improving education about
the socio-cultural aspects of vaudeville and providing for broader access to more performancebased archival materials were among the most important project goals. For Katherine Dunham,
creating the Dunham Technique was, in large part, about providing future generations of
African-Americans with access to their own cultural inheritance. Finally, for UNESCO, ensuring
access to intangible cultural heritage is embedded in the language of the Convention itself. 336
How, then, do archivists, cultural resource managers and other information scientists provide this
support and ensure access without maintaining physical custody? This study suggests that one
solution is for information scientists to provide tangible infrastructures for performed acts and
other intangible cultural heritage.

VII.B. TANGIBLE INFRASTRUCTURES FOR INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE

Understanding how cultural knowledge is produced, transferred and maintained is not only the
purview of archival studies, but is also closely tied to the broader information profession. One

Article 13 of the 2003 Convention to Safeguard the Intangible Cultural Heritage mandates: (ii)
ensuring access to the intangible cultural heritage while respecting customary practices governing
access to specific aspects of such heritage; [and] (iii) establishing documentation institutions for the
intangible cultural heritage and facilitating access to them.

336

157

way that cultural knowledge is transferred and maintained is through human interaction. Seminal
historian and philosopher Walter Ong suggests that valuable cultural information is available in
sound, bodies and performances through fixed, formulaic phrasings that aid memory. Ong asserts
that the knowledge stored in bodies was passed from generation to generation through
performance; he further maintains that the way a culture stores and retrieves its valuable
information is specifically tied to how individuals in that culture think. 337
In the case of Virtual Vaudeville, the sensors used to create a visual representation of a
past art form were placed on a human actor, who was then responsible for breathing life into
vaudeville as a performed art. Without the benefit of a human actor’s corporeal knowledge of the
large, broad movements associated with vaudeville acts, the archival data that the team collected
could not have been translated to a format that effectively reanimates a rich and diverse cultural
tradition.
Ong’s assertions become particularly apparent when considering the ways that the
Dunham Technique—as it continues to be codified both in bodies and in more fixed formats
such as DVDs—creates an infrastructure of both cultural knowledge acquired by Katherine
Dunham and of her distinctive dance work. Dunham’s dance work requires the same visual
literacy to be read as cultural information as does a similar dance form—ballet. Each dance form
consists of a series of specific, codified gestures that can be combined and re-combined to tell a
history. For Dunham, these movements combine to create physical narratives of stored cultural
information important to restoring cultural identity for African- and Caribbean-Americans.
Similarly, heritage communities partnering with States Parties who have ratified the 2003
Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage are charged with finding best

337

158

practices for safeguarding their performed acts. For many of these performed traditions the
primary safeguarding tool is human transmission with institutional support providing a
necessary, but secondary, tangible infrastructure. Ensuring that a tradition is passed from one
generation to the next and understanding how this transmission occurs is one way information
professionals help sustain and protect human-rooted cultural knowledge or intangible cultural
heritage.
Cultural knowledge is transferred and maintained through systems and structures that
capture that knowledge and through the information stewards who maintain those systems and
structures. Importantly, archivists and other information professionals are qualified to define,
build and develop policies for tangible infrastructures to support the preservation and
safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage. Information professionals and information scholars
tend to work specifically within contexts that are substrate-bound, tied to underlying systems and
structures. Providing this structure for performers and heritage communities allows for
performed acts and other intangible cultural heritage to shift and change as necessary while still
offering frameworks within which they can function and be preserved.
In the case of Virtual Vaudeville, sensors were used to capture human movement which
was then stored as data points for future manipulation and animation. This motion capture data,
the archival data and the Gamebryo game engine were used in combination to create the Virtual
Vaudeville prototype. These stores of data and the mediated, visualized data that comprise the
prototype’s website are not currently being managed by an information steward and are
considered at risk for loss by project team members. Information stewards and data curators have
already created systems that would help the project team manage and preserve this data. Here,

159

there is an opportunity for intervention: information professionals can and should be called upon
to create a tangible infrastructure for the preservation of this data artifact.
The Library of Congress provides this necessary infrastructure for the Dunham
Technique. Codification of Dunham Technique takes two concurrent and corresponding forms:
the archive and the repertoire. The institutional structures of the archives offer a stable
environment for the tangible detritus of Dunham’s work. Dunham’s dancers, however, work
closely with the Library of Congress to provide crucial supporting cultural information in the
form of metadata, personal narratives, choreology, photographs and moving images.
Similarly, national databases of intangible cultural heritage elements around the world
offer a stable system in which an accounting of the ICH can take place. That countries have
identified digitization as a primary means of preservation is a problematic notion in archival
studies and the broader information fields. Here, too, is an opportunity for intervention.
Information stewards are equipped to assist States Parties in finding more suitable methods for
preserving and safeguarding intangible cultural heritage. Heritage communities around the globe
have begun conducting oral histories and recording instances of performed cultural heritage as
another safeguarding tool. With the benefit of institutional support and advice, these
communities are successfully navigating the spaces between the tangible and the intangible.
As such, cultural knowledge is also transferred and maintained through the institutions
that support culture bearers, information systems and the information professionals who manage
those systems. From the Library of Congress to UNESCO and the cultural heritage institutions
that partner with States Parties, institutions play a significant role in safeguarding performed acts
and intangible cultural heritage. It was, for example, an initiative by the National Science
Foundation that created the opportunity for Virtual Vaudeville to exist. Without physical archival
160

spaces, such as those at the Library of Congress and Southern Illinois University, aspects of
Dunham Technique might not be legible to future generations. Finally, national archives,
libraries and museums create a vital and tangible infrastructure for the world’s intangible cultural
heritage.
This study, in part, elucidates the ways that people, systems and institutions form tangible
infrastructures that support the longevity of performed acts and other forms of intangible cultural
heritage. Similarly, the networks created by these infrastructures among heritage communities
and heritage institutions such as archives, museums and libraries illuminate existing cultures of
collaboration.

VII.C. CULTURES OF COLLABORATION

Information professionals increasingly work with communities to manage large and disparate
data sets. Policy as well as best practices impact how those data sets are managed. Nonetheless,
at the center of each of these interactions is a culture of collaboration. Each of the cases in this
study exemplifies a distributed model where nodes of knowledge come together under a single
policy umbrella. Sometimes the policy itself is responsible for creating these nodes, such as 2003
UNESCO Convention, which is effectively a policy instrument. Sometimes the nodes create
policy, as with Virtual Vaudeville. The Virtual Vaudeville case study is an example of different
centers of knowledge—both across the country and across disciplines—working collaboratively
to create a single, unified vision of a vaudeville act. Similarly, Katherine Dunham’s dancers
collaborated with her and now work with archivists to codify Dunham Technique and to make

161

arrangements for its continuation. It is the UNESCO case study, however, that is the best
example of how cooperative work requires and leads to cultures of collaboration.
As with Virtual Vaudeville, the UNESCO case study is an example of how performed
culture, no matter how distributed, comes together in a unified narrative through collaborative
means. Two clear illustrations of this convergence can be found in Trinidad and Tobago’s
Remember When Institute kickoff and Newfoundland and Labrador’s folk dance safeguarding
initiatives. In both cases, teams collaborated across disciplines and geographical distance to
create and implement a safeguarding plan that included tradition and/or culture bearers, archival
repositories, museums, government organizations and non-governmental organizations. Through
events designed to be both collaborative and celebratory, the knowledge and expertise of each
group was collocated, allowing a robust presentation of the ICH element and an opportunity to
transmit collective cultural knowledge to younger Trinibagonians and Canadians.

VII.D. SUMMARY

The cases in this study bring to light cultures of collaboration that are worthy of deeper
investigation and interrogation than is possible here. Examining and analyzing these
collaborative networks for safeguarding performed and event-based art and intangible cultural
heritage is one possible area of future study. A deeper analysis of collaborative cultures may
address itself to systemic inequities, to the genesis of more tangible infrastructures or to
conditions of collaborative possibility.
This dissertation challenges inherent tensions between the archives and the repertoire and
argues that these tensions, while complex, are mitigable. Although archives and performance
162

operate at opposite ends of temporal spectrums, the spaces between them are full of potential.
These liminal spaces offer information professionals and performers compelling opportunities
for creative engagement and collaboration. This study sets the proverbial stage for these future
undertakings.

163

VIII. FUTURE RESEARCH

Throughout the course of conducting this study many questions were raised that fell outside the
scope of the project. This section identifies three of these questions and frames them as areas
for future research. Each of the proposed future studies is comparative in nature as research for
this dissertation uncovered a gap in comparative, global and empirical research on the topic of
archives and intangible cultural heritage.

VIII.A. MEDIATION AND INFORMATION VISUALIZATION

There is some division among performance studies scholars and educators about appropriate
levels of mediation when (re)presenting a live performance—is the appropriate level no
mediation? The mediation of the script? Are photographs and film acceptable mediations? 338
One of the interventions the Virtual Vaudeville team hoped to make was the recreation of
historical performances in virtual reality environments. As such, the Virtual Vaudeville project
offers the opportunity to explore an early example of performance data or information
visualization. Indeed, several factors rendered early American vaudeville a particularly unique
case to test hypotheses about performance visualization. Key among them, that the availability of
338

Dr. Susan Kattwinkel, interview with author, August 7, 2013.

164

text-based archival material, which, when considered in the aggregate was actually quite
substantial, was adequate to form the basis of an accurate simulation. Also of import to the
Virtual Vaudeville team was that much of this archival material had not been rigorously analyzed
in any scholarly fashion. 339 Virtual Vaudeville offered a new way of visualizing the research data
so that scholars could then engage with an art form about which so little visual information
exists. 340 An empirical comparative study of projects which visualize archival data is one way to
engage with the question of appropriate levels of mediation in performance visualization and
“restaging.”

VIII.B. LIVING ARCHIVES

People who lack archival knowledge and/or training and work without the benefit of archival
oversight or intervention must create their own ways for their performed heritage and traditions
to endure. One such way is the notion of living archives, which seems to emerge from
communities that stand outside the institutional infrastructures from within which archives
function. While conducting research for this dissertation, several examples of “living archives”
appeared in search results related to the archive and the repertoire. A future study might
interrogate the concept of living archives, comparing examples and defining a frame within
which to better understand what it means to be or have a living archive. A simple Google search
confirms that the concept of Living Archives does not originate here on these pages. Rather, it is
a notion with which artists (particularly performance artists) have been grappling for some time,

339
340

Dr. Susan Kattwinkel, interview with author, August 7, 2013.

165

each convinced upon thinking of a “living archive” that s/he has invented the proverbial wheel.
One such example is the “Living Archive of Teresita de Campaneda.” Another can be found in
the “Living Archives of Gomez-Pena.” 341 Such a study might consider questions about how
living archives work. Do they function through modes of repetition, codification, transmission
like the Dunham Technique (or, in archival terms: duplication, authority, access)? Through other
modes? Are living archives oppositional narratives?

VIII.C. CONDITIONS OF POSSIBILITY

Trinidad and Tobago considers it their responsibility to provide an “enabling environment” for
the survival of intangible cultural heritage in their society. What are the conditions of possibility
for such an enabling environment? What information infrastructures need to be in place for this
enabling environment to exist and succeed? What technological and other tangible
infrastructures must be in place? A future study might undertake an international and
comparative analysis of these conditions of possibility, using them to create a structural plan for
future endeavors. A study such as this stands to benefit UNESCO ICH States Parties specifically,
helping them in the early planning stages of deploying the 2003 Convention and shortening the
time between ratification and the commencement of actual safeguarding activities.

The Role of Contemporary Archives in Safeguarding and Preserving Performance as Intangible
Cultural Heritage

Introductory Text

My name is Tonia Sutherland and I am a doctoral candidate in Library and Information Science at
the University of Pittsburgh. I am conducting a research study for my dissertation on the role of archives
in preserving performance. My research focuses on safeguarding performances and giving historical voice
to underrepresented cultures in archives. As an artist and archivist myself, I am trying to understand
how/if the memory we carry in our bodies is similar to or different from the memories we unearth in
archival repositories.
To this end, I am investigating the dancer/choreographer Katherine Dunham’s dance legacy, the
United Nation’s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s 2003 Convention for the
Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, and the Live Performance System’s Virtual Vaudeville
prototype. I am hoping to conduct a series of interviews with scholars, professional archivists and
performers about how archives can safeguard performance as intangible cultural heritage.
Would you be willing to speak with me, either formally or informally, about one of my case
studies? If you choose to participate, and I must stress that participation is entirely voluntary, the
interviews will require no more than an hour of your time and can be conducted over the telephone. There
is no compensation for participating in this study, and all responses may be kept confidential at your
request by the removal and separation of personally identifiable information. I want to stress that this
project is for research and educational purposes (not commercial purposes) and will be cleared through
the University of Pittsburgh’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).
Thank you so very much in advance for your kind consideration; I am enormously grateful. I will
follow up with you in a few days, but if you’d like to speak with me in the interim, please feel free to
contact me at 412.251.0084 or at tns10@pitt.edu. I look forward to speaking with you.

That was what she wanted to do. She wanted
to teach Black people about their culture,
that it was not something to be avoided, but
it was something to be embraced. As
Americans that’s something you should know
about. Other Americans, whether they’re
Chinese Americans or Italian Americans, they
are steeped in their culture and whatever
their former culture is as well. But so many of
us [African Americans] we want to forget
about that part because we’re ashamed of it
and we’re all, well, ‘We’re Americans.’ And
actually I think that we are encouraged to do
that. [Interviewer: We are. It’s too true.] We
need to encourage ourselves to say, ‘Yes, I’m
American. But I’m African American, I’m
Jamaican American or Trinidadian American
and so I need to know about that side of
myself too.’ And Dunham encouraged that. It
made us feel proud of that aspect of our
heritage. Feeling proud of it made you want
to learn more about it. As a result, I learned
about drumming, I’ve become a skilled gourd
maker.

“The techniques that I knew and saw and
experienced were not saying the things that I
wanted to say. I simply could not, with purely
classical ballet, say what I want to say. I could
do a story, of course, ballet as you know, so
much ballet is just a narrative, but to capture
the meaning in the culture, in the life of the
people, I felt that I had to take something
directly from the people and develop that.”

When all of the data collection was complete, the data was sorted by case and then by theme and
placed in a Microsoft Word document for further analyis. Narrative construction, as
demonstrated below, was vital in data analysis. In this example, although three separate data
sources asserted the need for Dunham technique, the words of Katherine Dunham herself were
selected as part of the final narrative. The other sources were used to support the construction of
this narrative; Dunham’s words were chosen in part because she was the subject of the case study
and could best speak to the inciting needs for Dunham Technique, and in part because her
assertion explicated the point most clearly and directly. (See narrative example from page 100
below.)

The General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization hereinafter referred
to as UNESCO, meeting in Paris, from 29 September to 17 October 2003, at its 32nd session,
Referring to existing international human rights instruments, in particular to the Universal Declaration on Human
Rights of 1948, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966, and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966,
Considering the importance of the intangible cultural heritage as a mainspring of cultural diversity and a guarantee
of sustainable development, as underscored in the UNESCO Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional
Culture and Folklore of 1989, in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity of 2001, and in the Istanbul
Declaration of 2002 adopted by the Third Round Table of Ministers of Culture,
Considering the deep-seated interdependence between the intangible cultural heritage and the tangible cultural and
natural heritage,
Recognizing that the processes of globalization and social transformation, alongside the conditions they create for
renewed dialogue among communities, also give rise, as does the phenomenon of intolerance, to grave threats of
deterioration, disappearance and destruction of the intangible cultural heritage, in particular owing to a lack of
resources for safeguarding such heritage,
Being aware of the universal will and the common concern to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage of humanity,
Recognizing that communities, in particular indigenous communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals, play
an important role in the production, safeguarding, maintenance and re-creation of the intangible cultural heritage, thus
helping to enrich cultural diversity and human creativity,

184

Noting the far-reaching impact of the activities of UNESCO in establishing normative instruments for the protection of
the cultural heritage, in particular the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of
1972,
Noting further that no binding multilateral instrument as yet exists for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural
heritage,
Considering that existing international agreements, recommendations and resolutions concerning the cultural and
natural heritage need to be effectively enriched and supplemented by means of new provisions relating to the
intangible cultural heritage,
Considering the need to build greater awareness, especially among the younger generations, of the importance of
the intangible cultural heritage and of its safeguarding,
Considering that the international community should contribute, together with the States Parties to this Convention,
to the safeguarding of such heritage in a spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance,
Recalling UNESCO’s programmes relating to the intangible cultural heritage, in particular the Proclamation of
Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity,
Considering the invaluable role of the intangible cultural heritage as a factor in bringing human beings closer
together and ensuring exchange and understanding among them,
Adopts this Convention on this seventeenth day of October 2003.

I. General provisions
Article 1 – Purposes of the Convention
The purposes of this Convention are:
(a) to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage;
(b) to ensure respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the communities, groups and individuals concerned;
(c) to raise awareness at the local, national and international levels of the importance of the intangible cultural
heritage, and of ensuring mutual appreciation thereof;
(d) to provide for international cooperation and assistance.

Article 2 – Definitions
For the purposes of this Convention,
1. The “intangible cultural heritage” means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as
the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some
cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from
generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their
interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting
respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given
solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as

185

well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable
development.
2. The “intangible cultural heritage”, as defined in paragraph 1 above, is manifested inter alia in the following
domains:
(a) oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage;
(b) performing arts;
(c) social practices, rituals and festive events;
(d) knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe;
(e) traditional craftsmanship.
3. “Safeguarding” means measures aimed at ensuring the viability of the intangible cultural heritage, including the
identification, documentation, research, preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission, particularly
through formal and non-formal education, as well as the revitalization of the various aspects of such heritage.
4. “States Parties” means States which are bound by this Convention and among which this Convention is in force.
5. This Convention applies mutatis mutandis to the territories referred to in Article 33 which become Parties to this
Convention in accordance with the conditions set out in that Article. To that extent the expression “States Parties”
also refers to such territories.

Article 3 – Relationship to other international instruments
Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as:
(a) altering the status or diminishing the level of protection under the 1972 Convention concerning the Protection of
the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of World Heritage properties with which an item of the intangible cultural
heritage is directly associated; or
(b) affecting the rights and obligations of States Parties deriving from any international instrument relating to
intellectual property rights or to the use of biological and ecological resources to which they are parties.

II. Organs of the Convention
Article 4 – General Assembly of States Parties
1. A General Assembly of the States Parties is hereby established, hereinafter referred to as “the General Assembly”.
The General Assembly is the sovereign body of this Convention.
2. The General Assembly shall meet in ordinary session every two years. It may meet in extraordinary session if it so
decides or at the request either of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural
Heritage or of at least one-third of the States Parties.
3. The General Assembly shall adopt its own Rules of Procedure.

186

Article 5 – Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the
Intangible Cultural Heritage
1. An Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, hereinafter referred to as
“the Committee”, is hereby established within UNESCO. It shall be composed of representatives of 18 States Parties,
elected by the States Parties meeting in General Assembly, once this Convention enters into force in accordance with
Article 34.
2. The number of States Members of the Committee shall be increased to 24 once the number of the States Parties
to the Convention reaches 50.
