Acknowledgement
This dissertation was driven by a personal passion for guiding both elementary and
secondary education students in the enjoyment of discovery through research. Driven by sharing
the concepts of information literacy, known primarily within the library profession, I was able to
develop a high school library program that supports and develops student researchers.
Since starting the program in 2011, many people have been pivotal in helping me earn
this degree. I would like to thank Dr. Kelly Conn, my dissertation chair, whose enthusiasm
supported my topic from the beginning. Through many conversations, Dr. Conn challenged and
motivated me to shape the research to support other educator practices.
I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Jane Lohmann (Northeastern
University) and Dr. Laura Saunders (Simmons College), whose perspectives, advice, and
previous research added greatly to this study.
I am thankful for all the volunteer participants who freely gave their time to share their
thoughts about the school’s library program. In addition, I am very grateful for all the wonderful
peer educators employed at the school who gave of themselves daily and contributed to the
development of a dynamic library program for our students.
I would like to thank my parents, sisters, and friends for their love, encouragement, and
editing skills.
Finally, to my husband David and three children Shelby, Drew, and Ty. David served as
the P.O.D. (Parent on Duty) as I earned three degrees in ten years, all necessary as a foundation
for this research. Shelby, Drew, and Ty, while challenged at times to be perfectly quiet, have
come to understand the value of higher education, as each pursue their own passion for learning
and building a career.

Abstract
High school students require the proficient understanding and execution of information literacy
processes and skills in preparation for the challenges of the “information ecosystem” (ACRL,
2015, p. 2) they inhabit. Although teacher-librarians grapple with developing materials,
programs, and resources intended to support increases in high school student information literacy
knowledge, students continue to enter higher education with limited skills to support the rigor of
academic research (Gross & Latham, 2012). Previous research of Kuhlthau (1991), Bruce
(2008) and Oakleaf (2009) focused on information literacy development through motivation,
varied experiences, and incremental assessments. Essential to the development of a high school
student’s information literacy knowledge is the school’s library program (Eisenberg, 2008). A
new perspective to view a high school library program will heighten stakeholder shared support,
awareness, responsibility, and expectations, for the development of sustainable information
literacy processes and skills that can be viewed and utilized in a new context for transferring and
recontextualizing into higher education. This semester long case study examined the perspective
of stakeholders within Western High School (pseudonym) in Massachusetts to determine
whether the existing library program supports the development of student information literacy
skills. The study utilized Wiggins’ (1993) assessment for learning theory and Bickman’s (1987)
use of a program theory to evaluate student and library program outcomes. The research
determined the library program supported student information literacy growth when librarian and
educator objectives were intertwined when creating lesson plans, tasks, guides, assessments, and
rubrics. Students were able to learn, practice, self-assess, correct, redirect their learning, and
individually invest in their information literacy knowledge development.

11
Chapter 1
“Lack of emphasis on the knowledge base and specific skills needed to be a successful
information seeker is also evidenced in the assumption that these are skills everyone has, that
growing up with computers provides these skills and that what you need to know can be selftaught” (Gross & Latham, 2009, p. 346).
High school students are expected to successfully transition into academic and career
challenges with the ability to utilize research skills in order to use information properly, ethically,
and effectively in combination with information and communications technologies (Grafstein,
2002; Gross & Latham, 2009; National Governors Association Center, 2010). Simultaneously,
high school students must prepare for the responsibility of managing their own learning (Smith,
Given, Julien, Ouellette, & Delong, 2013), which includes becoming a self–sufficient researcher.
Research is a problem solving process by which students gain the information literacy skills of
locating, evaluating, and using relevant information (Rankin, 1999, p.72). Association of
College and Research Libraries has proposed redefining information literacy from a “set of
abilities requiring individuals to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to
locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (ACRL, 2001, n.p.) to a “repertoire
of understandings, practices, and dispositions focused on flexible engagement with the
information ecosystems, underpinned by critical self-reflection” (ACRL, 2015, p. 2). The
proposed definition encourages students to become participants within a learning community,
contributing to the knowledge of the whole, while utilizing a repertoire of information literacy
skills and processes. Library practitioners, steeped in the practices of information science,
understand the life implications of developing proficient, information literate students within

12
secondary education that eventually supports the transition into any continued learning
environment.
With all the benefits to learning and self-sufficiency, library practitioners have
consistently observed secondary and higher education students maintain a lack of information
literacy skills necessary for academic research (Gross & Latham 2012; Gross & Latham, 2009;
Kovalik, Jensen, Schloman & Tipton, 2010; Oakleaf, 2009; Smith, Given, Julien, Ouellette, &
Delong, 2013). Academic research requires the location and use of information evaluated for
authority, currency, and its relevance to the argument being examined. Julien & Barker (2009)
determined high school students utilized a skimming technique, which glances for keywords,
rather than “critical evaluation criteria such as authority, accuracy, objectivity, currency and
coverage for determining the relevancy of a resource (p. 15). Smith, Given, Julien, and Delong
(2013) found high school students understood the importance of information literacy, but lacked
the ability to know where to locate quality resources (p. 90). High school students also required
instructional support for deciphering and citing information resources (Asselin & Lam, 2007, p.
6). Therefore, the underdeveloped information behavior skills of high school students are not
adequate to support a successful transition into a higher education learning environment.
Examining undergraduates, O’Brien and Symons (2007) and Stagg and Kimmins (2014)
determined students continued using many of the underdeveloped information literacy skills
practiced in high school. Students that primarily used and depended on the open web could not
distinguish between resource types, and considered the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), page
design, and currency adequate evaluation indicators of a resources authenticity and authority
(Stagg & Kimmons, 2014, p. 414). Open web searches generate unorganized, unqualified, and
confusing information, which a student must evaluate. University professors, who perceived that

13
undergraduate general web searching would develop information literacy skills, noted students
lacked the ability to identify scholarly articles necessary for academic work (Saunders, 2012, p.
229). The overdependence on open web searches coupled with the lack of understanding for
determining and evaluating resource types can have damaging results when unqualified
information serves as evidence for published or submitted for credit work. Others viewing and
absorbing the misinformation as knowledge may perpetuate the transfer of what is offered to
another’s knowledge built from incorrect information.
Further complicating the lack of information literacy skills is the self-perceived
confidence students have for their own search abilities. Gross & Latham’s (2009) study
considered student information literacy skills through the perspective of the perceived selfconfidence. Students overconfidently perceived themselves as having proficient information
literacy skills, which the researcher correlated with exposure to information and communications
technologies and self-taught information seeking since infancy (p. 346). Gross and Latham
(2009; 2012) determined that constant access to information communications technologies and
information sources leads to the perpetual overconfidence in student self-perception of
possessing proficient information literacy skills. Students rush to use information and
communication technologies, lack a research plan, and search in a social manner lacking the
metacognition necessary to develop information behavior that supports effective research
strategies (Asselin & Lam, 2007, p. 6). The overconfident student often feels it is not necessary
to reconsider generated findings, self-assess the search query, or reflect upon the overall research
process.
Compounding the problem is how students learn the research process; develop ethical
and aesthetical information behavior; and acquire information literacy skills. Probert (2009)

14
determined that high school students were not guided to engage in appropriate research
behaviors, but were given webbing software, skimming, scanning, and note taking techniques,
which lack information literacy skills guidance (p. 29). The educators studied did not understand
the difference between information communication technology and information literacy skills (p.
29). Asselin (2005) found that both content teachers and teacher-librarians determined it was
each their responsibility to teach the research process and information literacy, but could not
determine how to include developing the skills in an overcrowded curriculum (p. 23). When
each teacher and teacher-librarian separately teaches information literacy, there is the potential
for inconsistent learning of multiple methods. Multiple research process methods confuse and
dilute information literacy development, with the side effect of producing skills and supporting
processes that may not be transferable between courses or academic environments.
The American Library Association (1989) recommended to reconceptualize information
literacy with new educational methods founded in theory. Webber and Johnston (2000)
recommended further research on student experiences and responses for how “information
literacy is best learned” (p. 395) beyond inappropriate pedagogic strategies that have narrowed
information literacy to a set of tasks (p. 381). Dunham’s (2014) examination of first year student
assignments that required information seeking within fourteen colleges and universities in Iowa
offers possible reconceptualizing of information literacy instruction for high schools. Professor
expectations of information literacy indicated an expectation for students to discover through the
inquiry and review of information, know how and where to find and use scholarly resources, and
understand how to support a thesis through the synthesis and processing of information (Dunham,
2014, p. 9).

15
Reconceptualization creates an opportunity for developing a library program that embeds
pre-searching for discovery research preparation, information literacy, and pivotal research
process assessments, along with 21st century education methodologies and practices, in order to
build student understanding and knowledge of any given topic.
Purpose
The purpose of this research is to examine whether the library program at Western High
School supports the growth of student information literacy skills and processes. The study
utilized a qualitative approach to determine student information literacy growth once
instructional pedagogy is embedded into a comprehensive program guided by the school library
program. Reconceptualization for how information behaviors are acquired requires a pedagogical
shift from the research process and information literacy as a set of tasks leading to a product, to
metacognitive processes where students interact, inquire, and learn from information while
assessing and reflecting upon the search process (Dunham, 2014; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009).
High school educators and librarians will benefit from this research, as they are responsible for
collaborating with each other as students are guided through research processes in preparation
for higher education. The data collected will be used to develop an essential goal to reflect upon
and guide educational leadership decisions that will incorporate information literacy processes
into school culture, curriculum, practices, and assessments, in order to promote the continued
development of sustainable, transferable and recontextualized skills. In addition, the data will
provide the educators with evidence to change establish barriers that create a hidden culture that
traditionally and unknowingly can establish unjust situations by limiting specific groups of
students from receiving opportunities in information instruction and engagement. Librarians,
educators, administrative leadership, and students have a shared responsibility to collectively

16
prepare for the “the dynamic and often uncertain information ecosystem in which all of us work
and live” (ACRL, 2015, p.2). Information literacy can serve as an essential goal and become a
reflection point as the information ecosystem constantly changes.
Significance of the Research Problem
A high school library program that incorporates research preparation, information literacy
processes and skills development, incremental assessments and self-assessments along with
critical and reflective thinking within the research process provides the potential for increased
knowledge within its community of educators and students. The high school library program
under study was designed to facilitate and validate the research collaboration opportunities
between the library practitioner and school educators. This study adds to the scholarship of
advancing information behavior instruction by threading preparation, information literacy,
processing, inquiry, assessment, and reflection. This study considers how students have been
traditionally directed to engage in information behaviors as it introduces possible suggestions for
applications for learning within a changing “information ecosystem” (ACRL, 2015, p.2).
Important consideration is given to the State of Massachusetts’ emphasis on the development of
writing, inquiry, and the use of supportive evidence within the recently adopted Core Curriculum
State Standards (NGA Center, 2010).
When asking students to conduct research, educators have often utilized information
literacy models, writing composition instruction, and critical thinking methods as forms of
instruction. Kuhlthau’s (1999) information literacy model, Information Search Process (ISP)
focuses on a researcher’s ability to develop meaning by engaging in inquiry and critical thinking
within the cognitive processes associated with continued search choices. Writing composition
utilizes inquiry as a method to transform raw data through explanation and analysis (Hillocks,

17
1987, p.74). Critical thinking uses inquiry for “problem solving, formulating inferences,
calculate likelihoods and making decisions” (Halpern, 1999, p.70).
This study provides implication of practice for how educators guide the mindset of a
student researcher to develop individual sustainable and transferable information literacy
processes and skills that can be recontextualized. The use of a pre-search guide and research
preparation model, unique preparation methods utilized at the onset of the research process
within Western High School, offers students information seeking choices that build upon the
information known, in order to collect and transform new information into meaning (Grassian &
Kapowitz, 2009; Kuhlthau, 1991). Guiding methods for critical reading, organization, and
synthesis of information within both individual and collaborative projects emphasizes a student’s
information behavior growth. The practice of strategically placed formative assessments within
the research process may redirect, correct, and progress a student’s research skills schema
development and overall knowledge growth.
Broader implications of the study concern the development of library programming that
uses assessment for learning theory (Wiggins, 1993) and a program theory (Bickman, 1987) for
the incorporation of a comprehensive library program within a school or school district.
Assessments and evaluations offer data that determines if the library program is working.
Evidence based changes that improve practice lessen the possibility of educators relying on
previously learned individual pedagogy (Probert, 2009, p. 31). This study also supports
initiating policies that purchase and replace information and communication technology tools,
necessary components of a student’s information inquiry and development of proficient
information literacy skills.

18
Because this study influences setting policy that develops consistency of practice, it also
lays the foundation for developing a culture that supports the transfer of information literacy
skills (Herring & Bush, 2011, p. 130), where students critically think about how to best
manipulate an inquiry that is “purposeful, reasoned, and goal orientated” (Halpern, 1999. p. 70).
This study also considers the implications for cultural and policy expectation understanding for
the community to build an appreciation for information inquiry, behaviors, practices, and
assessments.
Position Statement
I come to this work as a second career teacher, combining a passion for developing
student researchers with previously practiced marketing and organizational management skills.
For the past three years, I have been afforded the opportunity to develop, market, and manage a
high school library program. The goal of the library program is to develop information literate
students who can sustain, transfer, and recontextualize the processes, skills, thinking, and
behaviors necessary when engaged in research. I have been able to consider and implement
various aspects and elements of information literacy into a high school’s library program. Now
it is time to determine if what was implemented actually works.
Before entering the field of education, I graduated from University of Massachusetts,
Isenberg School of Management and was employed in business sales and marketing. My unique
path to education offered a rich foundation for steering me away from the entrenched culture of
teacher resistance and toward continually seeking improvements for accepted practices. One
such pursuit is aggressively advancing how students proficiently master the processes necessary
to develop life-long information literacy skills within a school community. My passion for
developing information literate students began while earning a Masters of Library Science

19
degree from Simmons College. Although coined in 1974 by Zurkowski and later researched and
modeled by Eisenberg & Berkowitz (1988), Kuhlthau (1991) and others, I recognized the
seriousness of the concept that essential information literacy skills must continue to grow
exponentially with the impetus of the importance of information and communication technology.
As I began to teach information literacy, I noticed a disconnection between the learning
objectives of educators and those of teacher-librarians. Educator objectives surrounded growth
within the content, while the teacher-librarian wanted students to understand the nuances of
information behavior and information and communications technologies. Although
fundamentally linked through a student’s need for information, once placed into practice
information literacy lessons (i.e. research lessons) became a series of tasks leading toward a
single content-based assessment; usually a long paper. Educators expected a step-by-step robotic
process for students to be directed quickly through in order to retrieve exact information within
print text and online sources. Frustrating was the assumption that one lesson to guide searches
would be enough for students to not only gain the necessary knowledge and complex
understandings to engage in information behaviors. As a teacher-librarian, I wanted to create a
deeper understanding for not only how students located, evaluated, synthesized, and used
information, but also for the thinking, processing, and pride a student can possess once
information literacy skills are owned.
As I grew in my practice, I noticed three significant opportunities that were not a focus
within the information literacy models: first, was the incorporation and understanding of reading
strategies into information literacy instruction; second was how students prepared for engaging
in research; and third was how students aesthetically value information. It was through my

20
education experiences that these three opportunities emerged and became the cornerstone for
Western High School’s library program.
The first opportunity, reading, grew from my employment in two socioeconomically
challenged school districts. Experiencing schools with a student population that entered
kindergarten knowing only 2.5 letters of the alphabet and associated sounds, high free and
reduced lunch counts, and substantial transiency rates, I learned that poverty had its own
priorities. Families made survival choices associated with extreme poverty and not toward
education. Before the research process could be considered, students needed to learn how to
read, write and communicate, as well as be exposed to experiences their environment did not
provide. This realization forced me to admit that my Masters of Library Science was not enough.
I needed pedagogical understanding of early literacy, computer technology, and most
importantly, I needed to build a foundation in educational philosophy and theory. I especially
needed to understand how marginalized populations within challenging socioeconomic
conditions approached reading, to better teach, assess, and differentiate effectively.
The second opportunity, research preparation, grew from developing a middle school
Information Technology Curriculum for grades 5-8. While earning Masters in Education in
Curriculum and Instruction with Technology from Framingham State University, I remained
focused on information literacy, but with a deeper understanding for how students learn, read,
write, and critically think. Middle school students want guidance and reasoning for “why” the
content being taught is necessary. I broke down information literacy pedagogy adding answers
to the “why” questions students presented into palatable practices student could understand and
educators could mimic. Preparation considers what a student already knows about his or her
research and combines it with the organization necessary to create a well-developed thesis with

21
techniques necessary for Boolean searching. In addition, my interactions with peer educators
and administrators grew to focus on the institutional discussions surrounding information literacy
as components of technology literacy, critical literacy, information inquiry, and information
fluency (Callison & Preddy, 2006). I was now thinking about the school community and was
ready for the responsibilities of a librarian to shift from separate class instruction to collaboration
and embedded classroom teaching (Loesch, 2010).
The third opportunity, aesthetic value, became apparent as I transferred to a high school
community. In order for educators to support a concept, they required a central high school
community focus towards information literacy. As I considered the scales of philosophy, theory,
pedagogy, and evaluation, I wanted to develop an understanding that would embrace all content
disciplines, teaching methods, and learning style differences, while motivating towards
information literacy. While ethical values were embedded in the evaluation and formatting of
information, students never gained an appreciation for the nuances surrounding a piece of
information, nor for their own unique work.
Author to organization background. Simultaneous to the development of the middle
school Information and Technology Curriculum, educators in my district were becoming
increasingly concerned with the lack of quality in research based student work. Educators
reasoned quality was lacking due to the way students were using technology. However, I believe
educators did not understand the difference between information literacy and the use of
information and communications technology tools. Probert (2009) supported my belief through
the research of three secondary education schools in New Zealand which found 25% of educators
consider information literacy and use of information and communication technology to be
defined the same (p. 28). The findings support a professional challenge to separately define

22
information literacy, information and communication technology, and their associated skills
among educators. Educators in my school constantly reflected on their own assumptions about
technology proficiency, information use, and knowledge transfer. This reflection of practice
created opportunities for developing a level of understanding and learning in which collaboration
between educators and the teacher-librarian could support the learner. Rather than just seeing
students as the target for learning the research process and skills, educators and administrators
also became learners through professional development. This collaboration and change to
practice finds its foundation in cognitive development theory, where learners understand and
remember more when presented with a real-life problem that needs to be solved through research,
including the engagement of information and communication technology (Loesch, 2010, p. 33).
While we understand secondary education students are offered minimal time for the
research process, library services, or seeking additional assistance (Loesch, 2010, p. 33),
educators need to practice interdisciplinary collaboration for student research preparation and
information literacy. Closing the circle of learning to create sustainable researching processes
and skills that transfer between courses and can be recontextualized between situations requires
all teachers incorporate information literacy into the curriculum. More work needs to be
completed in the area of leadership, distributed between educators, administrators, and students,
for understanding the value of collaboration with and content learned from a teacher-librarian.
Bias challenge. Often viewed as a librarian outlier, I do not accept the traditional roles of
the librarian being a support by request only educator. I take a positive position with regard to
librarian-educator collaboration being directly embedded into content preparation and coteaching. My position has influenced district and school decisions concerning information and
communication technology supports, professional development, and research process curriculum.

23
Serving on several leadership committees, I have advocated for preparing student understanding
for proper use of information, developing his or her metacognition within the research process,
and assessing for skills gained. The leadership roles and involvement have provided me with an
inside perspective into the challenges associated with administrative decisions. I must challenge
myself to recognize and record the perspectives and the counter-perspectives of others without
placing biased assumptions upon my interpretations. Such would force my thoughts into the
research rather than letting the research emerge from the data collected.
Possible bias can develop through the defining of a student’s equal access to information.
My position is supported by Fitzgerald (2004) who found equal access to the information was
through computer technology, not the computer itself. Connecting students to the information
through a variety of computing tools takes into consideration both availability and differentiation
of learning. Each student who participates in the library program comes with intersecting
cultural characteristics and diversity aspects of ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. These
perspectives have bearing on how a student approaches the library and reacts within the
programming.
Considering my own experience within the current library program, I find bias when
secondary educators limit research process projects to only high-performing students who have
an assumed aptitude toward learning within traditional school structures and/or those with a
home computer. In doing this, educators limit the potential learning for those who learn
differently and those without a home computer. Researching enables all students to engage in
critical thinking, inquiry, problem solving, and the enjoyment of learning and new discovery. I
believe it is the responsibility of all educators, including the teacher-librarian, and administrators

24
to create an environment where collaboration supports differentiating and accommodating all
learners within the research process.
Preventing bias. Constant monitoring and evaluating of my relationship to the research
will support the prevention of bias (Machi & McEvoy, 2012, p. 18). Understanding the
restrictions educators and administrators have with the curriculum will add insight to the
research. The research should be constantly monitored in relationship to class, ethnicity, gender,
ability, and other group affiliations (Creswell, 2012, p. 277). In addition, this researcher plans to
use a program theory, generated from evaluation theory as a lens by which to examine Western
High School’s library program. Because the librarian conducting the research has also been the
primary leader in implementing the library program, self-reporting is not an acceptable resource
for valid measures of data (Bickman, et al, 2009, p. 96). The researcher may state what the
program components are, but may offer no opinion of the influence on students or educators.
Thus, the researcher kept running notes of activities, in order to insure opinion is not
incorporated into the research findings. Finally, due to the paucity of secondary education
library program research, there must be a monitoring of terms. Scholarly terms derived from
multiple literature sources must be explained and used to create a common language between
students and educators (p. 278). Terms and definitions should be transferable to academic
environments, which embody the spirit of college and career readiness.
Research Questions
A qualitative research case study was conducted to explore whether a library program’s
approach toward information behavior positively influences student information literacy skills
and processes.

25
Research question one. How does Western High School’s library program support
information behavior?
Research question two. How do Western High School’s educators and administrators
describe their experiences with the library program’s influence on information behavior?
Research question three. How do Western High School’s students describe their
experiences with the library program’s influence on information behavior?
Theoretical Framework
Educators complain that students lack strategic information behavior skills necessary to
proficiently retrieve, select, evaluate, and utilize information because of student assumptions that
their experience with information and communication technology tools provides adequate
scholarly research experience. Recognizing the increasing amounts of information, as well as
methods of information delivery, library practitioners have adopted information literacy methods
and models to assist with guiding behaviors within the research process. Information literacy sits
as a cornerstone of school library programs because through the engagement of information
knowledge is gained. Grafstein (2002) posits that the general components of information literacy
are (1) designing a focused research question or thesis, (2) formulating hypotheses, (3) locating,
evaluating resources, (4) determining resource relevance to the research, (5) synthesizing the
resources into a “logical and clearly-written, coherent argument, forming conclusions” and
identifying further research (p. 53). These components, once considered, can guide any
information search undertaking.
A foundation for theory. Shaping a library program within 21st century education
requires reconceptualizing of information literacy to correspond with educational methodologies
through scholarly research (ALA, 1989; Webber & Johnston, 2000) that is ongoing, as the field

26
of education is placing significant importance on the research process. Reconceptualization
influences the school library program when information literacy is combined with educational
methodologies and curriculum planning. Where information literacy may have been primarily
followed during a formal research process, reconceptualization considers any information need a
student has as an opportunity to hone information behaviors, processes, and skills. The research
process occurs when, after a query, students engage in information behavior that utilizes
information literacy integrated with inquiry, critical thinking, and educator objectives to generate
relevant, credible information necessary for completing tasks (Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009;
NGAC, 2010) and assessments. The reconceptualized research process blends with 21st century
educational methodologies and curriculum planning, linking the library practitioner objectives
directly with educator objectives.
The research conducted described and analyzed participant perceptions of Western High
School’s library program. Participants considered information behavior within the library
through their perspective lens. Included are a pre-search guide, a research preparation model,
information literacy skills and library practitioner produced resources, as well as the interactions
between librarian, educators, and students. The researcher wanted to know how the library
program of the high school under study’s influences information behavior, in order to develop
student information literacy skills. The library program’s influence on student information
behavior was evaluated.
The understanding of information seeking as an important entity for a school library
program helps to influence shaping of the theoretical framework to view the phenomena within
the study. The theoretical framework begins with an examination of previous research designs
and results. There is a paucity of research associated with evaluating a secondary school’s

27
comprehensive library program. However, publications that outline evaluation steps for school
(Everhart, 1998; NEMA, 2010) and public or academic libraries (Hernon & Dugan, 2014) offer
insight into current practices for a comprehensive analysis. Current school library scholarly
research has focused on aspects of leadership, information literacy, influence on academic
achievement, and collection development. These aspects are deeply interwoven into the school
library’s culture and value set.
Value as a foundation. Western High School’s library program was at the center of the
research. The program has been developed over time taking into consideration stakeholder
values. Values are “ideas or meanings of what ought to be” (Chen, 1990, p. 57). Values that are
“shared by a group or community…can affect what goals or outcomes should be used to judge
the worth of a program, what causal process should be investigated” (p. 57). The concept of
value becomes a thread that links theory and serves as the foundation for the theoretical
framework. Theory “provides not only guidelines for analyzing a phenomenon but also a
scheme for understanding the significance of research findings” (Chen, 1990, p. 18). The
research threads of Bickman’s (1987) and Chen’s (1990) concepts of a program theory, along
with Wiggins’ (1993) assessment for learning theory led to the creation of a theoretical
framework to evaluate the library program.
Bickman (1987) and Chen (1990) recognize value as a component of a program theory.
A program theory provides the basis for constructing a “plausible and sensible model of how a
program is supposed to work” (Bickman, 1987, p. 5). A program theory constructs a logical
model that reflects the values of the stakeholders. Wiggins’ (1993) assessment for learning
theory is valued by the school district because it serves as the foundation for creating educational
curriculum, methodologies, and pedagogy. Wiggins’ (1993) assessment for learning is the

28
foundation for backwards design curriculum planning that focuses instructional design on the
learning results sought (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Thus, value serves as a catalyst for
selecting the theories that become the perspective by which the library phenomena is viewed.
The concept of a program theory was developed as a direct result of evaluation theory
and evaluation research. A program theory expands the evaluation process by clarifying “the
connections between a program’s operations and its effects, and thus helps the evaluator to find
either positive or negative effects that otherwise might not be anticipated” (Chen, 1990, p. 29).
Simply defined, a program theory “may be nothing more than a few simple assumptions about
why the program should work” (Bickman, 1987. p. 6). Chen’s (1990) more complex meaning
states a program theory provides “guidelines for identifying which issues are most important in
an evaluation, determining what method or methods are most relevant to address these issues,
and suggesting how to apply the best methods for dealing with these issues” (p. 28). Thus, a
program theory provides the authority for the theory, as a set of assumptions, to be determined
and the evaluation process will support the analysis and judgment if the assumptions were
actually met.
Chen (1990) offers a counter view on atheoretical evaluation, as it primarily focuses “on
the overall relationship between the inputs and outputs of a program without concern for the
transformation processes in the middle” (p.18). Chen and Rossi (1983) “argue that, at the
extreme, an atheoretical approach to evaluation is characterized by adherence to a step-by-step
cookbook method of doing evaluations” (as cited in Chen, 1990, p. 18). The Western High
School study cannot be evaluated as a set of inputs and outputs, with no purpose for the
outcomes. Rather, a program theory must contain a logic model that “uses three components to
describe the program: the program activities or inputs, the intended outcomes or outputs, and the

29
mechanisms through which the intended outcomes are achieved” (Reynolds, 1998; Rogers, 2000;
Rogers et al, 2000; Sedani & Sechrest, 1999 as cited in Sharp, 2011, p. 72). The logical model
developed for Western High School is comprised of the categories of objectives, activities,
outputs, and evaluation of benefits. Organizing details into these four categories describe the
library’s program. Thus, this logical model combined the collected phenomenon data for the
researcher to reflect upon the research in order to evaluate whether the library program
objectives are being met through the intended outcomes.
The application of a program theory has implications for future research, policymaking,
and using failure as a positive opportunity. A program theory links directly with the validity of
the research, which supports how generalizable the findings can be within another environment
(Bickman, 1987, p. 7). Thus, a program theory is valued in future research because the “program
evaluation can make important contributions to social science theory if the program (independent
variable) and measures of the program process and outcome (dependent variables) are
theoretically meaningful” (Bickman, 1987, p. 7).
A program theory’s contribution to policy rests in how generalizable the “results of a
particular program indicate that the program or some aspect of the program will work in some
other setting” (Bickman, 1987, p. 8). When the construct of the program is understood, policy
makers can adjust the program to be operational in a different environment (Bickman, 1987, p. 8).
Failure within a program theory benefits the “program evaluation because the theory can be
tested in a manner that reveals if program failure is a result of implementation or the theory itself”
(Chen, 1990, p. 29). If evidence indicates that objectives have been met then the program theory
selected supports the evaluation. If the evaluation indicates that outcomes have not met the
objects then either the implementation failed or the theory selected to complete the evaluation

30
failed. Failure can be connected back to value, as it is an opportunity to recreate or redesign a
program theory or program in order to fulfill a given need.
Wiggins’ (1987; 1993) assessment for learning theory also embraces failure and feedback
as instruments of assessment for an individual to utilize when determining knowledge growth.
The foundation to Wiggins’ (1987) assessment for learning theory rests in the discussion of
thoughtfulness as an educational aim. Wiggins (1987) posits that thoughtfulness will engage
students to both know and re-think “the moral and intellectual connotations of ‘thoughtlessness’
are thus interconnected” (p. 38). When work does not require good judgment or authentic
engagement, the environment is fertile for detachment and unresponsiveness, often resulting in
enabling the “student to get high marks for merely using algorithms and doing well on drills”
(Wiggins, 1987, p. 38).
Although a relatively modern theory, the philosophical foundations of assessment for
learning are found within Dewey’s understanding of developing judgment (Dewey, 1916) and
Piaget’s discussions on habits of the mind (Piaget, 1973/1977) Dewey’s philosophy provides a
foundation for understanding how individuals gain knowledge within an educational setting.
Simply stating that Dewey’s philosophy is learning through experiences limits his argument that
“thinking is experimental in that it involves a series of problem-solving episodes that occur as we
attempt to survive and grow in an environmental context” (Gutek, 2009, p. 79). Dewey’s (1916)
philosophy considers thinking and acting as a “unified flow of ongoing experiences” (Gutek,
2009, p. 81). Thinking and acting are joined because thinking is incomplete until tested by
action (Gutck, 2009, p. 81). Dewey’s philosophy supports the initial tenets of Western High
School’s library program because students are required to think and act within the experience of
a research process to gain knowledge about a specific topic. Assessment for learning expands

31
Dewey’s philosophy into judgment. Threaded within the research process are many opportunities
for individuals to make judgments that will self-assess progress. When an individual is able to
transfer his or her information behavior between different environments or situations, then the
judgments made have involved “effective adaptation to specific role and situation” (Wiggins,
1993, p. 204), which results in developing confidence as a learner and knowledge that can be
recalled.
Wiggins (1993) relies on Piaget’s (1973/1977) development of habits, not as a repetitive
drill but as a reflective thought for an individual to become “progressively self-disciplined as a
thinker” (p. 204). Wiggins (1987) states that “mastering knowledge in use is not the same as
mastering skill in drill; it is the (separate) exercising and maturing of judge how and when to use
skill” (p. 47). Furthermore, Wiggins (1987) posits that the “essential failings of the high school
stem focus its operational epistemology, its day-to-day definition of what counts as adequate
‘knowing’ and the intellectual conditions (assignments and materials) required for it” (p. 74).
Thus, the consideration of habits is well beyond the population, encompassing the entire school
community. Understanding assessment for learning requires a shift of thought for how humans
learn. Wiggins (1993) states that “we cannot be said to understand something unless we can
employ our knowledge wisely, fluently, flexibly and aptly in particular and diverse contexts” (p.
200). Wiggins suggests that the recontextualizing of knowledge requires student actions adjust to
meet different phenomena while consistently showing sound judgment. In order to build
knowledge, assessment for learning theory supports the multiple uses of varied assessment
methods than traditional test taking. Recognizing that “even good teachers seem too prone to
operationalize ‘teaching’ as telling and ‘knowing’ as ingestion of summaries of information; socalled ‘skill development’ is often merely a low-level manipulation of ‘givens’ according to

32
fixed and narrow guidelines” (Wiggins, 1993, p. 74). The assessment for learning theory places
value on the uses of formal, informal, formative and self-assessments, and reflective thinking
within the learning process.
Assessment for learning requires performance aims are known to the teacher and his or
her students (Wiggins, 1987, p. 48). Wiggins (1987) refers to this knowledge of the performance
aims as the essential question. An essential question must (a) go to the historical and logical
heart of the discipline (Wiggins,1987, p. 54), (b) does not have a right answer (Wiggins,1987, p.
54), and (c) involves “higher-order capacities of analysis, synthesis and judgment”
(Wiggins,1987, p. 54). Establishing an essential question that allows an individual to think
through the possibilities towards answering the question allows for active participation of
knowledge acquisition, constant reflection and verification of knowledge gained (Wiggins,1987,
p. 54).
While assessment for learning is relatively modern, library practitioner Oakleaf (2009)
used the theory to ground research in teaching information literacy skills to undergraduate
students. Oakleaf (2009) expands assessment for learning by an individual by layering Popham’s
(2003) concept of “assessment as learning” (as cited in Oakleaf, 2009, p. 504) to become
“assessment as learning to teach” (p. 541). Oakleaf designs an information literacy model, which
is meant to “increase librarian instructional abilities” and improve student information literacy
abilities (p. 539). Important to the proposed research is Oakleaf’s utilization of the “assessment
activity itself as an instructional episode” (p. 540). While the research calls for additional
research to support assessments use as a method for improving library program instructional
design, it also opens the opportunity for library practitioners to design new models embedded
into assessments for learning.

33
Conclusion. This research collected evidence of information behavior and library
program supports as possible indicators of student information literacy growth. Bickman’s
(1987) offering of a program theory and use of a logical model is linked to Wiggins’ (1993)
assessment for learning theory through value. Together they thread reasoning for continued
information literacy recontextualized experiences, reflective learning assessments, and
evaluation of intended program outcomes. Ultimately, becoming an information literate
reflective learner through assessments, emphasized at all levels within the library program, helps
students gain and improve information behavior. While the information behaviors connected to
proficiently and effectively developing a thesis or hypothesis, locating and retrieving relevant
and credible information, and synthesizing resources are necessary for knowledge development,
the research presented recognizes these behaviors as becoming increasingly important life skills
(Grafstein, 2002, p. 53). The exponential increase of information and information delivery and
processing tools can be dizzying to individual searchers. Guiding support, which aids in the
research process, reinforces educational efforts to create global and responsible citizens who are
ready for an academic or work related career.
Chapter 2: Literature Review
First year higher education students struggle to “read reams of difficult text, take
comprehensive exams that require analysis not covered in class, and write papers that synthesize
ideas from multiple resources” (Fitzgerald, 2004, p. 19). Students enter higher education without
the skills to manipulate, evaluate, or proficiently use information skills and thinking habits
necessary for academic challenges (Conley, 2007, p.24). While professors are willing to
remediate by teaching prerequisite content students did not receive in their secondary education
(Conely, 2014, p. 42), we cannot assume this includes how to employ proficient information

34
literacy skills. Rather, graduating secondary education students are expected to use information
to understand evidence, communicate persuasively, and reason and support a position (ACRL,
1989; AASL, 2007; Lenhart, Arafeh, Smith, Macgill, 2008; Newell, Beach, Smith &
VanDerHeide, 2011). The nature of student research is changing. Deep close reading, text
analysis, and using information as evidence are vital skills for 21st century learning (Purcell et al.,
2012, p. 3). Because these skills are not innate, there has been a gradual transformation in the
inculcation of research and information inquiry. Purcell et al. (2012) posits that the act of
completing research “has shifted from a relatively slow process of intellectual curiosity and
discovery to a fast-paced short-term exercise aimed at locating just enough information to
complete an assignment” (p. 3). Proficient research skills cannot be assumed to develop within
secondary education students despite their continual exposure to information and communication
technologies or self-taught search methods. Head and Eisenberg (2009) found that when curious
students were given a chance to search for information, there was no difference between course
related and casual researching (p. 1). Because of the information inquiry challenges within a K16 environment, teacher-librarians need to imaginatively and innovatively consider how to
constantly improve library programs.
Responding to higher education concerns, 47 states adopted Common Core State
Standards, which guides secondary school student learning in the use of evidence to write,
“focused arguments on discipline-specific content” (NGA Center, 2010, n.p.), and “write
informative/ explanatory texts” (n.p.). The Association of College of Research Libraries (2014)
has proposed a shift from information literacy as a “set of standards and learning outcomes” (p.
1) to a framework of six concepts that are interconnected, “with flexible options for
implementation” (p. 1). The framework contains not only an explanation of each concept, but

35
also the knowledge practices, which demonstrate the ways students gain information skills and
dispositions (p. 1), “which describe ways in which the affective, attitudinal or valuing dimension
of learning can be addressed” (p. 1). School librarians and educators have the opportunity to
apply these standards and frameworks as overarching learning outcomes when designing a
“coherent curriculum and assessment system” (McTighe & Wiggins, 2012, p. 6) for guiding the
transfer of information from short-term skill acquisition to substantive understanding and
permanent knowledge (p. 6).
Developing an argument supported by evidence affirms a student’s ability to engage in
information inquiry. Information inquiry is necessary within the research process when students
are expected to engage in the information literacy process in order to ethically, efficiently, and
effectively locate, evaluate, and use authoritative and relevant evidence to produce a final
product that informs others. In addition, the Association of College and Research Libraries
(2015) state that student metaliteracy “demands behavioral, affective, cognitive, and
metacognitive engagement within the information ecosystem” (p. 2). The term information
literacy is more widely known by library science practitioners, with the understanding that
inquiry is within the processes. The Association of College and Research Libraries (2015) has
redefined information literacy as:
A repertoire of understanding, practice, and dispositions focused on flexible
engagement with the information ecosystem, underpinned by critical self-reflection. The
repertoire involves finding, evaluating, interpreting, managing, and using information to
answer questions and develop new ones; and creating new knowledge through ethical
participation in communities of learning scholarship and practice. (p. 2)

36
While educators, students, and librarians can identify with each aspect of the information literacy
definition, their approaches and understanding of proficient information literacy differ. More
importantly, the Association of College and Research Libraries definition recognizes the vital
relationship each individual develops with information. In addition, as students acquire subject
matter knowledge, they are guided to develop information literacy skills that are transferable,
sustainable, and can be recontextualized. Because knowledge evolves through the acquisition of
information, the transfer of information literacy as a life skill becomes even more vital to a
student’s individual growth toward attaining learning outcomes (Dugan & Hernon, 2002;
Oakleaf, 2009a; Saunders, 2012).
Purcell et al. (2012) acknowledge that the act of researching is changing, and identify a
possible conflict in the information literacy perspectives among librarians, educators, and
students. While all three perspectives, librarian, educator, and student, place importance on
information literacy, the differences may offer insight as to why students continue to lack these
skills in higher education (Gross & Latham, 2012; Meer, Perez-Stable & Sachs, 2012) and if
these skills should be part of a K-12 learning experience (Latham & Gross, 2008, p. 13.). The
three information literacy perspectives, librarian, educator, and student, are worthy of
investigation, as each reveal benefits of and obstacles to the integration of information literacy
skills across disciplines and grade levels. Combining the benefits and motivations and removing
obstacles from each perspective provides a foundation for developing a school’s library program
that utilizes the concepts, processes and skills development of information literacy to transform
the support and instruction necessary to prepare and motivate students for the information and
knowledge building challenges within both secondary and higher education.

37
Along with the perspectives, this literature review will explain information literacy and
analyze how it can serve as the foundation for a library program. Rather than considering each
library objective or event as separate programs, the term program will encompass all that occurs
within the secondary education library. A complete library program takes into account the
organization’s values, objectives, and cultures, while encouraging educators and students to risk
attempting new and challenging activities that require innovative methods of evaluation and
reflection (Kaufman, 2007, p. 23). In addition, this literature review will recognize the direct
connection between information literacy and information and communications technologies.
Information and communications technologies are the devices or applications used to store and
transfer both filtered and unfiltered information (Bruce, 2008, p. 16). Students readily use
information and communication technology tools to both locate and process information. The
connections of devices and applications provide an opportunity for individuals to publish,
distribute information, and produce motivational social networks (Ndon, 2010, p. 18). These
connections are significant when the skills of information literacy transcend information and
communications technology, as learners are able to utilize these tools to move content beyond
superficial understanding (p. 211) and work reflectively between formats and devices to develop
knowledge (Bruce, 2008, p. 17). While the focus of the literature review is on information
literacy within secondary education library programs, the lack of research completed within this
population warrants a combination of evidence from both secondary and higher education
settings, to identify similar themes for further investigation.
Conceptualizing Information Literacy
Before developing a library program grounded in information literacy, conceptualizing
these skills requires a view into their inception and understanding the tools by which information

38
is delivered. Zurkowski (1974) states that information includes the “concepts or ideas, which
enter a person’s field of perception, and are evaluated and assimilated, reinforcing or changing
the individual’s concept of reality and/or ability to act” (p. 1). This best develops meaning when
organized into units of understanding. Zurkowski’s (1974) report to the National Commission on
Libraries and Information Science forecasted that an “overabundance of information” (p. 1)
would occur “wherever available information exceeds our capacity to evaluate it” (p. 1).
Anticipating potential problems with information growth, Zurkowski (1974) sought to offer a
platform for managing information by first defining the ability “to find what is known or
knowable on any subject” (p. 23) as “information literacy” (p. 6).
Since Zurkowski (1974) defined the need to evaluate information as information literacy,
its present importance is evident as secondary education students utilize the various information
delivery tools. While traditional print information sources are limited by location, digital
information has become globally accessible. Online information is generally accessible using
information and communication technology tools, on the open web, or through subscription
database products. Purcell et al. (2012) reports that 94% of secondary education students use
Google or another search engine to locate information, with 75% using Wikipedia or other online
encyclopedias (p. 4). Due to the ease with which information is produced and uploaded to the
Internet, much of it is delivered in “unfiltered formats, raising questions about its authenticity,
validity and reliability” (ACRL, 2000, p. 4). The complexity by which information is formatted
and delivered to users through search engines necessitates that student researchers evaluate each
resource for authorship, currency, purpose, bias, and relevance in order to qualify it for use.
Online subscription database products, such as EBSCO, JSTOR, and InfoTrac, supply users with
information previously filtered for authority. Database resources require the researcher complete

39
a relevance analysis related to the inquiry. However, the intimate relationship between
information literacy and information and communications technology tools is only as strong and
beneficial to the growth of knowledge as the user’s willingness to engage in sincere and
productive efforts.
Perspectives of Information Literacy
Information literacy is not exclusive to the library program. Saunders (2011) offers that
information literacy supports the growth of competency areas such as critical thinking and oral
and written communication that are necessary beyond academic work (p. 229). Information
literacy is important to the growth of a school community. Therefore, it is up to secondary and
higher education “institutions, their faculty, and staff to decide on their resources, budgets, and
educational practices to ensure that students graduate” with the skills necessary for future
challenges (p. 229). Decisions about resources, budgets, and practices to support information
literacy can be influenced by group perspectives. Research findings indicate that librarians,
educators, and students all have different perspectives in the areas of defining information
literacy, determining ownership, curriculum, models, practice, and assessments. Constant
assessments of a school community’s information literacy skills and understanding can highlight
discrepancies between what a library program would like to offer and what needs remediation
(Fitzgerald, 2004, p. 20). In order to develop a library program that places information literacy as
a value, the concepts of ownership, curriculum, practice and assessment, and models as above
requires examination though the perspective of the librarian, educator, and student.
Defining information literacy. Information literacy stakeholders, who include librarians,
educators, and students, vary in their definition of information literacy. These varied definitions
offer a foundational perspective for developing a more collaborative school library program.

40
Librarian perspective. Librarians refer to information literacy not simply as a set of
linear steps but as oscillatory information processes that improve when consistently practiced
(ACRL, 2015; 2001; Gross & Latham, 2009a; Marcum, 2002). Marcum (2002) offers that
information literacy should be viewed through the lens of cognitive psychology where the
processes are “grounded in content and the transfer of information” (p. 10). The Association of
College and Research Libraries (2015) includes a metacognition perspective, where “critical selfreflection” (p. 2) supports an individual in becoming “more self-directed” (p. 2). Curriculum
content provides students with a meaningful opportunity to practice the processes of information
literacy along with specific information from the course work. Because the expectation is that the
information learned from content is transferred to other disciplines, librarians make the leap that
information literacy skills should also transfer and recontextualize between situations and
between disciplines. Thus, the individual who can consistently transfer content information and
transfer and recontextualize information literacy skills and knowledge throughout courses, grade
levels, information types, and information and communication technology tools are preparing
students to be an information literate citizens.
The Association of College and Research Libraries (2015) include in the proposed
information literacy definition an appreciation for the information literacy ecosystem (p. 2). The
ecosystem surrounds the conversations and questioning of scholarship, authorship, and
perspective; formats to create, produce and disseminate information; a willingness to engage in
exploratory opportunities to pursue information, strategize alternative methods, and develop new
knowledge; and recognize that information has value that respects what has been created and will
be created using the work of others (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2015).

41
Educator perspective. Educators have a slightly different view of information literacy.
Educators define information literacy through the lens of their discipline content. Educators
focus on “the very process of preparing a piece of written course work” (McGuinness, 2006, p.
577), which makes use of information inquiry without process methodology (p. 577). The
educator’s primary goal is the production of a quality product that indicates learning outcomes
such as the ability to critically approach scholarly literature or the ability to analyze information
and draw conclusions (McGuinness, 2006, p. 577). Saunders (2011) states, “attention to the topic
of information literacy outside of the library and information science is relatively recent” (p. 15).
While many educators individually understand concepts within information literacy, many of the
processes seem foreign. Therefore, educators want students to locate articles with authority and
currency, but are unsure how to support students in the processes necessary to achieve these
goals.
Student perspective. The student ability to define information literacy on their terms was
not found in any of the research examined. Rather, research data offered insight on student selfevaluated or educator evaluation of student information literacy skills proficiency (Asselin, 2005;
Gross & Latham, 2009a, 2012; Oakleaf, 2009; Probert, 2009). Head and Eisenberg (2009)
examined the “existence and frequency of the different research needs that students have” (p. 11),
which generated data indicating students were “curious about and engaged in finding information”
through pre-search and complex content searches. Willingness sets a foundation for students to
define and understand the value of information literacy skills as a concept through experience.
In addition, not having data on how students define information literacy creates an opportunity
for examining whether students understand learning outcomes associated with these skills can
improve teaching practices and learning processes.

42
The three perspectives of defining information literacy offer insight into the
responsibility and value each has for the landscape surrounding information and information
inquiry behaviors. Librarians, having the most invested, reach beyond a set of skills to define
information literacy through doing and thinking processes, values, and responsibilities within a
community of learners that use information. Educators and students each define information
literacy through individual experiences, identities, and cultures, often relying on past
understanding. Most importantly, students are ripe with opportunity for understanding
information literacy.
Information literacy ownership. Badke (2005) states, “scholars argue that information
literacy at a high level needs to be the right of every student” (p. 74) no matter the acceptance or
resistance by educators (p. 74). Badke recognizes value on each individual having the
opportunity to own information literacy skills and understanding of the processes involved. Yet,
who is responsible for teaching information literacy has been a source of territorial debate.
Asselin (2005) found that educators and teacher-librarians each assert responsibility for
separately teaching information literacy to students. Asselin (2005) researched educators and
librarians working collaboratively on a secondary education research methods unit. Educators
indicated extreme confidence with information literacy and perceived themselves as able to teach
the skills to students (Asselin, 2005, p. 23). However, these same educators were not able to
define the information literacy skills they intended to teach, indicating they had limited time to
collaborate with the librarian (p. 23). Saunders (2011) determined that educators and librarians
share responsibility of teaching information literacy skills (p. 234). Educators own content
curriculum and “without their support information literacy will be treated as an add-on or after
thought” (p. 234).

43
Shared responsibility is not always a collaboration of similar practices. Rather, it is a
mutual recognition that information literacy has value within the school community when taught
and reinforced by all those instructing students. Recognizing the shared responsibility requires
leadership, not just to support a library program’s use of information literacy but also to sustain
the program as a whole. Fullan (2005) defines sustainability as “the capacity of a system to
engage in the complexities of the continuous improvement consistent with deep values of human
purpose” (as cited in Fullan, 2006, p. ix). Sustaining a value within a program “lies in the
fostering and proliferation of a fundamentally new kind of leadership in action” (Fullan, 2006, p.
114). Leadership must not simply consider the long-term value of information literacy within a
library program, but information literacy itself as the value that is worthy of being sustained.
Shared ownership. The practicality of realizing the value of information literacy requires
librarians and educators to take a step back from their individual leadership traits and mindset of
ownership. Fullan’s (2011) recognition that making a mistake is not a personal flaw but a
learning opportunity (n.p.) is interpreted as recognizing a need for change, which opens
possibility. Rather than continued single ownership, where even collaboration must take on the
individual mission and vision of librarians and educators, the creation of a shared mission and
vision may serve the development of a library program that will meet the needs of student
learners. Librarians already struggle with developing a separate curriculum and instruction
removed from content instruction; understanding it gives the impression that information literacy
is a library only activity (Saunders, 2011, p.234). Current practices in information literacy
collaboration have the potential of diluting information literacy when the educator’s content
becomes the primary focus. As a result, a new kind of leadership requires librarians and
educators to not just focus on the problem, but to consider system challenges within the culture

44
generating more leaders (Fullan, 2006, p. 121) who place information literacy as a goal and are
willing to collaborate with mutual, respectful, and shared ownership that has the potential for
benefiting students.
Although researchers have examined who owns the responsibility of teaching information
literacy, evidence also shows that administrative leadership, of both secondary and higher
education institutions, are unwilling to support library programming or a program. Just because a
facility has a library does not mean information literacy instruction occurs. McGuinness (2006)
offers that administratively, higher education does not always provide for information literacy
instruction, assuming students enter already possessing the skills and utilize course work to
increase ability (p. 580). This same philosophy can be turned as students may also “reinforce
inappropriate or incorrect execution of” (p. 580) information literacy skills and processes due to
lack of instruction. Secondary education schools fair even less as not all of the 17,800 reporting
U.S. secondary education school libraries had at least one full-time certified school librarian
employed (NCES, 2012b, Table. 478 on n.p.). When examined by student population, one fulltime certified librarian was to support up to 1500 students in a single school (NCES, 2012a,
Table. 479 on n.p.). Elementary schools, where the foundations of early literacy skills of reading
and writing skills begin, are supported by less than a half-time certified librarian (NCES, 2012b,
Table. 478 on n.p.). The trajectory of elementary to high school statistics provides no doubt that
a majority of United States students will enter higher education never being exposed to how to
appreciate and ethically locate, evaluate, and use authoritative quality information. When budget
constraints and/or leadership perception of a library program’s importance limit support for
developing instruction, students have less potential to develop proficient information literacy
skills without the leadership of a certified librarian.

45
Student ownership perspective. Since students are the beneficiaries of an information
literacy focused library program, their ownership should also be considered. Rather than
claiming ownership of information literacy skills, students shift the paradigm through their
reliance on each other as search experts. Purcell, et al. (2012) found that 42% of high school
students look to each other as sources to learn search skills. The selection of a peer ranks fourth,
behind Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube (p. 34), which makes ownership not claimed, but freely
given. Head and Eisenberg (2009) surveyed over 2,318 higher education students and found that
librarians were tremendously under utilized… as “eight out of 10 of the respondents reported
rarely, if ever, turning to librarians for help with course related research assignments” (p. 3).
Purcell, et al. (2012) support Head and Eisenberg (2009), as only 16% of students surveyed
utilized a school or public librarian for research assistance (Purcell, et al, 2012, p. 34). These
finding directly relate to how secondary education students experience information literacy
instruction. While students are generally encouraged in peer collaboration and mutual learning,
unless librarians and educators agree upon a community tailored method for information literacy
instruction, the development of proficient skills and understanding of processes may not occur.
Without practitioner expertise to guide the research process, “students may accept the veracity of
online information too easily,” (p. 26) leaving open the proliferation of incorrect information
being used as evidence.
Ownership barriers. The concept of ownership cannot be discussed without the
consideration of barriers. While educators want students to have information literacy skills ready
to go in their classes, many are unwilling to give up class time to allow for the scaffolding and
consistent practice students need to hone these skills. Although focused on higher education,
McGuinness (2006) found that faculty barriers to information literacy development in students

46
potentially could transcend all educational levels. Findings provide evidence that faculty
considered the library a reserve of information students can pluck from, as they absorb
information literacy skills through a set of “existing learning situations” provided within a course
(p. 576). Confirming previous research Meer, Perez-Stable and Sachs’ (2012) determined that
educator reasoning for not taking advantage of library offered information literacy services was
because (a) they were unaware, (b) did not want to take away class time dedicated to content,
and (c) had deemed the instruction not relevant to the content (p. 113).
Shifting the concept of ownership of information instruction to the assumed ownership of
an individual’s proficient information literacy skills could serve as a barrier to offering an equal
learning opportunity. McGuinness (2006) indicated faculty perceived students who develop
proficient information literacy skills as having “individual motivation and innate ability, rather
than on the quality and format of the available instructional opportunities” (p. 577). Thus:
Rather than suggesting that it should be a desired learning outcome of undergraduate
programs, a number of participants observed that students can become information
literate only if they proactively and independently choose to pursue the opportunities that
are available to them during the course of their education. (p. 577)
Considering McGuinness’ (2006) thinking within secondary education, students in tiered courses
may be directly affected. Those who are in advanced placement (AP) or high-level courses may
have enrolled due to their self-starting nature and willingness to self-engage in learning
opportunities. These students may have the opportunity for information literacy instruction due
to their own pursuit. However, using McGuinness’ (2006) findings, if faculty self-judges that a
certain population is less willing to self-engage based on course enrollment and does not prove
information behavior instructional guidance, these students may never develop information

47
literacy processes and skills. Because AP and higher course level students may have innate
information literacy ability, the course instructors justify providing instruction giving these
students an opportunity to gain additional information literacy knowledge that all individuals
should have.
When faculty uses student ability as a barrier to offering information literacy support
instruction, no remediation of inappropriate skills occurs. No remediation perpetuates the
transfer of poor information literacy skills into higher education and career choices. This
judgment goes against the thinking of differentiating to meet the needs of the learner, because
those with low information literacy proficiency may not even recognize the deficiency (Latham
& Gross, 2008, p. 13). In addition, when potentially important learning and knowledge is
knowingly withheld from a certain population, the school has produced an unjust situation.
Distributing ownership. With students redefining information literacy ownership,
librarians and educators placing culturally established professional barriers and limiting
collaboration opportunities, and educators using academic levels or motivation to determine
information literacy learning potential, the opportunity gap for learning and developing
knowledge will continue to widen. Darling-Hammond (2010) defines opportunity gap as “the
accumulated differences in access to key educational resource-expert teachers, personalized
attention, high-quality curriculum opportunities, good educational materials, and plentiful
information resources-that support learning at home and at school” (p. 28). Thus, ownership
must not be territorial or it will compound the institutionalized inequalities that already exist in
the instruction of information literacy. Perhaps it is time for secondary and higher education
leaders, in both administration and instruction, to take a hard look at the distributive leadership
qualities students’ display when mimicking each others’ willingness to share and engage over

48
information challenges. Distributive leadership allows for the practice of leadership to be
“defined in the interactions of leaders, followers and their situation” (Spillane, 2006, n.p.).
Students are leaders and owners of their own education, including the acquisition of information
literacy processes and skills. Thus, ownership may mean that educators and librarians offer the
information literacy process pedagogy and expertise, while students add the distribution method.
Information literacy curriculum, practice, and assessment. Once ownership of
information literacy skills is determined, how does an institution’s library program plan
instruction and assessment? In pursuit of developing information literate students, both
secondary and higher education librarians ideal library program would offer collaboration
opportunities to educators that consistently embed integrated information literacy skills into
curriculum, design assessments that contain information literacy standard based outcomes, and
leadership opportunities to consistently evaluate that the values of information literacy are being
maintained (Saunders, 2011). School librarians and educators find support for developing
information literacy curriculum within the national Common Core State Standards, individual
state standards, and library associations’ standards. Common Core State Standards contain
different grade level learning outcomes for the scaffolding skills necessary for reading and
processing informational text (NGA Center, 2014, n.p.). Massachusetts offers the non-mandated
Massachusetts Technology Literacy Standards and Expectations (2008) to school districts as a
supportive document for developing information and communications technology skills. The
American Association of School Librarians (2007) offers K-12 educators four information
literacy guiding principals (1) “inquire, think critically, and gain knowledge;” (p. 3) (2) “draw
conclusions, make informed decisions, apply knowledge to new situations, and create new

49
knowledge;” (p. 3) (3) “share knowledge and participate ethically and productively as members
of our democratic society;” (p. 3) and (4) “pursue personal and aesthetic growth” (p. 3).
The Association of College Research Libraries (2014; 2000) has developed two very
different information literacy definitions and support publications to be used within secondary
and higher education. Past standards supported a set of learning targets to create a common
understanding through all disciplines, learning environments, and education levels (ACRL, 2000,
p. 2). The recently adopted framework is part of an educational reform that recognizes the
previous standards within a set of six concepts that place importance on students having “a
greater role and responsibility in creating new knowledge, in understanding the contours and the
changing dynamic of the world of information, and in using information, data, and scholarship
ethically” (ACRL, 2015, p. 2). All of these state and association resources have similar intent to
include information and communications technology tools and practices in the pursuit to locate,
process, organize, and produce information ethically, while appreciating the knowledge used and
shared. When combined in a curriculum, either stand-alone or in combination with content
courses, the standards and framework can guide curriculum planning, practice design and
assessment in the continuum of information literacy learning in K-16 education.
Embedding information literacy. Yet, with all the standards, framework, association
support, and collaboration of instruction, evidence still indicates students are not gaining the
skills necessary to become information literate. The question remains: how are established
standards and the framework embedded into the practice and assessment of information literacy
instruction? Oakleaf (2009a) research investigated the Information Literacy Instructional Cycle,
offering insight into the possibility of how a model utilizes assessment to increase librarian
instructional ability and improve student information literacy skills (p. 539). Oakleaf (2009a)

50
grounds the model in the assessment for learning works of Shepard (1989), Stiggins (1991) and
Wiggins (1989) (as cited in Oakleaf, 2009a, p. 540). Assessment for learning theorists “believe
that assessment and teaching are inseparable, and that students can learn and be assessed
simultaneously” (Oakleaf, 2009a, p. 540). Popham (2008) supports this theory using learning
progressions, where “step-by-step building blocks students are presumed to need in order to
successfully attain a more distant, designated instructional outcome” (p. 24). Thus, the
Information Literacy Instruction Cycles offer a sequencing of expected sub-skill outcomes
within one overall learning outcome. The overall learning outcome has the potential to be a
formalized learning standard. Wiggins and McTighe (2006) offer that designing curriculum,
practice, and assessment backwards, begins with sharing learning outcomes, as the relevant goal
the instruction will address (p. 22). The concept is performance improves when a student knows
what he or she is expected to learn (Wiggins & McTighe, 2006, p.15).
As students progress through a series of designed tasks, assessments will provide
evidence of mastery (Oakleaf, 2009a; Oakleaf, 2009b; Popham, 2008; Wiggins & McTighe,
2006). Assessments are evaluated for quality evidence as determined by a well developed rubric
that helps a student understand the curriculum and what is suppose to be learned (Oakleaf,
2009b; Popham, 2008). The results of an assessment has the potential to motivate the educator
and librarian to adjust instruction, individually differentiate instruction, and/or determine mastery
and future progress.
The use of assessments and rubrics within the curriculum design and educator practices
assists in determining mastery or a need to reinforce, reteach, and/or adjust instruction. As
information literacy practices are developed, the student’s ever changing environment has to be
considered. Students are found to have little “patience and want speedy answers, and full

51
gratification now” (Zimmerman, 2012, p. 181), often “disregarding the instructor of the library
and its vast array of data sources” (p. 181) for the open web. In addition, librarians and educators
have to be cognizant that students can disengage when traditional methods with print, paper, and
pencil are used as the primary method for building knowledge (Zimmerman, 2012, p. 179).
Julien and Barker (2009) examined a curriculum in practice, as a diverse population of 1300
secondary education students from different schools were provided with extensive information
literacy programming within a biology course. As part of their assessments, students were given
information-based tasks to perform to determine information search skills (p. 14). Although not
targeted in the research, the link between actual classroom practices, teacher understanding, and
attitudes needs to be further examined as a possible influence on the preparations of lessons and
assessments (Julien & Barker, 2009, p. 15).
Librarians have a responsibility to determine how their interactions with students
contribute to the transfer of information, learning, and knowledge development (Oakleaf, 2009a,
p. 234). Interactions are not always practiced within the traditional classroom setting. Kingsley,
et al. (2011) offer that practice may mean an “intervention led by an ILS [information literacy
skills] librarian specialist may be sufficient to effectively help students” (p. 6) develop skills.
Still, because librarians need others to ensure the overlapping of information literacy practice and
assessment, librarians solicit educator assistance. In addition, Probert (2009) indicates that
secondary educator understanding of information literacy shows that disciplinary differences
exist. English and social studies educators demonstrated more advanced information literacy
skills than those teaching technical courses (p. 28). Although those who perceived confidence
with information literacy noted the use of webbing software (Probert, 2009, p. 29), and
skimming, scanning and note taking techniques (p. 30), recognized was the difference between

52
how organizers utilized an information literacy model. Students would have been supported in
information literacy behaviors while using traditional reading and writing processing models; the
co-use of an information literacy model along with a reading model may have supported
information behavior. To have an inclusive information literacy program, Gross and Latham
(2012) posit, that “in the absence of consistent formal information literacy skills instruction in K12 it might be unrealistic to expect students to know that they can and should seek help from
more formal sources” (p. 581), including the school’s librarian.
Information Literacy Models
Simply providing access to information delivery tools and offering usage is not enough to
support student knowledge growth. Seeking a method to reach both students and educators and
reduce information search anxiety, librarians began to develop information literacy models
(Kuhlthau, 1990, p. 72). Models set users at ease because they allow one to view a process
before the experience. In addition, models allow for reflection upon a process taken, in order to
determine future adjustments and improvements. Information literacy models provide educators
with a universal view into how information skills can be approached.
The intention of an information literacy model is to guide students within a research
process promoting specific behavior that supports the ethical, effective, and efficient use of
information. While librarians promote the use of information literacy models, educators hesitate
to use them because of the underlying assumption that it attempts “to depict and explain a
sequence of behavior by referring to relevant variables, rather than merely indicates a sequence
of events” (Case, 2012, p.137). Educators may find discomfort with the unknown content of
information literacy or lack of available time to focus on something other than his or her subject.
When a model provides a linear process, it removes an educator from dedicating guidance

53
necessary for deep information processing. Deep information processing is a part of all
information literacy models.
Although the skills of information literacy have been recognized as having importance in
a student’s knowledge growth, published research rarely recognizes a specific model used within
a secondary school environment. Grafstein (2002) determined information literacy models
possess a collective essence of components discussed within library science research.
Information literacy components support (1) designing a focused research question or thesis, (2)
formulating hypotheses, (3) locating, evaluating resources, (4) determining resource relevance to
the research, (5) synthesizing the resources into a “logical and clearly-written, coherent argument,
forming conclusions” and identifying further research (p. 53). Model developers adjust and
combine these components with a theoretical framework, in order to determine the best method
for producing proficient information literacy skills in students.
Secondary education models. Kuhlthau, Stripling and Pitts, Eisenberg and Berkowiz,
Joyce and Tallman, and Rankin have all contributed to the development of information literacy
models intended for, but not limited to, secondary education. Kuhlthau’s (1988) Information
Search Process uses Kelly’s personal construct theory to take into consideration a student’s
feeling and cognition during the search process. Significant to Kuhlthau’s research is how the
stages of exploration and formulation are critical because students are encouraged to go beyond
fact finding to engage in the processes of information literacy (Kuhlthau, 1999 as cited in
Stripling, 1998, p. 16).
Stripling and Pitts’ Recalling, Explaining, Analyzing, Challenging, and Transforming
(REACT) taxonomy is a model focused on critical thinking methods within a ten-step research
process (Crow & Franklin, 2011, p. 65). REACT allows for general pre-searching and narrowing

54
of information until a topic is selected. Similar to the Information Search Process, REACT
encourages students to take the time to process the information search, in order to transform and
synthesize the information gathered into knowledge (p. 65). Eisenberg and Berkowiz’s Big 6 and
Big 3 models differentiate within K-12 to meet the needs of student learning abilities. Grounded
in Blooms Taxonomy the Big 6 and Big 3 offer a “straightforward summary of activities related
to information seeking and project completion” (Thomas, Crow & Franklin, 2011, p. 64). Joyce
and Tallman’s I-Search model is popular among educators whose discipline requires an
abundance of writing. I-Search differs from other models because it asks for student investment
in the process through the selection of a unique topic. As a student goes through the I-Search
steps, there is a series of tasks that expect one to learn and utilize webbing, sharing, citations,
reading, drafting and editing within a writing process (Callison, 2003; Thomas, Crow & Franklin,
2011). Educators accept these activities and the metacognition required, because they are within
the realm of the familiar writing process. While not containing the general components of an
information literacy model, Rankin’s (1992) Pre-Search two-step process prepares a student for
researching by directing students to connect with prior knowledge and develop research
questions that will guide an information search (Rankin, 1992, p. 168).
Although the pre-searching within Stripling and Pitts’ REACT and Rankin’s Pre-Search
models offers initial research behavior support, there is a paucity of research within the
information science community on the preparation for information inquiry. Writing teachers
commonly use graphic organizers, such as the KWL (Know, What, Learn) to generate what
students already know and want to know. Gale’s Infotrac introduced Topic Finder, an option
within the databases that assists with pre-searching by generating clustered terms around the
user’s initial inquiry. However, none of the resources support the students’ preparation for the

55
manipulation of keywords or the development of research questions to come to a point of
discovery to focus an argument.
Theory based models. As previously mentioned, more recent models, researched in
higher education, have been developed with a theoretical framework in mind. Oakleaf’s (2009b)
Information Literacy Instruction Cycle is grounded in Shepard’s (1989), Stiggins’ (1991) and
Wiggins’ (1989) assessment for learning theory. Bruce’s (2008) Six Frames for Informed
Learning makes use of variation theory (Marton &Tsui, 2004; Pang & Marton, 2003 as cited in
Bruce, Edwards, & Lupton, 2006, p. 6). Variation theory within information literacy proposes
that learning occurs when information is experienced differently (Bruce, Edwards, & Lupton,
2006, p. 6). Thus searching for information is learned through the variation of using a
subscription database and the open web. Organization of information is learned when a student
processes using a graphic organizer or traditional 3x5 note cards. Bruce’s (2008) theory of
informed learning posits that students learn from not only the change in environments but also
change in experiences. Bruce (2008) and Oakleaf (2009a; 2009b), along with the Grafstein
(2002), contend that the tenets of traditional information literacy models provides a foundation
for a library program that holds information literacy as a value in the processes of pre-searching,
research preparation, and to ethically, effectively, and efficiently locate, evaluate, use and
produce information.
Information and communications technology influence. Before considering the
development of a conceptually different school library program, the influence of information and
communications technology in conjunction with models must be considered. Purcell et al. (2012)
and Kingsley et al. (2011) conclude there is an undeniable connection between information and
communications technologies as the tools for researching and the actual information generated.

56
As a result, the importance of developing proficient information literacy skills and understanding
the processes that are within the sequencing of each skill grows exponentially along with the
growth of information and communications technology and information. Purcell et al. (2012)
report 77% of secondary education writing teachers state information and communication
technologies have a positive impact on student research habits (p. 3). Information and
communications technology tools are engaging, as they exist within a students’ realm of
experiences. In addition, many software programs have graphic organizer tools, such as numbers
and bullets or Microsoft’s Smart Art feature. However, 64% of these teachers also report
students are distracted by the same digital technology (p. 2). Without guidance and instruction,
students will not learn how to manage and organize the digital information and tools offered in
order to engage in information inquiry behavior.
While students experience the research process within an environment rich with
information, the tools used to access information distract from the critical thinking necessary for
proficient inquiry. This distraction restricts the amount of time students dedicate to inquiry.
Newell, Beach, Smith, and VanDerHeide (2011) report that in argumentative writing, due to
digital media, students assume “that in formulating claims, they [students] simply need to
summarize their claims to achieve the goal of convincing audiences without providing
supporting evidence, considering counterarguments, or changing their own or others’ stances on
an issue” (p. 274). Students are not conducting the deep information inquiry within the research
process necessary to “identify the underlying argument, and its claims, warrants and evidence”
(p. 274).
Disengaged and unmotivated students due to educator disconnect with information and
communication technology tools leave all at a disadvantage. Fullan (2013) states “the engaged

57
student is attentive, committed, persistent, and finds meaning and value” in learning (p. 18).
Using information and communication technology tools to design new pedagogy that partners
with students will only advance quality (p. 31). Fullan (2013) views information and
communications technologies as the great accelerator of new innovative methods of teaching
within education (p. 31).
Stakeholders Perspective and Support
Only through leadership comprised of librarians, educators, administrators, and students
can information literacy be recognized for its place of importance in the development of
knowledge growth. The combination of perspectives displays a push and pull situation, where
stakeholders claim ownership but are unable, due to a host of barriers, to adequately offer
information literacy instruction opportunities. The introduction of standards, a framework,
graphic organizers, models, and information and communication technology tools have the
potential to enhance the research process. If these tools are used inconsistently or without
educator and librarian guidance, they offer the student very little benefit. Yet, in the examination
of stakeholder perspectives and instructional support, each offers a glimpse into the value of
information and information literacy. Both the frameworks of the Association of College and
Research Libraries (2015) and the American Association of School Librarians (2007) standards
note ethical and aesthetic value. Badke (2005) recognized value within the individual’s right to
gain knowledge. Fullan (2006) and Saunders (2011) offer that value must be intentionally
selected and supported by stakeholders within an organization if it is to become of importance to
student learning. If a school library program considers value as a fulcrum that balances
stakeholders, curriculum, practice, assessments, standards, framework, models, and support, it
has the potential to guide an entire community.

58
Information Literacy and Value
Despite association standards, a framework, and educator and librarian support, the
genuine problem of students entering higher education not having mastered information literacy
behaviors necessary for the rigors of higher education remains. Information science practitioners
research how best to guide and build student information literacy skills in order to generate
generalizable themes that work. Theories associated with information literacy research offer
different perspectives by which to view the problem and possible solutions. Applying Dewey’s
(2009) statement that “differences in theory…grows out of conflicting elements in a genuine
problem” (Dewey, 2009, p. 104), to information literacy research allows for the concept of value
to be introduced. The possibility of generating themes for a “solution comes only by getting
away from the meaning of terms that is already fixed upon and coming to see the conditions
from another point of view, and hence in a fresh light” (p. 104). Shifting the thinking of
information literacy from a set of processes and skills taught by educators and gained by students
to a concept of value offers a new perspective, which may lead to possibilities of better preparing
student information behaviors. Information literacy through the perspective of value raises the
consciousness of understanding and reflection once an individual is engaged in information
behaviors. Progressive education realizes “genuine thinking and valuing taking place when the
child begins to step back and reflect on the consequences of action” (Gutek, 2009, p. 340). Thus,
each experience with information reflects value, no matter if a model, set of practices, or series
of processes are utilized.
Simply stating information literacy should be guided through the perspective of value is
not enough to generate complex understanding for how this concept trickles down into an
educator’s lesson plan. A foundation for understanding value begins with axiology, the

59
subdivision of philosophy that considers the study of value in an attempt to “prescribe what is
good and right conduct” (Gutek, 2009, p. 5). Axiology divides into the subdivisions of ethics,
“the philosophical study of moral value and conduct” (p. 5) and aesthetics, the “study of values
in the realm of beauty and art” (p. 5). Both ethical and aesthetic values develop in humans by the
shaping and molding of behaviors through the experiences their society and culture have deemed
important. These experiences develop a set of rules by which a human understands ethical and
aesthetic value. However, Dewey (1916) cautions that these rules “are so important as standards
to judging the worth of new experiences that parents and instructors are always tending to teach
them directly to the young” (p. 274), potentially leading to symbolic teaching rather than what
the individual has “specifically appreciated to be deeply significant in concrete situations” (p.
274). For information literacy to include value, experience with information would have to
encompass both an understanding for established ethical standards as well as the individual’s
deep appreciation for any created work.
Ethical value. The education community has a significant role in shaping a student’s
ethical and aesthetic values. Value within education is constructed throughout experiences in a
classroom, school, and district’s direct rituals and routines or the indirect experimentation,
observations, and discovery opportunities (Dewey, 1916, p. 271). Within education, ethical
values shape moral belief and behavior expected with learning, especially in the school
environment. Hence, a student claims a piece of original work through the routine of using a
formatted heading; the raising of a hand indicates a question, order, and fairness; and adopted
state curriculum deems certain content as having uniform ethical value within society. Core
Curriculum State Standards provide evidence of information literacy as an ethical value.
Students are required to “cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what

60
the text says explicitly” (NGA Center, 2010, p. CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.9-10.1) and to
“delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, assessing whether the
reasoning is valid and the evidence is relevant and sufficient; identify false statements and
fallacious reasoning” (p. CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.9-10.8). Ethical values exist within
information literacy standards, frameworks, models, processes, and practices, as each establish
expected behaviors to insure attribution is given to a creator; that information applied and
transferred to others is authoritative, current, objective, and true; and that an individual’s creation
has not been plagiarized or stolen. Therefore, the framework for information literacy containing
ethical value has been established but lacks educator and student conviction and appreciation to
warrant diligent use.
Aesthetic value. Aesthetic value is not as recognized when molding behavior because it
requires the individual to develop appreciation through the “engagement of imagination” (Dewey,
1916, p. 276). Dewey (1916) states that “the imagination is the medium of appreciation in every
field” (p. 276), moving the mechanical process into activities where individuals determine value
through their own experiences (p. 276). However, Gutek (2009) states, “aesthetic dimension of
life frequently has been neglected in U.S. education” (p. 5). Curriculum standards require
students to determine, analyze, integrate, delineate and evaluate, leaving it up to the educator to
include experiences to create, design, invent, and originate. Therefore, education often limits
aesthetic value to the appreciation of the beauty within subjects such as literature, art, music, and
drama. While, “aesthetic values have an obvious place in art, drama, music, and dancing classes:
they are also relevant to the cultivation of public taste and style of life” (Gutek, 2009, p. 5).
Dewey (1916) states that aesthetic value is not confined to specific education content but “its
scope is as comprehensive as the work of education itself” (p. 276). Aesthetic value within

61
information literacy comes when a student appreciates the designing of an argument, develops
unique search strategies for locating evidence, manipulates search tools and recognizes there is
beauty in another’s creation as well as in his or her created work. Thus, each piece of work used
within the ethical models, practices, and processes of information literacy are appreciated for
aesthetic value and what its creator brings to a student’s knowledge development.
Produce change by combining values. The subdivisions of value, ethics and aesthetics,
complement each other when cohesively focused towards a common purpose. Consequently,
aesthetic value can offer reasoning and appreciation for why the ethical practices and processes
of information literacy are necessary. However, educators cannot simply direct students to accept
value within information literacy without providing guidance. Before educators can offer
guidance, they have to change the traditional perception of information literacy to support the
concept of value. A “successful system reform usually means that a small number (up to half
dozen) of powerful factors are interacting to produce substantial impact,” (Fullan, 2009, p. 108),
upon an organization. While Fullan (2009) references educational reform as a whole, the
generalizable theme is the understanding that educational change requires the perspective of
many stakeholders working toward a common purpose.
Whether realized or not, the information literacy factors of leadership, educators,
partnerships, professional development, greater school community and especially students all
have a stake in the proliferation of information behavior. Each of these factors has a role in how
current information literacy is valued and practiced. More significant is the role these factors will
have within the change of value as a significant element of information literacy. Currently
information literacy education is disjointed and inconsistent as it relies on educators to select
when the teaching of information behavior has a place within class content. For change to occur,

62
information literacy education must centralize focus through a mission/theory that promotes the
interaction between the factors (Fullan, 2009, p. 108), produces imaginative and authentic
experimentation experiences for students and educators (Dewey, 1916; Wiggins, 1993), and
generates informative evidence (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011, p. 171) to continually evaluate and
build a sustainable library program. The theory or mission that combines ethical and aesthetic
information literacy value is simply a jumpstart, while action and practice make change happen
(Fullan, 2011). Bridging the gaps of understanding, and working to “reach for partnership, and
replace polarization with integration—in ways that make every effort to respect each other’s
position without capitulating to them” (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011, p. 154) open up avenues for
conversation towards development. Individually, educators and administrators have to look
inward (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011, p. 154) to determine their current information literacy
practices. Administrative leadership must reflect upon the professionalism, culture, and
leadership of information literacy within the school, in order to reach beyond traditional practice
to lead change (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011, p. 163). It is only through working together,
recognizing the need, and possessing a willingness to try something different, that students will
have an opportunity to gain sustainable, transferable and recontextualizable information literacy
processes and skills.
While providing educators with a theory or mission and opening up avenues to produce
integrations that recognize ethical and aesthetic information literacy value, students still require
tangible reasoning for why this path of engagement is personally beneficial. Educators are
instrumental in developing student values through not only classroom rituals and routines, but by
also appreciating knowledge that is transferred towards adulthood. There is a difference between
testing a student for ethical use of information and developing a student who embodies ethical

63
and aesthetic value for and with information (Gutek, 2009, p. 340). In an effort to develop the
whole child, Wiggins & McTighe (2005) encourage the use of essential questions “made central
to the unit to engender probing inquiry and eventual transfer” (p. 106) of knowledge. Thus, the
essential question is “not just about ‘the answer’ but about learning how to learn” (Wiggins &
McTighe, 2005, p. 108) and building key understanding that can be re-contextualized. Consider
the essential question, how do you ethically and appreciatively use information? The essential
question is phrased for an individual’s life and lifetime of experiences and reflection. The
phrasing opens up the opportunity for imaginative experimentation (Dewey, 1916) with
information opportunities, where thoughtful judgments build understanding throughout a lesson
and towards a lifetime. To engage students, educators “design criteria that can be used to frame
challenges that are psychometrically useful but also more authentic” (Wiggins, 1993, p. 206)
allowing students to respond to the essential question individually while collectively
understanding the concepts. Thus, within the school environment, the transfer of value is
reflected in how a student appreciates then ethically behaves when engaged in information
behaviors. Information value is not driven by a set of rules but by the student’s deep
understanding and appreciation for what one is about to create, using what was already created,
and what will be passed onto others.
Social justice consideration. Information literacy as a value has the opportunity to tackle
the educational injustices that occur when certain groups of students are selected to learn or not
learn information literacy behaviors based upon an educator’s pre-determined criteria. Dewey
(1916) makes the argument that “experience knows no division between human concern and a
purely mechanical physical world” (p. 333). Therefore, should not all students have the
opportunity to engage information literacy throughout their educational experiences? Previous

64
research has provided insight into why educators developed personal reasons not to offer
information literacy within content areas. Dewey (2009) offers that it is too easy to see
conditions both in their separateness and with an adult perspective (p. 104). In doing this, adult
educators overlay their own information behavior importance onto a student’s experiences, never
allowing the student to deeply understand why the use of information requires ethical and
aesthetic value focused behaviors. When information behavior is viewed through separateness,
each stakeholder separately makes choices at the expense of others rather than looking at the
reality of each other (p. 104). The social injustice falls within the educator’s own decision and
reasoning for discriminating why one group over another receives valuable information literacy
practice and knowledge and the allowing of misbehavior with information use to perpetuate. Not
offering information literacy ethical and aesthetic value experiences as one community leaves
holes in knowledge students will reflect upon, use, and transfer between classrooms and into
higher education. The loss of continuity indirectly provides permission for an individual student
to apply a self-defined information literacy value only when he or she deems it important. Thus,
the knowledge from the educator who applies information literacy as a value within a learning
unit never translates into reality of practice if not required to do so by other educators. This
disjointed practice leaves the potential information literacy knowledge in limbo, as “second
handed” (Dewey, 1916, p. 275), generating a “split between a person’s professed standards and
his actual one” (p. 275). All students should have information literacy value that represent who
they are through their relationship with information.
Without information literacy value, the current inconsistent method for teaching, guiding,
and practicing information literacy will remain socially unjust. Librarians will be left to
emphasize the importance of information literacy; educators will still teach information process

65
based upon their own pedagogy, discipline demands, and discrimination, and students will
continue to enter higher education without sufficient information literacy preparation. Thus, the
educators who are willing to equally offer information literacy through the differentiation of
instruction, rather than eliminating it due to preconceived notions of student ability, add value to
their community. Leadership should recognize “before us the need of overcoming this separation
in education if society is to be truly democratic” (Dewey, 1916, p. 338). Gutek (2009) posits,
“values are not the product of imposition from those in power but are the results of the interface
and sharing of people, whose voices have an equal right to be heard” (p. 412). Teachers have a
responsibility to guide student values. By guiding students to develop the skills needed to make
ethical decisions and appreciate the creative person who developed the information and
recognize the beauty of the information itself, the school community exhibits a shared value.
Developing a Library Program
Libraries traditionally offer individual programs centered on a specific concern or interest
generated through patron feedback. Library programs are “essentially an unconnected and nonsequential array of courses in-class sessions” (Saunders, 2011, p. 233). Educators select from a
menu offering of librarian created programs that can be taught separately or embedded into class
instruction (Loesch, 2010; Saunders, 2011). A disconnect occurs in student learning when library
programs do not allow for students to link the processes and understanding of information
literacy skills learned within each program. Rather, a new type of library program, which places
information literacy skills development as a value to be used as a guiding principal for all that
the library offers to students, insures that educators, librarians, and students are consistently
considering the proper processes involved with information behavior, while appreciating the
information used and new knowledge created. As a new culture for developing information

66
literate students evolves, leadership must be both transformative and transactional.
Transformative leadership allows for a complete change to the school library’s traditional
methods for conducting information literacy instruction (Burke, 2011, p. 216) along with a refocus on the mission. Transactional leadership allows for the day-to-day management of the
library to continue, changing gradually when necessary (p. 216). Within each of these leadership
distinctions lies a need for distributive leadership composed of librarians, educators, and students
that will bring to the program perspectives, expertise, skills, and willingness to risk, in the
pursuit of potentially increasing student learning, achievement and reduction of the opportunity
gap. Not only will students be assessed within the process of learning information literacy but
they will also know what the intended learning outcome is and how it will influence their lives.
Models, rubrics, organizers, and assessments will be used as consistent guides and reflective
mechanisms.
Evaluation of the entire library program is essential. The application of a program theory
has implications for other school libraries. Applying program theory evaluation, leadership
selects a library’s values, objectives, and activities (Bickman, 1987; Chen, 1990). An evaluation
of the activities includes a determination if the objectives were met and value maintained
(Bickman, 1987; Chen, 1990). Once an evaluation is complete, adjustments can be made.
Through a consistent evaluation process, the validity of data by generalizable themes of
curriculum, practices, assessments, models, and rubrics that improved information literacy within
a library program can be assessed. These themes have the potential to shift how secondary school
librarians, educators, administration, and students together change the secondary school library
program.
Conclusion

67
The need to use information and communications technology tools increases
simultaneously with the need for information. Educators want students to complete quality work
that has been ethically and aesthetically produced. Students want to experience information and
communications technology tools and information behaviors on their terms. Librarians want to
provide leadership that will motivate students through information literacy models, standards and
frameworks that engage with content learning to increase knowledge and build life skills.
Joining forces under a combined leadership with a focused goal will propel educators, librarians,
and students to develop a sustainable information literacy-based library program that will benefit
the entire secondary school community.
Chapter 3: Research Design
Trochim (2001) simply asks whether a researcher is willing to trade detail for
generalizability (p. 152). This question, which evokes a seesaw image, reflects the choices
between quantitative and qualitative research. Where quantitative research seeks to generate
conclusions that can be expanded to generalities, qualitative research offers an opportunity to
make sense of a situation or phenomenon. Using inductive reasoning, qualitative research moves
“from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories” (Trochim, 2001, p. 17). As
data are gathered and analyzed, the researcher will detect emerging “patterns and regularities and
formulate some tentative hypothesis” (Trochim, 2001, p. 17) that can later be explored, in order
to develop “general conclusions or theories” (Trochim, 2001, p. 17).
Trochim’s (2001) explanation of qualitative research supports the examination of
information behavior within Western High School’s library program that educators and students
utilize for information literacy support. Through qualitative research, the researcher is able to
record data generated by educator, administrator, and student participants who are stakeholders

68
of Western High School’s library program. The open-ended nature of qualitative research
allowed the researcher to examine participant perspectives on information inquiry behavior
within a natural setting, utilizing authentic curriculum assignments designed by educators to
determine learning (Creswell, 2013, p. 45). This distinction is important, as previous information
literacy research has restricted students either by query limitations, artificial settings, or
irrelevant content. Qualitative research can convey information on individual educator or student
growth mindset as he or she makes decisions and reacts within information literacy processes. A
“growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things” cultivated through
effort and experiences (Dweck, 2008, p. 7). Traditional mindset is a set of established beliefs that
have been generated within an individual’s culture (Dweck, 2008, p. 16). Therefore, individuals
who embody a growth mindset value and pay “close attention to information that could stretch
their knowledge” and learning becomes the priority (Dweck, 2008, p. 18). In addition, the
discussion of an individual’s culture can often be sensitive in nature. Qualitative research can
offer a structure for the respectful examination of how an individual’s culture, made up of
socioeconomic, family beliefs and viewed experiences, establishes values for deeper
understanding of information behavior.
Research Questions
The research questions developed should mirror the open-ended nature of a qualitative
study and reflect the aspects of the chosen paradigm. The qualitative research case study
presented explored how stakeholders perceived the Western High School library program’s
approach toward information behavior and whether it could lead to student information literacy
growth.

69
Research question one. How does Western High School’s library program support
information behavior?
Research question two. How do Western High School educators and administrators
describe their experiences with the library program’s influence on information behavior?
Research question three. How do the Western High School students describe their
experiences with the library program’s influence on information behavior?
Research Paradigm
The development of research questions and selection of a paradigm must be completed
simultaneously. Research questions have to honor any philosophy by which the researcher views
his or her study while remaining within the scope of a selected paradigm. Ponterotto’s (2005) use
of Filstead (1979) and Denzin and Lincoln (2000b) establishes that a qualitative research
paradigm provides both a philosophical and conceptual framework as a lens to view the
research’s selected methodology components (as cited in Ponterotto, 2005, p. 127). Prior to
selecting a research paradigm, the researcher has to determine several possible aspects of the
study. First, the research is hermeneutical, limiting the research to specific interpretive
paradigms. Second, the researcher’s role, as director of Western High School’s library program,
combines both study observer and participant. Within the study, the researcher is able to coconstruct findings from both the interactive dialogue and interpretations (Ponterottto, 2005, p.
129). Western High School’s library program contains pre-search guidance, a research
preparation model, supportive materials, and educational training developed and utilized by the
researcher. In addition, a library culture has developed over time that embodies stakeholder
perceptions. Because of the researcher’s role, it is important that the study includes a
presentation of her background, to include work and cultural experiences, as well as history and

70
how each shapes the “interpretation of the information of the study and what” is gained
(Creswell, 2013, p. 47). Third, the study embraces the philosophy that “multiple realities are
constructed” (p. 36) through participant’s various experiences (Ponterotto, 2005, p. 129). Broad
interview questions were used to generate and capture participant’s authentic perspective. This
thinking also provides a connection to Dewey’s (1902/2009) philosophy of building knowledge
through experiences, Wiggins’ (1993) assessment for learning theory, which directs and redirects
learning experiences through the analysis of multiple assessments, and Bickman’s (1987) use of
a program theory, which establishes a design for evaluating the existing program.
After applying these philosophies to the study, it was determined that Ponterotto’s (2005)
Constructivism-Interpretivism paradigm served as the most appropriate lens by which to view
educator and student experiences with information literacy within Western High School’s library
program. The researcher was firmly grounded as a necessary participant, where individual
student realities are valued, deeper meaning was constructed through these individual
experiences, and interpretation is a necessary method for analyzing data collected. In addition,
research questions offer guidance for collecting data in methods that best offer interpretation
opportunities on multiple levels.
Research Design
Qualitative research explores the nuances of a given phenomenon in a natural setting, in
order to generate a narrative for deeper understanding (Creswell, 2013, p. 46). Lincoln and
Guba’s (1985) naturalistic inquiry does not focus on methodology but on a new way of
considering human behavior. In a natural setting, “the design of a naturalistic inquiry…cannot be
given in advance; it must emerge, develop, unfold” (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 225), rather than
proceeding through a series of strict steps. The design emerges because meaning is determined

71
through the multiple realities of participants within a given context (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p.
208). What is learned develops through interactions between the investigator and context
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 208). Miles, Huberman & Saldaña (2014) contribute to qualitative
research through the development of an evaluation criteria. Evaluation criteria offer a series of
researcher considerations that act as tests of validity. Evaluation criteria (1) check for
representation of all stakeholders, (2) “checks for research effects on the case” (Miles, Huberman
& Saldaña, 2014, p. 294), (3) use triangulation across sources and methods, (4) weigh the
evidence according to strength, (5) check for outliers that may have meaning, (6) use extreme
outlier cases to verify conclusions, (7) follow up on surprises, (8) locate negative evidence, (9)
use the If-Then test to focus analysis, (10) rule out “spurious relations” (Miles, Huberman &
Saldaña, 2014, p. 294), (11) replicate the study in a new context, and (12) locate counter
explanations (Miles, Huberman & Saldaña, 2014, p. 294). Constant diligence towards the
validation of data leading to the transferability of theory further legitimizes the efforts of
qualitative researchers.
Because the researcher sought to examine the experiences of educators, administrators,
and students within the natural setting of Western High School’s library program, with the
intention of gaining understanding for how information behavior influences information literacy,
the researcher chose a qualitative research design. A qualitative study allows for the examination
of educator and student perspectives within their individual information ecosystem experiences.
In addition, qualitative research offer the researcher an opportunity to contribute her perspective
on and interpretation of educator, administrator, and student experiences leading “to an insightful
understanding of a case and its internal as well as external complexity” (Yin, 2014, p. 209).

72
Following the evaluation criteria may lead to transferability of findings and the possible
emergence of new theory to improve information literacy learning in secondary education.
Research Tradition
The researcher selected to use an instrumental case study to examine how the Western
High School library program’s approach to information behavior influenced student information
literacy growth. Case study research examines “contemporary events…when the relevant
behaviors cannot be manipulated” (Yin, 2014, p. 12). Case study research is defined as an
empirical inquiry investigating a contemporary phenomenon, when boundaries between
phenomenon and context are not clear, using multiple sources and benefiting from prior theory to
“guide data collection and analysis” (Yin, 2014, p. 16). The purpose of using instrumental case
study research “is to investigate a particular phenomenon or theory” (Pickard, 2013, p. 102). This
instrumental case study provided the researcher “with a holistic account of the case and in-depth
knowledge of the specific through rich description situated in context” (Pickard, 2013, p. 102)
leading to an understanding of the case (Pickard, 2013, p. 102). Applying instrumental case study
research supported the researcher’s ability to examine, describe, and derive data focused on
individual student understanding of information literacy. Utilizing a natural setting allowed for
the examination of participant experiences within an authentic and select environment rather than
one with a predetermined outcome (Creswell, 2013, p. 76).
This case study research supports the overall examination of Western High School’s
library program. Within the program, multiple resources were used to support educator,
administrator, and student motivation, understanding, and knowledge growth surrounding
information literacy. Evidence was provided through collected printed documentation and
stakeholder interviews (Yin, 2014, p. 106). The descriptions may open consideration for

73
transferability or theory development involving information literacy within K-16 educational
setting. While theory offers new perspective to view phenomena, transferability requires a
“similarity between the contexts” (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 124). When two contexts are
“sufficiently’ congruent, then working hypotheses from the sending originating context may be
applicable in the receiving context” (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 124).
The purpose of the study was to determine whether the library program within Western
High School supports the development of student information literacy skills. The research
developed in-depth description and analysis within the boundaries of Western High School’s
library program (Creswell, 2013, p. 98). While Miles and Huberman’s (1994) pragmatic
judgment that any method that “offers clear, verifiable and credible meanings from a set of
qualitative data—is grist for our mill, regardless of it’s antecedents” (p. 3), this general inductive
approach to qualitative research limits possible insight, specific vocabulary, and research
motivation of a possible new theory in student research behavior (Miles and Huberman’s, 1994,
p. 3). The selection of instrumental case study research insures rigor was embedded into the
overall design, to include the process of sampling, procedures, data collection, data analysis, and
the emergence of findings. Selecting instrumental case study research also ensures the study’s
boundaries and methodology have been carefully and deliberately reviewed to adjust for threats
to the research, including the researcher’s close association with the study. Finally, selecting
instrumental case study research places responsibility directly on the researcher to heed
Saldaña’s (2013) guidance to “examine individual value, attitude, and belief systems about
qualitative inquiry” (p. 2) when selecting a coding system to organize and interpret themes
generated.

74
Key case study theorist. The research presented utilizes the methodology approach of
instrumental case study. Case study practice is utilized in a professional environment or in the
context of every-day living to intensely study a specific context, defined as the case (Creswell,
2013, p. 98). Different from ethnography or grounded theory research traditions, the case study
research design uses the “role of theory development, prior to the conduct of any data collection”
(Yin, 2014, p. 37). It is through this specific context that a unique aspect of an otherwise typical
case may evoke the possibility of the emergence of a new theory or indicate the need for
additional research.
The foundation for case study research was initiated by the questioning of deductive and
inductive reasoning within science (Mill, 1886/ 2008, p. 147). Deductive reasoning establishes
possible themes or hypotheses that are consistently used to evaluate data (Mill, 1886/ 2008, p.
45). Deductive reasoning establishes that the theme or hypothesis being tested is correct.
Inductive reasoning requires the researcher to work between emerging themes within the data
until a comprehensive set is established to support a position (Creswell, 2013, p. 45). Thus,
actual proof is not determined but rather the researcher and practitioners within the given field
are pointed in a direction. This direction gives support to Mill’s (1886/ 2008) discussion, which
opened future speculation for investigating multiple instances of the same phenomena (Mills,
1886/2008, p. 201). Mill’s (1886/ 2008) offers that induction can be proof “it is inferring
something unobserved from something observed; it requires therefore, an appropriate test of
proof and to provide that test is the special purpose of inductive logic” (p. 199). Thus, for
inductive reasoning to be considered a method of developing proof it must connect different data
types that support a new conception or theme (Mill, 1886/ 2008, p. 199).

75
Since Mill (1886/ 2008), researchers have recognized a need for qualitative research to
intensely investigate a particular case rather than utilize quantitative research to investigate
occurrences during of a single point in time. Researchers such as Yin (2014), Stake (2005, 1995)
and Merriam (1998) have all offered insight into case study research. Together their efforts have
consistently worked to increase the validity of case study through research design. The case
study approach has been utilized in many disciplines including psychology, social sciences, law,
medicine, and education. Because these disciplines are constantly shifting, the case study
researcher must be cognizant that the research is bound by parameters, such as space, time,
project, or program (Creswell, 2013; Yin 2014) rather than a specific analytical format. While
Merriam (1998) has made significant contributions to this research through contributions within
education, Yin (2014) and Stake (2005) offer important validation points for legitimizing case
study methodology.
Merriam’s (1998) work embodies Stake’s (1995) humanistic considerations and Yin’s
(2014) emphasis on increasing validity, while layering social justice as an influencing factor
within educational research. Yin’s (2014) significance to this case is the quest to legitimize case
study research through the consistent emphasis on methodology to ensure understanding for
maintaining rigor, ethics, analysis, and reporting (p. 19). Stake’s (2005) contribution to this case
study surrounds the focus on humanistic research and the researcher’s role within the study.
Stake (1995) acknowledges the focus on human concerns and the objective to seek the intense
meaning within each human’s interpretation and construction of knowledge within the case (p.
101). Stake (1995) places great responsibly on the researcher to recognize deliberate or intuitive
role choices that influence personal participation, expertise, and analysis of the case (p. 103).
Stake (1995) urges the researcher to consider “how much the researcher will be her or himself”

76
within the study (p. 103). This question should be answered ethically and honestly before the
researcher proceeds with the case study (p. 103).
Merriam (1998) contributes specifically to this case study research through the
recognition of the constant changes occurring in education. Educational professionals often draw
upon psychology, sociology, history, and other disciplines to inform practice. However, it is
equally important for educational professionals to complete case study research within their own
domain, in order to gather relevant data (p. 45). Merriam (1998) references Carr and Kemmis’s
(1986) three forms of educational research, positivists, interpretive, and critical, as the lenses to
not only create a research design, but to consider intervention once data is analyzed (as cited in
Merriam, 1998, p. 4). Positivist educational research generates knowledge that is observable and
measureable (Merriam, 1998, p. 4). Interpretive educational research generates knowledge from
“inductive, hypothesis- or theory-generating… mode of inquiry” (Merriam, 1998, p. 4). Critical
research generates knowledge from the perspectives of multiple realities emerges depending on a
person’s knowledge, experiences and beliefs surrounding “power, privilege and oppression in the
areas of educational practice” (Merriam, 1998, p. 4).
Seminal works. The selection of seminal works is necessary to both support and firmly
ground case study as a method for research. Although the focus of this research is within the
information science profession, the case study method has crossed many disciplines. Case studies
from the University of Chicago’s Department of Sociology during the 1920’s through the 1950’s
have been accredited with beginning the momentum to investigate data on specific issues
(Creswell, 2013, p. 97). Yin (2014) specifically offers three examples, which contribute to the
generalizability of case study findings. Allison’s (1971) single case study examining the 1962
Cuban missile crisis remains a significant example, which illustrates both explanatory and

77
descriptive functions (Yin, 2014, p. 7). Whyte (1943/1993) along with Neustadt and Fineberg
(1978) have presented case studies that yield specific findings that can be viewed as generalities.
Whyte’s (1943/1993) case study of a neighborhood produced findings related to “individual
performance, group structures, and the social structures of neighborhoods” (Yin, 2014, p. 8).
Neustadt and Fineberg (1978) produced an “exceptionally well-researched case study” that
“contemporary policy makers have continued to consult” to understand “the quandaries of health
crisis and public actions” (Yin, 2014, p. 8).
Evidence based practice has been a primary motivator for producing quality research in
the field of education. Because educators continually search for methods to best approach
pedagogy to guide students in the building of knowledge, case study research within education
has experienced an increase. Cuban and Usdan (2003) presented a multiple case study examining
how six different urban districts “have gone about their work and how they have engaged the
support and collaboration of the business and political sectors” (Yin, 2005, p. 233). The
significance of this multiple case study is in the organization and interpretation of data. Word
tables were used to cover “demographic profiles, political and governance reforms, managerial
and instructional strategies and outcomes” (Yin, 2005, p. 234). The analysis presented “equally
and without research interpretation”, in order for the reader to draw his or her own conclusions
(p. 234). Kidder’s (1989) single case study of a fifth grade class “conveys the richness and
complexity of everyday life in a school, in a manner not readily emulated by other social science
methods” (Yin, 2005, p. 4). The case study is significant for future researchers to create a design
that allows for the researcher’s close proximity as the “unobtrusive observer” in order to create
general understanding for how the classroom functions (Yin, 2005, p. 4). Both case studies
presented by Cuban and Usdan (2003) and Kidder (1989) display how important the research

78
design is to generating detailed data that can be subsequently transferred between educational
settings.
Significant to this research were the case studies found in information science.
Kuhlthau’s (1991; 1990; 1988) five-year seminal case study follows the information literacy
learning progress of high school students as they advance toward higher education. The case
study provided information science practitioners with a longitudinal example. In addition, having
Kuhlthau’s research firmly grounded in Kelly’s (1973) personal construct theory provided
information science practitioners insight into how perspective adds to a richer understanding for
the acquisition of information literacy skills. Through theory, Kuhlthau’s work also added to the
understanding for how feelings, cognition, and action progressed, affected information inquiry,
and supported development of the Information Search Process model. Saunders (2011) research
of information literacy as a learning outcome within the boundaries of the Middle States
Commission’s accreditation process reviewed the documentation of over 60 higher education
institutions, from which four were selected for case study research. The significance of Saunders’
(2011) research was how it was used to explain an institution’s self-study documentation, which
will allow future practitioners to plan information literacy programs (p.98).
Although seminal case studies come from a variety of disciplines, they are similar in that
they design the research with validity, in order for the findings to be transferable to similar
locations or situations. Case studies specific to education and information science education must
always consider the unique perspectives of the population. Yet, it is through similar themes that
emerge, in addition to rich details gathered, which allow educators to consider how best to adjust
or change pedagogy.
Participants

79
This case study required a narrow range sampling strategy where participants had
previous experience within the phenomenon being studied (Creswell, 2013, p.155). The study
examined Western High School stakeholder perspectives on information within the natural
setting of the school’s library program. School stakeholders were comprised of administrators,
educators, and students. Because the research utilized the case study method, stratified
purposeful (Creswell, 2013), also known as purposive sampling (Pickard, 2013), was conducted
to “illustrate subgroups” (Creswell, 2013, p. 158), identifying “key informants who will have a
great deal of knowledge about the case” (Pickard, 2013, p. 104), and facilitate comparisons
(Creswell, 2013, p. 158). While this case study sought sixteen participants: three administrators,
five educators, and eight students only six students were interviewed reducing the participants to
fourteen.
Participant descriptor variations of position/role, gender, ethnicity, service years,
department association, year of graduation, and class level were maximized within the given
population of possible participants. Because of the variation in participant roles, not all
descriptors applied to each participant. The researcher understood and considered the influence
of how course content and professional decisions by educators may necessitate the differentiation
of teaching styles, learning objectives, and course preparation levels, in order to meet the
learning abilities of individual students. This enriches the experiences of the participants.
Western High School in Massachusetts was selected to complete the research. Proper
permissions were sought and received from the Western School District school committee (see
Appendix A for school committee permission letter), superintendent (see Appendix B for
superintendent permission letter), and the Western High School principal (see Appendix C for
principal permission letter). Western High School was selected because of the researcher’s

80
relationship to the library program, in which information literacy has been the focal point of
management and collaboration. Although the library space was available and reading material
could be borrowed, Western High School had no formal library program in place and did not
employ a certified school librarian for two years prior to the arrival of the researcher. Findings
will be used to improve the current library program and information literacy education.
Recruitment and Access
Administrators, educators, and students were asked to participate in this case study. All
Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines were followed for each population. Sample size
recommendation for each of these populations varied depending on the unit of analysis being
conducted (Pickard, 2013, p. 104). Pickard (2013) states that when using a purposive sampling
strategy, informants may open opportunities to recruit other participants who can offer rich
detailed information from different perspectives of the case (p. 104). As an organization tool for
recruitment, the research followed Pickard (2013) recommendation to create a detailed list to
define profiles, which were used to identify a diverse population of participants (p. 105). In order
to reduce possible bias, the researcher developed strict criteria for possible participants within
each category. All participants or their parent/guardian signed a consent form establishing
voluntary participation, the right to withdraw, the purpose of the study, how the researcher will
maintain anonymity, and delineating any risks and benefits (Creswell, 2012, p. 149).
Administrator recruitment and access. Administrator participants are employed in
Western School District. Administrators must have earned proper Massachusetts State
certifications for his or her particular position. Administrators were purposefully recruited based
upon their professional positions, knowledge of district and school curriculum direction and
supports, as well as the influence of their leadership, both direct and indirect, upon Western High

81
School’s library program. Western School District has three possible administrative participants.
A formal letter (see Appendix D for administrator and educator call-to-participate letter) was
mailed directly to the three possible participants. Three affirmative replies were received. A
meeting was arranged with each administrator during a non-school time that was convenient to
the administrator, in order to present the Informed Consent Form (see Appendix E for
administrator informed consent form,) and conduct the interview. Administrators received no
incentives or payment to avoid possible conflict with the Massachusetts 2009 Ethic’s Reform
Act (State of Massachusetts, 2013).
Educator recruitment and access. Educator participants are employed as a full-time
employee Western School District, physically teaching within the school, and are Massachusetts
State certified for the subject areas they are instructing. The researcher recruited participants by
sending a call-to-participate email to educators (see Appendix D for administrator and educator
call-to-participate letter). Participating educators had to have had at least one information inquiry
lesson or unit with planned performance assessments that were incorporated into at least one first
semester class he or she taught during the 2014-2015 school year. From the affirmative replies,
five educators were purposefully selected using profile descriptors of gender, ethnicity,
department, and class level, with the intent to assure diversity within the participants. This
ensured that candidates did not represent one content area or grade level, which potentially
would have limited participant perspectives. The researcher arranged a meeting with each
educator participant during non-school hours at a time convenient to present the project, the
Informed Consent Form (see Appendix F for educator informed consent form) and conduct the
interview. Interviews took place within Western High School. Educators did not receive any
incentives or payment to avoid possible conflict with the Massachusetts 2009 Ethics Reform Act

82
(State of Massachusetts, 2013). There were no consequences for educators who choose not to
participate in the study.
Student recruitment and access. All students recruited were enrolled in and attending
classes within Western High School during the first semester of the 2014-2015 school year.
Eight students were purposefully recruited from the educator participant courses to ensure their
direct participation in information inquiry lessons and use of library program materials. This
criterion eliminates those students who have only been engaging in information inquiry for selfinterests. Every effort was made to diversify student participants between gender, ethnicity,
department (research lesson was conducted), year of graduation, and class levels. A letter of
recruitment was sent directly to the selected students’ parents/guardians (see Appendix G for
parent letter for child participation). A meeting convenient to the parent or guardian was
arranged with the six who positively replied. During the meeting, parents/guardians reviewed the
purpose of the case study and sign the Informed Consent Form on behalf of their minor child
(see Appendix H for student informed consent form). Student participants were asked for their
assent by signing the same consent form.
Western High School’s Director of Guidance remained available during the semester for
student debriefing should participation in the research evoke learning, behavioral, social,
emotional, or medical concerns. To insure student and researcher safety, a second adult who was
known to the students, was present during student interviews. Student participants received a $10
gift certificate to Dunkin Donuts as a thank-you for giving up their time to participate. Each
parent or guardian was given a copy of the completed Informed Consent Form.
Data Collection

83
The information literacy as a value case study required data collection from various
perspectives in order to triangulate the results for similar themes. The researcher utilized the data
collation methods of interviews and printed material collection to complete the study. Because
Western High School’s library program is part of the school community, educator assignments
were authentic and part of the normal course of studies. Students were not expected to complete
additional work for the study.
Interview data collection. The researcher conducted a series of responsive interviews
with student, educators, and administrator participants (Rubin & Rubin, 2013, p. 36). Responsive
interviews were chosen due to the emphasis on relationship and trust, necessary elements when
working with students, peer educators, and administrators (p. 36). All interviews included a
review of the each participant’s Informed Consent Form followed by the interview protocol as
outlined in Creswell (2012) offering a script to describe the purpose of the research and the use
of predetermined interview questions (p. 220). The researcher used different scripts and
predetermined interview questions for administrators (see Appendix I for administrator script
and questions), educators (see Appendix J for educator script and questions), and students (see
Appendix K for student script and questions). All participants were asked to complete a 60minute interview. All interview questions related directly to this study’s research questions
concerning perception of information behavior as supported by Western High School’s library
program. To insure confidentiality, interview questions were designed to not collect identifying
information.
A member check was scheduled at a time that was convenient to the participant in the
same location as the initial interview. A member check, lasting no more than 30 minutes,
allowed each participant to scrutinize his or her transcript (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 236), to

84
confirm that the transcript “has captured the data as constructed by the informants, or to correct,
amend, or extend it… to establish the credibility of the case” (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 236).
Initial interviews were recorded using Quick Time and saved on the researcher’s personal
computer. Recording software was tested previously to insure it was in working order. Each
participant’s interview data was assigned a corresponding pseudonym.
Printed material data collection. Administrative print materials that influence the
library program were collected and analyzed. Administrative print materials included, but were
not limited to, library budgets, Massachusetts State requirements, curriculum requirements, and
other supportive information. All administrator or district names were removed from any print
materials.
Educator participant print materials were collected throughout the semester. Educator
print materials included, but were not limited to, lesson plans that included information inquiry,
library supportive materials and/or resources, a librarian-educator collaboration plan, lesson
notes, rubrics, and student assessment requirements. All educator names were removed from any
print materials. Each was identified by the educator’s pseudonym.
Library program materials identified by educators or students as valuable were collected.
Library program printed materials were readily available to the community prior to the research.
Using only materials created prior to the study ensures that materials were not created to
influence study outcomes. In addition, the researcher gathered the librarian’s notes and library
calendar bookings, which are routinely created in the course of library responsibilities. Notes
were taken when interacting with the participating administrators, educators, and students when
information inquiry issues, questions, supports, or planning were required. All identifying
information was removed from the notes

85
Data Storage
Interview data recordings were deleted from the researcher’s personal computer once the
interviews were transcribed. The computer and printed materials associated with this case study
are stored in a locked cabinet of the researcher’s locked home office. All print materials will
remain stored in the same locked cabinet for three years following the conclusion of the study.
Data Analysis
An instrumental case study approach was necessary to gain insight into the Western High
School library program’s influence on student information literacy growth. Data analysis
revealed how phenomena described within the case has been experienced. To examine the
research questions of a) how does Western High School’s library program support information
behavior; b) how do Western High School educators and administrators describe their
experiences with the library program’s influence on information behavior; and c) how do
Western High School students describe their experiences with the library program’s influence on
information behavior, fourteen interviews were conducted and educator print materials examined.
The researcher placed importance on the ability to triangulate data and analysis to show how
Western High School stakeholders perceived information behavior within Western High
School’s library program. Analysis of this case study’s data included an examination of
“significant statements, meaning units, textual and structural descriptions, and descriptions of
essences” (Creswell, 2013, p. 105).
Interview questions were thematically aligned but phrased differently to accommodate
participant positions or roles. Administrators were asked seven questions, while educators and
students were asked eight (see Appendices I, J, & K script and questions). The initial question
for each interview sought a general overview of participant information literacy awareness

86
through the description of an information behavior experience using Western High School’s
library program. Subsequent questions were designed to elicit participant perspectives on
information behavior experiences surrounding information literacy support, judgment,
responsibility, expectations, leadership, pedagogy, assessment, confidence, and value. To avoid
influencing responses, questions specifically naming the library were strategically placed at the
end of the interview (see Appendices I, J, & K script and questions).
Analysis began with the researcher listening to all interviews in order to discern any
audial patterns of data. The researcher then transcribed all participant interviews. To maintain
anonymity, participants were given pseudonyms. The web-based product Dedoose was used to
facilitate the data analysis after transcriptions were completed. Dedoose, developed by
University of Southern California (UCLA) socio-cultural researchers Eli Lieber, Ph.D. and
Thomas S. Weisner, Ph. D., is a for-pay analytic Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis
application (CAQDAS) for qualitative and mixed method research. Dedoose allowed uploaded
transcribed interview data to be interpreted through both individual and multiple coding of
interview excerpts. Overlapping units offer deeper understanding of any relationship among the
codes developed, which may indicate possible relationships between aspects of Western High
School’s library program. Dedoose required the importing of descriptors and first round codes
before the coding could be completed. First round In Vivo codes were developed using a sample
of two randomly selected interviews from each participant descriptor position or role. The
researcher manually cut and sorted In Vivo coded excerpts of the six transcriptions into twentyeight first round codes (see Appendix L for first round codes). These first round In Vivo codes
were used to code all fourteen interviews, including the transcriptions used as samples.
Demographic descriptors used to recruit participants were also uploaded into Dedoose.

87
In Vivo coding was selected as the first round method for analyzing data generated from
interviews and printed materials, since the researcher recognized that each participant might have
referenced information behaviors in various ways. In Vivo allowed the researcher to
“symbolically assign a salient attribute” (Saldaña, 2011, p. 3). In Vivo coding captured and made
use of language variations between participants based upon the actual terms used (Saldaña, 2013,
p. 91). In Vivo coding is used especially when it is important to “prioritize and honor the
participant’s voice” (Saldaña, 2013, p. 91). Excerpts indicating a relationship to information
behavior or the library program resulted in the emergence of twenty-eight first round In Vivo
codes (see Appendix L for first round codes). The first round In Vivo codes were defined
through participant perceptions of the Western High School library program support of
information behaviors as an indicator for information literacy learning. The definitions were
created in keeping with three of Conley’s (2014) Four Keys to College Readiness. Keys used
included students demonstrating “cognitive strategies”, “content knowledge”, and “learning
skills and techniques”, important indicators of student college and career readiness (p. 55). These
keys contain aspects of student readiness for thinking strategically, knowing core subject
knowledge, (p.55) and acting, in order to build upon previous knowledge and recontextualize
into a new setting. The fourth key, “key transition knowledge and skills” represents students’
specialized knowledge necessary to navigate and self-advocate the transitions into college
definitions (p.71). Since this research looks for indications of demonstrated and developing
information literacy skills, this fourth key was not referenced when defining the initial codes.
Analytic memos were created within Dedoose during the first round In Vivo coding,
allowing the researcher to reflect upon excerpts, especially those with multiple associated codes

88
(Saldaña, 2011, p. 42). Analytic memos facilitated insight necessary for the use of the second
round coding (p. 42).
Focused coding was used as a second round code analysis of the interview and printed
material data. The purpose of Focused coding was to identify “the most salient categories”
(Charmaz, as cited by Saldaña, 2013, p. 213), which requires the researcher to “make decisions
about which initial round codes make the most analytic sense” (Saldaña, 2013, p. 213). Focus
coding not only prompted reexamination of the first round In Vivo codes, but also further
narrowed the data into the five concentrated second round coded themes of information literacy,
effective educator choices, outside administrative and agency influences, creating a cognitive
environment, and program challenges (see Appendix M for secondary coded theme descriptions).
These second round coded themes became the organizational basis for illustrating the research
findings.
Printed materials collected consisted of educator lesson plans, rubrics, guides, budgets,
and library program support offerings. Only educator lesson plans, rubrics, and guides were
manually coded using the study’s themes to avoid introducing prejudice. Printed materials
created by the librarian were not coded and were used to conceptualize the library program or
support findings. The analysis of printed materials highlighted text indicators that related directly
to the twenty-eight first round codes. Coded printed materials were used to triangulate
participant perception of information behaviors indicating information literacy.
The completed analysis of the interview data contained not only a review of actual
excerpts but quantified the frequencies of first round excerpt occurrences within each second
round coded theme. Comparing the frequencies of first round occurrences enumerated possible

89
collective participant perceptions of administrators, educators, and students and their relationship
to each other.
Once the data was analyzed, the researcher applied the findings to a logical model to
determine whether the outcomes that emerged from Western High School’s library program
activities indicated information literate students (Bickman et al., 2009). The logical model
developed consisted of the following categories: objective, activities, outputs, and evaluation of
benefits (see Appendix N library program logical model). The objective rose from the central
theme of the research. In order to connect back to the research questions, activities were the
perceptions of participant actions as they related to student experiences, outcomes were based on
the reflection of activities and print materials and evaluation considered whether the Western
High School library program’s objectives were met by the outcomes of the various activities. For
added insight, the researcher aligned within the logical model first round In Vivo coded
information literacy variables established within the study to support the evaluation of the
outcomes. The logical model was divided and separately applied to each research question,
illustrating whether students, educators, or administrators perceived information literacy growth
within Western High School. The completed logical model provides support for
recommendations necessary to adjust, design new activities, or meet new objectives within
Western High School library program’s intended pursuit of student information literacy growth.
Contrasting Analysis Perspectives
The seminal works of library science information behavior research sought to observe
participants experiencing phenomena in different conditions (Kuhlthau, 1991). The contrasting
difference between past research and this qualitative research is Kuhlthau’s (1991) use of the
quantitative analysis tools of the “t-Test and ANOVA to determine significance” (Kuhlthau,

90
1991, p.365) and “Pearson product-moment measures to determine degree of correlation and
measures of linear regression” (Kuhlthau, 1991, p.365). Within this qualitative research,
importance is placed on thought and experiences (Creswell, 2013), which the researcher sought
to describe or interpret within the analysis. The study was designed to elicit contrasting
perspectives from educators, administrators, and students to provide a comprehensive data
analysis. The researcher must be most concerned in the interpretive validity of the data generated
through the various collection methods regardless of coding analysis chosen for this case study.
Therefore, it is vital that the researcher provide a methodology for collection and analysis that
allows the participant to describe an experience as the interviewer probes for further clarity and
details (Rubin & Rubin, 2013).
Trustworthiness
Qualitative research shifts the quantitative researcher’s understanding of trustworthiness
to one that now considers naturalistic work (Shenton, 2004, p.63). Quantitative research methods
utilize methods of validity, external validity, objectivity, and the ability to generalize from
specific findings to test trustworthiness. To separate themselves, qualitative researchers have
presented various research perspectives on trustworthiness and have constructed new terms that
align better with qualitative research (Creswell, 2012, p.244). Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) model
aligned the terminology of credibility (internal validation), transferability (external validation),
dependability (reliability), and conformability (objectivity) with quantitative tests of
trustworthiness (as cited in Creswell, 2012, p. 244).
Credibility. Insuring credibility requires that research methods and analyses be grounded
in previous qualitative research, with changes relating to only the nature of the topic. To reduce
possible threats to the credibility of the study, the researcher adopted specific strategies. The

91
researcher provided a “thick description of the phenomenon under scrutiny” (Shenton, 2004,
p.73), which included previous research and findings for reflective comparisons (p. 73). The
researcher also provided her information science background to include influences on current
curriculum efforts and reduce possible bias. To reduce bias where background is considered, the
researcher followed Shenton’s (2004) recommendations to complete “reflective commentary”
which provides continual reflective information on the researcher, his or her understanding of the
subject, the research purpose, and the research process being completed (p. 73). The interviews
were completed during the semester. The researcher also established visibility within the study’s
environment to set administrators, educators, students and parents/guardians at ease, build trust,
and potentially decrease hesitation, thus allowing authentic and natural data to be collected.
This case study utilized recognized and documented research and data collection methods.
Special focus was on information science studies where methods of interviews and printed
materials were used to collect data. Data collected was rich in detail to reduce the possibility of
misunderstanding in meanings of both actions and interview responses. The researcher made use
of a participant member check of completed interviews to clarify meanings (Shenton, 2004). The
variety of data collection methods allowed for triangulation. Triangulation generates
corroborating evidence from various data sources, recognizes contradictions (false data), and
identifies data that does not fit a pattern (Creswell, 2013, p. 251). This is of special concern when
working with teenage populations as there is a need to ensure that authentic and honest data is
generated. Participants were purposefully chosen using a suggested profiler of descriptors to
ensure that stakeholders with a variety of perspectives were selected. Participants could refuse or
end participation at any point in the study. This may have ensured willingness to participate
without coercion.

92
Transferability. Increasing transferability begins with the literature review. A deep
description of the previous research, methods, and theory not only serves as a foundation for this
research, but for future research. In addition, Lincoln and Guba (1985) stress “transferability
depends upon a degree of fittingness” (p. 124). The researcher provided “sufficient information
about the context in which an inquiry is carried out so that anyone else interested in
transferability has a base of information appropriate to the judgment” (Lincoln and Guba, 1985,
p. 124). Transferability differs from generalizable, as it requires the setting where the findings
can be reapplied be similar to the original case study.
Dependability. The recording of rich and thick detail in the data supported the
dependability of the information literacy as a value case study. Dependability is the degree to
which another research study may recreate the research within a situation that cannot depend on
maintaining the same phenomenon (Shenton, 2004, p. 71). Because the ability to extrapolate
generalities in a qualitative study is not possible, dependability of findings and conclusions may
be applicable with other populations. Thus, themed categories that emerge from the data
indicating growth of information literacy skills may be applied to another secondary school
library program. As a result, a full reporting of the boundaries, including descriptors, length of
study, and details of data collection have been detailed for future research (Shenton, 2004).
Overlapping methods increase the dependability of the research preparation model study.
Conformability. Conformability required that the information literacy as a value case
study methodology steps were reviewed critically to ensure the “work’s findings are the result of
the experiences and ideas of the informants, rather than the characteristics and preferences of the
researcher” (Shenton, 2004, p. 71). The research method used in the research design included
detailed steps for participant selection, data collection, data analysis, role descriptions, and the

93
purpose of any tool utilized. In addition, the triangulation of data supports conformability.
Finally, a check of the data collected was completed to ensure direct reflection of the research
questions as supportive evidence. The research question data check ensures the research remains
within the study’s boundaries stated by the researchers.
Once all four areas of qualitative test of trustworthiness have been completed with
integrity, then the researcher has contributed to the overall research in the given area.
Recognizing that these scaffolded pieces of research have bearing on our lives was both the
responsibility and a consideration of the researcher. Not completing steps of trustworthiness can
undermine the growth and potential impact of the research findings. Thus, the researcher’s
responsibility to the research matters.
Protection of Human Subjects
Creswell (2013) asserts that the more detailed data a researcher seeks, the more the study
is opened up to ethical risks (p. 174). More importantly, the researcher has an ethical
responsibility for minimizing the risks to and protecting human subjects. The researcher sought
administrative permission to conduct research within the Western School District. This process
required a formal request letter and interview explaining the nature of the research and potential
educational benefits to the district’s learning community.
Once permissions were granted, focus was placed on the participating human
subjects. The human subjects within the study consist of administrators, educators, and students.
All who volunteered were assured ethical consideration. Participation was strictly voluntary.
Student participants were treated as a population under the age of 18. Students who are under the
age of 18 are considered to be a vulnerable population requiring parent/guardian permission
before participation in the study (Rubin & Rubin, 2012, p.100).

94
Permission specifics. To reiterate, gaining parent/guardian permission for students and
student assent, as well as administrator and educator releases, required the researcher to provide
letters with clear and comprehensive information describing the research procedure, purpose,
collection, insurance of anonymity and future use of findings. The researcher provided a
statement within the study indicating informed consent was obtained (Rubin & Rubin, 2012, p.
90).
Confidentiality. Although there is only one primary researcher, those who were
indirectly involved completed a review for understanding the importance of maintaining
confidentiality, to insure bias was removed, and that students were not at risk. Indirect support
personnel were not in direct contact with the selected participant population. Each signed consent
form, interview transcript, and printed material notations that identify an individual was assigned
a pseudonym that corresponds to a specific participant. While the study was being conducted,
materials were locked in the researcher’s home office in locked cabinet. Any mention of specific
identities within the interview were altered to protect an individual’s privacy or rendered
anonymous any criticisms associated with the school and district. Recorded data was destroyed
once transcripts and theme analysis had been completed. All data in this publication has been
redacted, removing any possibility for identification of the participant.
Chapter 4: Report of Research Findings
Western High School’s library program was designed in response to ongoing discussions
concerning students entering higher education who are not prepared for the rigor of academic
research (Gross &Latham, 2012; Kovalik, Jensen, Schloman & Tipton, 2010; Oakleaf, 2009:
Smith, Given, Julien, Ouellete, & Delong, 2013). Developing information literate students who
can sustain, transfer, and reconextualize information literacy processes and skills has become a

95
goal of the Western High School’s library program. Realization of this goal required
inventorying current practices to determine whether information literacy is present within the
current library program (Saunders, 2011). The research questions of a) how does Western High
School’s library program support information behavior; b) how do Western High School
educators and administrators describe their experiences with the library program’s influence on
information behavior; and c) how do Western High School students describe their experiences
with the library program’s influence on information behavior, drove the study in determining
whether information literacy was present in the Western High School’s library program.
This chapter presents an analysis of the interviews obtained from fourteen purposefully
selected Western High School administrators, educators, and students, as well as library program
supported printed materials. A pseudonym was assigned to each participant. Administrator
participants are “Edward”, “John,” and “Thomas.” Educator participants are “Theresa”, “Drew”,
“Louise”, “Charles,” and “Lily.” Finally, student participants are “George”, “Maria”, “David”,
“Julie”, “Paul,” and “Vickie.” Interview questions sought each participant’s perspective on
information behavior experiences related to his or her position or role within Western High
School. The experiences of administrators, educators, and students provided evidence of the
library program’s influence on information literacy awareness, support, pedagogy, and
knowledge within the Western High School community. Through inductive reasoning, twenty
eight first round In Vivo coded excerpts were organized into five second round Focused coded
themes of information literacy, educator effectiveness, outside influences, cognitive environment,
and program challenges. These focused coded themes emerged through an inductive analysis and
were used to organize the data findings. In addition to quoted excerpts, quantified frequencies of

96
occurrences were used to emphasize possible combined perspectives of participants by positions
or role (see Table 4-1).
Perceptions of the Western High School library program’s support and influence on
student information behavior varied depending on the participant’s position or role. Participants
both identified with and defined information behaviors differently depending on their position or
role. Information behaviors described were identified by the researcher as established
information literacy variables. Administrators used the term research process interchangeably
with information literacy as a term for a single concept focused on a set of information behaviors.
While administrators could not specifically name information literacy variables, each understood
their response responsibility to educators and students by building the capacity for and creating
the conditions for learning growth. Relying on educators and the librarian to collaborate and
combine their expertise, administrators expected information literacy processes and skills to be
woven into all classes.
Educators identified with the individual information literacy variables of pre-search,
research preparation, research tools and sources, resource types, resource evaluation, and
research relevance. Depending on the need, educators used the same information literacy
variables to represent instructional guidance, performance task, and performance assessment, or
learning outcome. Educators collaborated directly with the librarian when developing lesson
plans, performance tasks, performance assessments, guides, and rubrics and used library program
resources to support students. Educators guided students to develop research thinking and
processing that represented the varied information literacy meanings. With guidance from the
librarian and educator, students described specific researching techniques and skills necessary
when engaged in information behaviors. In addition, students responded positively to educator

97
performance assessments for building information literacy skills. Students, educators, and
administrators recognized the Western High School library program as a resource for developing
information literacy skills. Students recognized the library program for instructional and resource
support and viewed the librarian as another educator in the classroom. Students especially
indicated understanding for appreciating and formatting the intellectual property of another
person’s work.
Findings also indicated challenges to information literacy learning. Students and
educators both recognized that reading influenced the potential to process and understand
information. In addition, the lack of time necessary to fully support student learning was a
constant concern of educators and administrators. Finally, educators indicated that even when
information literacy instruction, performance tasks and assessments, learning outcomes, and
collaborations are utilized, student effort and the desire to learn influenced information literacy
growth.
Demographics
Three administrators, five educators, and eight students were recruited for the study. Two
recruited students declined participation, reducing the number of student participants to six.
Western High School’s diversity based on the descriptors of gender, ethnicity, years of service,
graduation year, department, and class learning level was reflected in the participant population
(see Table 4-2). Participant gender breakdown was 36% female and 64% male. Ethnicity of the
participants is 93% white and 7% African American. Administrator and educator employment
within their current position ranged from 3 to 21 years of service.
Other descriptors of the study included graduation year, department, and class learning
level. Participants of this study are expected to graduate in 2015, 2016, and 2018. While all four

98
years are not represented, the range represents the matriculation of three years of information
literacy learning within Western High School’s current library program. Three years translates
into the class of 2015 beginning information literacy learning in their sophomore year.
Department descriptors of Science, Social Studies and History, and English Language Arts
identify the differences between this study and previous research which indicated that technical
disciplines, such as science, did not coincide with more advanced information literacy skills
(Probert, 2009, p. 28). Class learning level descriptors of honors (highest paced), level 1,
multilevel, and level 2 (lowest paced) indicated a course’s instructional speed. Indicating class
learning levels was necessary when considering McGuinness’ (2006) claim that a barrier to
information literacy may exist when educators rely on a student’s own innate ability or selfstarting nature to seek out information literacy process and skills in order to complete a project.
Key Terms
Key terms of the study include sustainability, transferability, recontextualizing, source,
resource, library program, information behavior, and information literacy variables. The
researcher describes sustainability as the continued support towards the information literacy
processes and skills growth; transferability as the ability to transfer information literacy
processes and skills grade to grade; and recontextualization as the ability to adjust information
literacy skills between varied conditions. The researcher defines understanding for the words
source and resource differently. Source is intended to be an entity that contains several resources,
while resource is an individually created piece of work. The phrase library program is used to
define all that occurs within the library, rather than individual library programming. The phrase
information behavior is used for the actions an individual engages in while researching for
information. This term is used especially with participants who are not familiar with the term

99
information literacy. The term information literacy variables, introduced by Case (2012) is
expanded beyond a set of behaviors to also represent performance tasks, performance
assessments, and learning objectives.
Theme 1: Information Literacy as a combined set of guiding principals and learning
objectives
Overall, this theme provided awareness that administrator, educator, and student
perspectives understood there was a need for identifying student information literacy learning
objectives, performance tasks, performance assessments, and critical thinking when engaged in
information behaviors. The American Association of School Librarian’s (2007) Standards for
the 21st Century Learner, the Association of College and Research Libraries’ (2015) Framework
for Information Literacy for Higher Education, and Grafstein’s (2002) information literacy
variables were aligned during the second round coding as verification that twelve first round
codes contained participant perceptions of information literacy processes and skills. This second
round theme captured 481 participant excerpts organized by participant position or role (see
Table 4-3).
Administration and information literacy. While administrators did not specifically
name information literacy variables, each saw their role as influencing student information
literacy growth by setting curriculum objectives. John, an administrator, explained how he views
the curriculum supporting information literacy, “I think we still have a lot of people who think
we have to teach students what happened in the U.S. Civil War and who won, rather than looking
at aspects of how and why the U.S. Civil War and the French Revolution were similar and
different.” While aware that critical thinking and learning objectives are part of information
literacy growth, administrators indicated that the responsibility of setting the learning objective

100
and circumstances for student critical thinking remains with the educator. John expects educators
to understand how and why there are different types of information needs. He wants educators
to guide students towards considering that to “analytically think about a situation, simple Google
searching does not always apply. People have to think about information in two ways. Is it a fillin-the-blanks question for Google or is there a need to find evidence for some hypothesis. I
don’t think students delineate this way without guidance.” Thomas, another administrator
expects students to develop “the ability to ask the next question or the ability to think about the
next question; it goes back to what the standards have asked kids to do, which is to think more
critically, asking not only an initial question but the second and third tiered questions around a
topic a student is interested in researching and being able to access the resources.” While not
being able to target exact information literacy skills and processes, these administrators have laid
the foundation of expectations for educators to guide students when engaging in information
behavior.
Educators and information literacy. Educator coded occurrences indicated perspectives
on how their role influenced student information literacy growth. Educators indicated that
information literacy variables were represented in learning objectives, performance tasks, and
performance assessments leading towards students learning how to critically think when engaged
in information behaviors. Encompassing how the combined information literacy variables of
research preparation, resource synthesis, research tools and sources and resource evaluation
became vital to his lesson, Charles stated that through his collaboration with the library program:
Students were exposed to research organization and the process is set up so that by the
end result, the final paper and presentation, students were able to analyze and apply.
From setting up notes, keywords and search strings, to looking at what databases were

101
available and what sources were going to be used, what area of the web will be identified
as credible.
Encouraging the thinking and processing of information of her students, Louise’s information
literacy expectations included, “reading through and tearing apart the resource and extracting
notes and information that directly connect to the research questions written about a subtopic.”
Students were guided using the tangible steps to read, create notes, and make connections to
research questions, which facilitated critical thinking and processing within the research process.
Responding to administrator curriculum expectations for student information behavior,
all educators required students to select a topic he or she would be interested in investigating.
Theresa, a science educator, explained that allowing students to pick a topic rather than assigning
a topic was a hard concept for students to understand. She offered that “students in the past have
been told to ‘look up Harriet Tubman’, so they go to Wikipedia and look up Harriet Tubman.”
This topic-only focused research is a very different process than what is expected. Theresa
explained that educators at Western High School are expected to guide students in first finding
and reading, “a wide variety of research that has been done on a topic. Students are to find one
thing within the reading that they are interested, in order to focus on how exciting research can
truly be.” Theresa expected students to learn the content of the class, as well as how information
literacy process and skills could generate excitement about research itself, in addition to
discoveries within aspects of the original topic. This supports the thinking behind Grassian &
Kaplowitz (2009) and National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (2010), which
recognizes the link between critical thinking and educator learning objectives.
Educators created the circumstances for students to complete and conceptually
understand pre-search, research preparation, research tools and sources, and resource evaluation.

102
Four educators incorporated pre-search steps. Students were directed to conduct a pre-search
before a thesis statement was developed with the expectation of gaining background knowledge
about a specific topic. These four educators required students to develop and investigate research
questions to facilitate background knowledge understanding before a thesis statement was
developed (Rankin,1992). Charles offered, “the pre-search method gives students a comfortable
environment that they can get used to. Students use that comfort to guide themselves to a more
specific place. Students ‘cast a wide net’ which gives them more information to move to a
smaller netting to focus their information search on.” Beginning with a pre-search is less
focused, examining several points of a topic while facilitating each student’s self-guidance
towards a single discovery point. Drew stated that for students to understand pre-searching they
“have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable because there is a part at the beginning of the
research where students feel like they know less then they know more, then they have to work
through the information, especially if they want to work authentically at this age.” Getting past
the uncomfortable stage of not knowing enough required students become motivated by their
own self-discovery point used for further research.
Educators used research preparation steps to organize and encourage thinking and
processing necessary with information behavior. Louise reinforced, “students needed to go
through the process of establishing research questions and pulling out keywords, in order to
search effectively to find information.” Additionally, Louise offered that the “collaboration with
the librarian teaches students to prepare for research, getting them ready to develop a thesis,
research questions, keywords, search strings and how to use each.” All educator participants
guided their students to organize content and thinking in preparation for more in-depth
information searches. This differs from current research indicating students use each other for

103
information seeking assistance or student innate research abilities (Purcell et al, 2012;
McGuinness, 2006).
Supporting research preparation of four educator printed materials (lesson plans,
associated guides, and rubrics) were found to have related language (Table 4-4). The most
frequent occurrences were found in learning level 2 classes, offering specific guidance and
assessment opportunities.
While students have been exposed to research tools and sources, educators recognized
specific lesson criteria and educator and librarian guidance that led students to the most
legitimate resources. Lily expressed concern that students “do not see databases as portals of
information and are overwhelmed by the idea of searching.” She was perplexed noticing that
students are comfortable, “going to Google, generating another type of access and hundreds of
choices.” Similarly, Drew found his students who used Google generated more biased
information. He stated that “next time I will structure the lesson in a way to provide more
instruction on what a legitimate source looks like and what is reliable.”
Because of the need to ensure a resource’s credibility, reliability, and relationship to the
student research questions, educators used resource evaluation techniques. Louise required
“information be scholarly, coming from an academic place, published in a database, or an avenue
that was scholarly.” When using an open Google search Louise required, “students use a library
program worksheet to evaluate for resources that could not be used.” Louise stated:
When students used the worksheet to evaluate, they realized resources they could not use.
Many students wanted to use websites but found they were not authoritative. This was
hard to understand. Some students determined a resource should not be used but wanted
to use it anyways. Students did not understand the consequences of what using that

104
information did to their paper.
Similarly, Drew offered, “that it is about your argument within the assignment, and the student’s
reputation because when you use the information you have to be able to say this was put together
by, and name the author.” It is through resource evaluation that students have to make a
connection with the outside world and the consequences of using poor information and having it
reflect upon their individual work.
Charles and Theresa required students use databases for the pre-search or until a thesis
was developed. Additionally, Charles wanted to build student confidence within the research
process, by “insuring information of subtopics were within the databases.” This meant students
found aspects of their chosen topic within the databases, possibly removing the need for an open
web search. Permission to use a web resource was granted only after a web evaluation was
completed. Charles’ directions after the pre-search was completed were, “no simple searching.
Use Google’s advanced search, filtering out for .edu, and .org, etc. We dropped .com
completely.” Only Louise, an educator of a learning level 2 class, collected formal website
evaluations as a graded assessment. Theresa and Lilly, educators of class level 1 and honors,
graded for resource credibility and reliability using the citation page associated with a student’s
work.
Educators identified reading and writing application in addition to recognized
information literacy variables. Reading and writing application were of concern to educators.
Educator’s recognized students lacked experience with reading, limiting the thinking about the
information presented and the possibility of linking to new information. Without reading ability,
learning level 2 class educators found students needed more guidance when organizing and
understanding information for deepening the search. Louise posits that without reading,

105
“students have a hard time even processing alternative words. I think students have not read
enough to formulate new alternative words for the search. Students don’t think in these ways yet;
they have not been exposed to information text reading.” Equally, Louise found writing was
incomplete when a student limited him or herself to “citing resources and restating their thesis
but not connecting the evidence to the thesis.” Louise, Charles, and Lily all required students go
organize resources and recognize the association between reading and writing by creating an
outline and making notes. Lily stated, “students were able to see what their paper was going to
look like at an early stage and see how information connects.”
Students and information literacy. Metacognition was evident as students thought
through unique combinations of information literacy variables that pertained specifically to their
individual assignments (Case, 2012; Flavell, 1979). Students were able to critically think through
and manipulate a search, react to search results, and work between database and search engine
tools. Rather than simply stating an information literacy variable as a task, students described the
processes and the purpose for each process, indicating awareness of their increased knowledge
gain and the value of having that knowledge. David, a sophomore stated,
I thought of other links that were connected to my original search and plugged these in,
finding more information. I found that my research sparked new ideas for subtopics to
look further into. Some research questions I narrowed down even more to have subquestions underneath them, which I used to answer the over arching question.
Paul, a freshman student, experienced thinking and processing information by using research
questions. Paul stated, “I linked topics. I found facts using research questions and putting them
in different orders because maybe there was a subtopic between each that may show up.”

106
All students indicated understanding how research sources and tools supported their
critical thinking. All used various search and advanced search options within databases, Google
Scholar, Google Books, Google, and governmental websites to narrow down information
retrieved. Vickie, a freshman student, understood the link between research thinking and
processing with research sources and tools. She stated, “advanced search and InfoTrac’s Topic
Finder was helpful because it brought down the topic one more layer that was needed to find
information on and about.” Vickie was able to select and manipulate the sources and tools for
locating information, in order to refine a wide topic into arguable points. Using different
variables, Maria, a senior student stated, “I would use Science Direct to search using keywords.
Many times I would find reviews. I would go to the references of those reviews to find the
references off other things.” Again, this student indicated how to think and process using the
relationships between a specific information source (Science Direct), how to use keywords
within the source’s search tools, and could link to more information using the resource’s
reference page. Finally, George, another senior student linked additional information through
direct quotes. George stated, “one of the things I really looked for was a good quote that when I
read it, it blew my mind out of the water. I would take that quote and try to build around it then
lead into the quote and explain that quote and say how it would tie into the general idea of things.”
While this student did not mention the exact search for information, the information gathered to
discover a point of research and completing a written analysis indicates research thinking and
processing was necessary to build a structure of supportive evidence.
Student confidence in his or her ability to act as a researcher grew when students were
able to reinforce the processes and skills of discovering something new through their experiences
with information (Bruce, 2008). David, enrolled in both Louise’s and Charles’ classes, found

107
“both did not have me develop a thesis statement until I learned more about the topic in general.
I started to really like my topics. I would look up one thing then it would lead me to another
topic, which I would look up. That lead me to a whole bunch of other things.” Through the
experiences of repeatedly seeking information and using retrieved resources, David was able to
build confidence as a researcher.
Students were able to confidently name various search engines, “InfoTrac,” “Science
Direct” and “Ebsco” and understand the reasoning for using specific tools and sources which
supported their self-perception of possessing proficient and confident information and
communications technology skills (Gross & Latham, 2009; 2012). Paul reflected, “the databases
were a lot more thorough and to the point. The databases did not try to add words to the search to
make the hits bigger, just facts were returned in the search. My impression of websites is that
while a lot of it may be true, I don’t know what is really true.”
Students indicated an understanding for making connection for how to select the most
relevant and supportive evidence. Maria stated, “I started off thinking some of the articles were
original research. However, as I read more I realized these articles did not actually say anything.
This was heartbreaking.” Nevertheless, Maria continued to critically think about not only the
information but also how the author came to that information. Maria described how determining
the relevance of an article required her to develop a process; “with each article I read the abstract,
then the discussion. If these matched what I had to say about my research, I would look over the
methods section.” Maria processed articles to determined whether there was a connection
between the information and her developed research questions.
Using a different strategy, Paul indicated his process to determine the relevance of a
resource depended upon when the thesis statement was developed. When the thesis statement

108
was developed without pre-searching, “all the research focused on one thing and I knew exactly
what I needed. But this meant information was overlooked because I knew exactly what was
really important to this thesis.” With a pre-search Paul offered that:
I was trying to narrow it down, I kind of need to observe more information because I was
trying to intake more to figure out what I was going to argue. There are many
possibilities of what I could argue so I needed to find as much information as I could that
was relevant to the topic.
Students made the connection between how relevant information stems from the pre-search and a
research preparation process and how both of these information literacy variables influenced
when in the research process a thesis statement was developed.
Theme 2: Effectiveness of educator choices to apply information literacy teaching and
learning
Educators contributed the highest frequency of first round codes to this theme (see Table
4-5). Each first round code within this theme represented educator choices for applying
information literacy to lessons from the perspective of educators, administrators, and students.
Supporting educator choices, an analysis of printed materials indicated frequencies for
information literacy variable entries divided by class learning levels (see Table 4-6).
Effectiveness of educator: Educator perspective. Educators within this study indicated
different information literacy processes and skills within the pedagogical planning and guidance
offered to students. Educators offered their different perspectives for how students experience
information literacy. Theresa described the information literacy objectives she wanted her
students to experience by stating:

109
Skills the educator and librarian clearly wanted students to obtain included how to search
a database; how to find an original article; what a primary source is in science; what a
review article is in science; the purpose of the primary article and the review article; how
to follow research threads; how to find more information on a topic of interest that came
forward in one article; how to collect articles that will somehow add to the overall 15
page paper; how to sort for relevance; how to determine if the articles are credible; how
to let the students’ interests that are provoked by an article read guide the student to a
topic for the paper.
Both Theresa and the librarian collaborated on student learning objectives not as a linear set of
tasks but rather competencies and skills students should develop (Bruce, 2008). Theresa’s
content and guidance allowed the librarian to weave information literacy processes and skills
into the lesson’s objectives, performance tasks, performance assessments, and rubric.
Theresa’s choice to weave information literacy into the lesson gave her students the opportunity
to learn and practice information literacy through the perspective of a problem each wanted to
discover more about (Bruce, 2008, p. 28).
Frequent performance assessments indicated whether information literacy variables
learning objectives woven into instruction needed instructional adjustment. Charles stated “I am
trying to scaffold the lesson so that I can intercept at a place I am seeing concerns. When there is
a concern, for example incomplete notes, I give the notes back to the student adjusting for
additional days to complete the work.” Varied and frequent assessments allowed educators to
redirect, correct, and assess for information literacy understanding rather than base student
growth on the performance of a single evaluation (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Charles offered
that his “students have to do a complete outline that is assessed. Notes are assessed because notes

110
are an indication of students completing the work and locating credible information. The thesis
statement and introduction paragraph are assessed.” Students were able use educator feedback
from these small assessments to determine their performance and make adjustments. These small
assessments built confidence with information literacy adding up to a larger evaluation, the final
paper (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005).
In addition to supporting information literacy learning at the point of instruction, Charles
applied what he learned from previous student assessments to his instructional approach for
teaching research. Charles offered “lessons and outcomes were adjusted based on the needs of
the students from another information literacy project. I realized students did not have enough
information prior to researching that allows them to develop an arguable thesis.” Charles began
to emphasize the information literacy variable of pre-searching, in order for students to build
background knowledge necessary when creating an arguable thesis statement. Charles’ examples
both illustrate how assessments can influence information literacy growth to make adjustments
for an individual student’s learning or to improve instructional practices for future classes.
Student information literacy assessments were not limited to applications from educators
or the librarian. Educators also set the stage using assessments to have students evaluate their
own work. The ability for an individual to assess his or her performance supports a life-long
learning ability (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005, p.215). Louise was able to promote not only student
self-assessment but also peer, educator, and librarian assessments of information literacy and
content work learning through round-robin activities. Louise divided students into peer-edit
groups, and the online tool Turnitin.com were used over a series of days for students to edit and
assess work without a grade consequence. Students self-assessed their performance after reading
the anonymous critical feedback of peers who used both the online tool Turnitin.com and group

111
discussions. In addition, the librarian assessed students individually for “formatting and checking
the validity of sources and order. Students needed to also see where a citation was needed.” The
educator assessed for content and flow of the work. Louise stated, “by the librarian and me
focusing on two different aspects of the paper we did not overwhelm the students. Students were
able to fix each thing and repeat the process with the next edit.” Students were also able to reflect
upon individual performance, using the perspective of their peer editor and Turnitin.com. As part
of their homework, Louise had students decide whether to add more evidence should it be
necessary to support the thesis, whether writing had to be adjusted or cited and whether
formatting required improvement. With assessments, educators set the capacity for students to
internalize critical points within a research process and apply them to their own works.
Educators recognized time was a factor when students engaged in information literacy
learning objectives. All educators were concerned about information literacy instruction taking
away from content learning (Loesch, 2010; Meer, Perez-Stable and Sachs, 2012). While class
learning level honors and level 1 were able to have students use after school time to practice
information literacy process and skills, class learning level 2 students were guided primarily
during school hours. In addition, students in learning level 2 were provided with more printed
material as a support for information literacy learning than either learning level 1 or honors (see
Table 4-6). Theresa, an educator, offered the importance of “building into the instructional time
opportunities to practice what was taught and after the educator and librarian told students the
objectives. For example, we taught them about databases and we allowed them to look there.”
This reflective and guided learning opportunity allowed for each student to practice, ask
questions of educators and peers, while deeply absorbing aspects of information literacy and
curriculum content (Bruce, 2008).

112
Print material analysis previously presented in Table 4-4 supported that educators not
only provided written guidance for information literacy processes but also reported to students
how and when they were going to be assessed. While all educators indicated frequent assessment
points, not all were graded. Rather, non-graded assessments were used as a “dip stick” check-in
for student progress. Louise stated that the objective of providing detailed lesson objectives,
assessment opportunities, dates, as well as guides was “because these small assessments help
students to fix what was wrong, which causes the realization that they won’t do that wrong thing
again.” Assessments opened avenues of consideration for students to think through and
understand consequences related to their information behavior choices (Flavell, 1979).
Effectiveness of educator: Administrator perspective. All three administrator coded
occurrences indicated expectations for educators to use information literacy objectives with
educational content. Thomas stated, “I expect it, information literacy, is woven into all our
classrooms.” Focused on educator pedagogy, Thomas continued that for students to become
information literate, “it starts with the teachers. To talk about the skills our students need to have,
we need a process in place to determined when research is taught, how it is taught, the resources
that are taught and after reflecting, develop some sort of metric to evaluate student skills.”
Thomas would like educators to share “model lessons, getting teachers of similar courses, and
building that small group of experts in one discipline to conduct peer observations to not only
teach best practices but to show best practices.” While reflecting on best practices John, another
administrator, recognized a need to build professional development that supports educators to
“embed information and research skills into all instruction, to answer how the school does
research across all disciplines.” John wants information literacy woven into educator lessons,
stating, “students should not be given task-based research projects in the middle of the semester.

113
I am offering instructional leadership in looking at how we use assessments and grades looking
at how we run our classes, and how will students be able to demonstrate research processes and
skills learning.” He wants leadership to build both a mechanism and a constituency to deliver and
educate faculty about the concepts and methods for weaving information literacy into lessons.
The administrators understood the need for information literacy to be taught in
conjunction with class content. However, John used the word woven, while the others used
embed. There was no detail offered by any administrator to indicate a difference of meaning
between woven and embed. By definition, these two terms offer an opportunity for information
literacy instruction differences. In addition, the lack of definition of either term is reasoning for
why information literacy vocabulary should be more clearly defined for district understanding.
Effectiveness of educator: Students perspective. Student perspectives for the
effectiveness of educator choices was found within student reactions to the information literacy
decisions made by educators. Students reacted positively to the multiple assessment educators
included in their lessons as opportunities for evaluating learning. Table 4-5 indicated that
students reacted to assessments offered within an educator’s lesson plan. George, a senior honors
learning level student, understood that his final grade evaluation was based on a research paper
that combined a variety of research performance assessments completed throughout the semester.
George stated, “Before the final paper we had to complete journal article reviews and an
annotated bibliography of all the articles.” Each of these assessments had associated instructions
and a rubric, which included information literacy variables as tasks and learning outcomes. Julie,
a sophomore learning level 1 student, noted how scaffolding assessments became an indication
for deepening the information search. Julie stated, “we were allowed to do more research if we
needed to fill anything in our outline. When we are doing our outline we have topics and sub-

114
topics and I realized if I did not know or have enough information, then I needed to do more
research.” The educators who worked with Julie and George made decisions that influenced how
each student’s information literacy skills grew. Allowing students to learn through their own
work using multiple assessments created opportunities for self-correction and continued learning
and understanding.
Educators developed various methods for balancing learning objectives with the
preexisting student comfort with the use of search engines generating broad results. Responding
to an educator’s assessment choice, George had to consider where to best invest his search-forinformation efforts. George’s educator required 20 scholarly original study resources for the
assignment. Understanding that students were uncomfortable about not using Google and lacked
confidence in finding information in the databases, the educator compromised on comfort and
behavior but not quality. The educator understood students needed to be met on their own terms
and allowed Google searches. However, if a student wanted to use a website, he or she could,
with the condition that the citation would not be counted as part of the 20 scholarly original
study articles. If Google was used, students had the potential to exceed the 20 required resources.
By changing the conditions, the educator placed the effort and efficiency choice of looking for
information in the hands of each student. The student realized how tethered to simple Google
searches they were as opposed to placing effort into retrieving the 20 scholarly original study
articles. After making his choice, George offered, “the educators change to allow Google was
very fair, other wise this could be a Wikipedia paper. But not by me…” The teacher gave the
requirements, offered an adjustment for students to consider that met with their comfort and gave
free choice to evaluate and use an open web resource.

115
Overall, all six students indicated an appreciation for the educators who scaffold learning
objectives, assessments, and allowed for adjustments until the content and information literacy
processes were mastered. David stated, “I like this process better because you break researching
down into steps and I feel confident in how to go through the research process and put together
information, formulate a thesis, and put it into an essay.” All recognized information literacy not
as a separate piece offered by the librarian or the educator but by both instructors, together.
Vickie, a freshman student felt:
This was a good experience and I understand why research papers have to be written. I
am very happy that the librarian and teacher were teaching us how to write a research
paper, not just giving it up to us to do on our own. I like guidance. The valuable part of
this process was having the guidance.
Each student was given the opportunity to make his or her own learning and values choices while
being guided and assessed for the information literacy learning and knowledge growth (Wiggins
& McTighe, 2006). How an educator chose to instruct and assess became valuable feedback that
a student chose to apply or not apply in order to learn and gain information literacy knowledge.
Theme 3: Outside administrative and agency influences on information literacy teaching
and learning
Administrators accounted for 90% of the coded occurrences within this theme (see Table
4-7). All administrators considered district and State budgets, Federal and State mandates,
curriculum objectives, learning standards, and the district’s greater community as having an
influence on information literacy learning. All administrators recognized it is their responsibility
to balance these points to support educators and create opportunities for striving toward student
academic achievement (Darling-Hammond, 2009). Edward, an administrator, stated his

116
“responsibility is the planning and setting of goals. A goal for the district is to allocate resources,
and personnel, and equipment so that students could be engaged in information literacy processes
and develop those skills.” Balancing these points also requires educators to consider the
curriculum. Thomas, another administrator whose focus is curriculum, considered the question
“research itself is changing, especially at the college level the expectations of research, so are we
doing the job of maintaining what colleges feel are best practices? Do our students have the
right researching skills?” While administrators were not steeped in the language of information
literacy or individual class practices, each has an educator background and realizes the
importance of developing student research skills. Administrator excerpts indicated support for
the development of student information literacy skills if balanced with Massachusetts State
requirements, and educator knowledge, willingness, and confidence, with yearly district assets.
Each administrator expressed perspectives through the level of his district leadership lens
acknowledging that through discussions and educator evaluation walk-throughs, the Western
High School’s library program has supported educators in their approach to student research
practices.
Outside influences: District library ambitions. If funding was available, all three
administrators were inclined to move the library program beyond high school, toward developing
a K-12 district information literacy curriculum. Thomas expressed, “what needs to happen is to
expand our certified librarians in the areas of middle school, and to insure they have the skills set
to developmentally engage students and teachers in best practices around research.” Thomas
made the point that by not having librarians “at the middle schools and elementary schools
basically the district is sending a message that true research skills development starts at the high
school.” While this is not an administrative intent, Thomas recognized that choices made

117
delivered an unintended message to the greater community. John supported Thomas stating, “it
does no good to have a really strong research program at the high school if the 7th grade teacher
does a research project and is doing it a different way. Students should be taught how to develop
a topic in a similar way all though K-12, creating a district culture.” The administrators grappled
with what they want to support and what they can support. While administrators realize certified
librarians within a K-12 library program are elements necessary to developing a district library
program, continued budget restrictions limit this vision. However, the concepts of information
literacy within a library program can be reflected upon by the current culture of Western High
School and can be shared with the educators, students, and parents, in order to get the
community thinking about student researching (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011).
Outside influences: Creating the conditions. All administrators touched upon how the
library program should be part of curriculum planning. Administrators interchanged the terms
embed, integrated, woven, and collaborate to represent a desire to have the librarian and educator
work together. While administrators do not want to dictate a step-by-step list of prescribed
information literacy tasks for educators to follow, they do recognize focus points that have
emerged from Western High School’s library program that improve student research.
Recognizing he offers indirect support, Edward stated:
Administrators created the conditions for students to develop information literacy skills,
partnering with a librarian, the principal, and others to make sure we set up extended
hours, adequate staffing, again in an area where we could do more. We wanted to make
sure there was enough collaboration space, that there were opportunities for kids to
access computers for databases. We wanted projection space. We wanted to make the
space inviting and comfortable, making sure it was a light and airy space, inviting.

118
Administrators supported the development of central library space with extended student access
for before and after school, with professional support and adequate funding. Administrators
recognized that their decisions supported opportunities for professional development training and
resources, and database and print sources. Thomas reasoned that information literacy
professional development is necessary because he was “not positive that every teacher has the
skill set to instruct at the level necessary to embed information and research skills into
instruction.” The district, including the school committee, has supported the Western High
School library program with the understanding and trust that educators and librarian will work
together to develop the lessons within the existing curriculum that will build information literacy
processes and skills knowledge within students and educators.
All administrators had a keen sense of how Western High School funding supported
information literacy development. All administrators discussed the school’s database collection
as necessary information and communication tools for researching. John expressed “that the
design of the programming means less books, more electronic databases, and offering resources
for students so they are learning in multiple places, with a structure to use in the process.”
Because the school employs a full time certified librarian, the Massachusetts Board of Library
Commissioners’ funded databases are available at no cost to the district for student and employee
use. To supplement these, database products from EBSCO, Elsevier, Infobase Learning, Nature
America, Rosen Publishing Group, Gale eBooks, and print books have also been purchased using
part of the library program’s $13,876 budget for the 2014-2015 school year (see Appendix O
Western High School’s library budget). Thus, creating the conditions for students to acquire
information literacy skills includes budgeting adequate funding and finding economical ways to
bring sources to the Western High School Library. John stressed that for information literacy to

119
take root, the certified librarian has to respond to curriculum needs of educators and share her
knowledge. John offered, “the knowledge of our current librarian has shared about databases
combined with listening to the needs of the faculty has resulted in an larger audience who have
access to sources.” Again this is a method of looking inward, in order to begin the conversations
within district stakeholders to build partnerships necessary to sustain an information literate
community (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011).
Outside influences: Standards, evaluation, and professional development.
Administrators are well aware that the adopted Core Curriculum State Standards have
had an impact on how students engage with informational text. Thomas, focusing on curriculum,
stated that the new standards “have a place in that they are driving research in a larger way. I see
this ramping up particularly in how research skills with our new standards are going to challenge
our students not just in ELA but science and other disciplines.” To be prepared for the changes,
administrators placed a high value on the relationship between the standards, the educator
evaluation system, and district supplied professional development. Thomas, recognizing that
information literacy professional development is necessary offered “after the professional
development we need to certainly, in a developmentally appropriate way, embed information and
research skills into all instruction, answering how we as a district do research across all
disciplines.” In addition to information literacy learning, administrators made an automatic
connection to information and communication technologies as a method to support the learning
process. The concept of gaining knowledge with information and communications technologies
is in keeping with Fullan’s (2013) assessment that technology can serve as an accelerator of
innovation and discovery in learning for both the educator and student.

120
Administrators understood information and communications technologies could be both
exciting and daunting for educators. John stated, “teaching educators the process of research is a
big thing. I think sometimes educators are afraid of utilizing databases because they are not sure
how to make it work.” The fear of using information and communications technology is real.
Considering educator fear, Thomas reasoned:
These are probably the teachers who do not come to the library because they do not want
to show fear of the teachers own skill set. So how do we support these teachers in
professional development? I think what we really have to do is look at a professional
development model around research that starts at the very basic that reaches everybody
and not make assumptions about what people know.
Administrators are sympathetic to educator fears when new learning is necessary. Each
participant contributed to the body of ideas to build training and support for educator learning.
Administrators considered the educator evaluation system as another vehicle to facilitate
educators learning and practicing how to include information literacy into lesson plans. John
offered:
I think training educators could be done with the teacher evaluation system, considering
planning, assessment, and teaching all kids. Having student research becomes a thematic
discussion point between the vice principals and me. During evaluations, we ask teachers
if they are going to use research in his or her classes. We would also ask how the teacher
is expecting to use research in his or her classroom.
By asking an educator the methodology for teaching and embedding research into his or her
classes, the administrator distributes the responsibility and the creativity to answer how the goal
of including student research will be completed. More importantly, the educator evaluation

121
system then becomes a vehicle for cultivating information literacy process and skill
conversations between school administrators. Thus, administrators keep school goals constant,
allowing educators, with support from the librarian, to define the methods for student research
implementation and evaluation. This builds respect between the classroom educator and the
librarian opening conversations toward progress (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011).
Outside influences: Advocacy expectations. All administrators expressed clear
expectation for the librarian to act as an advocate and leader for the library program. Thomas
expressed, “it is important to the librarian to put information literacy and the library program on
the front burner. Unfortunately this seems like part of the profession.” This administrator’s
comments support the thinking that the onus of sustained outreach for the library program is on
the librarian (Saunders, 2012, p.232). John stated that another type of advocacy is having the
“librarian as part of leadership committees with department chairs, as a participant and
encouraging teachers to use the library as a support.” Administrators all understood that their
role is continually redirected to their individual big-picture perspective, which detracts from
library program goals. Each administrator admitted that the library program is a small part of his
or her big picture. However, all expect the librarian’s leadership role to include reminding them
to renew their focus on the library program. Thomas wants the librarian to “encourage people to
push the administration, principals, and central offices, recognizing that advocacy for library
program support is an ongoing battle.”
Theme 4: Creating a cognitive environment where information literacy can grow
This theme represents educator, student, and administrator perspectives for supporting an
information literate community where deep thinking, reflection, and collaboration can thrive.

122
This theme contained 24.% of the total coded occurrences for the first round codes of school
culture, learning opportunity, value, and collaboration with librarian (see Table 4-2).
These four first round initial codes were grouped in this theme because of the community spirit
each invoked when a participant spoke about their information literacy experiences with a
sentiment that expanded to others. The excerpts for representing these initial themes made
connections with previous codes and among participants within the Western High School
community. The connections offered insight into how information literacy learning transpires
within Western High School’s structure and systems.
School culture. Collectively the perspectives of administrators, educators, and students
contain a respect for the library program as a supportive entity within the school community’s
culture. Administrators especially grappled with how to build a culture where information
literacy can be supported. Thomas stated, “with the current library programming, confidence in
researching is high.” However, he recognized that building an information-literate school
community requires educators to understand their fears surrounding research, examine their own
abilities, and trust opportunities and learn from peers to develop best practices. Understanding
more work needs to be completed, Thomas asked the question, “how do you get teachers and
students to understand how to conduct research? Teachers are either afraid of research or may be
overconfident with their research skills, in a similar manner as students are with technology. This
goes back to building capacity with people the teachers trust.” Similarly, John considered how
school culture supports information literacy growth at the student level. He stated, “we are
trying to change the culture at Western High School from only thinking the library is a place to
get a book through investing in subscription databases to support the idea of students conducting
research.” Knowing that there is a shift towards improving student information literacy skills,

123
John asked “how do we filter all Western High School students through the library? How do we,
as a school, get to the point of saying ‘welcome to our school, this is how we do research? We
need an effective, not necessarily efficient way to influence many populations.” Long term, both
Thomas and John expressed a desire to expand an information literacy curriculum to the entire
Western School District.
Educator perceptions of school culture in relation to information literacy related directly
to the transfer of student skills expectations between grade levels. Educators recognized their
role is insuring consistent and transferable information literacy skills, as well as their
expectations of what skills students should have before entering their class. Louise stated,
“students who take my class as seniors may remember my process from a previous class I taught.
These students seem to know right away, to bring out a thesis, research questions, keywords and
to perhaps use the organizational methods learned in other classes.” Drew recognized not only
the transfer of information literacy skills but that students feel confident when they gain
knowledge and understanding of the research process. Drew stated, “intelligence and
understanding spans grades and learning levels we place on students. What is fascinating is that
once students have guidance and excitement they move at a quicker rate, develop things that are
interesting and become confident and creative.” All educators recognized they have a
responsibility to guide student information literacy learning as these developed process and skills
will transfer with the student to the next class. When information literacy spans levels of
achievement, it opens possibilities of bringing a community together under a single focus
(McGuiness, 2006). No educator within the study stated that educators required information
literacy professional development. The need for professional development was only indicated by
administrators.

124
Student perspective of school culture was limited to how the library program became a
safe physical space to find resources and work quietly. George stated, “the library is my go to
place because it has less distractions, the theme of the library seems to be focused on comfort.
You are not going to be disturbed unless it is something to benefit you.”
Learning opportunity. Administrators, educators, and students all contributed to the
initial learning opportunity code. Table 4-8 presents the occurrences of participant perspectives
for recognizing information literacy knowledge within an individual or the greater school
community. While both educators and administrators offered significant learning opportunities
from their perspective position, students contributed concrete self-learning from the existing
library program.
Students indicated that possible fragments of information literacy learning had transferred
into a “big idea” knowledge concept (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). The “big idea” is a learning
opportunity because what is learned can be repeated in a person’s life (Wiggins & McTighe,
2005). Student learning opportunities were indicated through the information literacy process
and skills. Senior Maria stated, “I am definitely more confident than when I started researching. I
know how to navigate databases better and can find information better. I know I can find
something that fills in the gaps.” Maria’s use of the word “gaps” indicated she is aware that
building knowledge is a process where previous understanding requires the addition of new
information. In addition, Maria learned to use the databases effectively to target more specific
“gap” information to support her learning.
Maria’s understanding of information was heightened by appreciating how an author’s
credibility can be used to with other credible resources. Maria expressed:

125
I appreciate information more. I guess I did not know the vast extent that was out there. I
did not know that Science Direct existed. The author connections that could be drawn
were exciting and really impressed and surprised me. I can track all the different things
one person has written or done. This was exciting. I do appreciate information but also all
the tools that exist to help find the information. I think that if I did not have this
experience in high school of writing a research paper or trying to find information then I
would probably struggle a lot in college so the value of the techniques I learned and the
thinking like using original research or finding references of one thing, like trying to find
reputable things than just something like a blog someone wrote. I cited everything in
APA.
Maria grasped the value of connections between resources. Maria also understood how she will
be able to recontextualize her information literacy skills into an academic setting after graduation
from high school.
Sophomores Julie and David indicated they were able to make personal choices as to
which information literacy processes worked best for them. Julie stated, “if I was doing another
research paper in any other class, I would probably do exactly what I did in this history class. I
probably would not do what I learned in English class.” Julie recognized and made choices for
how she learns and wants to conduct research. The understanding that different information
literacy processes can be chosen and applied enables students to recontextualize information
literacy skills into other classes and experiences (Bruce, 2008; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005).
David went beyond valuing the transfer of information literacy processes and skills between
classes by sharing with a younger brother at home. David stated,

126
In history taking notes was a lot easier after the librarian and the English teacher showed
us how to have the three columns of notes that included the citation. That was helpful. I
took this idea from my English class and used it in my history class. It helped because I
could put facts in places and being able to go back to it easily, instead of rereading the
articles I began to be more organized. I took what I did home and told my younger
brother about it for his work.
Learning opportunities become part of a cultures identity as often they are the values the
community places upon itself (Gutek, 2009).
Value. All participants contributed to the first round value code within this theme with
students having highest frequency of excerpts. Individuals who engaged in information literacy
instruction, processing, and skills development came to appreciate the scope of the work rather
than the content within the work (Dewey, 1916). Value was indicated when a participant’s
excerpt demonstrated an appreciation for an information literacy variable, the research process, a
resource, proper formatting, and crediting for intellectual property. Appreciation for another’s
scope of work indicated knowledge that the person can select and transfer appreciation into his
or her own value system as something to follow or practice (Dewey 1916).
Students indicated appreciating their own work after experience with the research process,
peer contributions, educator and librarian guidance, library program printable guides, the works
created by others, and opportunities for displaying knowledge learned through frequent
assessments (Wiggins, 1993). Appreciating how information is processed Maria offered, “I used
information by summarizing and using direct quotes. I would put most of the summarizing at the
end, using my own thoughts but not as an opinion, but as evidence. I come away with thinking
how valuable this type of thinking or this way to do research is very valuable.” Having a similar

127
experience Julie stated, “I took notes. Most of it I reworded but some I quoted. By the time the
information was in my paper, it was all reworded unless I absolutely needed a quote. I used intext citations for quotes and paraphrasing and listed citations in MLA format.” Maria and Julie’s
proper processing of the information indicated valuing the work of others and how the
information supported their individual work. Value for any author’s work, including the students,
became a center point on which the educators, students, and librarian focused.
Students indicated valuing the work they created and shared by determining resource
credibility. Julie stated, “you have to get reliable information for the research paper to actually
be good. Reliable information is important because you do not want to put wrong information
into your paper. You cannot have a good paper from false information. The paper has to be
reliable because it is a research paper.” Julie internalized valuing credible information and the
pressure of eventually presenting to her peers and reacted by developing a strong work ethic. She
continued, “I do not want to sound stupid in front of the class so I work harder. If my work is bad,
I will know because the other students will obviously tell and show me. I thought getting
feedback was good.” Students came to understand the use of citations as a way to honor authors
rather than for plagiarism violations. Paul noted that with practice and support, “citations
themselves, once you learned how to do them, were easy. To do them I used the library program
templates.” David used “in-text citations on a few quotes but liked to put things in my own
words and cite it. I used a quote or paraphrase because it really explained my thesis.”
Appreciating research support George stated, “I would ask my teacher and librarian about APA
accuracy styling and get feedback on properly what to do. Whenever I had research questions I
would also go to them. With all the feedback I received I am pretty confident in how I am doing
the process.” As students came to value their information choices for selecting, processing and

128
sharing as well as the guidance offered, they grew more confident trusting not only the
information literacy variables but also their own skills.
Student participants indicated an appreciation for information literacy processes and
skills never mentioning plagiarism. Yet in juxtaposition, educators and administrators indicated a
student’s realization of consequences developed value (Gutek, 2009). Educators and
administrators indicated that Western High School’s appreciation for information literacy and
researching has shifted from being driven by plagiarism and punishment to combining
organization of information, engaging in critical thinking, and evaluating information. John
offered that he has not had many cases of plagiarism since the library program has been
supporting information literacy learning. John commented that Western High School used to,
“teach a value to research through consequences.” John stated he used to be invited to classes to
speak to students who “were about to do research and talk to the class about ethical research
before you get to the point of consequences.” John noted there have been no requests for him to
speak about plagiarism consequences in three years.
All five educators stressed the value of recognizing and treating another person’s work
with respect, selecting evaluated resources and formatting. Four educators had clear criteria for
the formatting of student work embedded into their lesson plans and rubrics. Charles offered
students frequent assessments that layered information literacy learning and content, which gave
students many opportunities to correct their work. Charles found students did get confused. He
stated, “I certainly express value in the kind of information students are thinking about and
finding but this usually falls to a silent room. I don’t know if this is because students don’t
understand or that they don’t agree about valuing the information they want to use. Students who
did not have a citation page did not do the work. This was a personal choice.” John offered

129
students many opportunities for corrections, which indicated the student’s value of his or her
own work. After providing multiple opportunities to correct small assessments, John then
dedicated 30% of the final paper’s grade to formatting. John made the argument that at any point
in the overall assignment students could correct their work based upon the feedback he offered
with each assessment. When a student chose not to correct formatting, find credible and reliable
information, or seek additional supportive evidence, it was a choice that had consequences. The
choices each student made reflected upon their individual adopted value system.
Printed materials offered insight into educator expectations of student values, including
information literacy variables. Four of the educator lesson plans guided citation organization and
evaluation of resources as practiced tasks. Educators offered methods for processing information
including three column notes, note cards, online notes, and the development of a Works Cited
page used to not only record information but also keep track of the authority that produced the
work. Educators kept the consideration for another person’s work in front of the student by
consistent practice. Responding to educator and librarian support student Paul offered:
I guess the more valuable articles are the ones cited in the actual essay and where direct
quotes are from. I did a good job with citing and selecting quotes. I can go back to the
research I did and understand how valuable it was and what I did to prepare myself to do
the essay and presentation. When I was doing the presentation, I was kind of thinking
what was most important. Because I felt that the most important information was
something I was sharing with my class.
Paul indicated many levels of respect and appreciation for the information literacy process and
variables, knowledge gained and shared, and the ethical treatment of information produced by
another human being.

130
Educators came to value their role in the research process through the experiences of their
students. Educators indicated that students began to choose whether or not to identify themselves
as a researcher. Theresa, an educator, stated:
That a person cannot get to an answer to a question that is raised by what she or he knows.
So it makes a person value the previous research, leading to the realization that there was
no answer to the question. I am not quite sure if the students value the experience yet,
but students that always do their best work have said to me that they are enjoying this
process.
Louise expressed how her students within the library program’s system of information literacy
support have been given the choice to act ethically, stating:
Students do come away with understanding for the value of information. Those students
who wanted to use the invalid source, I question but they made the choice. However,
most students understood when they used valid sources and argued a point. Students also
learned about a person who is an expert and one that just has an opinion. And I don't
think they can walk away without gaining a sense of appreciation for another’s work
because the students are writing an opinion and backing it up the same way someone else
did.
Educators offered students every opportunity to learn, be assessed, respond to feedback, and gain
knowledge within the lesson with the understanding that for valuing information literacy
variables and allowing students to make the final choices of what to internalize, react to, and
commit to their own value structure.
Collaboration with librarian. First round In Vivo coded excerpts of collaboration with
the librarian offered insight into elements of building a cognitive environment that supports

131
information literacy growth (see Table 4-8). Administrators considered collaboration as a method
for guiding information literacy learning within the library program. Thomas and Edward
recognized the importance of educators collaborating directly with the librarian, while Thomas
and John recognized the importance of the librarian working directly with students. Students
recognized collaboration through the lesson plans educators developed with the librarian. Paul, a
sophomore student, stated “just having the time to research with the two teachers helps. When
the teacher and the librarian are in the same room, it helps to bounce ideas between them.” Paul
identifies the librarian with the role of an educator, equal to the content area educator.
All students indicated valuing the lessons and time dedicated to teaching about databases,
online examples and guides, and formatting. Vicki offered, “I would go to my teacher and the
librarian just because they have experiences, but the organizational skills I got from the librarian
are helpful.” John divided the purposes of educator and librarian by stating, “I think my librarian
and teacher helped a lot. The teacher leads you in the direction you want to go, but the librarian
shows you how to get into that direction better than a teacher. I guess the teacher is looking for
the final products but the librarian helps you get through.”
Library program and educator printed material indicated occurrences of educator and
librarian collaboration (see Table 4-9). Evidence was gathered from the library program’s
calendar of bookings, educator lesson plans, and guides. The calendar offered dates educators
met to plan a lesson and bookings for co-teaching a class between the librarian and educator.
There were 32 collaborative co-taught lessons between the librarian and educator participants
during the fall semester. Educators who co-taught determined the scheduling date, amount of
class collaboration visits, and the content, and included information literacy processes, skills, and
tools, as lesson objectives. Giving students advanced expectations and objectives, two educators

132
of class learning level 2 students notified students within their lesson plans of upcoming
collaborations with the librarian, in addition to assessments and benchmarks. Charles summed up
the relationships necessary for researching by stating, “I think there is a lot of collaboration to
get students to the analysis point. Collaboration between teacher and students, student and
student, teacher and librarian, and librarian and students has to happen.” Louise recognized that
the collaboration and the transfer of skills to other classes reinforce information literacy learning
and “important to the process was the time spent with the librarian in the library. Every year we
have students who say they have already done the process in another class. Students need this
guidance. The instruction is reinforced when described by me and then the librarian and how
they overlap.”
Theme 5: Program Challenges
Challenges must be a consideration if school and district leadership are to recognize
adjustments, improvements, and changes necessary for a library program to flourish. This initial
code transferred directly to a theme containing 122 occurrences. Since education is a constantly
changing entity that requires research, the associated challenges are also constantly changing
(Merriam, 1998).
Reading. One student and four educators recognized a need for additional reading
support. Support included reading to understand meaning and concepts, locate keywords or
alternative words, organizing facts, encouragement to read, and processing and organizing what
was read. As an initial code within the theme of information literacy, administrators, educators,
and students recognized reading has a place in the research process. Maria, recognizing her own
difficulty with reading perseverance, stated, “the real issue was reading and how I was reading.
At first, I was looking at the article title and beginning and there would be nothing really in it.

133
Then I began to read through the whole article and figured out the end has a good part.”
Recognizing the reading difficulties in her class Louise stated:
Reading was a struggle for a lot of the sophomores. And when you look at the criteria for
a level 1 class and consider the students, reading is a piece that students need to work on
and do, that is an expectation of the course. This research assignment shows that some of
the students need to increase their literacy skills. Reading for understanding when you are
trying to connect information is something you need to improve.
Louise opens the possibility for reading remediation in high school, not for how to read but
learning close reading techniques, which are changing the way students conduct research and
engage in information literacy (Purcell et al., 2012).
Time influencing student skills. All educators were challenged by how many students
struggled though the research process because of the variation of student information literacy
understanding and skills. No educator or student offered class learning levels as a reason for the
variation of information literacy skills. Rather, Charles, an educator who correlated the variation
of information literacy skills with the time other educators allowed for the lesson, stated:
There are a lot of teachers who believe student ability, freshmen and sophomores are not
ready to do a research paper at this level, and I disagree with this. Setting up how to find
information and what to do with the information, I had to build and tie this into the
curriculum, Ya, and I am behind. But, I do not want students to just read and write but to
read and write in a certain way, through the project. I have made this a keystone in my
own classes.”
All the educators and administrators recognized time dedicated to researching and taken from the
curriculum is a problem (Meer, Perez-Stable and Sachs’ 2012).

134
Administrators also struggled with time. Administrators have to respect past practices and
existing cultures before committing to a change due to challenges to the library program
(Hargreaves & Fullan, 2011). John stated, “teachers have been comfortable with past practices.
Now they require depth of understanding, that is new.” Therefore, change is not immediate even
if the administrator recognizes what should be done. John who wanted educators to take
ownership for facilitating information literacy development, stated:
It should not be seen as someone else’s responsibility. We do not want teachers saying,
‘its not my job to teach research,’ ‘its not by job to teach a child to use a database,’ or ‘its
not my job to each a kid how to properly cite or build a bibliography’ I have always
leaned towards making sure these are integrated into the curriculum.
However, understanding and ownership cannot be developed when financial constraints limit the
number of certified librarians in the district. Thomas offered that each time schools are asked to
wait for information literacy support and training, a new norm is established. This new norm
reduces the perceived importance of the library program and further delays the development of
processes and skills associated with research in both educators and students. Without support for
information literacy, Thomas recognized “we have done a lousy job of professional development
or even determining what the skills set of research are.” Edward wondered “if the district has
done a good job of pushing the message of teaching research and learning information literacy
out to teachers, making sure teachers understand my expectations. I probably have not in, terms
of marketing, sent researching expectations to the teachers.”
Administrators and educators understand when teaching information literacy within a
standards based curriculum, students need more time processing. Administrators want to offer
students the opportunity to work independently during unscheduled time, but John stated the

135
feelings of all by saying, “kids don't have that time during the school day. We talked about
creating the conditions to develop the skills, I don’t think we allow for adequate time for
independent learning and practice so it is dependent on teachers to bring classes to the library.”
Louise, an educator questioned:
If we may be expecting too much from our students. I say this because when you
consider that they have only had three hours of researching introduction and it is
continuous, and we don’t waste a second, with the continuous flow of information written,
verbal, and visual from us to them on how to research, that there may not have been
enough processing time built into the plan and we maybe thinking we conveyed the
information clearly and well that students do not get yet because they do not have enough
background and enough use.”
Louise struggles with the balance between students mastering specific learning objectives and
with their learning capacity.
Student effort. One the most frustrating challenges to educators are the students who
show a lack of effort. Lack of effort caused by either not wanting to complete the research
process or by those students who perceive themselves as having proficient information literacy
skills (Purcell, et al., 2012). Students’ initial attitude towards information and information
literacy processes and skills as perceived by educators is often unappreciative and impatient.
Charles found that although students perceived themselves as knowing how to research he
noticed:
How many students at the sophomore level did not understand how to use the search
engine options correctly. Students know how to open up Google’s simple search and type
in words, but so many students type in the actual question. Students do not understand

136
how Google works. I think that blew me away that they did not know how to use
keywords or even figure out what the keywords are.
Thomas, an administrator, offered the idea that this student attitude is based on their over
confidence with technology, which is often supported by educators, “the assumption is because
kids have an iPad or iPod or another device that they possess a fundamental set of skills that
makes us assume they do not need instruction in the research area.” John, another administrator,
stated students “think they are better with the skills they have…would be over confident with not
only using information but presenting information.” While we know all the challenges, it is time
to work through each, in order to achieve the goal of creating an information literate Western
High School community.
Chapter 5: Discussion
An instrumental case study was used to evaluate whether Western High School’s library
program supported student information literacy growth, the fundamental purpose for this
research. While other research studies provided data for analyzing a specific information literacy
skill or process within a learning environment, this study examined students without content or
process restrictions. The study asked three driving questions to identify how administrators,
educators, and students perceive the library program’s support of information behavior within
Western High School. Information behavior language was then interpreted into information
literacy concepts generated within the study. While the term information literacy is known
primarily within the library science field as a set of concepts and behaviors that transcend
educational boundaries, enabling educators, librarians, and administrators to work towards
building information literate students ready for the challenges of college and career, it took on
other roles within the research (Conley, 2014; Saunders, 2011; Wiggins & McTighe 2005). In

137
addition, the research indicated information literacy was referenced as a set of behaviors, tasks,
variables, and learning objectives, as well as concepts. These five information literacy
understandings were interchangeable depending on the perspective and need of the administrator,
educator, or student. Behaviors, tasks, and learning objectives were used with lesson planning,
instruction, and assessment. Variables and concepts were referenced when consideration beyond
the lesson and into life-long understanding was the focus.
The study drew upon Bickman’s (1987) concepts of a program theory and Wiggins
(1993) assessment for learning theory to determine how the Western High School library
program supported information literacy growth. Evaluating Western High School’s library
program required the establishment of a logical model to evaluate whether the library’s goal is
being achieved through the planned activities and associated outcomes (Bickman, 1987; Chen,
1990). Planned activities included not only how students were assessed for information literacy
growth, but also for how educators taught for understanding based on educator indications of
“desired results” (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Since the larger concept of developing
information literate students who sustain, transfer, and recontextualize information literacy
processes and skills reaches into life long learning, these theories are able to work in conjunction
with each other. The logical model contains the library program’s contributions to educator
open-ended authentic performance tasks and projects that students are assessed on as they
engage in information behavior (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Presented is how providing the
conditions for both learning and assessing information literacy emerges from the library program,
passes through administrators and educators and into supporting students knowledge growth.
Logical Model

138
The study utilized a logical model comprised of Western High School library program’s
overall goal, activities, objectives, and evaluation of the objectives met to answer the study’s
driving questions (see Appendix P library program logical model determining student
information literacy growth). To insure data placed from the study was reflected in the logical
model, information literacy initial codes were placed adjacent to the evaluation of objectives.
The logical model offered a view into how the library program is functioning, if the evaluation of
outputs satisfies the goal, and a tool for determining if change or adjustments are required.
Western High School’s logical model was developed to analyze the library program’s
influence on student information literacy growth. In the context of understanding student
information behaviors, actions, and reactions, perceptions of information literacy activities, what
was learned, and benefits gleaned from the perspective of students, educators, and administrators,
were recorded. Logical model activities were determined through analysis of the data.
Information literacy activities described by students, educators, and administrators having library
program or librarian influences were identified. While the activities do not initially indicate
information literacy growth, it is important to keep in mind “information literacy is about using
information to learn…drawing on information use or information practices to help secure the
learning outcomes that we seek” (Bruce, 2008, p. 15). Thus, instruction for pre-searching,
research preparation, research organization, databases, search engines, evaluation, relevancy and
formatting may be reflected in tasks, practices, and assessments when the educator’s primary
goal was to provide students with opportunities to become proficient in varied information
literacy learning objectives.
Library program student activities. The logical model points to students having
positive experiences with activities leading to the benefit of learning information literacy

139
concepts. Recorded student experiences with pre-search methods, preparation for understanding
and using keywords, organizing outlines, data, and information from a variety of potential
resources, as well as evaluating and selecting authoritative and relevant resources were included
in the logical model’s activities. These library program activities are connected as oscillatory
variables that students needed to critically think through. Because the activities are connected,
the outputs students experienced were also connected. For example, when a pre-search or
research preparation activity was created, a student applied what was constructed to an
information technology and communications tool. The intimate connection between the presearch, research preparation, and information and communications tools required the threaded
connection of oscillatory thinking and processing for how and what type of information could be
retrieved and if these processes should be adjusted and repeated with different results. Students
not only experienced information literacy processes and gained understanding during the
performance tasks but were also able to reason why the differences in information behavior
choices can influence consequences (Flavell, 1979). Confidence grew when students were able to
select their own information literacy variables and understand the transferring and
recontextualizing of information literacy knowledge to new phenomena (Bruce, 2008; Case,
2009).
The evaluation of student development of understanding and confidence in information
literacy included a connection to values. Outputs indicated students completed the evaluation of
websites and selected relevant information not only when directed by an educator or librarian but
when the desire for producing an assessment that contained quality superseded the desire for
speed or the actual grade itself. While not fully developed, the steps and assessments the
librarian and educators provided led to students identifying themselves as researchers with actual

140
researcher responsibilities. Students identifying as a researcher indicated evidence of dedication
to writing format, completing citations, understanding a creator or author should be given credit
for a published work, and appreciating and taking pride in their own personal work by
developing something credible others can learn from.
Library program educator and administrator activities. Library program activities
with educators and administrators did not directly link to information literacy growth within
students. Rather, the outputs based on library program collaborations created opportunities for
student information behavior experiences. Students experienced and responded to lesson plans,
calendars, guides, rubrics, assessments, and access to information and communications tools
provided through educator and administrator activities within the library program. These
resources offered a level of transparency to the students, replacing the fear of research with
guidance for organizing information and self-learning information processes. Lesson materials
provided direction for the overall assignment and guidance for specific practices and assessment
expectations. Students interpreted the transparency of an educator’s lesson material as
reassurance they could concentrate on making individual decisions concerning the information
content rather than the consequences of correctly engaging with information. Removing fear of
consequences based on grade or plagiarism allowed students to learn from their mistakes and
corrections.
Program evaluation and goal. Western High School’s library program’s logical model
was created to determine whether the evaluation of student benefits reflected the goal of
developing information literate students who can sustain, transfer and recontextualize
information literacy skills. The library program exhibited support for positively influencing
student information literacy growth. Most importantly, students showed a propensity for

141
applying ethical and aesthetic value when thinking and processing information related to the
specific activities of pre-searching, research preparation, selection of research tools and sources,
resource evaluation and choosing relevant information. Further consideration for how an
evaluation of student outputs mirror the goals is discussed in conjunction with the driving
research questions. The research questions become the vehicle by which the library program is
not only evaluated but where implications for change would be generated.
Western High School’s library program supports information behavior
A logical model was used to determine a baseline for whether the Western High School’s
library program supported information literacy growth. For a library program to evolve, it is
important to determine if information literacy is present (Saunders, 2011). Evidence pointed to
Western High School’s library program as containing information literacy instruction where
students were able to experience formalized assistance (Gross & Latham, 2012). Administrators,
educators, and students came to understand information literacy instruction was intertwined into
course instruction, guides, rubrics, and individual student assistance provided by the library
program. Intertwining, rather than embedding, is a weaving of information literacy with course
content. Embedding information literacy into courses insinuates instruction is dropped separately
into educators lesson content. Educators who used the library program adopted intertwining
where co-planning, co-teaching, and at times co-assessing with the librarian spiraled information
literacy teaching and learning with content teaching and learning. In addition, the librarian was
present for individual student guidance and reflection. The intertwining of information literacy,
with course instruction directly influenced student experiences and perspectives of the library
program. Without the library program and the intertwining of information literacy concepts with

142
course content, students would be more likely to define their own information behaviors
measured against individual values (Purcell, et al., 2012).
Students were surprised by the differences between library program information literacy
instruction as a stand alone and what each have come to practice with intertwined instruction.
Students found the intertwined information literacy instruction into content learning offered
efficient, effective, and authoritative methods for supporting information behaviors. The library
program offered centralized understandings of values educators applied when creating
opportunities for students to practice and critically think through information literacy processes
and skills. Educator participants who intertwined information literacy instruction into pedagogy
understood that information behaviors surrounding information literacy as concepts, tasks,
learning objectives, and values mattered both to the student and student’s knowledge growth.
Considerations for intertwining information literacy. In order for the library program
to influence student information behavior, the study provided evidence of two considerations if
information literacy and content teaching and learning are to be intertwined. First, educators and
the librarian must consider their understanding differences for the learning outputs shown in the
logical model. The differences are a result of the perspective of their respective professions and
ownership claims to information literacy. Seven of the twelve information literacy learning
objectives were present when compared with the evaluation results of Western High School’s
library program’s logical model (see Appendix N library program logical model). Participants
indicted the library program provided direct support for the instruction, concepts, and associated
values with research techniques and skills, research thinking and processing, pre-search, research
preparation, resource evaluation and resource relevance. These information literacy concepts are
important components of recognized library association standards and frameworks.

143
The first round codes of research process, reading analysis, resource types, resource
synthesis, and writing application that emerged though the coding process were not determined
by educators to be part of the library program, but rather part of their responsibility for
instructing synthesis, resource types, writing, and reading. Therefore, there is a value difference
concerning points of instruction between the educator and the librarian that needed to be
discussed. For this to work there can be no clear ownership line of demarcation. Rather, the
educator and librarian, as components of the library program, need to share understanding,
learning objectives, and instructional practices to understand each others perspective to create
opportunities for student information literacy growth. Within this study the sharing between the
librarian and the educator displayed how closely tied the content and assessments are to an
educator’s indicators of student learning (Saunders, 2011). The sharing was especially necessary
when teaching and assessing student learning between class learning levels. The educator and
librarian kept the information learning levels constant no matter the changes to methodology and
assessment. By focusing on the learning objectives but changing methodology and assessments,
all students had the opportunity to gain information literacy knowledge.
The second consideration for intertwining information literacy and content was for how
each participant perceived his or her roles within the school. Administrators acknowledged their
role as capacity builders for educators and students to deeply understand, process, and practice
information literacy learning. Building capacity meant financial support and communicated
curriculum expectations for how the library program brought together printed materials,
purchased sources, and utilized personnel. While administrators offered clear expectations and
budgetary support for the library program, they recognized a void in communicating their
information literacy expectations to educators and students. Without district level information

144
literacy expectations, the library program struggles upwardly to gain educator support for
intertwining information literacy concepts into instruction. Administrators recognized that their
support offers downward momentum for the district level information literacy expectations.
As a primary instructor of a class, each educator recognized his or her responsibility for
instructing students how to properly research. Educators had the responsibility of setting learning
objectives, guiding student instruction, and assessing growth. However, educators within this
study understood they needed information literacy support and reached out to the library
program. Although the educator and student excerpts do not continually indicate points of the
library program, there is an implied perception that the librarian was part of the planning process.
Intertwining of information literacy variables into instruction influenced student growth
through learning how to support each other’s knowledge development. Initially students were in
the role of the learner with the potential for moving toward the role of instructor. Students used
the library program’s librarian for information literacy instruction and individual guidance for
specific searches and formatting. The people who students go to for information help can be
categorized into three distinct roles: informants, agents, and trainers (Gross & Latham, 2009, p.
343). While informants have the information ready to distribute, agents know where to find
information, and trainers are used to gain the skills necessary to locate information (Gross &
Latham, 2009, p. 344). Students who used Western High School’s library program identified the
librarian in these three roles. However, as students developed information literacy skills, they
also could identify themselves as becoming an informer, agent, or trainer. As student information
literacy skills grew, they began to rely on each other (Gross & Latham, 2009). When a student’s
role changed from learner to instructor, it was driven by his or her desire to learn and share

145
experiences with peers. The role changes, as well as the motivation behind the change, may
potentially inspire students to persevere through the research process.
Educator and administrator: Library program information behavior influence
Educator and administrator perspectives on how the library program influenced
information behavior relied primarily on the willingness of educators to intertwine information
literacy into their lessons. Current educational constructs do not celebrate educator-librarian
collaboration nor create the mechanism to collaborate (Saunders, 2011). Educators are focused
on content, while librarians are aware of the range of sources and methods for embedding
processes and skills, information behaviors, thinking and processing, and information and
communications tools into educator lesson objectives (Saunders, 2011, p. 145). Three of the
educators within the study collaborated with the librarian to develop lessons, rubrics,
assessments, and calendar bookings. Others selected the aspect of information literacy he or she
wanted the students to learn, expecting the librarian to intertwine this instruction into the lesson.
Intertwining information literacy into content lessons required collaboration between the
educator and the librarian. A mutual trust and appreciation for each other’s knowledge had to
exist between the educator and the librarian for successful collaboration to occur. Trust required
that the educator and librarian learn from each other. Trust was evident when the librarian was
asked to edit student work and participate in developing student article analysis criteria and
guides. Similarly, trust was evident when educators published within lesson plans specific
librarian created information literacy guides or used information literacy objectives within
rubrics and assessments.
Combining collaboration with the information literacy variables makes the educator
perspective of the library program more cohesive. The library program thrives when educators

146
and the librarian collaborate with their professional knowledge and skills set intertwining at
information literacy points. When the sharing of knowledge, skills, and responsibilities occurs,
rather than the educator or librarian claiming single ownership, Western High School’s students
experienced information literacy growth.
Performance tasks, assessments, and goal. Educators considered the library program as
a resource for developing assessments linked to learning both content and information literacy
processes and skills. While only one educator did not frequently assess within his lesson, all
realized that the goal of the lesson was not the success of each individual performance task but
rather the sum of the tasks and assessments as they become fulfilled learning objectives. All
educators understood the accumulation of each performance task within the lesson leads the
library program’s goal of developing information literate students. Wiggins and McTighe (2005)
ask educators to challenge the validity of evidence that assesses students. Four educators
collected various notes and note cards, information analysis, citation works, rough drafts, thesis
statements, initial paragraphs and outlines as formal and informal assessments leading up to the
final assignment. Opportunities to use feedback to learn from and adjust work were valuable and
led to student’s information literacy learning within the extent of the data collected (Wiggins &
McTighe, 2005).
Class learning levels. A deeper look into educator performance assessments noted that
correlation existed between class learning levels and time dedicated to the lesson. Class learning
level 2 educators collaborated with the librarian on 20 occasions (see Table 4-9) and completed
15 assessments (see Table 4-6), giving students many opportunities for successful learning of
content as well as information literacy processes and skills. Class learning level 2 educators
described how they provided a variety of assessment to engage, check, redirect, and support

147
student learning. Although class learning levels of honors and learning level 1 met with the
librarians less and contained fewer assignments, more was expected concerning out-of-class
independent work. While educators expressed that time at home allowed more time in the
classroom to dedicate to the curriculum, it is “complicated because the teacher has to verify that
all work produced is the student’s own” (Conley, 2014, p. 223). Educators and the librarian
working directly with class learning level 2 students wanted more control to not only ensure
work was being authentically completed but that the skills and processes of information literacy
were understood. With the librarian and educator having a presence during all learning level
classes, students were able to receive direct support. This supports Badke’s (2005) statement that
information literacy is the right of every student (p.74). Educators of class learning level 1, 2,
and honors provided information literacy instruction tailored to the student learning levels.
Although limited to these four educators, the differentiation challenged McGuiness’s (2006)
findings that educators self-select who is eligible to learn and acquire information literacy
knowledge.
The outlier to consider is the multilevel class that provided only one assessment but
visited the library to collaborate five times. The multilevel class contained a variety of learners
where the educator have to differentiate between additional time, innate ability, the motivated
and unmotivated, as well as other differences. While the time dedicated to the collaboration of
information literacy learning was embedded, not intertwined, students were only given one
chance to show skills acquired. With only one assessment, information literacy takes a back-seat
to content (McGuiness, 2006; Saunders, 2011). Unfortunately, there were no students from this
multilevel class to offer perspective of information literacy processes and skills learned.

148
Value. Both educator and administrators saw value emerge though the Western High
School library program’s influence on information behaviors. The discussion of value took on
three facets: considerations surrounding plagiarism educator and librarian emphasis for student
to identifying as a researcher, and creating a community that encourages thinking about
researching through ethical and appreciative lenses. Plagiarism was not discussed as an educator
focus, only administrators had this focus. One educator considered the potential for plagiarism as
an opportunity for teaching and learning information literacy values and redirecting behaviors.
During the peer editing process, this educator let students comment on each other’s work, noting
his experience as “what was interesting is that the other students in class understood right away
what the person wanted to plagiarize and what was wrong with this method.” Rather than
delivering punishment, the educator allowed for self-correction within the performance
assessments provided. Students were part of the assessment as comments concerning potential
plagiarism came through student feedback. The educator noticed an opportunity for students to
influence each other without grade consequences in a respectful manner. While the students
discussed may or may not have applied self-corrections, the opportunity to think about
consequences, actions, and adjustments for learning through value were available.
Part of the students’ understanding of value was driven by consequences. The importance
for appreciating another person’s intellectual property was used to illustrate how students should
value information literacy. All educators indicated some type of citation and formatting
requirement on their rubrics. More importantly, we can infer by student comments that the
instruction received concerning the value of another person’s work led to specific information
behaviors. Students emphasized source credibility rather than completing citations, excitement
when linking authors, and selection of the best information to represent their work. These

149
research characteristics led them to use information properly. For this type of understanding to
occur, students placed the value of information above their own personal needs. Educators
created the opportunity and conditions for students to use information literacy variables to reflect,
act, make mistakes, and react until the process had been completed. The library program’s place
within this learning process existed through co-teaching, developing rubrics, individual
instruction, and printed material guides. Together, the educator and librarian found ways for
students to identify as a researcher. When students indicated they were concerned about
presenting to the class or peer editing, they were thinking not out of fear but towards building a
quality product based on credibility and relevance. While the study only represents six of the
school’s students, educator perspectives concerned entire classes. Therefore, when educator
perspectives are considered, there is potential for building capacity for information literacy as a
value in all classes through intertwined instruction and assessment.
Students: Library program’s information behavior influence
Students who participated in the study demonstrated various degrees of information
literacy understanding. Similar to the finding of Kuhlthau (1991), the research moved beyond the
articulated common activities of students to the considerations of more than information
behavior cognition (p. 370). Rather than determining degrees of growth in student information
literacy skills, the research uncovered commonalities that laid the foundation for student
information literacy to flourish. Two overarching concepts, critical thinking and making
independent choices, emerged as common threads among student information behavior
experiences within the Western High School library program. These concepts were developed
through direct activities containing indirect educator and librarian overarching purposes for
intertwining information literacy into lessons. Critical thinking, through individual information

150
behavior choices, meant information literacy concepts were dependent on each other for students
to learn the processes and skills. More importantly, students supplied glimpses into their value
structure that was used to contemplate each of the information literacy concepts. Students did
not just think about the choice to go to a database, or use specific keywords, indicating cognition.
Rather, students employed metacognition, where there is a combination of information literacy
variables (Case, 2012; Flavell, 1979, p. 907). One of the variables is the behavior of choosing a
consequence. Genuine thinking happens when a student is able to reflect upon consequences
before acting (Gutek, 2009, p. 340). Thus, students within this study critically thought through
the right or wrong of each information literacy concept before acting, reflected upon the
consequences, and used their individual value structure to choose an action (see Appendix Q
information literacy value model). Once the action was evaluated, the student determined if a
repeat of the action was necessary or to move on to the next information literacy concept.
The overlapping of individual value structures with the concepts of critical thinking and
making independent choices evolved simultaneously with student information literacy processes
and skills. Students in the study experienced the logical model listed activities of pre-searching,
research preparation, database and search engine instruction, evaluating websites, and selecting
relevant information. Each activity was a point of information literacy that the educator and
librarian instructed and built performance tasks and assessments intended to showcase student
progress. While excerpts could quantify these activities through coding, indications of
metacognition, reasoning, and value associated with actual choices were contained within the
wording of each excerpt. Student excerpts that offered reasoning for information literacy action
choices gave the educator and librarian a foundation for shaping future student information

151
behavior. This shaping then became more than teaching information literacy skills and processes,
it came to encompass the development of ethical and aesthetic values by the students.
Information literacy and value. Students who participated in this study came with
different information literacy value structures developed from previous experiences. Yet, when
guided by the study’s educators and the librarian, students displayed a tendency to make choices
based on values absorbed from the class instruction. A student offered, “I value learning. I did
not want to write a paper for the grade, I wanted to learn something in the process, something
new.” This single sentiment is the overarching idea of education, as it leads to constant learning
and an increase in knowledge. When viewed through the lens of the library program, this excerpt
indicates more than learning information literacy process and skills; it communicates the
student’s perceived value of information literacy.
The librarian within this study shared information literacy understanding with educators
to shape interactions with students. This sharing contributed to the transfer of information and an
increase in knowledge, in addition to the development of values expressed within the research
process (Oakleaf, 2009). The activities of pre-searching, research preparation, and using
information and communications tools facilitated the development of student confidence when
guided to openly investigate a topic until a single point of discovery was targeted. Students were
then able to shape and direct a single discovery point they determined into a unique, arguable
thesis. The students’ thesis statements were systematically unraveled and placed into a query, in
order to locate supportive evidence. While directly guiding students to develop a thesis, create
research questions, select keywords, formulate search strings, and manipulate information and
communications technology tools to narrow down retrieved information, the educator and
librarian trusted students to make choices within each of these information literacy concept areas.

152
Within the research study, students had a series of critical points where the appreciation of
another’s work or their own work required ethical behavior choices.
Where previous studies indicated students lacked the ability to know where to locate
quality resources (Smith, Given, Julien, & Delong, 2013), Western High School students
indicated exact databases, web searching domains, and the uses for Google Scholar citations and
Google Books. Applying critical thinking to these choices built both student knowledge and
confidence by engaging in the search, being assessed, and correcting errors without
consequences. Critical thinking choices led to actions and reactions concerning keywords and
alternative word use to generate better resources, manipulating search tools to target specific
types of credible sources, maneuvering through content within a resource to deepen the query,
and giving credit for another’s intellectual contributions.
Yet, throughout theses choices, actions, and reactions, with the exception of occasional
specific guidance from the educator and/or librarian, each student was guided by his or her own
value system that included a desire to learn, to develop a well thought out researching structure,
to complete a thorough search that rendered the best possible credible and relevant resources to
support an argumentative thesis, and to give credit. Students questioned and made judgments
such as, “I don’t want to use this information because I don’t know who wrote it.” Or “I want to
use information in my essay written by someone who is an expert.” Where previous studies
indicated trouble with deciphering information and citing (Asselin & Lam, 2007), students
within this study linked authors between additional and/or contributing works, linked journal
publications, and formatted in either APA or MLA styles. Western High School students
absorbed educator and librarian guidance to eventually weave new information literacy
knowledge into their own individual value structure.

153
Students came to understand that the overlapping skills of the educator and librarian
together make a powerful combination for placing the learning responsibility on the student
(Kingsley et al., 2011). As one student indicated, educators offered the framework of the content,
but the librarian guided the student through the research. All the students within this study
expressed the desire to learn as a motivating factor for completing the research process, not fully
realizing that they were gaining necessary information literacy process and skills to support
future information behavior challenges.
Implications
The research presented has implications for current library program instruction, school
cultural changes, and future research within the school library science field.
Implications for practice. This research has implications for school library teacher
practices depending on the library program’s current environment. Practice implications include
the intertwining rather than embedding of instruction, the value of multiple performance
assessments, improving student reading and writing, and understanding how time is a factor in
student information literacy growth.
Intertwining. The research provided evidence for intertwining of educator content with
information literacy concepts and learning objectives during the collaborative development of
lesson plans, tasks, guides, assessments, and rubrics by the educator and librarian. Intertwining is
different than embedding. Embedding offers the librarian an opportunity to teach an information
literacy process within a specific point of an already established lesson. Intertwining, which coils
and connects multiple educator and librarian learning objectives, was shown to build student
confidence as a researcher able to critically think through and utilize combinations of
information literacy variables, weigh choices against consequences, and transfer and

154
recontextualize processes and skills to other phenomena. Intertwining offered students of all
class learning levels the opportunity to gain the same information literacy skills at their own pace.
Intertwining influenced how the term information literacy was experienced: as a set of
tasks, concepts, learning objectives, or variables, each having implications for intertwining
information literacy into an educator’s course content. Similar to the presented research,
intertwining required librarians to share responsibility for and be ever present in a student’s
information literacy learning. The study determined that while the librarian contributed and
collaborated with the educator, the educator is ultimately responsible for the lesson plans, tasks,
assessments, and evaluation of student growth. Intertwining allows the concept of information
literacy to emerge, allowing educators and students to focus on both content and tangible
information literacy tasks and learning objectives. Information literacy as tasks and learning
objectives supports educators and students on their terms. Librarians can concentrate on building
awareness of information literacy as a set of concepts and/or spaced variables beyond individual
classes and into the community’s value set. Information literacy variable combinations reflect a
student’s individual choices weighed against the consequences of misusing information.
Together, individual choices become a shared value set.
Performance assessments. Educators within the study applied multiple assessments to
provide students with practice information literacy performance tasks which led to the
understanding of information literacy concepts. The research process can feel overwhelming.
Providing opportunities for students to practice, assess, correct, and redirect sent a message to
the student that educators and the librarian respected how each one developed knowledge. It also
provided the student with the independence to make his or her own choices, which could
influence the overall performance evaluation of a student’s combined assessments.

155
Reading. Both educators and students indicated a need for instructional support and
practice with informational text reading, synthesis of information understanding, and writing.
Students indicated a desire to learn how to read a research study, while others wanted graphic
organizers for locating and recording facts in preparation for synthesis and writing. While not all
research, reading, and writing are the same, developing tools students can select from and
educators can offer may support the close reading of informational text. Information literacy can
become a pathway for competency areas such as critical thinking, reading, and written
communication (Saunders, 2011, p. 229).
Time. The use of time was a concern of every educator who introduced research into his
or her curriculum. It is frustrating to high school educators that there is a need to remediate
research processes and skills to assist students with completion of a rigorous task. Consideration
of the development of scaffolded information literacy learning objectives between grades K-12,
fostered through collaboration between educators and librarians, will reduce the stress caused by
time constraints felt by high school educators. As indicated by one administrator, the district
places both the responsibility and pressure for student research instruction on high school
educators indirectly by not supporting information literacy K-12. The responsibility should be
shared, where students learn to cite in all grade levels that use informational text, select
keywords, understand different grade level search tools and databases, and learn to use advanced
search options. Today’s economy and school budgets require school districts to find a way to
make information literacy a priority. Intertwining educator content and information literacy
objectives can support information use with any information behavior demand.
Implications for cultural change. For schools to graduate information literate students,
information literacy has to become a significant goal within a school’s current culture. In order to

156
accomplish this, library professionals must respectfully approach change in a way that will
develop a common perspective and approach to information literacy instruction. Information
literacy can no longer remain hidden in the library and only taught by the librarian. Rather,
information literacy should become part of the school culture’s philosophical value set.
Administrator, educator, and librarian leadership has to develop a shared information literacy
vision the community can continually reflect upon. The consideration of value presents
possibilities for all lesson plans, performance tasks, assessments, guides, and rubrics to reflect
the ethical and aesthetical value the school’s culture places on information literacy.
Developing a constituency for the intertwining of information literacy into all disciplines
begins with listening, without bias, to the voices of the students, educators, and administrators
concerning past research practices, expectations, and fears. Because educators, students, and the
librarian have a stake in the ownership of information literacy, the information gleaned from
listening will generate important common themes that the community can agree upon. Through
listening, a school can take inventory of their current library program, understand educator and
student needs, develop school goals surrounding information behavior, and plan with individuals
who want to lead the change
Implications for research. Future research that specifically concentrates on K-12
information behavior is vital to understanding the growing demand for information use in
education. Within this research study, student participants were freshmen, sophomores, and
seniors. This aspect of the research is important because much of the data surrounding student
information behavior has been primarily generated in academic settings. If information literacy
research continues to indicate students at theses academic levels are still entering colleges and
universities requiring information literacy remediation, then future research has no choice but to

157
look into the K-12 educational setting for support. Educators at the K-12 level need to apply
research-based pedagogy that allows for the intertwining of librarian and educator skills. This
opportunity is not currently available in the academic setting, where embedding of information
literacy or separate information literacy classes have historically occurred. Recognizing the
differences in settings is a new way of considering information literacy research. Stating
information literacy processes and skills are lacking in students is not sufficient, so researching
how to build these skills before students are academically challenged and remediation is
necessary should be the focus of further research.
In addition, K-12 research should expanding the information literacy concepts of presearch and research preparation. Both were found to shape the way students came to choose a
topic and aspects of the topic and developed an argumentative thesis statement. This early
investment by the participating students encouraged the continued dedication toward valuing
researching and the information literacy concepts understood.
Finally, Thomas, an administrator, discussed how pre-service educators are being
introduced to information literacy. If intertwining of information literacy is introduced into preservice educator training, researching possible student growth after placement may be an
opportunity for further research.
Limitations of the study
Because the research is bound to Western High School’s library program, there were
some limitations. Although the researcher made efforts to purposely select a diverse population
of participants using the previously stated descriptors, there is no guarantee that the sample
represents the school’s population. Another limitation is the researcher’s relationship to the
library program. As both the researcher and the librarian, reflective notes assisted in ensuring

158
that the researcher perspective was not biased. The application of a logical model supported this
separation by recording only the information behavior perspective of participants, rather than
reflections of the librarian/researcher. Finally, terminology, definitions, and understanding for
information literacy are commonly known within the library profession. Administrators,
educators, and students used different terminology within their interviews to describe the
processes and skills necessary when conducting research or engaging in information behaviors.
Because of the terminology variation, the findings may not be generalizable to another setting
unless there is an understanding of the information literacy terminologies and associated
definitions.
Conclusion
The study presented went beyond the examination of individual points of information
literacy growth in students. Rather, what emerged was the experience of developing a unique
collaborative relationship between myself, as the librarian, and the educators. Collaboration
indicates parties working together toward the creation of a product. As the school librarian, I
found the most effective collaborations occurred when an educator and I merged our teaching
methods towards set learning objectives and affirmed similar values. Conversations necessary for
collaborating were pivotal and established listening as important practice for respectfully sharing
previous practices and results, creating new methods, and making adjustments based on student
assessment and responses. Required of both the educator and me was a letting-go of assumptions
of previous practices and each other’s responsibility towards the teaching the research process.
This letting go of assumptions established a foundation with an honest willingness to want to
work together in order to guide students. I especially had to be respectful of each educator’s past
practices, grounded beliefs, and research process skills set to establish a comfort level for us to

159
both guide the development of student information literacy growth, as each were different.
Intertwining became the product of the collaborative relationship. Supported by administrators,
the educators and I came to redefined our collaboration with the Western High School’s library
program. We found, redefining our collaborative relationship as intertwining was necessary
when our mutual objective was for our students to gain information literacy skills that could be
recontextualized to other environments.
Gaining information literacy knowledge is the right of every student who engages in
information behaviors (Badke, 2005). The goal of this research study was to determine whether
the library program selected for study positively supported student information literacy growth
that could be sustained, transferred, and recontextualized. The research encompassed the
assessment of student research skills and indicated that students entering colleges and
universities lacked information literacy skills necessary for academic research. The research
determined that when the objectives of the librarian and the educator were intertwined,
generating combined lesson plans, tasks, guides, assessments, and rubrics, students were able to
learn, practice, self-assess, correct, redirect their learning, and individually invest in their
information literacy knowledge development. Both the librarian and the educators have to let go
of ownership points within the research process and learn from each other. Students were able to
understand individual information literacy learning variables, especially as learning objectives.
Students were surprised by their own discoveries, which led them to a new level of information
literacy. As each student’s information behavior is guided and he or she seeks to become
information literate, there is a shift from the individual student’s focus on values to becoming
part of the greater school community adopting a similar value.

160
Gutek (2009) reminds us that value is not imposed but shared among people who have
determined its worth. While much of the previous research points to specific areas of information
literacy, this study indicated how a student’s understanding of his or her own value structure can
influence information literacy growth. A student’s value structure has worth within the school in
how he or she makes judgments. The importance for students to have a value structure emerged
through the library program’s collaboration with educators. Students were able to absorb the
understanding for the ethical use of information, appreciate intellectual property and understand
the implications for information literacy behavior choices. Educator and librarian guidance,
pedagogical choices, and frequent individual and class assessments assisted with practice,
reflection, and decisions to act and react. Ethical and aesthetical points of information literacy
were internalized by students and applied to their own work and the work of others. Thus, a
small community of researchers who exist in a cognitive environment emerged, having the
potential to influence a high school’s culture, shaping expectations of any information behavior,
independent choices, critical thinking and pedagogical methods towards those efforts. It is
through this higher consideration of information literacy among community members,
administrators, educators, students, and the library program working together toward the single
goal of information literate students. As students become information literate, a foundation for
building a sustainable information literacy community is established. Students were able to
transfer and recontextualize an information literacy value structure more easily with changing
information and technologies, rather than inculcating a series of steps with specific information
or technologies. The constant is information literacy as a value over the entire constituency
within Western High School.

Effectiveness of educator
choices to apply
information literacy
teaching and learning

Initial codes that have direct impact on student
information literacy learning due to educator
choices. These items are within the control of the
educator. Many of these initial codes were cocoded with an information literacy code. However,
most stood alone relating to exactly what the initial
code intended.

Outside administrative
and agency influences on
information literacy
teaching and learning

Initial codes that influence a school's overall
information literacy learning either by
administrative or agency decisions and mandates.
Most of these codes stood alone as to how they
influence. However, these codes are similar in
directly influencing educators and generate change
towards teaching effectiveness and student
learning.

Creating a cognitive
environment where
information literacy can
grow

Initial codes that directly support the creation of an
environment where deep thinking and reflection are
encouraged. Collaboration, while seen as a part of
educator practices, is placed in Cognitive
Environment due to administrators and students
recognition of its importance to the development of
a community.

Program Challenges

This initial code remains a secondary code, as it
directly shares the frustration of administrators,
educators, and students for developing information
literacy within the community.

Instruction: Presearching, Preparing and
organization research

Students prepared general questions
to pre-search, developed a point to
research, and connected research
questions, thesis, and keywords in
an organization creating a
framework for thinking about
information layout, outline, and
overall project. Individually,
students selected a learning
research method they could use in a
new context.

Students gained
understanding for how
planning supports successful
research. Students valued
their own work and
discovering a point worth
researching. Students chose
their own method for
organizing and grew
confident in their ability to
research.

Instruction: Databases,
Search Engines and
linking tools

Student's-facilitated advanced
searches, used keywords, and
alternative words, used critical
thinking to link information and
authors. Used reference lists to
locate additional information.

Students appreciated the
differences between
databases and search engines
and how each tool, source,
and resources connect to
each other. Confidence grew
as how to effectively and
efficiently use search tools.

Instruction: Formatting &
Appreciation of other's
work

Students used guides offered to
format work. Librarian provided
editing support. Students developed
an appreciation for their own work,
an author's work, and a
responsibility to each other.
Beginnings of understanding
synthesis of information through
multiple use of evidence, in-text
citations, and organization of
information.

Activities with Educators
Collaboration: Lesson
Students received student version of

Collaboration: Class CoTeaching, assessment,
feedback

Students responded to class and
individual instruction, associated
with anecdotes, appreciated
assessments, and feedback.

Evaluation of Student
Benefits
Students learned to value
what is authoritative and
appreciated their
responsibility in selecting the
best work to represent their
own projects
Students were not in fear of
plagiarism. Students who
formatted were followed
guided expectations and
began to understand giving
another person credit is
ethical. Students came to
understand the value of the
citation list as a reference for
other researchers.

Students understood what is
expected of them at each step
of the process, they began to
see the "big idea" for
researching done with
integrity.
Students felt supported and
respected but realized that
they still had a large
responsibility to fulfill the
steps
