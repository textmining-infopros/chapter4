ABSTRACT

This research investigates how organizational context contributes to the use of digital libraries,
an ICT-enabled information infrastructure. Traditionally digital-library use is measured with the
help of statistical analysis of download and other related data, but statistics alone have limited
power to explain how such an expensive information infrastructure is used to meet
organizational goals. Such limitation was overcome in this study by relating digital-library use to
the context of such use.

In the last decade many Indian research organizations have witnessed the abundance of such
information infrastructures accessible directly by end-users. The convergence of several
phenomena such as current business models for digital resources, improved ICT infrastructure
within organizations and several government interventions to help organizations have made this
possible. Because of this recent change, the study was conducted in two Indian research
organizations to understand how their respective contexts shape digital library use.

This qualitative study used two theoretical constructs -- social actor (Lamb & Kling, 2003) and
technology-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000). The lens of social actor helped to look beyond the
boundary of an organization in order to identify entities that reside in its environment and create
information demands on the members of the organization. Information demands from those
entities, making up organizational context, often pressure the members to use digital libraries.

Consequently digital-library uses acquire various meanings depending on the nature and power
position of those entities with respect to the members. The premise of the other lens used –
technology-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000) – is often for a technology use, the centrality does not
lie in its technical capabilities, rather various other factors outweigh such capabilities resulting
into a specific pattern of its use. In this study, this lens helped to identify several environmental,
technological, organizational and personal factors that contribute to very limited use patterns of
digital libraries.

The study contributed to our understanding of digital library use beyond merely measuring
downloaded data from database companies. It goes further to describe organizational context in
terms of several components and how such components often create workplace demands
resulting to digital library use. It also explains how some of the contextual aspects can outweigh
the technical capabilities of digital libraries leading to certain use patterns.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

It is a joyous moment for a doctoral student to write this section of her dissertation and finally
that time has come for me. At this moment, the name that first comes to my mind is Barbara
Hanna Kwasnik. Barbara often used to say that doing research is a joint activity of the committee
and the student. I realized what she meant when I was in the actual process of doing research.
Sitting thousands of miles away from the school while carrying on the research in last few years,
I never felt that distance. She was always there to discuss a problem, to read a piece written by
me, to critique my views on my findings. Numerous emails and recordings of skype sessions
between us form a treasured collection for me. While doing this research, I also learned from her
how an advisor can also become a research colleague.
I am equally grateful to the other members of my committee – Steve Sawyer, Jian Qin and Anne
Diekema for their unstinting support. Despite their very busy schedules, they always interacted
whenever I requested and continued on my committee till the end.
Sarah Webb Inoue is another very important name here. We were colleagues in our doctoral
class in Syracuse and later in the study group that we formed. She then offered to be the auditor
of my dissertation process. Since I came back to India to collect data and finish my dissertation,
every Tuesday evening was marked for our Skype session. This was in spite of the fact that she
herself was pursuing the doctoral program. Those weekly skype sessions, devoted to discuss my
dissertation, continued till a few days before her daughter arrived in 2013. And then she was
again there at the Syracuse airport to receive me in a freezing afternoon of February 2014, in the
dry run and in the final defense session.
It was possible for me to join the research program after taking a break from a job of many years
as my school – iSchool@SU – supported my study with assistantships and summer jobs. Another
very important and timely financial support from my school was a grant under the Students of
v

Promise fund. This grant helped to complete the final round of my dissertation work. I am
extremely thankful to Dean Liddy and the Board of Advisors of the School for this grant.
Emerald India LIS research fund provided a grant that helped me travel within the country for
data collection. I take this opportunity to record my gratitude to Emerald. I am also thankful to
all my informants whose identity I cannot disclose.
I am thankful to my friends in India – Dr. Rukmini Mitra Dasgupta, Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Dr.
Dipayan Sanyal and Dr. Sukomal Ghosh who provided me very valuable support in my data
collection. I am also grateful to another small group of my acquaintances that surprisingly
includes my dentist, who continuously reminded me that I was yet to complete this study.
Last but not the least, I am thankful to my loving sister Bulbuli and her husband Kalyan.
Together, they relieved me of many family responsibilities that otherwise would have occupied
my time. Bulbuli does not exactly know what her Didi (elder sister) did in all these years but that
her Didi is now a Ph.D. gives her immense pleasure.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1

Chapter introduction

The goal of the current research was to understand how the members of an organization are
exploiting digital libraries (DL)1, as an Information & Communication (ICT) tool, in order to
meet their organizational responsibilities. The study intended to look into the situations when
digital libraries become a meaningful tool at the hand of those members and how, in reality, it is
used. The actions of the organizational members involving digital libraries, in relation to
organizational responsibilities were of prime importance in this study.

Studies on the use of DLs/electronic resources have emerged, predominantly, into two streams of
research. One stream devoted to understand the process of information seeking in terms of
interaction between a user and an information system. It has resulted into a rich body of literature
that guides on what should be the features of a usable system. Another stream focused on counts
of interactions and used those counts to understand use patterns. Every click on a search feature
of a system or on an icon to download full text of a citation is captured as a “count of use”. These
counts are then projected as the measure of “use” of digital libraries/electronic resources. This
notion of “use” has been employed by libraries to justify the expenditure, to re-orient their
collections and so on.

1

Hence forth the terms digital library and its abbreviation DL have been used interchangeably throughout this document.

2
Notwithstanding the rich body of information that has been created, certain aspects of use are left
outside the purview of both the streams. On the larger canvass, a technology can be said to be
useful when it actually fits into the environment in which it was intended to be used. At a more
micro-level, when an organization makes huge investment in developing an information
infrastructure, a legitimate question – how this infrastructure is used to serve the ultimate
purpose of the organization – arises. Organizations do not necessarily develop systems – rather
they procure systems that are available in the market. Hence interaction-based studies cannot
shade light on the use of digital libraries as aimed in this study. At the same time, a count of
interactions ends the phenomenon there. There is no way to understand how such counts are
transformed into a higher level of use that can serve the organization goal.

In order to overcome the limitations of prevalent studies with respect to this research, the context
of DL use was considered for examination. The premise was that context is a major force that
contributes to DL use. In order to understand how a digital library is used, the reason for its use
(or non-use), one must consider the context of such use or non-use. Expanding on concepts from
Information Science and borrowing from Organizational Science, this research aimed to explore
how context contributes to DL use.

The following sections review the prevalent notion of digital-library use, the terminology
adopted in the study, and the rationale behind some of the decisions made in this study. The
research paradigm and theoretical constructs used to frame the study are highlighted. Finally, the
chapter introduces the research objective and the research questions formulated through the
lenses of the theoretical constructs used.

1.2

The notion of “use” as explored in this research

The last twenty-five years of the previous millennium revolutionized the information industry,
first by online information services and then by packing those online information services onto a
CD-ROM medium. Finally, the Internet brought several changes in rapid succession. As the
Internet was adopted as a medium of publication, a new business model – referred to as the
consortium model – came into the market. Libraries could band together to form consortia and
get a substantial discount on electronic resources in lieu of assured procurement of multiple
copies of a resource for all members.

Technology facilitated measuring the use of these resources. Use studies already have a long
history in the literature of Library and Information Science. In the beginning of the electronic
era, reading statistics were used to understand how researchers were moving from print to the
online environment (Tenopir et al., 2003). In the Internet and electronic-publication era,
COUNTER2 – a standardized measure of use – was introduced. COUNTER-compliant usage
data of an electronic resource, by an organization, can be captured mechanically from the IPbased3 log-in data at publisher’s server. Such IP-based usage data became very useful in several
ways, namely, understanding information behavior (Davis and Solla, 2003), as a tool at the hand
2

Launched in March 2002, COUNTER (Counting Online Usage of Networked Electronic Resources) is an international
initiative serving librarians, publishers and intermediaries by setting standards that facilitate the recording and reporting of online
usage statistics in a consistent, credible and compatible way. The first COUNTER Code of Practice, covering online journals and
databases, was published in 2003. COUNTER’s coverage was extended further with the launch of the Code of Practice for online
books and reference works in 2006. The body of COUNTER compliant usage statistics has steadily grown as more and more
vendors have adopted the COUNTER Codes of Practice. This has contributed to the new discipline of usage bibliometrics and a
great deal of work is underway to try to establish .value metrics. associated with usage, in which the COUNTER compliant
statistics play an increasingly important role (retrieved on March 6, 2014 from http://www.projectcounter.org/about.html)
IP address represents an organization’s computer address on global computer network. When registered with a publisher’s
server, the organization is recognized and authenticated by publisher’s server and users from that organization are allowed to
access the resources on the publisher’s server.

of a Collection Development librarian (Cox, 2007), a way to understand from where users are
accessing the resources (Coombs, 2005), to mention a few.

Scholars, acknowledging earlier research, have stressed the need for developing some other
dimensions of use. Usage statistics are limited to the number of times a resource is consulted and
they do not help in understanding how people make use of the information received out of such
consultations (Bishop, 1998). Borgman (2000) depicted digital libraries as our future libraries,
and hence it becomes incumbent upon us to understand why and when people use (or do not use)
digital libraries so we can then address the related issues. This understanding can be developed if
the connotation of “use” is extended beyond the “number of consultations”. As the needs of the
individuals who consult such resources arise from the situations in which they are embedded,
those embedding situations or contexts should be taken into account in this regard. This research
is an attempt to understand this context and how the context shapes the use of digital libraries. In
that process, the research brings a new dimension to the notion of the “use of digital libraries”.
This research is as much about “context” as it is about “digital-library use”.

1.3

Terminologies and their connotations as used in this research

The ambits of two major terms that are fundamental in this research are explained here. These
are: digital library and organizational and social context.

Digital library
Since the term digital library was coined in 1990s, it has been variously referred to denote
organizations, services and resources by different authors. Elsewhere the term is used to mean

5
one or a combination of institutional repositories, special collections, packages of electronic
journals and books and so on.

A digital library in this study is a service comprising various digital resources – developed
locally, procured through licensing, or available free of cost on the Internet – that are packaged
as a service and deployed within a specific organizational boundary, using various ICT
infrastructure, specifically distributed networks. This connotation was adopted from the works of
Elliott and Kling (1998), Covi (1996), and Covi and Kling (1999) and was open to include any
other genre of the Internet based digital resource that the informants of this research considered
as digital libraries.

A more detailed discussion on the connotations of digital libraries has been made in section 2.2.

Context: Organizational and social context
Context is another term that requires disambiguation. One basic assumption of this research was
that digital-library use can exhibit different patterns in different contexts; hence the boundary of
context must be predefined before observing the phenomenon of digital-library use. In this
research, the term organizational and social context was used to mean academic and research
organizations in India. There are two levels of context – one is the geographic level and another
is the organizational level. The importance of and the reasons for specifying the context in this
way are described below.

6
An organization is affected by the characteristics of its location. ICT use is a prerequisite for
digital-library use and may vary across time and space. This variance is a result of combination
of one or more factors such as the economic condition of a state, its geographical spread,
technological developments of the state, and the extent to which a technology is integrated into
the lives of the people in that state at any given point of time. Table-1, for example, provides a
glimpse of the number of the Internet users per 100 people in different countries over three
years4.

In a networked society (Castells, 2004) electronically processed information networks become
the center of key social structures and various activities. It is not only about electronic networks,
but also about the social networks of individuals who process and manage information and use
the micro-electronic based technologies. In that process, individuals and various forms of
organizations, such as firms, schools, and government departments, are connected with each
other. A networked society is not an absolute situation – almost every society strives to be even
more networked. Thus, one of the key differences between a more networked society and a less
networked society is that in the former a greater number of members are connected for a greater

7
number of purposes than those in the latter. Table-1 presented above gives some indication of
how differently networked are different states, resulting into variations in the spread of ICT
usage and the use of other ICT-dependent technologies. This table provides some indirect
justification of limiting the boundary of context in this study to a geographical level, which in the
case of this study is India. Justification for this choice is explained in section 1.4.

Organizational and social context is the next level of context. ICT may be used by various
segments within a geographical level. Such segments are users at home, researchers in a
laboratory, and managers within an organization, to name a few. The availability of ICTs, the
extent of their use and the purpose for use may vary for different segments. Thus, Internet uses
for leisure at home, for research work within an academic organization and for transactions in
financial sectors are not the same. This is the rationale for introducing the second level while
describing context. Organizational and social context is a generic term here. It encompasses
organizational aspect which arises from the organizational structure as well as the social aspect
arising with respect to the organization. For example, peers in a specific field such as scientists,
academicians, chemists belong to respective specific communities which become their social
context.

1.4

Rationale for choosing India as the geographical study site

Indian libraries leapfrogged from the print era to the age of digital libraries in the post-Internet
scenario. Because of high telecommunications as well as data costs, the majority of Indian
libraries could not afford the developments brought by a rapidly growing online information
industry services in the late 1980s and CDROM-based information products in the 1990s. The

8
level of library automation in the country was fairly low, and thus, people had hardly any
experience in using computerized information systems.

In the Internet era, the government made a very significant intervention in promoting access to
digital libraries by various academic and research organizations within the country. As the
country’s telecommunications facilities experienced spectacular development, scientific research
organizations embraced the new Internet technology and made it available for their scientists and
other employees. This gave people ample opportunities to learn how to search in a computerized
environment, especially using Google.

At the same time, publishers and aggregators started promoting the concept of consortium-based
subscription to electronic resources in different forums within the country. The first informal
library consortium arrangement was developed in 2000 by six Indian Institutes of Management
in the country5. Shortly after this, the government supported the formation of a centrally funded
consortium6 that started procuring electronic resources for its members. Within a few years,
more such government-sponsored consortia came into existence serving different segments of
the scientific, technological as well as academic research organizations7. All these events
together resulted in an abundance of electronic resources in academic and research organizations,
particularly those pertaining to scientific and technological research. Thus, from the early years
of this millennium, many Indian academic and research libraries became rich in electronic
information.

9
The government’s intervention expanded beyond procurement level. Most of the consortium
members were using, until a few years back, the Internet of bandwidth 10 MBPS. Through
another endeavor of the government – National Knowledge network (NKN)8 – most of the
academic and research organizations of the country are now allocated Internet facility of 100
MBPS bandwidth without any cost implication to them. Thus the government provided both the
resources and infrastructure to access those resources.

Shortly after the formation of the consortia and with a commitment to investing enormous funds
every year, the government started monitoring the performances of the beneficiary organizations.
Since then usage statistics, captured through IP authentication of the organizations and provided
by publishers/aggregators, have been considered as the only measure of the use of electronic
resources. The administrative decisions regarding continuation for funding various resources for
member organizations of the consortia have been greatly guided by such usage statistics.

The limitation of IP-based download data to explain actual use has already been mentioned.
Some other limitations were also observed by this researcher. During the analysis of the usage
data of a specific package across several organizations in India, these researchers found that
large numbers of article downloads were from a few journals; and this was the pattern across
several institutions. The reason for such skewed consultations can only be guessed at but cannot
be explained definitively. One can of course argue that it is already established that only twentyfive percent of a collection is used seventy-five percent of the time. Such observations, however,
were made in the all-print era. It is difficult to accept that in the current highly technology-

8

http://www.nkn.in/ retrieved on March 6, 2014

10
enabled era, when it is very easy to discover relevant information, the same principles of the
print era would hold as firmly.

Another anomaly regarding usage statistics was highlighted in a 2009 study9. This study showed
that in the UK, per-user downloads were 47 out of total downloads of 102 million, while for one
Indian organization, per-user downloads were 558 out of total downloads of 3.9 million. This
study also showed that for several science-related disciplines, the average citation count per
paper published by Stanford University faculty and students was 22.93, while the average
citation count per paper published by one Indian university was 4.52. This data does not require
any further explanation on the anomaly. These two examples may appear to be isolated cases,
but in this age of quantification, when count matters, it seems improbable that such anomalies
are not being noticed.

These anomalies created the diving board for this research. Such anomalies raise several
questions, such as, what does digital-library use mean? How is it possible to understand the use
(or non-use) of digital libraries? The researcher was convinced that more downloads do not mean
more use. The use of digital libraries ought to be understood in terms of the meanings that users
assign to these resources. This, in turn, may help in understanding how consultations of
electronic resources (and generating number of uses) are getting translated into the action by the
users. The meanings assigned to digital-library use are likely to vary depending on the situations
under which such uses take place. This underscores the importance of situation or context.

11
The question now arises is why India was chosen as the geographical context of this study.
Indian organizations were chosen for both theoretical and practical considerations. The
theoretical aspect is explained first. Without going into the details of economic and political
aspects which are beyond the purview of this research, it can be said that the country started
taking a different shape since the late 1980s. Organizations that were getting full economic
protection from the government were asked to increase the degree of their self-reliance. This was
particularly true for organizations pursuing research in science, technology and industry. The
government, however, provided infrastructural support in order to enable those organizations to
become competitive. The government’s initiatives to provide support in terms of Internet facility
and digital resources attest to this.

With all these facilities, an Indian research organization in all probability would appear the same
as or isomorphic to a research organization in any other country, such as the US. But an earlier
study revealed that the local and cultural contexts can differently shape the use of an ICT-based
tool (Walsham & Sahay, 1999). In the current emerging economic situation, the Indian context is
likely to hold both new and old features that may not be present in economically advanced
countries, thus making it a good candidate for study.

The practical consideration had several layers. The obvious reason for the choice was that
anomalies as mentioned above were noted for Indian organizations. This was further
strengthened by the fact that the researcher, being a working librarian in India for many years,
had an excellent understanding of the organizational culture in India, thus strengthening the
probability of being able to describe and understand the context of digital-library use. Being a

12
natural citizen, she would also have greater access to organizations in India. Thus if the study
were to be done in a country of emerging economy, India was the best choice.

1.5

Research paradigm and theoretical underpinnings of the study

The research was framed within the paradigm of social informatics and supported by two
theoretical constructs, namely the concepts of social actor and technology-in-practice. A
discussion on each of these is presented here. The relevance of the research paradigm and the
theoretical constructs are discussed along with research questions in the following section.

1.5.1 Rationale for the choice of research paradigm and constructs
This study adopted the research paradigm of social informatics and two theoretical constructs –
social actor and technology-in-practice. Several other theories have been frequently used in
research pertaining to the use of ICT or Information System in organizations. Two such
important theories are Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Technology Acceptance Model
(TAM). It is appropriate here to explain why the current research did not adopt DOI or TAM.
Brief descriptions of each of these two theories and a rationale for selecting alternate theoretical
constructs follow.

Diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 1983) explains how new things, new ideas disseminate
through social system over time. Innovation can be an idea or behavior that is new to an
organization (Swanson, 1994). DOI focuses on the process of diffusion. Researchers have

13
attempted to understand how this process is related to the characteristics and perceptions of
potential adopters (Moore & Benbaasat, 1991; Kappelman, 1995), under which conditions the
adoption or diffusion of an innovation would occur (Sanson-Fisher, 2004). Studies also looked
into the stages through which diffusion/adoption passes as well as into the nature of the process.
Those stages have been variously described by researchers as knowledge, persuasion, decision,
implementation, and confirmation (Rogers, 1983), compatibility, complexity, trialability,
observability and relative advantage (Sanson-Fisher, 2004), orderly or chaotic process (Van der
Ven, 1999), initiation, development, and implementation/termination and with a flow back and
forth within complex networks and relationships (Gosling, Westbrook & Braithwaite, 2003). In
relation to ICT, DOI was applied to study the diffusion process of knowledge management
system, health care system (Gosling, Westbrook & Braithwaite, 2003; Sanson-Fisher, 2004),
information systems (Kappelman, 1995; Mustonen-Ollila & Lyytinen, 2003).

TAM was originally proposed by Davis (1986) and is based on the Theory of Reasoned Action
(Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980). The model has two variables, namely, “Perceived Usefulness (PU)”
and “Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)”. The core of this theory is the belief structure of an
individual. The theory posits that individual’s acceptance of an information system is determined
by two belief factors; one is that job performance will be enhanced by the use of information
system and the other is that the use of information system will be free from effort (PEOU). Thus
TAM is an expression of intent and is an outcome of the belief structure of an individual, to use a
specific technology.

14
TAM has been tested on a variety of ICT tools – communication systems (email, cell phone),
general purpose systems (personal computer, workstations), office systems (word processors,
spreadsheets), and specialized business systems (case tools, telemedicine). Between 1986 and
2003, research using TAM yielded 26 external variables that influence PU and PEOU (Lee,
Kozar, & Larsen, 2003). TAM based research aimed to understand how intention to use a
specific ICT can be related to various factors.
The current research, did not intend to look into the process through which digital libraries has
become accepted as an ICT tool within an organization. In fact, by the time this research started,
digital library was no more a new phenomenon within organizations. Similarly, the study also
did not focus on the intention of individuals to use digital libraries. All intentions may not get
translated into actions. As found in an earlier research on public hygiene, 95% of the
interviewees expressed intention to follow a specific hygiene related activity while observation
confirmed that in real life only 67% people practiced it (Legris, Ingham & Collerette, 2003).
The study aimed to understand how digital libraries are being used by organizational members
in order to meet their organizational responsibilities, the meaning associated with such use, the
pattern of use and to reveal how these understandings are connected to the organizational
context. It is not only the use but also the situation under which actual use takes place is
important. The study required some model of action which could help observe the situated
action. Hence the study could neither fit within the framework of DOI (model of process) nor
within TAM (model of belief). The aim of the study also did not align with any framework
which can predict the economic benefit or performance improvement as a result of using digital
libraries (technology imperative).

15
On the other hand, social informatics as research paradigm and social actors and technology-inpractice as constructs provided the required frame for capturing the actual use of technology as
aimed in this research. Brief discussions on these follow.

1.5.2 Social informatics – the research paradigm
The field of social informatics addresses how organizational and social contexts shape the use of
ICT. The studies under this paradigm are interdisciplinary in nature and examine the design,
implementation, use, and consequence of information technologies that take into account their
interactions with institutional and cultural contexts (Kling, 1999). Sawyer and Eschenfelder
(2002) asserted that social informatics is the field of study which explores, explains and theorizes
the design, implementation and use of ICTs in a wide range of social and organization settings.
In order to describe what the field is about, the authors enumerated that this paradigm excludes
studies on information activities without technological reference, studies that address individual,
cognitive, or psychological processes involved in using technology, economic aspects of
technology and the technological imperatives that seek to understand the effects caused by
introducing technology in an organization. Consequently, this guideline was used by the
researcher to remain sensitized about the questions to be asked and issued to be examined in the
field.

16

1.5.3 Social actor – the institutional view of user
Social actor is one of the theoretical constructs used in this study. The concept of social actor
was proposed for industrial and business setups with respect to ICT use in those organizations.
An organization is surrounded by an institutional environment that shapes its interactions with
the environment and subsequent actions. Technologies are integral part of such interactions. A
social actor, as proposed by Lamb and Kling (2003), is an organizational member and is
pressured to perform legitimate actions and interactions within this institutional environment.
Such interactions are facilitated by the exchange of resources and information between members
of firms and institutions. As individuals, organizational members have little choice over the
technologies acquired by the organization. They are rewarded or sanctioned for the work they do.
ICT use in such work can be instrumental in being rewarded or being sanctioned.

Scientists as organizational members, conceptualized as social actors, are surrounded by an
institutional environment as context. The lens of social actor has been used to identify such
institutions and reveal how such institutional environments pressure scientists to use digital
libraries and to develop an analytical description of the context.

1.5.4 Technology-in-practice – structure of technology use
Technology-in-practice, proposed by Orlikowski (2000), is the other theoretical construct used in
this study. This construct is based on structuration theory proposed by Anthony Giddens
(Giddens, 1984). Structuration is a social process involving reciprocal interaction between
human and structural features of an organization. Within a social system, structure is manifested

17
through structural properties that consist of rules and resources mediating human action and is
re-affirmed by the actors. The core of the theory is the reflexivity of the human beings to
routinely observe, understand and continuously monitor the context.

This notion of structure was extended to the use of technology. Technology is an artifact with
material and cultural properties. Such properties transcend the experiences of individuals as well
as of particular settings. Such artifacts, however, do not appear the same to all people. Rules and
resources are built into a technology. When the rules and resources of a technology are mobilized
into use, a specific recurrent social practice of using the technology emerges. In that process, a
technology structures human action and it is possible to see that structure through those recurring
actions.

It is important to acknowledge what the use of a technology means. Orlikowski (2000, p425)
describes the use of a gun in a way that can help us understand use of technology:

. . . if our knowledge of a gun comes primarily from its use, then we cannot assume that a
gun “is a gun” without knowing how that object is being used. While guns are designed
and built for a particular purpose, and their possession has important implications for
social policy, gun possession is not sufficient grounds for presuming that a gun will be
used in a particular way. People can and do choose not to pull the trigger, and that
makes all the difference.

Thus technology-in-practice can help to reveal the structure of the use of a technology and the
associated reasons. This was the importance of the construct in this study.

18

1.6

The research questions

Conceptualizing digital libraries as network based, ICT-enabled information infrastructure, the
study was brought under the paradigm of social informatics and the overarching research
question was:

How is the practice of digital-library use by people in Indian academic and research
institutes being shaped by organizational and social contexts?

As mentioned earlier, bringing the study under the paradigm of social informatics helped to
frame further specific research questions and to remain sensitive on what to observe and what
phenomena to take cognizance of during data collection.

As mentioned earlier, context and more specifically organizational and social context is
important. An analytical view of context is generally missing in the literature and is very
important to reveal how context contributes to any phenomenon (Courtright, 2007). The first
research question was developed keeping this issue in the mind. However, there was an
additional dimension in the research question targeting the understanding of context. A brief
description of this dimension is discussed here and details will be found in Chapter-3 on
methodology.

Technology, specifically ICT, forms the backbone of a digital library. Thus any reference to
digital libraries also refers to the use of technology. As this research required close interactions10
10

Detail discussion is provided in Chapter-3

19
with study participants for dialog, there was a threat to the truthfulness of the data collected.
Such threats are there when qualitative studies are designed on technology use (Barry, 1995).
Frequent reference to a technology-driven facility, during ongoing dialog at the time of data
collection, could have pushed some participants to a stage where they would try to develop an
image of themselves, as frequent user of technology when in reality they were not. Moreover
such questioning about technology use might lead quite often to a description of what they do
with the technology, searching, downloading, for example, and not what led them to use it.

On the other hand, digital-library use is intricately related to information-gathering practices of
users. Hence it was felt prudent to develop an instrument which would focus on informationgathering practices initially. Such an instrument would thus minimize the risks mentioned in the
preceding paragraph. In the process of interviewing, the instrument would be further augmented
to indirectly unearth the concurrent use of digital libraries in those information gathering
activities. Thus foregrounding the issue of information-gathering practice in the research
question was found to be a better alternative than only asking about digital-library use per se.

The first research question was thus framed using the context and information-gathering practice
of organizational members. At this stage, the lens of social actor was helpful to develop two
specific questions. The notion of social actor is grounded upon the presence of institutions in the
environment of the organization to which a member belongs and the institutional pressure on the
members to act in a certain way or in a certain use of the technology. With the help of the lens of
social actor, it was possible to reveal which are the institutions present in the organizational
environment and how information-gathering practices meet such institutional pressure. This
approach was adopted to develop an analytical picture of the organizational and social context

20
and how information-gathering practice meets the needs arising from those institutions.
Accordingly, the following more specific research questions were framed:

RQ1# How do the social worlds of an organizational member influence and shape her/his
information-gathering practice?

RQ1(a)#

What are the various patterns of interactions in which people as social
actors, in Indian academic and research institutes, engage in meeting the
demands of their social world?

RQ1(b)#

How do information-gathering practices help those social actors meet the
institutional forces of those interactions?

In order to find answers to these two questions, this researcher examined different individuals
and organizations with which the study participants have to interact in the process of discharging
their organizational responsibilities. The institutional nature of such individuals/organizations
and nature of information demand created by them upon the study participants were to be
elicited. Subsequently, the researcher also examined how the study participants view their
information-gathering practices with respect to the interactions with such individuals and/or
organizations.

That organizational members are pressured to perform information gathering does not imply that
they will automatically use the entire DL, even if it is available. One can preferentially use one
or a few resources over others. Depending on situations, they may not use the DL at all. The use

21
or non-use, is not necessarily limited to the content or technological capability of the resource.
The lens of technology-in-practice helps to see that many such uses (and non-uses) can be
attributed to different organizational forces.

Two different forces can play a role here. One is the structural force that originates within an
organization. How structural forces outweigh the power of technology is described here. In
Orlikowski’s (2000) study, the system Notes was deployed equally for all groups of organization
members, but the consultants were not willing to learn it or use it for business reasons. Using
Notes, according to their view, would lead to non-chargeable hours or giving up some of their
personal time, which they were not willing to do. On the contrary, the group that was not
restricted by billable hours strived to learn and use it. In a study by Adams, Blandford, and Lunt
(2005), a group of organizational members could not use a DL because the deployment of the
DL reflected the organizational structure: people in upper hierarchy within an organization were
given more facilities to access those DLs. Thus, people who would draw such DLs into use were
either made dependent on people who were hierarchically above them or they were excluded, in
an indirect way, from availing themselves of the facility.

The other force originates outside the boundary of an organization and still shapes the use of
technology within an organization. Disciplinary norms, norms of the technical and/or
institutional environments within which an organization is situated belong to this category (Kling
& McKim, 2000; Walsham & Sahay, 1999; Covi & Kling, 1996; Lamb, King, & Kling, 2003).
In sum, how a DL is reckoned with as an organizational resource which can be recurrently used
in the information-gathering activities by the members of the organization is contingent upon

22
several intra- and extra-organizational forces. Thus another set of questions was framed using
technology-in-practice as a lens. Those are:

RQ#2: What are the various extra- and intra-organizational factors mediating the practice
of DL use (including non-use) by organizational members?

RQ#2(a):

What are the various emergent practices of the use of digital libraries, both
at the digital library level as a whole and at the feature level?

RQ#2(b):

How are such practices accounted for by different extra- and intraorganizational factors?

Answer to these questions necessitated the examination of the types and features of electronic
resources repeatedly used by organizational members. The exact resource was of no importance
here but the nature of resources and the pattern of use across the study participants were
important. Further, the research also probed into the factors which could be associated with such
pattern of use.

Finally, the findings from research questions RQ#1 and RQ#2 were integrated to draw a picture
of digital libraries use as shaped within the academic and research organizations in India.

organizational members?

1.7

Chapter summary

This chapter briefly describes the background of this research. This research was designed to
develop a description of context, in terms of its components, of a selected group of people,
namely scientists working in different organizations. To this end, the research examined the
followings:
(i)

various components of organizational environment with whom the study participants
had to interact in order to discharge their organizational responsibilities,

(ii)

the institutional nature of such components,

(iii)

information demand made by such components upon the study participants, and

24
(iv)

what information-gathering practice means on the face of such information demand.

Further, the research looked into the pattern of digital-library use in regards to informationgathering practice by those participants and the associated factors, both within and outside the
organization. In this process, the research attempted to understand what properties of digital
libraries are often visible to the scientists so that they use such properties more frequently and
what causes the visibility of such properties over others. Finally, the research concluded on
whether different organizational contexts can lead to different meanings for digital-library use
and use pattern.

Though the research was conducted within Indian academic and research organizations, the
study was not about any specific country or specific organization. In that sense, the study
explored digital-library use as a model for ICT enabled technology use. The study was about the
institutional environment and organizational environment surrounding the members of any
organization leading to their use of ICT-enabled tools. The fundamental assumption of the study
was that the use of a technology by people is shaped by the demands of institutional contexts and
structure within which they are embedded. So, the richer the institutional context, the more is the
use of the technology – a digital library in this case. The study also attempts to show how the
concepts of social actor and technology-in-practice, which were developed within the context of
industries in the USA, are perhaps more universal, and can be used to explore ICT-enabled
technologies within different organizational and social cultures anywhere.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1

Chapter introduction

The present study seeks to understand how digital library (DL) use by people in Indian academic
and research institutes is being shaped by organizational and social contexts. Questions include:
who the external entities are with whom members of such organizations interact, the institutional
nature of those entities, what kind of information demand is made by those institutional entities,
how information gathering by those members helps to meet those information demands, what are
the patterns of using digital libraries to meet those information demands, and organizational
aspects that contribute to such patterns of use.

This chapter discusses the background literature, the ambits and definitions of major concepts
used, and the theoretical constructs used in this study. The study stands at the intersection of two
strands of research – context-based information behavior studies and organizational sociology
based studies of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Relevant literatures from
both the strands are discussed with a view to explaining how the research questions of the study
were framed.

2.2

Digital library – its boundary in the present study

As mentioned in Section 1.3, the term digital library (DL) has been variously used since 1990s,
though attempt has been made by scholars to broadly categorize what the term implies from

26
different perspective. One of the earliest descriptions that stressed on the organizational aspect
came from the Digital Library Federation11 is:

Digital libraries are organizations that provide the resources, including the specialized
staff, to select, structure, offer intellectual access to, interpret, distribute, preserve the
integrity of, and ensure the persistence over time of collections of digital works so that
they are readily and economically available for use by a defined community or set of
communities.
Borgman (1999) categorized the discourse on digital libraries from research and practice
perspectives. Research-wise, digital libraries are of interest to primarily two disciplines, namely
computer science (CS) and library & information science (LIS). CS researchers consider DLs as
extensions and enhancements of information storage and retrieval systems manipulating digital
data that exist in distributed networks. Their concern is improving the technological efficiency of
DL. LIS researchers focus on content, organization, searching behavior, and publishing. DLs are
constructed, by and for a community; DLs are extensions, enhancements and integration of a
variety of information institutions as physical space; the information institutions include among
others – libraries, archives and other settings such as classrooms, offices, laboratories, homes and
public spaces.

The practice oriented definitions aim at current and anticipated practical challenges; for example,
how the changing nature of universities and the advent of digital collections are affecting the
evolution of libraries as institutions. Most librarians view DLs as part of the library institution
and as a natural transformation of that existing institution to address the new information
environment.

Many digital collections of resources such as NSDL12 or GEM13 are considered digital libraries.
Those are distributed collections of digital resources, not owned by any organization exclusively,
and are composed of resources that are available on the Internet. Digital institutional repositories
are also discussed within the discourses related to digital libraries. Some authors used this term
to imply a set of electronic or digital resources (erstwhile bibliographic databases and sets of full
text journals) that are acquired by an organization, mostly libraries, and are packaged as a service
using the Information and Communication Technology14 infrastructure of the organization. The
China Academic Digital Library (CADL) project includes such resources along with digitized
versions of books (Shen, et al., 2008). Electronic journal services are also considered DLs
(Monopoli et al., 2002).

Content, service, organizations and, most important, specific user communities are referred to in
different definitions of digital libraries (Levy & Marshall, 1995; Lucier, 1995; Zhao & Ramsden,
1995; Marshall,et. al. 1994). A somewhat broader definition includes a sense of an organized
collection, content being either in electronic or in a mix of electronic and physical media,
contents in different formats including some full-text materials, and a specific community for
whom the specific DL is built (Bishop & Star, 1996). Elsewhere, DLs are considered as hybrid
libraries containing digital documents and pointers to non-digital documents – the pointers may
be metadata embedded in the catalog of any library. Given the fact that a large part of the
world’s collections are still beyond digitization, and we do not know whether it will ever be
possible to bring such vast resources under complete digitization, a digital library will be more

13

28
meaningful if it provides digital contents and digital records of non-digital contents (Borgman,
2000, p 76).

The above trend of referring to various collections, services as digital libraries still continue.
Following are some examples from very recent literature. Digital library was considered as an
integration of research resources which include online databases, electronic bulletin boards, local
databases (Chang, et.al, 2009), a digitized native collection of rare books, ancient books
manuscripts, pictures, photographs, audio-visual materials with a view to providing specialized
services (Yao & Zhao, 2009), a web portal that provides consolidated digital access to materials
from individual libraries (Dalbello, 2008) or a National Digital Library program that provides
free access to several full text databases, many peer reviewed online journals and e-books to
public and private sector universities and non-profitable research and development organizations
(Warraich & Ameen, 2010). Data repositories, institutional repositories have also been referred
to by this term. Conferences like JCDL admit papers in which collections of data sets are meant
as digital libraries.

There is another view of digital libraries which can be labeled as users’ view. Kling and Lamb
(1996) suggested that the terms digital library and electronic library conjure up, in the users’
mind, the images of the networked collections of resources in electronic formats and it is difficult
to distinguish between them. Covi (1999, p293) noted that:

The term `digital libraries' refers to a variety of electronic resources and services including
the world-wide web, shared databases and bibliographic systems. However, it is difficult to
examine the use of any one electronic collection for knowledge work because `digital
library' materials are linked in ways that often blur the boundaries between different

29
collections. It is impossible to determine simply from access logs how a subset of users in a
particular discipline uses them.
Various authors have adopted this view of digital libraries – an information system made up of a
combination of a variety of sources such as OPACs, electronic journals (Elliott & Kling,1998;
Covi, 1996; Covi, 1999); and electronic databases, procured from commercial vendors and
deployed within an organization boundary (Adams & Blandford, 2004).

The scope of the term digital library in the current study has been aligned with this last strand of
definition. A digital library, in this research encompasses a set of digital resources: resources
created locally, such as an OPAC, institutional repositories; resources procured commercially; or
resources that are collected from the Web. All these resources are packaged as a service within
an organization using several other ICTs.

2.3

Organizational context in information behavior research

Context has been an important construct in the area of information seeking and human
information behavior. Contrary to earlier studies in this area, which gave importance to
individual users and ignored factors external to information seekers, there have been calls for
understanding the context (Courtright, 2007; Dervin, 1997, Johnson, 2003). There has been a
growing realization that the context has a complex relationship with information-related
activities. The context should include actual work settings as well as the institution that acquires
and deploys technologies, and in which people for whom such technologies are acquired have
little say. The need for methodological change, preferring field studies over experimental or
quasi-experimental methods was also stressed (Borgman, 2000; p 1-15).

30

This study focused on organizational context of the members of an organization who use digital
libraries. Context, in this study, was not limited to a selected number of factors labeled a-priori
by the researcher in order to observe the influences of those factors on digital-library use.
Context was what people experience while interacting with their social world. They may not be
able to label that experience as context but they can certainly experience the forces at play in all
of their interactions with the social world and try to reciprocate those forces by some taken-forgranted actions. This research looked into those taken-for-granted actions that is consulting
digital libraries, by people in academic and research organizations and followed the trail to find
the link between the digital-library use and the environment of those people. Then, context was
depicted analytically by the researcher employing inductive analysis of the experiences as
narrated by the informants.

Reference to organization can be found in the literature predominantly when information
practices of groups have been discussed. Another type of reference of organization is found
when information use environment within an organization has been examined. However, in both
cases, earlier researchers focused within the organization. This section shows how context, in
information behavior research, was treated in terms of groups and information use environments,
both within the boundary of an organization and limitations of such treatment.

Subsequently, the discussion builds on the notion of open natural view of organizations and the
usefulness of this view in treating interactions with various institutional entities residing outside
the boundary of an organization, as context. It is then highlighted how this view of organization

31
leads to the construct social actor. The section ends with framing research questions through the
lens of social actor.

The rest of this section is devoted to:


how organizational context is treated with reference to groups and their information
practices;



information use environments with reference to organizations;



formation of an open natural view of organization;



how interactions in an open natural view of organization act as context of information
practices;



how information practices of users as social actors are shaped by interactions in an open
natural view of organization;

2.3.1 Organizational context in terms of groups in information behavior
studies
Organization has been referred to quite often in the studies of information practices of groups.
Out of four different categories of information users, namely professionals, entrepreneurs,
special interest groups and special socioeconomic groups, as identified by Taylor (1991),
professionals were mostly identified within an organization. Those professionals were engineers,
lawyers, scientists, teachers, managers, physicians. Nearly all empirical studies collected data for
groups which were located within an organization.

32
Information practices of professional groups (engineers, lawyers, and journalists), disciplinary
groups (physicists, chemists), and functional groups (managers, administrators) were studied
within the boundary of some organizations which were workplaces of those respective groups.
Studies based on such groupings are quite extensive in the LIS literature. These studies
enumerate the types of information required by different groups, and their preferences for
different information resources.

Though organizations were referred to as the sites for the data collection, data regarding
information practices were collected with reference to the immediate tasks at hand, in the studies
of various groups. In a newspaper house, for journalists (Attfield & Dowell, 2003), news and
feature research writing were such tasks. Activity and constraint-based accounts of such tasks
describe goals and activities associated with generating an information product. The product
constraints as well as resource constraints in terms of affordance and limitations of available
resources are also important to the tasks at hand. These constraints described the context for the
work task and gave a clue to what that work is (Attfield &Dowell, 2003). In a large university,
the information practices of professional and managerial staff were prompted by daily
managerial/professional routines or crises (short term) and those that arose from longer-term
planning situations or special projects (Wilkins & Leckie, 1997). In a museum, the tasks of art
administrators are various decision-making processes (Zach, 2006).

Within an organization, engineers as a professional group have been studied extensively, in order
to understand their information practices. Fidel and Green (2004) studied the perceptions of
engineers about access to resources. There was, however, no explicit link between such
perceptions and the tasks at the hands of those engineers. With respect to aerospace

33
establishments, the relation between degree of task uncertainty as faced and choice of
information carrier by research engineers and scientists were studied (Anderson et al. 2001).

A discipline was also considered as context in various studies. Notable among those studies were
chemists (Davis, 2004), academics from various disciplines such as astronomy, chemistry,
mathematics and physics (Brown, 1999), engineers and scientists in different disciplines (Ellis &
Haugan, 1997), academics from computer science, business management and English studies
(Gardiner, McMenemy & Chowdhury, 2006).

The studies mentioned above, mostly focused on the various types of information resources used.
Some of those studies highlighted the channels of information, namely oral, print, electronic and
personal communication used. Within a specific group, an individual’s relation with an ongoing
project could also be related to the information-seeking intensities (Ellis & Haugan, 1997). These
researchers found that intensive use of information sources take place in the beginning of a
project, and on a smaller scale at the end of the project. There were associations between task
levels, role, and the types of information that are required by special groups such as engineers
(Kwasitsu, 2003).

In the study of nurses’ information practice, it was highlighted how profession and workplace as
contexts can create some tension in the information practices of nurses (Sundin, 2002). While
professional leaders, researchers of the profession put stress on abstract knowledge, the
workplace identity of a nurse forces her to experience a different information practice.

Despite their merits, these studies have several limitations as below:

34

(i)

context was referred to in those studies from a very micro-perspective, in terms of
situations or tasks such as the project initiation stage for research engineers or the
decision making process by administrators;

(ii)

the analytical presentation of context is almost nil; context, particularly the
organization was used more as a background only; and

(iii)

these studies assumed naturalization of member of such groups implying the stable
characteristics of groups (Van House, 2004).

In sum, various groups and their settings within an organizational setup have been treated as
contexts of information activities, in the literature. Mostly those contexts, though, do not have
enough analytical features to help establish the dimensions or characteristics of these contexts
that may be associated with information-gathering activities of people within them.

2.3.2 Information use environment as organizational context
The importance of the organizational context is also acknowledged in the Information Use
Environment or IUE as proposed by Taylor (1991). IUE bounds organizational context in terms
of predictable work settings in which professional groups such as physicians and engineers
function. Four dimensions of the IUE that affect the flow and use of information messages and
determine the criteria for judging the value of information messages are:



a set of people in terms of their social identities, demographic and non-demographic
characteristics;



conceptualization of the problems that spark information practices;

35


organizational and infrastructural attributes which facilitate or limit the action of
information practice; and



the nature of problem solutions that are sought or accepted.

The limitation of this model is in its level of analysis. If the context is to be considered as
shaping the information behavior of a group of people within an organizational boundary,
context should be considered separately from and external to people, and treated as an
independent variable. Thus organizational settings and the nature of problems, the people within
that setting, and the problem resolutions that are accepted by those people are three different
levels of analysis. As well, the nature of problem resolution can be considered a specific
situation within a context and is an outcome variable. Instead of treating those three levels
separately, those are merged in IUE.

Rosenbaum (1993) elaborates upon the IUE and asserts that: “contexts” are settings within which
the mundane information practices of people occur. Context is the social world and social
interaction is thus an important underlying concept of the IUE. Rosenbaum also gave
prominence to the setting. Setting, according to him, is an organization which establishes goals,
style, rewards and penalties, and access channels for information use and validation. Rosenbaum
thus identified a contradiction in the IUE. The contradiction lies in acknowledging users as an
intelligent actor and at the same time assigning supremacy to the IUE. Rosenbaum proposed to
reconcile the contradiction with the help of Gidden’s structuration theory. He suggested that the
IUE is part of the organizational structure and not the one which contains the user as one of the
dimensions. He further posited that the IUE has virtual rules and resources which are instantiated

36
in action by the users (Rosenbaum, 1993), and the rules and resources of different types within
an organizational structure (Rosenbaum, 1996).

It is important to note that literature discussed in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 considered only internal
view of an organizations. Studies in section 2.3.1, had a reference to organization; yet there was
hardly any operationalization of the relation between the information practices of various groups
and the organization. However, Rosenbaum (1993), while advancing the concept of context in
terms of Information Use Environment, stressed some important factors of organization, namely
interactions, goal, reward, penalties. But any elaboration on a direct link between these aspects
and information behavior of organizational members was absent.

2.3.3 System views of organizations and organizational context
The point of departure in studies discussed in the previous sections was the individuals, and
further, those studies directed to contexts surrounding those individuals but only within the
physical boundary of an organization. However, there are different views of organizations and
depending on the view adopted; the picture of organizational context emerges differently.
Additionally, certain practice settles within an organization through the process of
institutionalization. This section discusses various views of organization and the role of
institutionalization in order to facilitate the understanding of the relation between various
organizational views and information practices.

Notion of organization was expanded and mapped along of the two dimensions as below (Scott,
1992):

37


Rational/natural view of organization



Closed/open view of organization

According to rational system, organizational behavior is purposeful and organizations move
towards defined goals with formalized processes. Elements such as costs, coordination
efficiency, performance measures that constrain actions of an organization are often focus of this
system model. The natural system model views organizations as organisms that struggle to
survive. Organizational participants in the natural system model develop informal arrangements
with their other elements to shape goals that contribute to their values and their existence. An
organization can be viewed as a combination of a rational/natural and a closed/open system.

In a closed system, all key influences on organizational behavior can be located within an
organization. In an open system, some key influences on organizational behavior are located
outside the organization. Those influences are the result of relationships with clients, suppliers,
other institutions, such as schools, regulatory bodies, and professional associations.

The characteristics of these four views of organizational behavior are summarized in Table-3.
The open natural system perspective underscores the interchange with the environment, thus
making this interchange a factor affecting the viability of the system.

38
Institutionalization is the process by which an organization develops a distinctive character
structure - a set of norms and routines, a way of doing things. Such practice may develop within
one particular organization, or it may become standardized throughout an industry (Scott, 1992,
p33). New Institutionalism is a cognitive approach to organizational behavior. It posits that many
choices of organizational actors are governed by highly routinized habits, scripts, rote actions,
and imitation of elites; these routinized actions are conditioned and reinforced by centralized
institutions (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991). Institutions form an important social force that shapes
behavior and also gives legitimacy to that behavior. This new institutionalism view was found to
have more explanatory power of organizational actions when the notion of environment is
extended beyond the boundaries of organizations. Such extended organizational environment
focus at the ‘functional organizational field level’15 (DiMaggio and Powell, 1991a; Powell and
Brantley, 1992; Powell et al, 1996.).

According to Scott (1987), organizations are embedded into a technical environment that can be
described succinctly as shown in Figure-1. Within a technical environment, organizations are
rewarded for effective and efficient control of their production systems. On the other hand, in
order to maintain legitimacy and receive support, those organizations are to conform to a set of
rules and requirements of the institutional environment within which they are situated.
Regulatory agencies, professional or trade associations, and general belief systems contribute to
those institutional requirements. To a varying degree, all organizations are subjected to both
these two environments, namely technical and institutional environments (Lamb, King, & Kling,
2003).
15

An organizational field is defined as: "those organizations that, in the aggregate, constitute a recognized area of institutional
life: key suppliers, resource and product consumers, regulatory agencies, and other organizations that produce similar services or
products." (DiMaggio and Powell. 1983.) Functional organizational fields are industries, broadly construed— i.e., organizational
systems that are isolated for analysis based on functional rather than geographic criteria. (Scott. 1987: p124.)

In sum, there is a direct relation between human activities within an organization, and the
environment surrounding the organization.

2.3.4 Interaction - an open natural view of organizational context
The concepts of open natural systems and institutionalized organizations have formed the basis
of several studies on organizational context. The characteristics of those studies are:

(i)

the environment of an organization in those studies extends beyond its boundary;

(ii)

interactions by the organizational members with various institutional forces in such an
environment are considered; and

(iii)

such interactions were legitimized through the exchange of information;

40
Some of those studies, relevant to the current research are discussed here.

From the open system perspective, context becomes more holistic as the focus moves from
within the organization to outside the organization. Within the organization, at the individual
level, context can focus on the task or technology at hand. At the next level, the context may be
the task structure and coordination of the task, but is still within the boundary of the
organization. This has been labeled as socially thin interaction. At the third level which is labeled
as socially rich interaction, the focus of the studies moves away from the group and looks at the
multivalent and complex relationships in the organizational settings (Lamb & Kling, 2002).
Table-4 presents a summary of these interactions.

To differentiate between socially thin interaction and socially rich interaction, the authors
associated the first with inside-the-firm interactions and the second with inter-firm interaction.
In a socially rich interaction, ICT or ICT information products are used by the members of an
organization who remain aware of inter-organizational contexts. The members also remain aware
that the role and power relationships in such contexts differ and this difference leads to the
difference of the perception about the appropriate use of technology (Lamb & Kling, 2002). This
socially rich interaction is built on an open system model of organization as proposed by Scot
(1987).

41

From the perspective of open natural systems, the technical and institutional environments of an
organization form the social world of the members of an organization. The activities of the
organizational members may be viewed as interactions with such social world. As social
interactions take place within a social world, and social worlds have their own norms, such
interactions of organizational members are bound to be influenced by various institutions of that
social world. Those institutional influences are taken for granted because they are so ingrained in
practice that it is difficult to see them separately. By making those institutional influences
explicit, it is possible to take into account the contextual factors which can explain an
organizational information behavior and thus operationalize organizational context.

That extra-organizational social pressures or social norms can directly contribute to the types of
resources used, and the way specific resources are used, has been recognized by Audunson
(1999). Audunson (1999), using the case of the judiciary, discussed how various issues such as
reducing uncertainty, preference to certain sources, preference to a channel for communication
can all be shaped by different norms of different areas of jurisprudence.

In the domain of information and communication technologies, earlier studies examined how
social aspects of computerization transcend the technological particulars of specific technologies
by focusing on human activities (Kling, 1980; Markus & Keil, 1994; Walsham, 1993). This was
further advanced in studies related to digital-library use. It was argued that effective digitallibrary use takes place when its users can readily integrate DLs into socially legitimate ways of
working and that this way of working takes shape out of various norms in the environment
(Covi, 1999; Covi & Kling, 1996). These studies showed that with an open natural view of

42
organization, it is possible to provide a more holistic account of organizational information
behavior surrounding digital libraries, particularly the followings:



to give an account of differential use of digital libraries across different communities;



to show how complex activities such as work habits, patterns of legitimation in a social
group, and organizational politics shape DL use;



to provide more enduring explanations of DL use than those based on changing
technology.

Some of the findings of the studies mentioned above, which are pertinent to current research are
highlighted here:

How work habits, legitimization process and organizational politics shape DL use: Disciplinespecific work culture of molecular biologists strongly influences their DL use. The culture of this
discipline values for new ideas. There is strong competition for getting credit for findings and
verifying that the findings are original. Peer review through the invisible college16 (Price, 1963;
Crane, 1972) provides a key mechanism for authors to receive suggestions from the invisible
college about new materials or standards for judgment. This helps in getting new ideas
published. In this discipline, faculty researchers' raises, tenure, and promotions are usually
dependent upon publication. There are also high stakes in terms of obtaining competitive
funding. All these cultural aspects create a sense of urgency in terms of creating, finding
information in a timely manner and hence utilizing DLs.

16

An invisible college is defined as a geographically distributed set of colleagues in a particular research specialty who are the
peers that judge and legitimate research contribution.

43
Differential use of digital libraries across different communities: The differences in culture and
characteristics create differences in the use of DL – the type of resources that are used and the
mode of communication – across disciplines. Molecular biologists depend on gene sequencing
information and photographs. Hence they give as much importance to gene databases and photos
as on published literature. Those scientists predominantly use the database MEDLINE. As
mentioned, there is a strong culture of competition for getting credit in the discipline. This
culture reinforces the use of electronic communication system and also to make a balance
between competition and collaboration. Computer scientists depend more on established
scholarly communication outlets and those outlets which publish materials relevant to current
research that they are involved with. Scientists in this domain also keep track of specific authors
for possible collaboration and try to develop a link while meeting in conferences. At the time of
contributing to the discipline, they value timeliness over the possible risk of duplication.
Sociologists are required to know more about unfamiliar area or a previously known area and
they collect information from respective disciplinary literature. Researchers in the area of literary
theory give importance to keeping up with current discourse, rather than new ideas. Scholars in
literary theory, attempt to develop their own working collection which they consult. At the time
of contributing to the discipline, scholars in literary theory value thorough and crafted
arguments, accommodating difference in textual forms, over timeliness. Literary theorists prefer
book publication and value the slower communication speeds of print to allow more time to
produce acceptable work. There is a concern that what constitutes good work would change if
everyone circulates her/his work via E-mail (Covi & Kling, 1996).

44
There are examples of how regulatory agencies in the institutional environment directly play a
role in the information practices in industries. For example, a biotech company in the U.S. before
selling its products must obtain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is an
example of a relation as well as interaction between an organization and a regulatory agency. In
the process of interaction in that relation, which is securing the approval, the new drug
application must include, among other information, citations to what has been published about
the drug, its compounds, and its medical application (Lamb, King, & Kling, 2003). This
relational requirement leads to extensive information gathering and a link is thus made explicit
between the institutional influences in the environment of an organization and the related
information-gathering practices within the organization.

The information-richness and interaction-richness nature of the environment coupled with the
availability of technologies such as mobile technology was used to understand information
activities for a particular population such as the police, for instance. Both extra-organizational
and intra-organizational forces were found to shape the information activities. As well, in order
to gain recognition, people in those environments engage in more information activities (Allen &
Shoard, 2005).

The use of electronic media for scientific communication is another area which was found to
take shape differently for different disciplines, due to different institutional norms. The
organization of work and the access to resources to conduct research are influenced by the
conventions about legitimate forms of scholarly communication. Communication conventions, in
this "institutional view" are embedded in ways of organizing work that differ between fields and
that may change slowly (Kling & Iacono, 1989). The notion of “legitimacy,” borrowed from

45
New Institutionalism, was used in the study of the development of electronic media to support
scholarly communication system which was embedded in work organizations. Authors further
used the concept of social shaping of technology, which focuses on the ongoing dynamics that
takes place between a technology and a community as the technology is developed, used, shaped,
reconfigured, and reconstituted within the community. Kling and McKim (2000) also noted the
influences of disciplinary differences in terms of extra-organizational institutional norms
resulting into differential use of electronic media for scientific communication. Among the
factors that contribute to such extra-organizational disciplinary differences, the culture of
competition for credit for work performed has already been mentioned. Some other factors are:
selection of target audience for research, access to resources including data, speed of work and
result sharing, and allocation of professional status.

Studies of the genre as discussed above are clearly different from those mentioned earlier. For
example, Gardiner, McMenemy and Chowdhury (2006) reported differential use of print and
electronic resources, and a different perception about access and use of digital resources across
three disciplines. But such studies were limited to the observation of such differences and did not
have enough power to make any analytical description of the discipline as the context leading to
such differences.

The core point that emerges from above discussions is when organizational members are viewed
as part of an open natural system a holistic picture of context of the behaviors of those members
develops. This is because of interactions with external entities located in the organizational
environment more clearly articulate the context than group. By contrast the group-as-context
approach puts people in a passive role, thus making the dimensions of the context less visible.

46
The conventional notion of group becomes fuzzy in real work settings: for example, a physics
faculty member is both a physicist and an academic. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of
many fields also adds to that fuzziness. For example, in an organization, where members are
pursuing research on building technology, the members come from various disciplines such as
construction science, physics, chemistry, and so on. Though they contribute to their own area of
specialization, they primarily work under the mandate of the organization. Moreover, they often
cross the boundary of their own discipline and enter other areas if demanded by the job. The
strict definition of boundary does not hold in such cases. Interaction as context emphasizes an
active role of people who want to meet the demands of various social worlds in which they
participate. Interactions that take place between an organizational member and any other entity
are more clearly bounded. As those interactions are always situated in real-life experiences, it is
possible to understand, from such interactions, who are the others participating in an interaction,
their relations with the organizational member, and thus the institutional force that can play in
that interaction. Interactions make the information gathering a part of an open system and
depending on whom an organizational member is interacting; the institutional forces surrounding
the interaction can be located within or outside the organization. This can be visualized in
Figure-2.

2.3.5 Social actor – a lens to view organizational context
Social actor (Lamb & Kling, 2003) was one of the two theoretical constructs that are used to
frame this research. This construct is based on the open-natural system view, institutionalized
organization, and socially rich interaction, as discussed in earlier sections. A social actor is an
organizational member, whose individual autonomy, agency, and behaviors are shaped by social
norms, institutional forces, and the social and physical structures that surround her/him. This
view gives primacy to the interactions between organizational members and
individuals/institutions outside their workplace. In those interactions the use of ICT to gather and
package information becomes an essential component because either those external
individual/institution request for information or organizational members are required to persuade
them with information. Social actors are also connected to the global network society, describing
a rich environment within which we can view social interactions (Castells, 1996). Lamb and
Kling (2003) underscored the importance of the perception about the role of external
organizations/individuals (variously constituted others) by organizational members to form the
basis of social institutions and identities (Goffman, 1959) and the importance of ICT to shape

48
identity and institutions. ICT related changes are not agent-directed; agency is channeled through
a complex, multi-level system of networks and organizational affiliations that constitute local
and global environments. Also, these social actors decline to be identified as users of a specific
technology. They gain recognition for the work they do and not for using a technology (Lamb &
Kling, 2002).

Exchange of information is the important function for social actors. Information exchange as
part of organizational behavior in inter-organizational relationships was highlighted by several
authors (Blau, 1964; Hall et al., 1976; Alexander. 1995). The earlier example of information
exchange between biotech companies in the U.S. and the regulatory agency in order to secure
approval also illustrates this (Lamb, King, & Kling, 2003). This relational requirement accounts
for why in some cases, information gathering does not scale up to the expectation. The smaller
the institutional pressures in an interaction, the smaller may be the intensity of informationgathering practice (Lamb & Kling, 2003). One important point to note here is that in the
literature, only formal exchange of information through reports was stressed. In the current
research, as we will find later, information exchange that takes place informally is also taken into
account.

Lamb & Kling (2003) conceptualized social actor in four dimensions. Those dimensions are
affiliations, environments, interactions, and identities. Organizational members as social actors
develop affiliations through organizational and professional relationships. Environments can be
construed as stabilized, regulated, and/or institutionalized practices that circumscribe the
organizational actions. Interaction is the process of mobilizing information, resources, and
exchanges that takes place when the actors engage with the affiliated individuals/organizations.

49
Identities are the avowed presentations of the self and the collective entities. Social actors at the
individual level routinely use ICTs, information products in their inter-organizational and
interpersonal interactions. These technologies shape who they are as organizational
representatives and what they can do in terms of exchange. These are important aspects of their
interactions with other actors (speed, complexity) and influence the perceptions of other actors,
the nature of reciprocal engagements, and the social actors’ perceptions about themselves.

From the above discussion using the literature, following points emerged:



Institutional environments of an organization place an organizational member within a
network of relationships;



Information exchanges by those organizational members take place in response to the
demand of various entities in such institutional environment.



Those information exchanges can be viewed as one or more of (i) compliance to
regulatory agencies (ii) attempt to survive the competitive world (iii) display of
competency (iv) adjustment to an already established process of sharing information load.

Hence, looking at the organizational members through the lens of social actor, it is possible to
unearth the institutional environment of those members and understand what digital-library use
means to them.

2.3.6 Organizational context shaped through social actor in current research
This study is framed using the open natural view of organizations and conceptualizing
organizational members as social actors who engage in information-gathering practices using
digital libraries. The construct of social actor, which was first conceptualized in industrial
setting, has been extended to academic and research organizations selected as cases for the
present study. As the notion of social actor was developed by Lamb and Kling (2003) within
industry/business environment, a question arises as to the suitability of that concept in academic
and research organizations. Heavily laden with the language of organization science such as
inside-the-firm interaction, inter-firm interaction, their discourse initially suggests that such a
construct is suitable only when business transactions take place.

The organizations selected for this research are neither industries nor academic organizations
such as universities. It is not clear what kind of technical and institutional environment surrounds
academic and research organizations as there is no mention of this type of organization in the
work of Scott (1987). But these organizations are certainly in the business of knowledge. Alavi,
Yoo and Vogel (1997) stressed that universities are in the business of knowledge creation and
sharing, they have an organization-like structure, and hence conceptualizing IT-enabled
collaboration in the partnership of knowledge sharing business is applicable for the universities.
This logic can also be extended to the organizations under study. Knowledge generation is a
major task of both the organizations selected for this research.

Using the lens of social actor, the first specific research question (RQ#1) was framed to explore
what constitutes organizational context in terms of institutional entities with whom members of

51
organizations selected for the study are required to interact. It is recognized here that one
organizational member can have multiple roles and each role may lead to different organizational
environments. In this study, instead of imposing categories in a top-down approach, the social
worlds of the organizational members are revealed inductively by allowing them to speak about
themselves. Further, the study looked into the types of information demands made by such
institutional entities on those members and how those members view their information-gathering
practices in response to such information demands. The research questions were framed as:

RQ1# How do the social worlds of an organizational member influence and shape her/his
information-gathering practice?

RQ1(a)#

What are the various patterns of interactions in which people as social
actors, in Indian academic and research institutes, engage in meeting the
demands of their social world?

RQ1(b)#

How do information-gathering practices help those social actors meet the
institutional forces of those interactions?

2.4

The organizational context of technology use

In previous sections, the emphasis was on organizational context in terms of interactions between
organizational members and various institutions in the external environment. ICT as a
technology adds a new dimension to organizational behavior. Digital libraries are conceptualized
in this study as an ICT-enabled tool. Hence, it is necessary to examine how the use of a

52
technology is shaped by contextual factors. This section provides an account of technology use
and its context, discusses the theoretical construct used in this study and finally presents the
research questions framed within this theoretical construct.

The study, framed within the paradigm of social informatics, aimed to explore what can possibly
contribute to the way ICT-enabled tools, digital libraries in this case, are used within
organizations. The study did not attempt to assess the technological or economic impact on
digital-library use because such studies on impact analysis cannot possibly reveal the meaning
attached to digital-library use by the participants, which is the objective of this research. Given
this, social informatics was found to be the right paradigm for this research. According to
Sawyer and Eschenfelder (2002, p430), research under this paradigm is:

…..set within the context of social milieu such as work groups, communities, cultural units,
societies, and/or organizations, in which use of ICTs is increasingly important and pervasive.
This orientation toward context helps to distinguish social informatics from other
information science work that focuses on individual behaviors and/or draws on theories
rooted in, for example, economics, computer science, or psychology
Adopting this paradigm helped to steer the observation of this research in a way that it could
keep issues such as technological imperative, economic impact, and so on out of scope. The
following sections explain how this is so.

2.4.1 Social informatics – a paradigm support
In one of the earliest reviews published on the social informatics of digital libraries, Bishop and
Star (1996) described this area as the study of social influences, processes, practices and effects
related to how knowledge is structured and communicated in digital libraries. In this regard,

53
various document genres and metadata for organization of knowledge within digital libraries
were considered important. Communities share their ideas about various document genres for
communication. The digital environment offers scope to change such shared notion of
documents and increase the scope for the mutability and integrity of various types of documents
while structuring knowledge in digital libraries. The creation of document surrogates in digital
libraries, with the help of metadata, are affected by types of artifacts, as well as by institutions
and the legal framework of knowledge production, conservation and consumption practices. One
example is the online catalog, which, contrary to earlier days, now provides access to indexing
and abstracting databases and online resources with full text contents. With regards to digitallibrary use, both infrastructure and content can contribute to the use of digital libraries. Some of
the issues regarding usability factors are convenient access to technology, useful content, degree
of systematic use of computers in daily work life, availability of training and support to the end
users (Bishop & Star, 1996).

A more inclusive definition and description of social informatics came later. This new definition
considered social informatics as the interdisciplinary study of the design, use and consequences
of information technologies (ICT) that takes into account their interactions with institutional and
cultural contexts in which these ICTs exist (Kling, 1999). The issues of research in this area are:
the impacts of social and organizational settings on design, implementation, and the uses of ICT;
the intended and unintended social and organizational consequences of ICT-enabled changes and
change efforts.

As mentioned in the beginning of this section, the main thrust of social informatics is the context
of ICT – work groups, communities, cultural units, societies, formal organizations in which the

54
use of ICT is increasingly pervasive and not on economic or technological impact analysis.
Vexing issues that people face when they work and live with ICT are studied within the
framework of this paradigm. Such studies explicitly recognize the role of ICTs in the information
world of the people. Studies of following perspectives are out of the scope of this paradigm:



System development perspective – studies that employ the psychological process of using
ICT tools or performance measure to ascertain the efficiency of a given system;



Economic perspective – studies that aim to measure the economic impact of ICT
adoption;

Social informatics also excludes the studies of the effects of pre-defined external variables on
ICT use. Rather, it aims to explore and identify the contextual factors which contribute to the use
or non-use of ICT (Sawyer & Eschenfelder, 2002).

The important feature of this paradigm is its critical orientation that advocates examination of
possible failures or unintended consequences of ICTs. These include, for example, studies of the
failure of an expert system to completely automate the task of coding documents because the
rule-based expert system failed to capture the actual complex process of judgment (Suchman,
1996), the improper use of passwords (Adams & Sasse, 1999), or unexpected use of a listserv to
evaluate other members where the initial objective was to share information among members
(Eschenfelder, Heckman, Sawyer, 1998).

55

2.4.2 ICT use within the paradigm of social informatics
Studies under the paradigm of social informatics examine various factors both outside and within
the organization surrounding the uses of various ICT based tools. Factors/entities outside the
organization are system developers, vendors, and publishers whose ways of developing a system
can shape the use of technology. Within an organization, in-house system staff, library
leadership, and trainers can also influence and shape the use of the technology. Social
informatics covers both creation and use of ICT-based tools. As the current study is concerned
with the use of digital libraries, the scope of the discussion is limited to the use aspect.

Kling and Elliott (1994) underscored the cultural influence of different groups of stakeholders in
designing digital libraries. Based on this, Davies (1997) identified several such stakeholders
within and outside an organization. Project leaders in the area of digital libraries, the politics of
the information environment within which such leaders perform, overall strategic management
by those leaders, and how they make the system visible within the organization all contribute to
the usability of digital libraries within the organization. Anything that makes it more difficult for
the user to use the system, both within and outside the organization, is a usability factor.
Developers contribute to how it becomes easy or difficult to use digital libraries in terms of
navigating within a document, displaying a document, and downloading. At another level, the
attitude of the library staff members who generate and provide services and their perception of
their own roles in a digital environment also contribute to the usability factor. The training
imparted to end-users, its timing, language used in-training materials also contribute to how endusers appropriate digital libraries (Davies, 1997).

56
Extra-organizational infrastructures in the organizational environment become the context of
technology design and use. Being part of such an infrastructure can facilitate technology use
within an organization. For example, libraries in some parts of the U.S. can draw on the
comprehensive information infrastructure at the county level for Internet connectivity, while
county libraries in some other areas have difficulty since they are not part of any such established
network (Curry & Curtis, 2000). Similarly, the availability of electronic systems developed and
maintained by real estate agencies also encourages their use by individual organizations (Lamb
& Kling, 2003).

Issues internal to an organization can contribute both to the use or non-use of technology. Those
issues may be administrative structure of an organization or the librarian’s perception about the
technology. For example, unstable technology, such as non-functioning computers, led to
teachers’ uncertainty about adopting that technology in their classes. The problem however, was
rooted not in the technology per se but in the administrative structure of the school that paid less
emphasis on administrative computing support (Soloway, 2000). Librarians may carry the old
baggage of work practice with print materials to the digital environment and thus cause,
inadvertently, users’ poor DL awareness (Adams & Blandford , 2004). The mismatch between
technology deployment and the work characteristics of communities of practice can lead to a
feeling of social exclusion. Poorly designed systems can provide information that is available in
principle, but not accessible in practice. For example, DL access was deployed favorably to more
senior people in a given organization, thus making junior people dependent on the senior people
for information. This differential structure caused a sense of exclusion. Thus, the administrative
structure within an organization may favor undue hoarding of ICTs and information at some

57
point and uneven use by people who want to use the technology (Adams, Blandford & Lunt,
2005).

Boudreau and Robey (1996) highlighted the paradox of information technology in businessprocess reengineering. While information technology enhanced the scope of organizational
processes, including variety of time and place of work and speed of response, the system once
hard-coded had little flexibility to accommodate new or emerging processes.

It has already been mentioned how extra-organizational institutionalized norms such as
allocation of credit for work performed, selection of the target audience for research, access to
resources including data, speed of work and result sharing, and allocation of professional status
shape information-gathering practice. This, in turn, also shapes the use of ICTs particularly
communication technologies which support such information practices. All these shape the
differential use of electronic media for scientific communication (Kling & McKim, 2000).
Similar disciplinary differences were also found to play a role on the pattern of use of DLs (Covi,
1999).

Cultural values inscribed in technology may make the technology dysfunctional. When a
technology developed within one culture is taken to a different culture, the expected or desired
usage of the technology may not take place. The organizational and cultural contexts of the place
of use of the technology contribute to such unintended consequences. In their study of the use of
a Geographical Information System (GIS) in a specific developing country, Walsham and Sahay
(1999) described how in effect the system was not used by organizational members. The GIS in
their study – was inscribed with the culture of the country where it was developed. Those

58
inscriptions were: display and use of spatially related data, coordinated working when there are
overlays, and the domination of the truth value of scientific data. The same GIS system was
implemented in a different culture where all these characteristics were culturally absent. The
usability of this GIS in a different culture was affected by several factors – lack of orientation
towards spatial data, an altogether different philosophy towards work getting done, very
restricted administrative structure leading to compartmentalization of work and overtaking
scientific inferences by local political interests – to name a few. Thus the context of the study site
and the inscriptions of the GIS mismatched and led to non-use of the system in the site of study,
notwithstanding the accuracy of the technology and availability of hardware and software at the
disposal of people in the study site.

On the other hand, an almost similar technology – Geospatial Information Technology (GIT)
changed the structure of working relations of various coordinating groups following the World
Trade Center crisis (Harrison et al., 2007). This work shows how a facilitating context can
transform an ICT-based tool from inert reference material to a dynamic decision making tool. In
the process that tool shaped the way of working of the organization members.

Two contrasting examples may be illuminating here. The quotes have been taken from each of
the studies cited above:

None of the Indian scientists, or for that matter the Indian author of this paper, had
considered the production or use of a map for this purpose and when this was jokingly
queried by the non-Indian author of this paper, he was firmly told that “we don’t use
maps for this purpose in India”. A GIS project leader in the National Informatics Center
(NIC), one of the other institutions in India trying to introduce GIS, said: The most
difficult part of GIS introduction is getting people to think spatially (Walsham & Sahay,
1999, p49).

59

(from a quote of informant). . I still remember creating that LIDAR image on the 19th. I
got the data; we printed it out and brought it to the firehouse and to Pier 92 and the
firemen, you know. They stood around staring at it silently. . . there was about half a
dozen of them. And then suddenly, they understood what it was, you know; even though
they’d never seen this technology before, it started to hit home. And they could recognize
the different mounds and the pits and where the guys were working in different parts of
the image. And I think it became a really important tool for organizing their thinking and
orchestrating the response to the whole crisis. . . (author’s quote) once identified and
used, images created from LIDAR data became a critical decision making tool. Daily
images of ground zero allowed respondents to identify, investigate, and plan for shifts in
the topography of the site (Harrison, et. al, 2007, p2250)
These two examples of use show that the way a technology is used by an individual is shaped by
the organization context.

2.4.3 Intra-organizational factors and differential use of ICT
A more interesting point of ICT use is that the same technology may be used differently by
different groups within an organization or the same technology may be used differently by the
same people at different times. This can be likened to a situation in which some properties of
ICTs are only visible to users over other properties or some ICTs are not at all visible to users
some of the time. When a limited number of features of word processing software are used by
most of the people, it appears to the observer as if only those properties are visible to users, even
though on each user’s table the system is available with all its features. Jasperson, Carter, and
Zmud (2005) also bring to our attention the point that people use a very limited range of features
of a technology. Citing the example of tax return software, Orlikowski (2000) showed how one
software was used differently by different people or differently at different times by the same
people. That tax return software is used for printing a blank form, for learning the current tax
code, or for learning the interface of such software is an example of how the same technology

60
evokes different interest and hence different usage among different groups of people. Or, the
same tax-return software is typically ignored for most of the year and only intensively used for a
short period by the same group of users demonstrating how the same technology remains
invisible depending on the time when it is needed. This specific pattern of use of the same
technology by different groups of people, or at different times by the same group of people is
termed as technology-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000).

Orlikowski (2000) elaborated how different work groups’ interests, organizational demands on
them and different perceptions can contribute to different technologies-in-practice within the
same organization. She used the example of “Notes” – software installed on the desktops of
employees of a company. This software was very powerful in promoting and supporting
cooperative work within the organization. It was found that two groups – “technical support” and
“consultants” – were enacting different technologies-in-practice for the same software.
“Technical support” members were free of a competitive culture, not subjected to “up-or-out”
career tensions or “billable hours” pressure. Members of this group were found using many
features of the software and thus promoted their collective technical work and cooperated with
each other. They also modified the technology over time as they added data to the databases and
created or customized them. Thus one kind of technology-in-practice emerged from this group.
However, members of the “consultant” groups were found to use the technology in a minimal
way. This group was subjected to strong competition (“up-or-out”) and higher performance
metrics (“billable hours”). The competitive culture strongly reinforced by the ‘‘up-or-out’’ career
path was seen by many consultants as encouraging the development of individually distinctive
competence. This increased their reluctance to use Notes to share expertise, and reinforced their
firm’s practice of rewarding individual effort and distinctive competence rather than cooperation

61
and knowledge sharing. Similarly, this group was doubtful of the relationship between the
technology and company performance. The training conducted for this technology was also very
abstract and technical. Overall, Notes triggered their fear that use of its collaborative properties
would threaten their status within the company and all these resulted in minimal technology-inpractice (Orlikowski, 2000).

The important point to note here is that such differential use happens within the same
organizations and issues which contribute to such differential use are also internal to the
organization. A theoretical underpinning was adopted to explain such differential use, which is
described in the following section.

2.4.4 Structuration theory and technology-in-practice
As mentioned in the previous section, Orlikowski (2000) proposed technology-in-practice to
describe what she observed about technology use in organizations. This construct is developed
using structuration theory (Giddens, 1984), which describes and explains how structures are
developed, maintained and changed within social systems. This theory has been used by many
scholars to explain phenomena that have roots in social practices. The theory, its various
explanations and critiques form a voluminous body of literature and it is beyond the scope of this
work to present such a discussion in detail. A brief introduction to structuration theory is given
here followed by the discussion on technology-in-practice – a structuration theory based lens – as
proposed by Orlikowski (2000).

62
Structuration theory posits that structuration is a social process involving reciprocal interaction
between human and structural properties of an organization. The structural properties consist of
rules and resources which mediate human action, and at the same time, the structure is reaffirmed by the actors. The core of the theory is the reflexivity of the human beings to routinely
observe, understand, and continuously monitor their context. That is how a social practice is
developed and mediated through the facilities available to them (e.g., land, buildings, and
technology), the norms that inform their ongoing practices, and their knowledge (both tacit and
explicit) of prior action and the situation at hand. A facility which is an external resource only
becomes a resource when it is implicated in the recurrent practices by humans. For example, in a
society, money is a resource only when people use the money in a meaningful way. Unless
money is constantly used, it does not become a resource. Norms define how a resource should be
used in a given structure. The use of a resource in a meaningful way depends on people –
intelligent and reflexive individuals – their past experience as well as the knowledge gained
through their interactions with others. The interpretive schema of the intelligent and reflexive
self of the individual helps an individual to develop a way of acting in a certain situation or using
a resource in a certain way in a situation. Recurrent practices of doing certain things in a new or
different way that are capable of being made visible, may give rise to new norms. In this way,
they apply such knowledge, facilities, and habits of the mind and body to ‘‘structure’’ their
current action. In doing so, they recursively instantiate and thus reconstitute the rules and
resources that structure their social action.

Based on this explanation of structuration theory, Orlikowski (2000) proposed technology-inpractice – the theory of the structure of technology use. Technology-in-practice is the enacted
structure of the action of technology use. In technology-in-practice, people draw on the

63
resources – the technical materiality of the technological artifacts inscribed by the designers as
well as added by people (specific data contents, customized features); norms – skills, power,
knowledge, assumptions about the technology and its use; and the interpretive schemas.

Interpretive schemas require some detailed discussion. Technology-in-practice focuses on human
agency. From an agency point of view, human interaction involves the constitution and
communication of meaning. This is achieved via interpretive schema – that is, stocks of
knowledge. Interpretive schemas represent organizational structure of signification, which
represent organizational rules that inform and define interaction. As the organizational rules are
reaffirmed or challenged through their use by human agents, interpretive schemas are also
reinforced or changed. Thus in any interaction, shared knowledge is not merely part of the
background, but is an integral part of the social encounter, in part organizing it and in part being
shaped by the interactions themselves.

Interpretive schemas are developed through training, communication, and previous experiences,
which include emotional and intellectual meaning and attachments that people associate with a
specific technology and its use, shaped by their experiences with various technologies, and their
participation in a range of social and political communities. Knowledge and experience also
come from the institutional contexts within which people live and work, and the social and
cultural conventions associated with participating in such contexts. Thus people’s use of
technology is structured by these experiences, knowledge, meanings, habits, power relations,
norms, and the technological artifacts at hand. Such structuring enacts a specific set of rules and
resources in practice that then serves to structure future use as people continue to interact with
the technology in recurrent practices. Consequently, over time, people constitute and reconstitute

64
a structure of technology use; they enact a distinctive technology-in-practice. Through ongoing
enactment of technology-in-practice, it becomes regularized and routinized. Though the
technology-in-practice is enacted in current use, such enactment is influenced by the past uses
and experiences which serve essentially as a “behavioral and interpretive template”.

The interpretive schema can help better understand how and why people are likely to use their
technologies and with what intended or unintended consequences in different conditions. The
emphasis on interpretive schemas also assumes that people are purposive, knowledgeable,
adaptive, and inventive agents who engage with technology in multiple ways to accomplish
various and dynamic ends. When the technology does not help them achieve those ends, they
abandon it or work around it. Structures are not static and get changed through agency, so does
technology-in-practice. No technology-in-practice is static forever. As intelligent people interact
with various worlds and get sensitized to the various ways of using a technology and the
usefulness of using this technology in different ways, technology-in-practice gets molded.

Different groups can demonstrate different technology-in-practice with respect to the same
technology. Technology is an artifact because its material and cultural properties transcend the
experiences of individuals and particular settings. Such artifacts, however, do not appear the
same to all people. By implicating rules and resources of technology as specific recurrent social
practice, as mentioned above, the technology structures human action and it is possible to see
that structure through those recurring actions. Even for a specific technology, different people
can see and use different sets of features and implicate those features accordingly and thus give
shape to the technological artifacts and/or some of the properties of a technological artifact. A
parallel has been drawn between technology use structure and supermarket use (Lave, 1988,

65
pp.150–151). The supermarket for individual shoppers is a repeatedly experienced, personally
ordered and edited version of a setting of activity. Some aisles in the supermarket do not exist for
a given shopper as part of her/his setting, while other aisles are rich in detailed possibilities.
Similarly, the use of a technology involves a repeatedly experienced, personally ordered and
edited version of some technology. This explains why people, at best, routinely use 25 percent of
the functionalities of office software packages such as word processing, spreadsheets or the
differential use of tax return software by different group and by same people at different times
(Orlikowski, 2000). Technology-in-practice can vary among users as rules, resources and
conditions for a technology use can be experienced differently by different individuals and
differently by the same individuals depending on the time or circumstance.

Technology-in-practice is emergent and is not embodied within the technology. What a
technology embodies are particular symbols and material properties. Repeated interactions with
some properties facilitate implicating those properties in the ongoing process of structuration,
and thus instantiate the properties in practice. Technologies-in-practice can change as users
experience changes in awareness, knowledge, power, motivations, time, circumstances, and the
technology. They are changed through the same process that all social structures are changed—
through human action. Users may also choose to enact different technologies-in-practice when
they become more knowledgeable about using their technology (through attending a training
class or watching a colleague’s use, for instance) or because they have changed jobs and now
need to use technology differently in their new work community. At the same time, users’
knowledge of what technological properties are available to them may be updated or made
obsolete, may change the meanings, expectations, associations, and conventions they attach to
the technology and its use. By focusing on this emergent structure, a view of technology use

66
emerges which can describe what users do with technologies as enactment. It can then be further
extended to understand whether such emergent structure is associated with any specific work
groups or is a result of some organizational factors.

Using the lens of technology-in-practice for the studies already discussed above helps to
understand how organizational context directly intervenes in shaping the use of ICTs by
organizational members. In the case study of Geographical Information System (GIS), as
mentioned in Section 2.4.2, cultural and educational aspects were associated to limited use
technology-in-practice of GIS (Walsham & Sahay, 1999). One of the examples of the effective
use, or “substantive use,” as termed by the authors, of a GIS in this case would involve district
forest officers using the GIS outputs on a regular basis to support decisions on what kinds of
trees should be planted in particular wasteland areas in order to help restore these lands. This was
found not to be happening, though. This is an example of limited use technology-in-practice and
was the result of two factors: (i) the absence of a relatively stable set of key actors with aligned
interests related to the GIS and (ii) creation and maintenance of such key actors demanded a long
process of changing social attitudes and structures. The authors (Walsham & Sahay, 1999) noted
that one key component in earlier education/training that would promote substantive use of this
technology was map-orientation. This map-orientation was lacking in the people who were using
the technology. Thus, in order to blend decision making process of administrators and output of
GIS technology, change in educational components by brining advance technology like remote
sensing for the users groups of GIS was felt necessary. The cultures of data sharing and
cooperative work approach were also found essential for effective and substantive use of GIS
technology and this culture was absent in the study site.

67
If the above cited case was an example of non-use or limited use of technology, the other study
on GIT, as mentioned earlier, exemplifies how technology-in-practice can change. Interorganizational social structure came into force and make the users take note of material
capabilities17 of a geospatial information technology (GIT) and enact those materials capabilities
which were otherwise ignored (Harrison et.al., 2007). Sharing geospatial information across
regions and integrating this information with other data sets are core to successful use of GIT.
GIT’s tremendous capability which can be exploited when geographical information across legal,
organizational and economic jurisdictional boundaries are combined to make an interoperable
system was restricted, until the WTC attack in 2001, by the notion of “owned” data and thus
preventing data sharing. Until this time, there were similarities between this and earlier case of
GIS use. However, in the acute emergency of the situation, such social structural impediments
lost their usual force and norms for collaboration in crisis gained prominence. Consequently,
material features of GIT facilities, enabling capabilities that have been feasible for a long time,
were drawn upon by GIT professionals to produce improvised GIT products to respond to urgent
needs. Actors/users of the technology brought a set of diverse technical facilities and resources,
pre-existing and newly adapted norms, and organizationally idiosyncratic interpretations of
reality. An interchange of knowledge, meaning systems, and technological artifacts took place
among members of the different groups in the course of which they shared perspectives on social
reality at that moment, learned from each other, and engaged in a fertile period of technological
innovation. In drawing on these structural properties, users’ experiences are shaped not only by
material aspects of the technology (“facilities,” of a resource, according to structuration theory)
but they are also shaped by norms (rules of using the resource) for appropriate behavior within

17

According to structuration theory – the basis of the construct technology-in-practice – the material capabilities of a technology
are its features that can be put to use as resource

68
an organization and with respect to a technology, and by interpretive schemes drawn from the
institutional context through which structure is instantiated. Thus, an important part of analyzing
a technology-in-practice is to understand how structural properties of the social system, through
the modalities of facilities, norms, and interpretive schemes, shape users’ tendencies to enact
technology in particular ways, giving rise to the possibility of structural reconstitution.

In sum, technology-in-practice allows us to observe the structure of use of a technology and also
factors leading to not only use or non-use by different organizations, but also differential use
within an organization. Such factors can be external to an organization such as infrastructure,
political and work culture of a society in general, as well as internal to an organization such as
administrative structure, work practice, and previous experience of working with the technology.

2.4.5 Technology-in-practice, DL use and research question
This section addresses how the concept of technology-in-practice can be used as a framework to
understand DL use. The departure points here are that organizational members’ informationgathering practices are shaped by some institutional forces and they should turn to one or more
systems and use some features of systems preferentially over others to support their informationgathering practices. The question at this stage is what kind of DL use structure can be observed
and the factors that contribute to such use structure. This question can be addressed at two levels
and both are important, to my mind, to understand DL use. At one level, an ICT can be said to be
used substantively if the outcome of that ICT is used in the day-to-day work of people (day-today work refers to the institutionally shaped actions of social actors). At another level, an ICT is

69
used substantively if many features of the ICT are used to produce the outcome of the ICT,
which can then be put to use to meet the day-to-day work of people.

We can conceptualize the entire range of information channels mediated through ICT as a DL
and the various electronic resources, including commercially available as well as locally
developed resources, search engines on the Internet and other services such as Google Scholar as
properties (resources) of the information-service provision technology. There are mechanisms
deployed by organizations to make those resources accessible by people who are entitled to
implicate or put to the use of those resources in their practices. This technology, the information
service provision, has several rules and resources. People instantiate one or more such properties
in differential ways, depending on how such properties are visible to them. This visibility of
some of the properties may be the result of the users’ earlier experiences of the use of the
technology. Also, rhetoric of powerful actors such as organizational policy or vendors who
continuously promote a technology can contribute to people developing some image of a
technology and attaching some meaning to a technology. Repeated use of one or more of those
facilities, predominantly by people under certain contexts, establishes a structure of information
channel use.

Each component of a DL comes with certain rules and resources. Within the purview of DL use
as technology-in-practice for information gathering, people can read some of the properties more
clearly than others because of their interpretive schema, which is again developed because of
their experience in the past and their environment. Depending on such readings, DL use may be
structured for some people as a simple store of articles that can be downloaded once the
reference is exactly known; for other people it may be a simple word-searching facility to locate

70
items; and yet for others it may be an extensive information discovery tool. In the light of the
above discussions, the second research question is once again presented here.

RQ#2: What are the various extra- and intra-organizational factors mediating the practice
of DL use (including non-use) in information-gathering activities of organizational
members?

RQ#2(a):

What are the various emergent practices of use of digital libraries, both at
the digital library level as a whole and at the feature level?

RQ#2(b):

How are such practices accounted for by different extra- and intraorganizational factors?

A graphic presentation of the research question is presented in Figure-3 below.

Finally, the findings from research questions RQ#1 and RQ#2 will be reconciled to understand
how digital libraries use are being shaped by the organizational context of academic and research
organizations in India.

Chapter summary

Organizational context can shape DL use in support of the information-gathering activities of the
organizational members at two levels. At one level, there are various institutionalized
organizations or representatives of such organizations with whom the organizational members
have to interact in order to discharge their responsibilities. Information exchange is part of such
interaction. Information gathering is viewed as routine activities to meet such institutional
information demand. In that routine process, DL use also becomes routinized. Using the
construct social actor, this study attempted to capture how the DL use and information gathering
activities are routinized by organizational members of academic and research organizations in
India.

72

Digital libraries are ICT-enabled tools. Because of this, at another level, organizational context
of DL use can be mapped onto those issues that contribute to any ICT-enabled tool within an
organization. Organizational context, from this perspective, covers a wide range of issues,
namely, external information environment/infrastructure, administrative structure of the
organization leading to ICT deployment within the organization, the nature of work demand on
individuals, and the previous experience of organizational members of using the technology. All
these not only contribute to varying degrees of use of ICTs but also contribute to differential use
of ICTs by different groups in the same organization or by the same person at different points in
time. Using the paradigm of social informatics and using the construct technology-in-practice,
the research attempts to capture the elements in an organizational context that can shape the use
of ICT-enabled tools, which in this study are DLs.

This chapter drew on the literature relevant to the core ideas of the proposed research and
showed how the ideas from the literature had been adopted and modified. The chapter also
provided a detailed discussion on the concept of digital library, various definitions as found in
the literature and the definition adopted in the current study.

CHAPTER 3: THE RESEARCH METHOD
3.1

Chapter introduction

This chapter starts with a review of the research paradigm adopted in this study and a
justification for this adoption. This is followed by a review of case study and field research as an
approach and the appropriateness of these two methods in the current study. Next, a summary of
case selection criteria, the sample selection process, the sources of evidences, data elicitation
techniques, data reduction and data analysis are presented. The description of each is supported
by various decisions taken to address concerns in each area. The chapter also highlights some
changes that had to be accommodated and the evolving insights regarding research design that
took place. A pilot study was conducted before the actual research study was initiated. A brief
summary of the experience of the pilot study and how it was used to fine tune some of the steps
in the research process is presented at the end of this chapter

The target of this research was to develop an account of the context of digital-library use within
an academic and research organization in India. To this end, the questions to be pursued were:
(i)

What are the components of the contexts of members of an academic and research
organization?

(ii)

What is the institutional nature of those components?

(iii)

What kind of information demand is made on the organizational members by those
components?

74
(iv)

How do information-gathering practices help those organizational members in
meeting such information demands?

(v)

In the process of consulting digital libraries in order to support such information
gathering activities, what are the properties that are visible to those organizational
members and are used recurrently? and

(vi)

What contributes to make some properties more visible than others?

The best way to develop such an account of organizational context was to look at it through the
eyes of the organizational members who use digital libraries. Hence coming into close contact
with organizational members was necessary. To this end, the research was conducted within the
paradigm of qualitative and naturalistic studies. The following section provides a brief
description of this research paradigm and its relevance to the current study.

3.2

The research paradigm for the current study

The current research adopts naturalistic and qualitative research paradigm. Naturalistic inquiries
are based on five axioms. Those axioms are: realities are multiple, constructed and holistic and
can be understood but cannot be predicted or controlled; the inquirer and the object of inquiry
interact with each other; separating cause from effect is not possible as each influences the other;
knowledge can be described ideographically as a working hypothesis that describes a case; and
all inquiries are value-laden (Lincoln & Guba, 1985: pp 39-44). Terminology differs but these
axioms are attributed to qualitative research in general (Cresswell, 1994). Here are some
examples of different terms: ontological (the reality is multiple and subjective as seen by the

75
participants), epistemological (the researcher is required to interact with that being researched),
axiological (the research is value-laden or biased), rhetorical (the language of the research is
informal, the decisions are evolving, a personal voice and qualitative words are accepted), and
methodological (the research has to progress inductively). Other scholars emphasize the process
of conducting qualitative research and define it as the process of exploring issues, understanding
phenomena, and answering questions. Overall, the goal of all qualitative research is to better
understand human behavior and experiences by grasping the process by which people construct
meaning, and then to describe what those meanings are. Concrete incidents of human behavior
are empirically observed in order to think clearly and deeply about the human condition (Bogdan
& Biklen, 2007; pp 20-36).

Following this paradigm, the questions raised by this research could be answered best by those
who use digital libraries, and in their own narratives. DL use is a convergence of informationgathering activities and the use of ICTs. Individuals acquire experience in information-gathering
and using the associated technology and they subsequently assign meaning to these activities as
an outcome of the experience. Thus each person’s worldview of information-gathering and DLs
is part of a reality and is constructed by them. Based on the individual’s worldview, a more
holistic picture emerges inductively and progressively. It must be noted here that a holistic
picture of reality or total reality is a relative state because it always remains unknown how much
is still unknown. The term total reality is used here to imply a discernible pattern in the
worldviews of people who are available to the researcher. The process of developing the total
view recognizes the importance of language and personal voice. Consequently, informal
language becomes the most important vehicle for empirical data in this study. This process
demands the researcher coming into close contact with those who serve as sources of evidence

76
thus bringing the value of the researcher into the mix. For these reasons, the research was a
perfect fit within the paradigm of qualitative and naturalistic research.

3.3

Case study and field research – the fit with current research

In the research design stage, some of the major concerns are the sources of the data and decisions
about how that data will be collected. Adopting the case-study approach addresses the question
of the source, while the decision to do field research addresses the issue on how the data should
be collected. A summary of these two research approaches and the fit to the current research
follows.

3.3.1 Case study – a description
Case study, as a research method, is adopted when the researcher intends to explore a program,
an event, an activity or a process or individuals in depth. The cases are bounded by time and
space and data is collected using a variety of procedures over a sustained period of time (Stake,
1995). Some scholars view case study as one of many strategies to conduct inquiry (Baily, 2007).
Bogdan and Biklen (2007) describe case study as a detailed study of a setting. Yin (1994)
unambiguously calls the case study a research strategy. It is neither a data-collection tactic nor
merely a design feature alone (Stoecker, 1991). An extensive list of criteria that make a study a
good fit for case study includes: (i) examining phenomena in a natural setting; (ii) collecting data
through multiple means; (iii) examining very few entities; (iv) intense study of the complexity of
the unit; (v) exploration, classification and hypothesis development; (vi) no involvement of an
experimental control; (vii) no specification of independent and dependent variables; and (viii)

77
results being dependent upon the integrative power of the researcher (Benbasat et al, 1987). Case
studies are typically conducted to observe current phenomena, bounded by time and space, and
hence observations are to be made after the data points are bounded by a context (Yin, 1994).

A case study can employ either single case or multiple cases. A single case is selected when such
a case has potential to be a critical or revelatory. On the other hand, the evidence from multiple
cases is often compelling resulting in a study that is regarded as robust. Replication logic works
more for multiple case studies. In multiple case studies, each case either predicts the same results
or produces contrasting results for predictable reasons (Yin, 1994: p45).

Subsequent to the selection of a case or cases, different data-collection strategies can be
employed depending on the nature of questions raised. One can administer a questionnaire
survey, adopt participant observation or other techniques for empirical observation within the
case.

3.3.2 Field research – a description
Field research is the systematic study, primarily through long term, face-to-face interactions and
observations of everyday life (Bailey, 2007). Studies in this category aim to understand daily life
from the perspective of people who live that life in a setting. In field-research-based studies,
researchers are required to come in close contact with study participants, in their natural setting,
in order to observe the phenomenon under study. From this perspective, field work meets one of
the epistemological axioms of naturalistic inquiry, which states that the researcher has to come in
close contact with those being studied.

78

Field research is referred to as naturalistic inquiry as it does not move people from their daily
lives. Field research also does not impose any parameters from the outside. Unlike researchers
using surveys, who focus on a few pre-selected variables, field researchers learn from larger,
complicated, multifaceted, social and historical contexts within which people live. The temporal
order of events and the change over time are important to them. Field researchers often become
part of the setting and personally experience and reflect on it afterwards (Bailey, 2007). The
most important mode of data collection is observation, although interview is also another
instrument for data collection. Field studies tend to capture the essence of human behavior,
particularly when the people under observation are unaware that they are being observed,
resulting in authentic behaviors being reflected without the influence of demand characteristics
(reactivity) or social desirability answers (Persaud, 2010).

3.3.3 Similarity and differences between case study and field research
Case study and field research have similarities on three counts, namely, the notion and role of
theories; the level of generalization that can be achieved through these strategies; and the nature
of variables to be examined. The importance of the role of theories has been recognized for both
the methods. Such a theory need not be a grand theory; it can be a proposition which can guide
what to study or serve as a blueprint by stressing the questions, propositions, units of analysis. It
can help by connecting data to the concepts and the criteria for interpreting the findings (Yin,
p28). It can also provide orienting frameworks, conceptual lenses, sensitizing concepts, causal
models, disciplinary perspectives, philosophical perspectives, or worldviews (Bailey, 2007).

79
Theory influences how we understand the world and the research, and helps wade through large
amounts of data, avoiding merely dumping the data as research output.

Neither of these two research methods aims to achieve the generalization of the findings at the
population level. When based on a single case, both field study and case research aim to
understand the details of the selected case. On the other hand, when multiple cases are selected,
analytical generalization can be made among situations.

Both these research methods recommend not restricting the study to a few selected variables.
Rather, larger, complicated, multifaceted, social, and historical contexts within which people’s
lives unfold provide a rich understanding to the researcher. The case study research also relies on
multiple sources of evidence, with data needing to converge in a triangulating fashion and
benefits from prior developments of theoretical propositions to guide data collection and analysis
(Yin, 1994; p 13).

One can adopt a case study approach and then opt for field work for data-collection purposes
(Yin, 1994). On the other hand, cases are purposive samples in field work (Bailey, 2007). Thus,
when flavors of both these research methods are present in a research, their relative importance
in the research depends on the approach taken by the researcher.

3.3.4 Applicability of case study and field research in the current study
Even though the current research was conducted in a naturalistic setting it did not perfectly fit the
criteria of field research along two dimensions: (i) the researcher’s role and (ii) the datacollection mode. In field research, in order to have “the lived experience” the researcher becomes

80
part of the setting and participates in the daily life of those being studied. Bailey (2007) gave an
example of such lived experience from the work of Russell (1991):

For her data collection she volunteered for four months at a day shelter, where she
could directly observe the women in their role as residents of the shelters, diners at soup
kitchens, participants in social activities. She held babies, poured coffee, and chatted
with sheltered women….she wanted to explore how they made sense of their lives and
how they viewed themselves and other homeless women
This role naturally indicates that observation is a significant part of the data-collection technique
in this research method. The aim of the current research was to know what digital-library use
means to the organizational members in academic and research settings, but to be a part of a
highly technical world was not possible for the researcher. Hence, the full lived experience was
not a requirement for this research. Additionally, observation was a minor part of data collection
in this research as explained in a later section where data elicitation is discussed. Primarily,
because of these two reasons, the current research could not be identified as a field research in
which lived experience of the researcher is important.

The research method of the study aligned more with case study. There were several ingredients
in the research that made it better align as a case study methodology: the phenomenon under
investigation was current and it had to be studied within the clearly defined boundary of an
organization, thus making the study bound by time and space, a quality of a case; cases had to be
selected as purposive samples (more discussion on sampling to follow); a case study allows
several methods of data collection and need not necessarily restrict to observation – the current
study primarily depended on interviewing technique; the study targeted multiple sources of data
for triangulation; and finally, the researcher could not control the phenomenon and did not

81
reduce the context into any preselected variables. Hence it met the basic criteria for a research
study to be identified as case study (Yin, 19994).

A multiple case study approach was adopted in the study. The researcher did not have any
evidence that there is a single site that could be considered as critical or revelatory. On the other
hand, selecting multiple cases enabled the researcher to make a cross-case analysis to understand
the universality of the phenomenon.

3.4

Research design

Designing a study is the process of translation of elements of inquiry and research approaches
into practices (Creswell, 1994). The elements of inquiry were summarized as questions at the
beginning of this chapter, and a qualitative, naturalistic case study was adopted as the research
approach. This section will provide details on the actual design.

3.4.1 Case selection
Cases in a multiple-case research are purposive samples. Two organizations – ORG1 and ORG2
– were selected as purposive samples for the study. Detailed descriptions of both the sites are
given in following chapter 4.This section presents how these two organizations were determined
to be fit for inclusion in the study.

There were several concerns in selecting cases for the current multiple-case study. These were:
the possibility of finding adequate data for the research, differences in the organizational

82
contexts of the cases to be studied, the possibility of getting access to the sites in a more or less
hassle-free way, and the geographical locations of the cases.

It was obvious that in order for a site to qualify as a case, there must be possibility of getting
adequate data. This was possible if the selected case, at the time of starting the data collection,
was sufficiently familiar with electronic resources and their uses. Both ORG1 and ORG2 were
sufficiently accustomed to electronic resources when data collection started in early 2009. In
India, it was such government-supported/funded organizations that witnessed spectacular
changes in terms of electronic resources. This happened because several measures were taken by
the government to make Indian scientific and research organizations competitive under the
assumption that knowledge is the greatest tool for coping with competition and that electronic
resources can provide such up-to-date knowledge speedily. Organizations similar to ORG1 and
ORG2 were part of some government-sponsored consortium and had access to a large number of
resources that were otherwise inaccessible during the all-print era. This government policy made
ORG1 and ORG2 quite rich in information resources and subsequently, these two organizations
were qualified as representative organizations where there were possibilities of finding rich
phenomena of digital-library use.

The organizations were to be selected in such a way that their contexts were sufficiently
different. When two organizations are quite different, it is possible to observe if such differences
in context contribute to a given phenomenon, digital-library use in this case. Selecting each
organization using the principles of theory-driven purposive sampling was helpful because it
gave the researcher the opportunity to select organizations with differences. Such differences
between selected organizations were at two levels – field of specialization and structure.

83

A field of specialization is a recognized area of scholarly activities. Thus two organizations
pertaining to two different fields of research are most likely to be different. As reported in the
literature, field differences and their contributions contribute to different communication patterns
corroborate this. To make the findings comparable, however, only applied fields, namely,
metallurgy and materials science and biotechnology, were selected.

Metallurgy and materials science is a very conventional and old discipline. As quite a few
informants described, this discipline now devotes itself mostly to developing processes leading
to better quality of metals or to developing new materials that can be used by other industries.
The first area supports operations of large existing industries, such as steel industries or power
industries, where the quality of metal in the infrastructure/equipment, such as blast furnaces, can
contribute to the operational cost. The second area is more challenging. According to the
informants a big task is not only finding the applicability of new materials but also finding the
areas where new materials will be applicable. Biotechnology, on the other hand, is comparatively
a new but extremely thriving field. Its main goal is discovery of new items directly related to the
benefit of society. New drugs and new genetically developed plant seeds are examples of such
items. In addition, biotechnology, as a discipline, was selected in order to be able to compare the
finding of this study with literature (Lamb & Kling, 2003). Choosing biotechnology as discipline
of research in an academic and research organization provides an opportunity for comparing the
findings from an academic and research organization with that from an industry.

Discipline-wise, ORG1 devotes its research to metallurgy, materials and mineral science. ORG2,
on the other hand, devotes itself to many areas of research, including basic disciplines such as

84
physics, chemistry, and so forth. However, there is a division that pursues research in the area of
biotechnology. Hence, for ORG2, only that division was considered for this study.

Structurally, ORG1 and ORG2 are two different types of organizations. Details of these two
organizations are given in chapter-4 and a very succinct version is presented here. ORG2 is
committed to basic research and ORG1 is committed to industrial research with a specific
objective to make the country self-sufficient in this industry. From the objectives of these two
organizations, it is clear that these two organizations are structurally different. Thus selection of
these two different organizations provided an opportunity for analytical generalization across
cases.

The two other concerns, namely, getting entry into an organization and geographical proximity
of cases, were mostly related to research management. Getting entry into an organization is
extremely important but can be complicated sometimes. Two types of organizations were kept
out of purview because of the impossibility in getting access. Those were organizations doing
research in the defense sector, and in mission areas, such as nuclear science or space science.
Organizations that are supposed to direct their research to the betterment of society, in terms of
production, economic development, and self-sufficiency, were considered. Even then, getting
entry into those organizations was a long process. Hence the researcher resorted to her personal
connections in order to be introduced to the authority of respective organizations and to get
permission to conduct the data collection.

Regarding geographical proximity, it was a concern that cases selected should be in the same
geographic area so that time and resources could remain at a manageable level. Thus both the

85
cases selected were from same region of the country. Though this selection was made for
convenience, it did not undermine the merit of the cases as organizational goals and research
agenda are not dependent on geographical locations within the country.

3.4.2 Sample selection
Individuals were the basic building blocks of the two cases. Selection of study participants
within each organization was accomplished through purposive sampling and by using the
snowballing technique. The first issue was how to select the individuals whose worldview would
matter in the research. Depending on the experiences – and people can certainly have widely
different experiences – the worldview may vary widely from person to person. So the question
ensues; how to ensure that experiences are not randomly collected. If context matters, then
individuals bounded by a given context will have comparable worldviews.

Spradley (1979) recommends selection of informants who are enculturated, have current
involvement, are in a cultural scene that is unfamiliar to the researcher, have adequate time, and
are non-analytic in nature. As enculturation takes some time, the informants were to be ideally
selected from those who were serving the organization for a few years. In the Indian research
scenario, it is not uncommon that sometimes researchers are moved to administrative positions.
In the process of handling administrative works however, they become enculturated differently
and therefore, could not be included as informants. To ensure current involvement the informants
were to be selected from those who were working in research projects, preferably managing both
internal tasks and the external relations, and were specifically in charge of report writing.

86
The site of research must be culturally unfamiliar to the researcher. Even though this researcher
has experience of working in different academic and research organizations in India for nearly 25
years, the organizations she selected are of the type she left almost 15 years ago. It is a
sufficiently long enough time to have made her unfamiliar with the situations in those
organizations.

In order to get the informants who had sufficient time for an interview of about one hour, people
in a very high rank within organizations were avoided. It was difficult to predict how the
informants would be chosen based on the last criterion – informants of non-analytic nature. A
certain degree of reflexive capacity of the informants is necessary for them to articulate how they
look at events, phenomena, and objects. There is a trade-off, however, and some of these people
may inadvertently try to translate their thoughts with the good intention of helping the
researcher. During the data collection stage, one interview was rejected on this ground. A person
who can provide a good description would be a good informant. It is the researcher’s skill to
encourage the informants and engage them to show their world in their native language. It was
not possible beforehand to identify such good informants. In addition to the above issues, the
researcher was keen to and could include two of the following kinds of informants: people who
are almost nearing retirement – those who started working when libraries were completely
conventional and continued to do so even a few years before that; and people who were educated
in countries such as the U.S. and have gone back to India within the last few years and were
currently working there.

Within ORG1 and ORG2, there are two types of science workers who are engaged in research.
One group is referred to as scientist and the other group is referred to as technical. Though some

87
of the technical people became highly knowledgeable and scientists of respective organizations
may have great respect for their capability, it was the scientists in both the organizations who
were in charge of the research projects. Hence to keep the findings comparable, both within and
across organizations, study participants were drawn only from the pool of scientists.

ORG1 is a large organization. Entry to ORG1 was first made through an acquaintance who also
participated in the study. The researcher approached six (6) scientists, in the first round of data
collection, after examining documents such as annual reports and future vision document. Before
the second round of data collection also, the ongoing project list was consulted and one of the
acquaintances was requested to introduce the researcher to other scientists some of whom were
doing different types of research. This former research participant circulated an email to selective
scientists meeting the criteria, requesting them to participate in the study. Nine scientists agreed
and actually participated in the study in this round. Overall, the informants were recruited using
snowball technique with a touch of theoretical sampling.

In ORG2, the group devoted to the research in biotechnology was very small. Through
acquaintances, contact was made with almost all in the group who were present in the city at that
time. Four scientists initially agreed to participate in the research, out of which three scientists
finally took part in the study.

Because the process of research was emergent in nature, data collection, analysis, and the
adjustment of the instrument (i.e. the researcher) took place in a cyclical manner. Though
sampling was the first step in any research process, after selecting one sample and completing
the process as far as preliminary data analysis, the next sample was to be selected based on the

88
questions that emerged in previous analysis. Similarly, based on the analysis, necessary
adjustments were made to include more questions on a specific issue or questions on a different
but relevant issue.

3.4.3 Sources of evidence
Initially, the target was to examine two types of sources for data collection -- documents and
individuals. Documents can hold the footprint of how organizations as a source of “power”
create the structure of DL. The intent was to include both print and electronic versions, if any, of
annual reports, research reports, websites of the organizations and their libraries, assessment and
promotion guides, job responsibilities at different levels, any materials prepared on DLs, minutes
of meetings of library committees dealing with DLs, library brochures, handouts and so on,
subject to availability. The research method using case study also recommends collecting data
from multiple sources for the purpose of triangulation (Yin, 1994; p91-93). It was an expectation
that these organizations might have some policy documents regarding adoption of ICTs as well
as digital libraries. However, no such document was found in any of those organizations. Hence,
librarians and system managers of both the organizations were interviewed to understand the
evolution of the current state of ICTs as well as digital libraries in those organizations. Those
interviews were used to develop the background information for each organization.

The second source of data was individual organizational members who were study participants.
In-depth interviews were conducted with those participants following which those interviews
were transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were then used as a major source of data.

89

3.4.4 Interview as data elicitation technique
3.4.4.1

Research design issues using interview as data elicitation technique

The issues regarding adopting a data elicitation technique, at the research design stage, are: (i)
the choice of technique appropriate for the type of data required for drawing inferences; and (ii)
containing the risk of data corruption. How these two issues were handled, are described below.

Qualitative and naturalistic inquiry is often accomplished with the help of unobtrusive
observation and/or interviews. This study used interviewing as the primary data-elicitation
technique. This choice leads to an obvious question of why another standard data-collection
technique, namely observation, was not employed. The reasons are: (i) unobtrusive observation
on a purposive sample is not possible; and (ii) information related activities are very private in
nature in the current electronic scenario (Barry, 1995). Had observation been used, there were
two places within an organization where such observation would have been conducted: either the
library or the participants’ office spaces. The libraries of the two organizations were ruled out for
two reasons: (i) the study participants comprised a purposive sample and were selected based on
certain criteria. There was no guarantee that those participants would come to the Library to
consult digital libraries; and (ii) both the organizations were found to have adequate local
networking facilities and scientists, in general, of both the organizations were found to consult
digital libraries from their office spaces. Moreover, the researcher spent some time, in the
libraries of respective organizations watching users. It was found that computers marked for
users were mostly used by other non-scientists for different purposes such as email checking.
This was also corroborated during the interview as the participants admitted that they do not go

90
to the library any more to consult electronic resources as those were available digitally on their
computers.

Another alternate space for observation could have been their office spaces. However, computers
or laptops used by those scientists in their office were located within a setup which can be best
described as a personal space. They perform many tasks on their computers including searching
digital libraries, but it could not be ascertained when they were consulting the digital library or
performing some other activity. Spending time in the room of such scientists, beyond the time
allotted for an interview, for the purpose of observing them would have been very uncomfortable
and could not be defined as unobtrusive observation. Moreover, those scientists were also
entrusted with other research administration jobs and would not have liked to be observed when
they were engaged in such work.

But the most compelling reason for adopting interviews for data elicitation was the nature of
expected data. This research aims to understand context as viewed by an informant and this was
possible only if those participants guided the researcher into their worldview. This would reveal
the way she/he sees digital-library use, and the language she/he uses to express that experience.
Such views, based on the personal experience of the participants can only be captured when the
participants speak. The words and their meanings attached to digital-library use by those
scientists were important, and not the precise way in which they conducted their searches.
Nonetheless, during the interviews, occasionally participants were requested to show how they
do a specific job. Those activities were necessary for the researcher to understand the meaning of
some of their actions. Such observations also led to some more questions. Some participants

91
were comfortable and acceded to the request. Some scientists did not give much importance to
such requests.

The second design issue was mitigating the chance of data corruption. Interviewing as a process
can be prone to data corruption depending on the stand taken by the researcher. Close and
informal interaction between the researcher and the participants may create some pressure on the
interviewee. This may lead to form an image of “ideal self” or “good researcher” in the mind of
participants. Out of such imageries, some interviewees may tend to give exaggerated data or
idealized data (Barry, 1995). This can happen if the point of departure is the assumption, on the
part of the researcher, that participants are using digital libraries when in reality they may not.
Such an assumption on the part of the researcher could have resulted in questions directly on the
use of digital libraries or referring to digital libraries. This could have been counter-productive.

In today’s technology-laden world, any revelation of not using a common technology by a highly
educated person may put her/him in an uncomfortable position. Any direct question on DL use
may inadvertently create an image of an ideal person in the informant’s mind. The informants
might have then been tempted to exaggerate their DL use. They might have reported what ideally
should be done and not what they do in reality. This would have resulted in corrupted data. In the
research method that was adopted in this study, it was important that the informants of the study
give their account uninhibitedly, without a feeling of being considered inferior if they did not use
DLs in their information-gathering activities, for whatever reasons. Hence it was a conscious
decision of the researcher, at the methodology level, not to make any utterance on digital
libraries.

92
This methodological risk was tackled by framing the research question. The purpose of a digital
library is to look for information. Thus the research question RQ#1 was framed in a way that
information-gathering practice which may or may not lead to digital-library use was
foregrounded. There were two assumptions behind framing questions in this manner. The first
assumption was that if context does not drive one to information gathering, then DL use does not
relate to the organizational responsibilities that make up the social context of an informant. The
second assumption was that even if information gathering is practiced by informants, there may
be competing resources, other than DLs. By handling this methodological risk through the
research question the researcher was relieved of having to conduct the interview with the
assumption that the informants did use DLs.

Further care was taken while asking the questions. The informants were gradually directed to the
questions on digital-library use by making it a natural part of conversation. No question on
whether they use DL was asked. Rather they were drawn into the discussions of their research
programs, exploring what they are concerned about in various stages of the research. In the
middle of such questions, a light probe was made on what kinds of information were useful
during the specific stages of the project under discussion. Only after they started speaking about
their information-gathering practices, the direction of the dialog was oriented towards the
resources from which they obtain the required information (It was not only the questions that
were crucial, but also the non-judgmental way those questions were placed that was important.
The researcher did her best to control voice and gesture, not to express any surprise even when
she heard something awkward, and asked the questions on information requirements in the most
unobtrusive and un-evaluative way possible).

93
It was also important that they considered me as a researcher and not a librarian who would help
them with resources. This prevented the interview from digressing into discussions towards the
performances of the libraries in terms of electronic resources.

3.4.4.2

The framework of the interview technique adopted in this study

After deciding that interview would be the primary mechanism for data collection, additional
precautions were taken to avoid data corruption. In section 1.5.1, it was mentioned that this
research aimed to be based on model of action that had a methodological implication. The
implication was that informants would be required to make visible their actions through
descriptions. On the other hand, the risk of open interview is that participants may often speak of
an ideal situation or rationalize/theorize their actions. In order to understand the meaning that
participants attached to digital-library use, which takes place due to actual use, it was essential to
capture their experience and not what they believed should have been done. Besides, it was
important to encourage the participants to describe and not to provide just “yes/no” types of
closed answers. Thus it was essential that participants would tell stories of their digital-library
use and not make suggestions about it. To meet all these requirements, the interview was
conducted by adopting certain techniques of phenomenological framing and an ethnographic
style of interviewing.

Phenomenology, in qualitative inquiry, is a term pointing to interest in understanding a
phenomenon from the actor’s own perspective and describing the world as experienced by those
actors. The underlying assumption is that the reality is what people perceive it to be (Kvale &
Brinkmann, 2009). Such an approach is termed as “phenomenological interview” (Thompson,

94
et.al., 1989) and described as a stance of qualitative research (Cope, 2005). No assumption is
made about what is not real; rather descriptions of phenomena begin with how one experiences
things. The aim of phenomenological inquiry is to understand the subjective nature of “lived
experience” from the perspective of those who experience it by exploring the meanings and
explanations that individuals attribute to their experiences. As Cope (2005) described “one of the
defining features of phenomenological inquiry is that it is firmly located in the context of
discovery rather than the context of justification”. An interview guided by a phenomenological
frame situates the informants in their experience and thus helps to avoid any possible
theorization by them. This can be attained by always raising the question in the form of “how did
an incident help in a situation.” By emphasizing “help” and not “why” facilitates avoiding any
theorizing or producing any ideal response. The questions were always asked with reference to
their ongoing projects – no question on ideal situations was raised. This was expected to help
contain the chance of data corruption. Some of the guidance given for placing the questions in
the interview (Thompson, 1989) are summarized in Table-5:
Table 5: Phrasing of questions in phenomenological interviewing
Forms of question that are not accepted
What does this symbolize for you
(theoretical and abstract?

Can you tell me about a time when you (about a specific

question because it leads to
rationalization

What was X like?How did you feel?.
Can you describe a time when you were (a state as told by
the respondent)?
Can you tell me a time when you did this?

The experience of the participants is the main source of information in phenomenological
interviewing. Such experience is, however, expressed through the language of the culture to
which the participant belongs. Language is a means for communicating and also a tool for

95
constructing reality. Ethnographic interviewing is a way to capture the language of people
belonging to a certain culture. Culture here does not mean a specific race or nationality for
instance. Each profession/trade has a certain culture.

The objective of an ethnographic interview is to facilitate the interviewee to link an incident to
his own experience so that the researcher can infer what that incident means to the interviewee.
To encourage interviewees to speak and not to answer in a closed fashion (for example,
“yes/no”), ethnographic interviewing suggests that the purpose of the research must be explicitly
revealed to the interviewee, questions should be repeated, researcher must express interest by
repeating what informants say, express ignorance so that the participants are encouraged to show
what do they think about an object, details must be asked and full form of any abbreviation must
be asked. Questions should be of various types and depth and a shuffling of grand tour question,
mini tour question, example question, experience questions, and native language questions,
structural questions and contrast questions. Particularly, participants must not be asked the
meaning of any incident/example and always asked for an example – thus reducing the chance of
closed answer (“yes/no” type) (Spradley, 1979).

The interview process in this research was framed using these valuable guidelines from both
phenomenological interview and ethnographic interview. For example, when an informant was
drawn into a discussion of information-gathering practices using the digital library, she/he was
asked for an example of such use. As the informant described her/his own situation of
preparation before going to a review meeting, the researcher asked how that information
gathering was helpful. This not only situated the informant with a real life experience but it was
also possible to see her/his world. For example, it emerged that often information-gathering

96
before a scheduled meeting with peers was not merely an action for collection of information, it
was a way to establish herself, with her/his peers, as an equally knowledgeable person –
information-gathering practices and digital-library use under those situations becomes a tool for
establishing the scientist’s identity.
The interviews within the phenomenological framework and using ethnographic technique were
conducted in an unstructured fashion. The unstructured interview method helped informants to
speak in an uninhibited way. Informants were drawn into a conversation by which they could
express their concerns and their own way of looking at digital-library use or non-use. An
unstructured interview was adopted to support building discussions on any new issues that
emerged and that seemed relevant to the study.

As individuals are quite likely to differ from each other in terms of expression and speech acts,
an instrument for such unstructured interviews is required that can adjust according to the
situation. Thus, the researcher as the “human instrument” poses such questions in the
identification stage as, “What is this?” “Who is that?” and “What is important here?” which lead
to identifying or naming a phenomenon (Miller & Crabtree, 1999). Adjustment can be made by
dropping a question if the answer was already offered or putting forward more probing questions
if a lead to another direction is found. Only the human instrument can do this job.

There were three operational characteristics of the actual interview process. First, the initial plan
of interview was changed partially. Second, the actual flow of interview process sometimes
differed for a few informants. Third, there were several issues that emerged after the interviews

97
of a few scientists were completed. These characteristics and necessary adjustments are
discussed.

The original plan of open ended unstructured interview was changed to partially guided, semistructured interview. Better time management was the reason for this change. Many of the
informants in this study were at very senior levels and had extremely busy schedule. They agreed
to speak for about an hour or so. While some of the informants started talking in an
authoritative/assertive voice without giving the researcher much opportunity to place the cues for
the questions, some scientists were often found to be easily engrossed in talking about their
findings, achievements, even frustrations and thus consuming a lot of time. At the same time,
information-gathering activities did not easily emerge from their discussion. Many of them did
not see using a digital library or information-gathering activities as a separate process to
recognize and mention. This unconsciousness of scientists about their information gathering
activities made the interview process too time consuming to orient the direction of the interview.
To overcome this problem of time management, guided and semi-structured interview technique
was adopted. However, the process was maintained as open-ended as much as possible. The
researcher, to start with, prepared a list of issues for discussion. After the initial ice-breaking
session with the informants, those issues were placed before an interviewee one by on and
discussion on each issue started.

The actual flow of the interview process was adjusted for some of the scientists. This means
either the starting point of the interview was not same for all scientists or the same question was
placed before some scientists differently. Change of sequence of placing questions was done in

98
order to maintain an ambience of discussion in which the informant was given importance and to
instill a faith that her every utterance is important. For example this researcher got a chance to be
introduced to one of the informants much ahead of the scheduled interview. In that informal
talking, the scientist commented how information has become important for his everyday work.
During the actual interview session which took place a few days later, the researcher, instead of
starting the session with regular formalities and with questions about the type of research done
by him, opened the session by referring to the discussion on information that took place in the
last informal meeting and discussion started. By giving importance to what he told in an informal
meeting helped in (i) developing a trusting relationship with the researcher by giving a signal
that the researcher was attentive to the comments made in the earlier informal meeting (ii)
situating him immediately in the context based on which he made such comments. In this and
similar other interviews, the informant was guided to the other issues at hand later. Thus, even
though the sequence of brining issues was different for different informants, all issues were
placed before each of them.

There were also occasions when the questions were placed before different scientists differently.
For example, if the flow of discussion brought a listed issue spontaneously by the scientist, he
was not asked the same question afresh – rather a verification question was placed by repeating
some of her statements and she was asked whether the researcher understood her correctly. One
example of such variation was the question related to different types of projects conducted by the
organization and the informant’s involvement. After a few interviews were conducted, the types
of projects that are conducted within the organization became clear. A list of all such project
types and their characteristics, as understood by the researcher, were listed. Next scientist,

99
instead of being asked on various project types of the organizations, was offered what the
researcher prepared on various projects and was asked whether the understanding was correct,
whether the researcher missed any other types of research that the current informant is involved
with, whether the informant was participating in all those types of projects and so on. This is also
an example of in-process member check that was administered to maintain trustworthiness of the
study – an issue discussed later. This process helped in saving the time as well as either to
confirm or expand any list of themes in iterative way.

Another characteristic of open ended interview is that an issue might have emerged at a later date
in the process of data collection – at a time when several interviews were already conducted. An
example will be helpful to elucidate this aspect. The theme that information gathering activities
help to build identity of knowledgeable self while a scientist is facing an audience in a face-toface meeting emerged after a few interviews were conducted.

All such newly emerged themes were always checked with the themes that already emerged.
Interview transcripts were re-read to check if there was any indication of such themes in earlier
transcripts. If the theme appeared to be new, it was noted. In the subsequent interviews the
researcher remained alert and if that theme was not forthcoming, a light probe was made at the
end of the interview. For example, on the issue of risk of accepting of unawareness about a piece
of information in front of learned audience (Identity – knowledgeable self), in a face-to-face
meeting, a question as below was placed before subsequent interviewees:

Me: one scientist said that it is important for him to know relevant information as much as
possible, before he speaks before an audience. He thinks it is very embarrassing if someone from

100
the audience refers to some information that he never noticed and asks him to react on that. He
said that regular information gathering saves him from such situation – how do you see this
situation? Is it really so important to be ready with information by a scientist before she/he goes
before an audience?

This question had several features. By uttering “one scientist”, the informant was assured that it
was not the opinion of this researcher about what a scientist would do and did not hurt his ego.
Second, by mentioning “one scientist” and not “many scientists” helped not to create any
pressure on the interviewee to agree to what is being told by many. Third, by asking his opinion
on that situation gave him superiority – the interviewee was free to say that it may be the
problem of that individual scientist. Surprisingly all scientists came forward in support of that
view and narrated more on this theme. One scientist even said that he cannot claim himself as
peer if he does not know something what others in an audience already knows.

Themes forthcoming like the above, not only strongly supported the theme, but it also helped to
build the larger picture which is one of the objectives of the inductive content analysis through
constant comparison. At this point it did not matter that earlier participants did not talk on this
theme. In fact, by the time the last scientist was interviewed, the themes were almost saturated.
No new themes were forthcoming.

There were, however, a few instances, when a theme emerged from the interview of only one
scientist. All such instances are discussed with educated guess in Chapter 8.

Thus it was possible to strike a balance between two aspects – to manage each interview within
the scheduled time and also to situate the informants within an information environment so that

101
the conversation could be anchored around themes that are relevant to the research questions.
The “guided” nature of the interview helped the researcher to draw the conversation surrounding
the themes that were likely to yield usable data, though the sequence in which those themes
would be discussed varied from one informant to another depending on the point of entry into a
conversation. At the same time, it was still an unstructured interview – the researcher placed
open-ended questions prodding the informants to speak about their experiences, and their
opinions about their use of digital libraries.

The language of the interview session was another concern. Native language is an important
aspect of the ethnographic interview. India, where this study was conducted, has nearly 30
different languages. For the purpose of comparison, all the interviews were conducted in English.

As it will be demonstrated later, the findings vindicated the soundness of the interviewing
technique. Informants revealed clearly when they prefer non-digital information sources over
digital resources. The picture of digital libraries that emerged was a melting pot of various
resources, Internet/Google search engines, specific journal websites, expensive resource such as
Scopus, and free search engines such as Pubmed. Some could not even remember the name of
the resource but the way they described the use left no doubt that they using digital resources.
Overall, participants made direct statement about using digital libraries by describing how they
use keywords while searching or their use of electronic content-alert services from various
publishers. There were also frank admissions that some scientists either did not consult Web of
Science, a very expensive resource, or were not aware of its features. The more interesting
finding was that most of the scientists connected Web of Science to finding the impact factor of
journals and never used some of its important features such as citation chaining for information

102
gathering purposes. In sum, the elicited data stands as proof of success of the strategies adopted
in data elicitation.

3.4.5 Data reduction and analysis
After the interview is over, the interviewee or participant of the study leaves the scenario. The
onus is now on the researcher to interpret the meaning of the interviewee’s experiences as
captured through the interviews. The researcher serves as an instrument at the data-analysis
level. Data reduction is the process of selecting, focusing, simplifying, abstracting, and
transforming the data that appear in field notes or transcriptions. Though in formal research
reports these steps are described separately, data reduction and analysis takes place throughout
the life cycle of a qualitative study. In addition, data reduction forms a part of the data analysis.
As an analytical process, data reduction sharpens sorts, focuses, discards and organizes data to
facilitate drawing final conclusions (Miles & Huberman, 1994).

At this stage, the researcher poses such questions as “What is going on here?” “What is the
nature of the phenomenon?” “What are the dimensions of the concept?” “What variations exist?”
and “What meanings/practices occur in lived experiences?” In the explanation stage, the
researcher establishes associations of phenomena by addressing questions such as “What is
happening here?” “What pattern exists?” “How do phenomena differ and relate to each other?”
and “How does it work?” (Miller & Crabtree, 1999).

There were three issues of concern at this stage. Those are: (i) The choice of a tool for data
reduction and analysis – inductive content analysis; (ii) preparing the data for analysis; and (iii)
coding. These issues are discussed in this section.

103

3.4.5.1

Inductive content analysis – a tool for data reduction and analysis

Data analysis is the process of reducing the data to meaningful accounts. Content analysis is the
most frequently used tool for the data -reduction process for qualitative textual data. One of the
various forms of content analysis, as found in the literature, is qualitative content analysis that
emphasizes an integrated view of speech/texts and their specific contexts. Qualitative content
analysis aims to examine meaning, themes and patterns that may manifest or be latent in a
particular text. It thus helps the researcher to understand social reality in a subjective manner
(Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009). This research used qualitative content analysis for data reduction
and analysis.

Qualitative content analysis, which was developed in order to explore the meanings underlying
physical messages, is mainly inductive, grounding the examination of topics and themes, as well
as the inferences drawn from the data. This technique is also used to generate theories. Samples
for qualitative content analysis usually consist of purposively selected texts which can inform the
research questions being investigated. Descriptions or typologies, along with participants’ views
of the social world are the outcome of qualitative content analysis. Thus it is helpful to
understand, by both researcher and the reader, the perspectives of the producers of the text (Berg,
2001).

A distinction has been made between two types of qualitative content analysis (Hsieh &
Shannon, 2005). One is conventional qualitative content analysis in which coding categories are
derived directly and inductively from the raw data with an aim to developing grounded theory.

104
The other is directed content analysis, in which the initial coding starts with a theory or relevant
research findings. Themes emerge from the data and are used to validate or extend a conceptual
framework or theory. The current research aligned more with directed content analysis as it used
a theoretical lens to raise the research questions brought to the analysis. However, the process
did not use any existing typologies. All themes were developed inductively from the text of the
transcription.

Deciding on the unit of analysis is a prerequisite and fundamental job for any coding task
(Weber, 1990). It is the basic unit of text that is to be assigned a category during the process of
content analysis. Unit definition can affect coding decisions and the comparability of outcomes
from similar other studies (De Wever, et.al. 2006). The emerging themes were of interest in this
study and hence they were considered the units of analysis. A theme may be attached to a single
word, a phrase, or any chunk of the text. When using themes as the coding unit it is the
expression of an idea which becomes the focus (Minichiello et al., 1990). Accordingly, during
the analysis process, a theme was attached to a chunk of text so long as it was sufficient to
represent the theme.

Though the analysis started with inductive coding, after a few transcripts were coded and
generated codes were reconciled in terms of definition, the existing codes became a starting point
for analyzing new transcripts. At that point, analyses were done by both deductive and inductive
mode. The iterative process of coding and selecting a new sample is summarized in Table-6.

This approach to coding was complemented by the constant comparison technique. Constant
comparison helped either to expand the properties of a code or to include a new code. Constant
comparison was applied at several levels – between two informants from the same organization,
and between two informants from different organizations.

3.4.5.2

Audio records to text – data preparation

For the most part, the entire audio records of all interviews were transcribed verbatim. There
were, however, exceptions. Occasionally, during the process of the interview, scientists
described the scientific theory of their work in too much depth. Sometimes, in the process of
describing how important their job was, they gave a very detailed account of the experiments
conducted by them. Verbatim transcriptions of such theoretical descriptions and laboratory
experiments were omitted. In the transcription record, a note was made, in such cases, indicating
that the audio in that part dealt with scientific theories and processes.

106

3.4.5.3

The coding process

As the researcher did not have access to any content analysis software, the coding task was
accomplished manually with the help of spreadsheet software. Each block of text to be coded
was tagged with an identifier, which was a combination of the code for the organization, a code
for the interviewee, and the block number. On the transcription document, each such block was
marked with the identifier and all codes that could be assigned to that block. Finally, each
identifier and its associated codes were transferred to a spreadsheet and the necessary sorting and
merging were done.

Demarcating each block of text for coding was a little problematic. Ideally, text could be broken
based on turn-taking between the researcher and the interviewee. But, these interviews did not
work in such a balanced way. This was because in the unstructured/semi-structured interview
process, interviewees were encouraged to speak more and the researcher controlled her speaking
to a bare minimum. The discussion, most of the time, did not follow a linear path. Participants, in
the middle of discussing one issue, referred to another related issue and switched over to that
issue. After some time, they were urged back to the original issue. Thus, the interview did not
always have enough continuity to chunk the text following a turn-taking strategy.

Coding was done through several passes guided by the theoretical lenses adopted in the study.
For example, the first pass was guided by the theoretical construct social actor. Every action of
information activity mentioned by an interviewee was marked and followed to locate the external
entity triggering that information activity. Those external entities were coded. In another pass,

107
those informational interactions were further examined to understand the kind of information
demand made by the external entities and how the interviewee was describing her/his experience
of information activity in response to that information demand. The nature of information
demands and the interviewees’ view of their information activities were coded. In subsequent
passes, which were guided by the concept of technologies-in-practice, the use of digital libraries
in terms of resources and features, and the factors leading to such uses were coded.

Constant comparison, leading to the discovery of the whole picture from its parts, is an essential
characteristic of inductive content analysis. Codes generated from two transcripts were reviewed
and compared and the necessary level of abstraction was adjusted. After a code list was
generated from the first two transcriptions, the text was again read to adjust in coding. Thus the
entire process went through cyclically. After all transcriptions from one of the organizations
were coded, the same was repeated for all transcriptions from the other organizations.

3.5

Lessons learned from the pilot study

As qualitative field research involves human beings at various levels, it may meet some
unexpected problems while conducting the study. The problem areas may be one of getting entry
into a site, getting access to documents and/or individuals, the mode of interview, the
interactions with the informants and many other considerations. Hence it is always helpful to
conduct a feasibility/pilot study before the study starts in full scale in order to check the
problems and think, beforehand, how to minimize those problems. To this end, a pilot study was
conducted with an objective to assess (i) the difficulties in getting access to an organization (ii)
the difficulties that the researcher would face during the actual process of interview.

108

Gaining the trust of the participants is very important and having a common acquaintance in each
organization was found to have worked successfully. Scientists are very busy organizational
members as most of them, apart from their research; have to serve on several committees within
and outside the organization. Thus the common acquaintance could help initially to get an
appointment date.

In addition, the way this research was conducted was unfamiliar to the scientists. They expected
a questionnaire to which they could respond with some thought. The initial discomfiture of the
participants of the pilot study made the researcher aware of this issue. As a result, during the
actual study, the introductory sessions were conducted carefully to convince the participants of
the reasons why an interview in the form of mutual discussion and not a questionnaire was
helpful. It was also important to make them understand the topic of the research in their own
language and how their participations were important.

It is also during the pilot study the benefit of a guided interview, rather than a totally
unstructured interview, was realized. Both during the pilot study and later too, it was found that
scientists are excited to talk about their experiments, research, and so on. As the flow of talk
went in that direction, the interviewee would neglect talking about the information-gathering
related question. Because of this, it was decided to conduct interviews in a guided manner. As an
aside, the interviewee in the pilot study and several others during main study confided to the
researcher that they enjoyed talking and it was a new experience for them.

109
The most difficult part of the interview was to make the participants see their information
gathering as a task of its own. Asking any question about when they engaged in informationgathering activities, the typical answer was “always.” Since information gathering as a process
has been so internalized by them and nowadays is a private activity not requiring them to go to
the library, it is very difficult for them to see those activities separately.

3.6

Some other related issues

Annual reports, newsletters, websites, and vision documents of the organizations were also
examined by the researcher. The researcher also searched for any public documents in which
policy regarding digital libraries or electronic resources was recorded. No such document,
however, was found. None of the documents consulted gave any special attention to this
resource. For example, annual reports routinely mentioned the expenditures of the library
including electronic resources. However, from the websites of both organizations it was clear
that resources are made visible to the users. Those documents were not conducive to any further
analysis for the purpose of triangulation, but they were very helpful in understanding the sites. A
discussion of this will be presented in the next chapter.

In fact, as the research focus was on the experience and meaning that participants attached to
their use of digital libraries, and not on any process flow, documentary sources cannot serve the
purpose of triangulation. Triangulation was partly achieved through constant comparison when
either two themes were collapsed or a new theme emerged from two different transcripts.

110
Another strategy was employed during the process of interviewing that partly served the purpose
of triangulation. After covering nearly half of the sample, some summary statements were
constructed out of some of the key themes that had emerged up to that point. During the
succeeding interviews, at the end of interviews, the participants were presented with such
statements and were asked to give their opinions or views on those statements. Participants
enthusiastically responded and gave their own examples in support of their agreement or
disagreement. This process was further extended to conduct a Delphi-like study which is
reported at the end of the document.

Though inductive content analysis was used for data analysis, the purpose of such analysis was
to help in discovering categories and their relationships – characteristics of a research obeying
the principle of emergent design. Hence inter-coder reliability, which is used to establish the
strength of codes when a codebook is deductively applied to a body of text, was not used in this
study. What was important was to validate whether the researcher identified an event correctly
and arrived at the categories without any bias. One of the ways this could be achieved is to make
another researcher present during the process of interviewing and subsequent coding. However,
this being dissertation research, such a process of validation could not be adopted. The alternate
way which was adopted here was to connect with another researcher. Regular weekly meetings
were held with her. She examined and commented on various decisions regarding arriving at
codes. This arrangement also met the criteria of peer debriefing. Peer debriefing is the process of
exposing the thought process of the researcher to a disinterested peer. The process helps the
researcher: to remain honest by allowing her biases being questioned; to test any emerging
hypothesis; to develop and test subsequent steps; and to clear the emotions and feelings that may
inhibit the judgment (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).

Chapter summary

This chapter presented the research paradigm, namely qualitative and naturalistic study, adopted
in this study and the rationale supporting this decision. The relevance of two important methods
– case study and field research – in the adopted research paradigm was discussed and it was
argued why this research could be considered more as a case study than field research. The
details of the research design included the process of case selection, sample selection,
methodological details of data-elicitation techniques, and data reduction and analysis techniques.
The transferability of findings of a naturalistic study to another setting is important and the
chapter ends with an account of the attempt towards establishing the transferability of the
findings of the current study.

CHAPTER 4: STUDY SITES

4.1

Chapter introduction

This research set its objective to examine how organizational and social contexts shape the use of
digital libraries and whether differences in the practice of DL use can be attributed to the
differences in those organizational and social contexts. To this end, the research questions were:
(i) What are the various patterns of interactions in which people as social actors, in Indian
academic and research institutes engage in meeting the demands of their social world? (ii) How
do information-gathering practices help those social actors meet the institutional forces of those
interactions? (iii) What are the various emergent practices of use of digital libraries, both at the
digital library level as a whole and at the feature level? (iv) How do different extra- and intraorganizational factors contribute to such practices?

In order to find out answers to these questions, followings issues were looked at:


What are the components of the contexts of the members of an academic and research
organization?



What are the institutional natures of those components?



What kind of information demand is made by those components on organizational
members?



How does information-gathering practice help those organizational members in meeting
such information demand?

113


In the process of consulting digital libraries, in order to support such informationgathering activities, what are the properties that are visible to those organizational
members and are used recurrently? and



What contributes to make some properties more visible than others?

These research questions were framed with the intention of developing an account of the context
of digital-library use. It was thus necessary to develop a boundary surrounding digital-library
use. This boundary was to serve as the context of use. This process of observing phenomena
within a boundary is referred to as case study (Yin, 1994). In this study, this boundary or the
context was operationalized as an organization. The scope of the organizational and social
context was restricted, in this study, to academic and research institutes in India. As discussed in
one of the previous chapters, selections of organizations/cases were achieved through purposive
sampling. This study required that selected cases must have access to digital/electronic
collections adequately and must be well equipped with ICT infrastructure18 to make those
resources usable by the members of the organizations. As a multiple case study, two
organizations were selected for this purpose.

In order to observe variations or similarities in digital-library use, the organizations were chosen
to be sufficiently different from each other. ORG1 and ORG2 were selected as two cases that
differ from each other with respect to the field of specialization as well as type of organization. A
field of specialization is a recognized area of scholarly activities. The role of disciplinary
differences or field of specialization in various information practices is already discussed in the

18

ICT infrastructure includes primarily Internet connectivity, local area network within the organization, computers etc. which
are required to access data residing on a server – within or outside the organization.

114
literature. The field of specialization of an organization makes it different from an organization
of another specialty. However, in order to make the findings comparable, there should be some
similarities between fields of specialization selected for the study. Hence, two applied fields, one
in the area of heavy industries and the other in the area of biotechnology were chosen. In
addition, the difference in context was also accentuated by selecting different types of
organization.

ORG1’s specialization pertains to heavy industries that handle minerals, metals and other nonorganic materials. As quite a few informants described, some parts in this area of specialization
have become very conventional and this discipline now devotes itself mostly either to developing
processes that can lead to better quality of materials or to developing new materials that can be
used by other industries. Better quality materials can support operations of large existing
industries such as metal industries, power industries, construction industries where quality of
material in the infrastructure/equipment can contribute to the operational cost. The second area is
more challenging. Not only is the applicability of new materials but also finding the areas where
new materials will be applicable is a big task for the researchers in this organization.

ORG2 was selected as it contributes to the area of Biotechnology. Biotechnology is a
comparatively new discipline with tremendous potential for contributing to more pressing
demands of society such as food, medicine, and so on. New drugs, new genetically developed
plant seeds are examples of such items. Biotechnology as a discipline was also selected in order
to be able to compare the findings with the literature (Lamb & Kling, 2003). Choosing
Biotechnology as discipline of research in an academic and research organization enabled
comparing the findings from an academic and research organization to those from an industry.

115

Structurally, ORG1 and ORG2 are quite different, though both can be labeled as government
funded organizations. More details about the relation between government funding and these two
organizations are given in the following sections. The precise structural difference between these
two organizations is that ORG1 is mandated to work for industries and to produce income for
self-sustenance while ORG2 has no such mandate and pursues research in developing basic
understanding of the field. The mandate for ORG1 has an implication – it is supposed to do
research that has value to industries within and/or across countries.

The eliciting of the context is the result of a combination of information gleaned from the public
domain documents such as annual reports, newsletters as well as the information emerging from
the interviews conducted with scientists, librarians and officials in charge of the ICT
infrastructure of the respective organizations. It is worth mentioning here that official public
documents provide dispassionate important facts about an organization. Though such facts are
important to understand the organization, its members’ views are equally important in this
regard. Discourse of the members can reveal, as we will see, many interesting aspects of an
organization.

The following two sections portray both the organizations selected for the study in terms of
history, evolution, and administrative structure. Though the case study method focuses only on
current phenomena, a historical perspective of any organization helps to understand how it has
been evolving over the years. The following sections examine how the evolved organizational
policy connects the scientists of these organizations to external interactions. Each of the
following sections has been structured as: brief history of formation and evolution, current

116
governance structure, and how the scientists view their organizational activities. These
descriptions help understand the activities of an organizations. Further the ICT infrastructure,
library and digital library facilities of each organization are described.

4.2

Organizational view of ORG1

4.2.1 Brief History of ORG1

ORG1 is devoted to the research pertaining to the development of non-organic materials,
including minerals and metals. Its research areas align with those of heavy industry. It was set up
with a view to make the country self-sufficient with technologies that require the use of these
materials.

4.2.2 Governing structure of ORG1
ORG1 is governed and controlled by the Government through an appointed agency. The policy,
staff structure, salary structure of staff and almost all organizational rules are controlled by the
government. All organizational level policies originate from the government and are
implemented at ORG1. While implementing some policies, ORG1 adds its own perspective.

ORG1, locally, is governed by one research council and one management Council. The research
council comprises external experts from industry and academic institutions as well as the head of
ORG1 and some of its scientists. The management council is comprises the head of ORG1 and

117
its scientists. While the research council guides ORG1 in intellectual activities, management
council looks after the administrative aspect of the organization.

4.2.3 Evolution of ORG1 over years
ORG1 has evolved and changed greatly, in terms of research policy, over the years and was still
found to be changing while the interviews were being conducted. While documents such as the
annual report provided a factual account of the growth of the organization, the evolution over
this period, as viewed by the organizational members, could be captured from informants’
accounts. The interviews in ORG1 were conducted first in 2009 and again in 2012. As a
government service holder in India normally retires at the age of sixty, there was no one found in
2009 who joined ORG1 in the late sixties or seventies and could talk about the organizational
policies of earlier days. There was, however, one informant who joined the organization in the
early eighties and could describe, from his memory, how the organization used to be prior to the
mid-eighties. In addition, several informants referred to changes they had witnessed. From these
interviews it could be inferred that ORG1 continued, since its inception, under one philosophy
until almost the mid-eighties when the winds of change started blowing. In fact the impetus of
such changes was so great that issue returned time and again in the interviews of almost all
informants.

Before the mid-eighties, ORG1 was a typical government organization in the sense that the
government used to bear all its expenditures. It also paid for the research done in the
organization.
“ earlier in 80s we were not much bothered about sponsorship project – not much of such
projects – <govt> itself was giving almost all the funding – and at that point of time, I
think even if you go – prior to 80s – <govt> used to fund 100% for development of

118
technology – from bench scale to the large scale even pilot plant scale – all funding from
<govt> – hardly any funding other sources” – ORG1-SCT3-01.
Those research projects were based on, most probably, issues decided by individual scientists.
There are frank admissions that in those days there was not much accountability on the part of
ORG1 scientists. If the research was brought to the organization, it was carried out, but scientists
themselves never took any initiative to bring in projects.
“one thing that has happened over the years. . if you think of last fifteen years and it
has intensified thru the last 6-8 years . . there has been lot of pressure to take of lot of
projects with the purpose of earning money and also delivering good scientific
output . . if I compare with the situation when I joined 18 years ago, ... . , there was
not much pressure on senior people to deliver projects within time to earn money . . .
the feeling was that the jobs will come. . . . jobs will be obtained by the Director or
the government or people who are interested in getting the jobs. . . it will
automatically <come> to me. . if it comes, I will do. . if it does not come I do not have
to look for it” – ORG1-SCT7-01

Major changes, in terms of policies, started taking place in the mid-eighties when government
funds started dwindling. The current policies of ORG1 are mostly within the frame that started in
the mid-eighties when government began cutting funds. After paying the salary of the
employees, the remainder was hardly enough to conduct research or install facilities for
conducting research. At that time, government initiated a policy which had two major aspects,
namely, revenue generation and career advancement. Emphasis was placed on generating
revenue by ORG1. The idea was that ORG1 and similar organizations must earn a third of their
annual revenues from external sources. It was not that ORG1 was not earning anything at that
time, but setting the target at one-third of annual revenue was quite a high standard to achieve in
the mid-eighties. This implied that ORG1, in order to sustain its research activities, must find
resources on its own.

119
The other aspect of the new policy was linking career advancement to various activities,
including publications. From the mid-eighties, importance was placed on the productivity of
scientists in terms of number of publications. This productivity was reflected during the annual
assessments. Emphasis was placed not only on the number of publications but also on the quality
of the journals. The notion of “impact factor” of journals, as a measure of quality of journals was
introduced. Table-7 shows a decade-wise journal publication pattern by ORG1 scientists.

It is evident from the Table-7 and Table-8 that the number of publications in international
journals started rising from the late-eighties. Considering several factors such as (i) publication
in journals is always time consuming since there are long wait-lists and such time was far greater
in non-Internet days; and (ii) ORG1 could not afford to buy many international journals because
of the lack of funding in the late eighties to nineties, it can be inferred that the new policy
certainly had a correlation with the spate of publication in international journals. During this
period, stress was also placed on patent filing, which was linked to career advancement.

When external environments change, someone is required within the organization to implement
those changes. Along with the external changes occurring outside ORG1 in the mid-eighties,
internal changes happened through a newly appointed young director who brought many new
ideas and attempted to implement those ideas not only in research but also in the regular
administration of the organization. He started recruiting young scientists (at the time the average
age of scientists was quite high) and attempted to bring funds from other organizations for
research. Those scientists who were appointed during his tenure still fondly remember the way
he brought new ideas to ORG1.

“…in the mid-80s and beyond – that was exactly the time when <name of the Director> joined –
and so after he joined, slowly the perspective changed – and by that time we already had certain
technology . .. but then putting up a plant and developing technology are two different ball
games – but then <the Director> was able to push thru development and there were takers . . we

121
transferred this technology to a party. … and that was the time when the change in policy of
<govt> – the interaction with entrepreneurs, industry and even gov’t funded agency started –
when you were supposed to get the funding .. .. but then slowly this approach was propagated by
people- there were takers – in fact – since then we started getting a lot of funding from gov’t
sector as well as private and if you just look at the present – perhaps 30-40% funding which we
are getting today thru from primary source” – ORG1-SCT3-03/05
Looking through the eyes of the ORG1 scientists in 2009, the evolution can be summarized as:


Until the mid-80s, ORG1 was not asked to generate revenue;



Even after the new change was introduced, the culture of passivity to bring funds
remained for a long period. Now, scientists at all levels except entry level, are engaged in
bringing funds through research projects;



The majority of external sources came from other government agencies beyond CSIR.

Over time, the dependence on government funding has been reduced, though even in the
beginning of the change, bringing projects and funds were the Director’s responsibility. This
culture, of course, started changing within the organization. New scientists joining ORG1 were
given some support initially but were also told to bring their own funds without which it would
be difficult for them to sustain their research activities.

“in today’s scenario – if a scientist does not have his project of his own, perhaps <ORG1>
may not be able to support his travel all the time – we have understanding – we are funding
each to go once for a seminar – if anyone wants to go more, we say sorry you have to have
your own finding – that is the kind of pressure.. pressure to the people…..– limit to govt
funding – if we have to go and flourish then you have to have your own purse and use the
money from that purse and go ahead” – ORG1-SCT3-11
Over a period of time, the internal culture of ORG1 changed to such an extent that currently all
scientists, except those who join at junior-most level, compete externally for bringing project and
funds.

122

“I think in last 8 years it has come to a state when all scientists, even at junior level. .
<mentions the ranks of junior scientists> may not have that pressure in terms of obtaining
or interfacing with the outer world… but surely ..<mentions the rank of senior scientists>
onwards are expected that they will interface with the outside world and obtain funds” –
ORG1-SCT7-04
This certainly had another effect. Contrary to earlier times, when only the Director or seniorlevel scientists were getting recognition, recognition started percolating down to lower level
scientists too.

“last ten years we are much better recognized. . individual scientists are better recognized.
.. thru awards, recognition than they were in nineties. in eighties or nineties, only directors
were recognized nationally . . now there are quite a few people who are now nationally and
even internationally ..” ORG1-SCT4-05
Government funding still remains a major source of revenue of ORG1. However, that source is
no longer guaranteed. ORG1 scientists now go to various government agencies that fund
projects. Mostly those projects are of three-year duration and with moderate financial support.
Some apex body of the Government of India also fund projects but those projects are mostly very
large and require networking or the participation of more than one organization. Such projects
result in building up research facilities in terms of equipment, laboratory, and so on, in ORG1. In
industrial research, an organization can certainly carry on research, provided it has its own
facilities. Several informants confidently declared that the infrastructural facility in the
organization now is one of the best in the world, and when such facilities exist, research offers
are bound to come to any organization.

“..and that is a very major. . . .probably most important difference. .nineties we did not
have funds. . because there is lot of funding there are lots of facilities. . we have best
characterization facility in the world. . forget about India. .if there are facilities, researches
should come “.. ORG1-SCT4-09

123

Simultaneously, throughout this period, ORG1 served industries in a very specific way. One of
the ways is to conduct various tests on behalf of other industries using various organizational
facilities. The other way is to solve specific problems submitted by individual industries. These
two types of projects generated a good amount of funds. At the same time, scientists also
interacted with industries in a different way. Scientists were participating in research projects for
which problems were identified jointly by industries and ORG1, though funding was provided by
government. Subsequently the projects were monitored by industries too.

However, in 2012 when this researcher visited ORG1 for a second set of data collection, another
change could be sensed. A new director had joined and “earning revenue” had taken a different
direction. Instead of getting government funding and carrying on research of a basic nature, the
priority has changed to research and service for industries and taking less government-funded
basic research. The emphasis is now more on a pro-active role towards industries. The objective
is to market the knowledge developed to industries. This new policy, taken at the ORG1 level, is
making ORG1 scientists look for avenues for making them visible and acceptable to industries
though ORG1 scientists are confident that they are the best in the country in several areas.
Several informants were of the opinion that there is hardly any competition within the country as
the field is very specialized and ORG1 has developed substantial knowledge in the area, along
with a state-of-the-art facility.

124

4.2.4 ORG1 scientists’ view of their activities
Overall, ORG1 scientists feel that they are mandated to bring research projects that will show
their contribution to the “earning capacity” of the laboratory. It is a general feeling that the
organization has changed substantially in the last 8 to 10 years. Reward is something that is no
longer limited to top people; even juniors are now recognized for their contributions.

Scientists view those research projects that are funded by government grants and that are also
directed to develop basic knowledge as an opportunity for development of infrastructure and a
diving board for getting their papers published in good journals. Infrastructure is always a
requirement, and publications in good journals make up the prerequisites for an upward career
path. According to several scientists, it is difficult to get papers published in good journals out of
research done for industries. Some informants also view those government-funded projects as a
relaxed way of doing research because it was not as critical that the outcomes of those projects
were really transferrable to industry. Submitting a report at the end of the project was all what
was required. It appears that outcomes of those research projects did not matter but outputs in
terms of papers and patents helped scientists to get rewarded in their careers.

4.2.5 The ICT infrastructure in ORG1
A digital library is an ICT-enabled tool. Hence any discussion on digital-library use within an
organization is not possible without an understanding of the ICT infrastructure in the
organization. ICT infrastructure in an organization means the arrangement that facilitates a user’s

125
working in a computerized environment. It includes access to computers, printers, network
connectivity, Internet bandwidth, and so on.

Scientists recollect the past when the ICT infrastructure was not so good. Each division had a
central computing facility where computers, and hence Internet accessibility, used to be shared
by more than one scientist. Currently, ORG1 has a satisfactory ICT facility. All scientists are
given computers in their workplaces. Besides, many scientists include provision of a computer in
their project costs – thus upgrading the configuration of their current computers. Some scientists
have more than one computer. The entire laboratory building is connected on a computer
network. The Internet bandwidth availed by the laboratory is 100 MBPS. This connectivity is
also provided by the government under the National Knowledge Network (NKN)19 scheme. Prior
to this facility, the Internet bandwidth available to the laboratory was 10 MBPS. At the time
when this researcher visited the laboratory, computers were found at each scientist’s work desk,
placed in a way that is most convenient for the scientists to work without leaving the work table.

In addition, the library is also equipped with computing facility. There are several computers in
the users’ area of the library. Those terminals, however, were found to be used only by nonscientific workers. During the time spent in the library, the researcher did not see any scientist
using the computers there.

19

The NKN is a state-of-the-art multi-gigabit pan-India network for providing a unified high speed network backbone for all
knowledge related institutions in the country. The purpose of such a knowledge network goes to the very core of the country's
quest for building quality institutions with requisite research facilities and creating a pool of highly trained professionals. The
NKN will enable scientists, researchers and students from different backgrounds and diverse geographies to work closely for
advancing human development in critical and emerging areas.

126

4.2.6 The library and the digital library in ORG1
In mid-nineties, library faced a resource crunch due to the shortage of fund. Retaining the
subscription list over a period of years was a difficult task. Notwithstanding this financial
difficulty, a computerized database service from M/s Dialog Inc was introduced in 1990. This
introduction was to comply with one of the prerequisites of a large research project for which the
World Bank gave a huge loan. Subsequently, in the following years, ORG1 started subscribing to
such information storage and retrieval services, issued by Dialog Inc., on CDROM. Scientists did
not have much experience in handling the search system on their own. The online service of
Dialog Inc. used to be accessed through a telex service. For every request put to the search
service, the search intermediary used to prepare a detailed search strategy in consultation with
the user. Then, she used to access those services from the telex terminal. Finally, the search
output was received by ORG1 through the postal service.

When the online service was switched over to a CD-ROM system, the same process flow
continued. The only difference was that output was available immediately after the search.
Occasionally scientists used to conduct their own search sessions. In those days, however, such
information storage and retrieval services did not provide access to actual content beyond the
citation information. Thus there was always a gap between the content demand of the scientists
and the information that could be obtained through such information services. To some extent
this gap was reduced by using the Document Delivery services from British Library Document
Supply Center.

127
Current access to large numbers of electronic resources has been possible due to an intervention
of the government in the form of a government-supported centrally funded consortium that was
formed including ORG1 and similar other organizations. Thus, despite funding problems at the
local level, which still remains (as revealed the current librarian), ORG1 scientists were able to
access a large number of electronic resources.

All these resources are well organized on the website of the library. From time to time, users’
training programs are conducted by the publishers’ representatives. As one scientist stated, they
had already learned much on their own but such sessions are helpful. Most of the time, searches
are conducted by the scientists themselves, but occasionally they deliver the search job to the
library as well.

4.2.7 Demographic information about the informants from ORG1
In order to understand the researcher population within the organization, annual reports of ORG1
were examined. According to the annual report, there are four divisions and two centers that
pursue scientific research in ORG1. These divisions and centers contribute to research in seven
areas. Besides, R&D services such as consultancy service are provided in six areas. Total
number of scientists eligible for bringing funds for research projects, in those divisions and
centers was 85. The authority was very kind to disclose a list of ongoing projects and the
scientists involved in those research projects. This master project list showed that 64 scientists
were active in various research projects. This helped to select informants who had live projects.
Out of those 64 scientists, 15 participated in this research. There were three female scientists out
of 15 informants. All those 15 scientists held highest academic degree, namely, Ph.D. in their

128
respective areas and three of them received their degrees from universities in the USA and
Europe. Most of the informants visited academic institutions abroad All informants had been
working in the organizations, at least for ten years implying that all of them were completely
encultured with the policies of ORG1.

4.2.8 Summary
Overall, ORG1 is a changed organization and such changes are felt by scientists in intervals of
every 8 to 10 years. From the discussions with scientists, an urge to “earn” by the scientists was
very evident. There was a sense of concern regarding industries’ acceptance of the work and at
the same time there was complacency regarding the capability of the laboratory. That scientists
in ORG1 are mandated was evident from the discussions. At the same time, scientists also felt
concerned about their future course of action in view of the recently introduced organizational
policy. The organization is also fairly up-to-date in terms of the ICT infrastructure and has access
to substantial numbers of electronic resources.

4.3

The Organizational view of ORG2

4.3.1 A brief history of ORG2
ORG2 was founded with the purpose of investigating the many and ever-opening problems of
the nascent science that includes both life and non-life. The earlier organizational structure of the
Institute could not be traced directly. From external sources like Wikipedia, some information in
this regard was collected. Initially, the organization was funded through donations. For many

129
years, it was a part of a university. Finally, in the mid-eighties, the ORG2 was brought under one
of the agencies of Government of India, as a grant-in-aid autonomous body. The term grant-inaid implies that its research function depends on various grants available from different
government agencies.

4.3.2 The governing structure of ORG2
ORG2 has a Governing Body comprising several members from both inside and outside the
Institute, and the Director of ORG2 is the Secretary of the body. The management of the Institute
is vested with council comprising members from the Government of India, and nominees from
the Governing Body with the Director of ORG2. There is a reference to the Research Advisory
Council but details are not available. The first report of the formation of a Scientific Advisory
Council was traced in the newsletter published in 1995. Apparently, the first review of scientific
works done by the Institute was conducted in 1995. Another review committee’s reference was
found in the newsletter published in 1997. The review committee, according to the newsletter,
was to review and suggest greater effectiveness of the organization and to suggest newer areas of
research in next 10 years. This researcher could not find the outcomes of that review in any of
the institutional documents.

ORG2 is also a government organization in terms of organizational rules, pay structure etc.
Annual reports of several years mention receiving grants from the Government of India. In order
to understand the types of funds received by ORG2, audited reports of few years were reviewed,
revealing that “grants” and “services” are two major sources of earnings at ORG2. ORG2’s
newsletter regularly publishes the details of projects received, including funding. Without any

130
exceptions, all such projects were found to be funded by some government agencies and a few of
those projects were funded by some international agencies. Hence, it could be inferred that
ORG2’s main revenues are research funds from various government agencies. Compared to
“grants,” earning through “services” was very much less common.

4.3.3 The evolution of ORG2 as an organization
As mentioned, ORG2 was part of a university for many years. It still has a strong and distinct
flavor of an academic organization. Though in annual reports/newsletters, science workers are
referred to as scientists; the designations of those scientists within the Institute are Professor,
Associate Professor or Assistant Professor. Most probably these were the designations followed
when the Institute was a part of the local university, and the same trend has continued. The
Institute houses doctoral students registered with various universities.

The Institute is engaged in doing research in multiple areas. It started initially with basic
sciences, but later on added many new disciplines. The discussions with informants did not
reveal any major shake-up within the organization in the last few years. Though the number of
informants from this organization was very few, all of them have been attached to the Institute
for many years.

Unlike ORG1, publications did not find any special mention in the discussions with ORG2. This
does not mean that ORG2 is not engaged in publication activities – publications form a part of
the scientific life of ORG2 scientists and there are associated awards for publications. Table-9
shows a decade-wise journal publication pattern by ORG2 scientists.

Both the tables (9 & 10) indicate international journals always got higher importance than local
journals for publishing. This is just the opposite to what was observed for ORG1. One possible
reason for this stress in international journals may be the academic nature of the organization. It
may be recollected here that ORG2 has many divisions other than Biotechnology related area.

132
The above table reflects the publication pattern for the areas engaged in Biotechnology and not
for the entire organization.

For the purpose of this research, those who are working in the area of bio-technology were
invited to participate. As such, there is no single institute in this part of India that devotes itself
exclusively to bio-technology. Researchers in this area are part of research institutes that also
carry research in related or other areas.

4.3.4 ORG2 scientists’ views about their activities
Contrary to ORG1 scientists, ORG2 scientists say they do not feel mandated and have the
freedom of pursuing any research that they find interesting. In fact, during the discussion, some
participants directly made this comparison with ORG1 like organizations. There was no sense of
urgency, during discussion, on “earning,” though they confirmed that they have to bring in
projects from outside. However, ORG2 scientists were more concerned about publications and
the reputation of such publications.

ORG2 scientists do not see any big perceivable change in the Institute’s policy within the last
few years. A mention of reviewing the performance of scientists by the government, as found in
the newsletter, was made by one scientist only. This scientist also mentioned how as preparatory
work of that evaluation, impact factor of journals where they published, could be used as
measure of their productivity.

4.3.5 The ICT infrastructure in ORG2
The ICT infrastructure in ORG2 is quite comparable with that of ORG1. During the time spent in
ORG2, the researcher observed that scientists have their own computers in their offices. The
Institute has a network covering the entire building and thus scientists can access the Internet
from their rooms. The Institute, like ORG1 is also using NKN’s Internet facility of 100MBPS
bandwidth. Prior to this facility, the Internet bandwidth availed by the Institute was 10 MBPS.

Until a few years ago, ORG2 informants had a sharing system with respect to ICT infrastructure
similar to the situation in ORG1. The Institute’s Bioinformatics Center used to house all
discipline-related information resources available in CD-ROM. Even for some time afterwards,
the Internet used to be available from the Bioinformatics Center. Scientists could compare the
current facility with the older facility in terms of comfort of access and privacy of using the ICT
infrastructure.

The Library of ORG2 is also connected to the Internet and there are a few computers for users.
However, all participants told this researcher that they use the facility from their offices. Going
to the Library is required when they want to consult a print copy of books and other materials.

4.3.6 The library and the digital library in ORG2
The history of ORG2 library is not much different from that of ORG1 library. At one time there
was a severe funding problem. The situation has improved during the electronic era, particularly
after the formation of various government-supported e-resource procurement consortia.

134
ORG2 never had the experience of using online information services. However, the Institute
started procuring information resources on CD-ROM as the technology came onto the market.
There was, however, a gap between the content demand and information provided by CD-ROM
services. The participants reported that it was a common practice at one time for them to get a
copy of the paper by requesting it from the author or through some friends working in different
universities worldwide.

The electronic resource section of the library is fairly organized through the website of the
library. The digital collection includes subscription databases, e-journals as well as local
collections of papers published by the scientists of the Institute, annual reports, newsletters, and
so on.

4.3.7 Demographic information about informants from ORG2
This researcher could examine the annual reports for ORG2. ORG2 had seven departments and
three centers. Those seven departments include physical sciences such as physics, chemistry, and
along with more modern areas such as molecular medicine. A small group within ORG2 pursues
research in the area of Biotechnology. Total number of scientists in this group was found to be
seven. Because of this small number, attempt was made to interview all scientists. However,
three scientists finally participated. There were two female scientists among the informants All
three scientists held the highest Ph.D. degree from Indian universities. Two of them mentioned
about their further studies in various North American and European universities. All of them had
been working in ORG2 for more than fifteen years.

135

4.3.8 Summary
ORG2, from its scientists’ perspective, has not undergone any major change over the years. It is
still dedicated to basic research. The scientists of the institute feel they are not mandated enjoy
great freedom to pursue any research in which they are interested. The organization has a
satisfactory ICT infrastructure. It is a beneficiary of the government’s initiative of providing
Internet facility to the individual organization as well as through an e-resource procurement
consortium. The digital collection of ORG2 is made up of databases, e-journals, e-books, and a
locally developed digitized collection of reprints, annual reports and many other types of local
resources.

4.4

Chapter summary

This chapter provided a brief description of ORG1 and ORG2, two organizations selected as
cases, in terms of their activities, ICT infrastructure and digital libraries to which the members of
each of the institutes have access. Though the ICT infrastructure and the characteristics of the
digital libraries are comparable for these two organizations, the nature of activities differs. While
ORG1 is dedicated to serving the industrial requirements of the country and as an organization
its scientists are concerned with earning while doing research, ORG2 is dedicated to basic
research and earning is not a concern for its scientists. Whether such differences in
organizational activities are reflected in the digital-library use by the scientists of each of these
organizations was examined in this study.

CHAPTER 5: INFORMATION GATHERING PRACTICES OF
SCIENTISTS
5.1

Chapter introduction

The overarching question of this research is how is the practice of digital-library use by people in
Indian academic and research institutes being shaped by organizational and social contexts? This
question is divided in two parts. Since digital-library use is very much related to informationgathering practices, the first part focusses on the relation between context and informationgathering practices of scientists20 (RQ1# How does the social world of an organizational member
influence and shape her/his information-gathering practice?). Scientists are referred to here as
organizational members and the social world implies their context. The second part identifies
various issues that contribute to digital-library use in support of information-gathering practices
by these scientists (RQ2# what are the various extra- and intra-organizational factors mediating
the practice of digital-library use in information gathering activities of organizational
members?).This chapter is devoted to the first part (RQ1).

In investigating information-gathering practices (RQ1), systematic studies were conducted in
two different but related directions. Along one direction, were the components of context with
which scientists have to interact and the ways in which each component triggers informationgathering practices (RQ1(a)# What are the various patterns of interactions in which people as
social actors, in Indian academic and research institutes, engage in meeting the demands of their
social world? ). The other direction of the investigation was how these scientists view their
20

The methodological issues of foregrounding information gathering practices are discussed in more details in Chapter-3.

137
information-gathering practices with respect to their interactions with various components of
their social world (RQ1(b)# How do information-gathering practices help those social actors
meet the institutional forces of those interactions?).

Identifying the components of context on such a large canvass was an important task. This was
accomplished in two steps. First, the scope of the context was limited to an organizational
context since the policy and goals of an organization drive the work of their scientists. In the
second step, this organizational context was viewed through the lens of a theoretical construct,
namely social actor, and this helped in identifying the followings:



The components of the organizational context, with which the scientists have to interact;



The demand of information exchanges in such interactions leading to informationgathering practices by those scientists;



The characteristics of information exchanges that take place between scientists and their
organizational context; and



How do such information exchanges (and information gathering in that process) help
scientists.

A clarification on some terms used seems appropriate here. There are references to two actions,
namely, “information gathering” that is used in the research question (RQ1#b) and “information
exchange” used above. Another term “information demand” is also used frequently in the text.
These are different but related terms. As a scientist interacts to an external entity, she
understands that some of those interactions demand support of information. This is “information
demand”. As a result, the scientist engages in “information gathering” (using Dl or non-DL

138
resources). Subsequently, the scientist exchanges those information (information exchange) in
order to make the interaction fruitful. Figure-4 depicts the relation between these actions:

To begin with, a brief discussion on some concepts and issues related to this research may be
helpful. To this end, the rest of this introductory section


Recapitulates some important concepts and issues of this research;



Revisits the relevant literature and develops a structure to theoretically link the
findings of this research;

139
o Highlights the relationship between the theoretical discussion and the research
questions.

5.1.1 Important concepts and issues of the research

In this section, the important concepts and issues related to this research are briefly described.
More detailed discussions on these issues can be found in Chapter-2. The main concepts
addressed in this research are digital libraries, its use and context.

The term digital library, in this research, denotes a wide array of electronic resources of
following characteristics:


Contents of digital libraries may be either developed locally or developed/aggregated by
commercial publishers/aggregators;



Digital libraries may be hosted on a local network or may be Internet based;



Digital libraries may cover specific websites or may be an organized collection of webbased contents.

The term “digital-library use” or simply use excludes the notion of download statistics or any
other usage statistics, though the discussion sometimes may refer to such usage. Digital-library
use is the incidence of consulting digital libraries for the purpose of information gathering. It also
refers to connecting to specific electronic resources and exploiting one or more specific features
of digital libraries. As the data for this research is collected from users’ description, it was not
possible to associate this aspect of use to actual download statistics. Download statistics is based

140
on every time a specific IP of a computer performs an action in a publisher’s site and cannot
connect to the activities of a specific user. Thus it was not possible to quantify the use from the
discussions with the informants.

Context is another concept in this research. Context is construed as the organizations whose
members have access to and use digital libraries in order to perform organizational work.

Social actor is the theoretical construct which forms a conceptual pillar in this research. Social
actors are members of an organization and their organizational behaviors are responses to their
workplace demands. These workplace demands arise because scientists have to interact with
various individuals and organizations external to their respective workplace. In this research,
scientists are conceptualized as social actor and information gathering is conceptualized as their
organizational behavior as a response to their workplace demand.

Chapter-3 covers in more details why information-gathering activity has been brought to focus in
this research. Digital-library use is essentially related to information gathering activities. But
using the term digital library or any other similar technology-laden term might have been
counterproductive in eliciting the true picture if some of the informants were not comfortable
with technology. They might have been tempted to provide what they perceive as the right
answer and not the actual information-gathering practice using digital libraries. In order to take
precaution for this possible situation, the notion of social actor is connected to information
gathering and later it is examined (presented in Chapter-6) how such information gathering
action is related to using digital libraries.

141

5.1.2 Theoretical background

A literature based overview of social actor and its deployment in operationalizing organizational
context are relevant at this point. One major task of a context based study of information need,
seeking and use is to disambiguate what constitutes context and how context is understood by the
participants of studies (Courtright, 2007). The first disambiguation was done by considering the
organization as the boundary of the context. The second disambiguation was required to identify
what exactly are the components in an organization that play playing a role in the informationgathering practices of scientists. Theoretical support was brought into the picture in order to
make a systematic approach to reveal the features of organization-as-context which can then be
further studied. The construct social actor was used to this end.

Social actor was conceptualized based on the notion of an open natural system and an
institutionalized organization. As already described, organizational members in natural system
develop informal relation with others that shape their values and existence. Additionally, in open
system, external relationship such as suppliers, clients and other institutions influence the
organizational behavior (Scott, 1992). Institutions are made up of cognitive, normative and
regulative structures and activities. Institutions are one important social force that shapes
behavior and also gives legitimacy to that behavior. Institutions are transported by various
carriers, namely culture, structures and routines. The cognitive structure is the important feature
of new institutional view. It posits that many choices of organizational actors are governed by
highly routinized habits, scripts, rote actions, and imitation of elites (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991).

142
Information use, as the literature suggests, can be richly described by examining the environment
of an organization, along the lines of an open natural system. Complex activities such as work
habits, patterns of legitimation in a social group, and organizational politics were found to
provide more enduring explanations of digital-library use than those based on changing
technology (Covi & Kling, 1996). Memberships of various communities outside the
organizational boundary also contribute to various information activities. These communities can
be formed based on specific jobs, such as police (Allen & Shoard, 2005), or on professions or
academic disciplines. Discipline-specific skills of researchers that take shape from work
characteristics could be used to explain digital-library use within universities (Covi, 1999). This
study also highlights the role of the invisible college21 in this regard. Invisible college is all about
publications and peer review. Faculty members in that study were found to be highly concerned
about others acknowledging the originality of their findings and giving credit. Such
acknowledgement is important for their tenure, promotion and raise. This study found the digitallibrary use by university researchers strongly influenced by the social characteristics of scholarly
research activities and effective digital-library use takes place when users can integrate these
resources into socially legitimated and legitimate-able ways of working (Covi, 1999).

Social actor is a new institutional view of users and looks at their ICT use in their everyday
interactions with various institutionalized systems residing outside their respective organizations
(Lamb & Kling, 2003). This view highlights these actors’ relationships with those who have
requested information or whom they are trying to persuade with information gathered and
packaged through the use of ICTs. Within the larger context of an organizational environment,

21

An invisible college is defined as a geographically distributed set of colleagues in a particular research specialty who are the
peers that judge and legitimize research contribution (Price, 1963; Crane, 1972).

143
information gathering can be conceptualized as a way to meet the demands of various social
interactions developed out of various relations. The exchange of information can be a part of
organizational behavior which can be influenced by inter-organizational relationships (Blau,
1964; Hall et al., 1976; Alexander. 1995). An industry level study can provide descriptions of
how informational exchanges become integral to obtaining and sustaining legitimacy (Lamb,
King & Kling, 2003). For example, a biotech company’s obligation to obtain an approval from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prior to selling a medicine reveals the relation between
an organization and a regulatory agency. Interactions developed out of such relations result in an
explicit information exchange, for example, producing a report based on collected information.
The information exchange takes place through a report, prepared by the drug companies, that
includes citations to what has been published about the drug, its compounds, and its medical
application (Lamb, King, & Kling, 2003). All these exchanges are believed to be “legitimate
ways” of interaction. Another important characteristic of such information exchanges is that all
such exchanges take place through formal reporting. In the current research, as we will find later,
information exchange also takes place informally.

Information gathering is an outcome of these relational requirements and a link becomes
discernible between the institutional influences that play a role in the environment and the
information-gathering practices. This relational requirement not only makes the context explicit,
but it also accounts for why in some cases, information gathering does not scale up to the
expectation. The smaller the institutional pressures in an interaction, the smaller may be the
intensity of information-gathering practices (Lamb & Kling, 2003).

144
This construct of social actor has been extended to academic and research organizations selected
as cases for the present study. The premise was that focusing on social actor, one should be able
to trace various other institutionalized systems outside the boundary of the social actor’s
organization, interactions that take place between these institutionalized systems and the social
actors. By making those institutional influences explicit, it is possible to take into account the
contextual factors which can explain an organizational behavior and thus operationalize
organizational context. In this current research such operationalization can help understanding
why and how information gathering becomes a routine in the interactions that take place between
an organization member and the organizational environment.

The construct social actor, however, was used for industries that are organizations involved in
business. The organizations selected for this research are not industries. Hence the organizational
fields surrounding these academic and research organizations are different from those of
industries. But these selected organizations are in the business of knowledge generation. This can
be likened to what Alavi, Yoo and Vogel (1997) stressed that universities have an organizationlike structure and are in the business of knowledge creation and sharing. The authors made such
reference to universities to draw the similarities between other types of organizations that engage
in IT-enabled collaboration and universities. The same logic can be extended to the organizations
under study. Knowledge generation is a major task of both the organizations selected for this
research and in both capital flow takes place for the purpose of knowledge generation. Hence the
construct of social actor should be applicable to scientists of academic and research
organizations and it is possible to explore how their information-gathering practices can be
linked to various institutional influences and how such institutional influences are generated.

145

5.1.3 Operationalizing organizational context in the current research

Following the information-gathering practices of scientists through the lens of social actor can
lead to the identification of organizations, outside their workplaces, with which scientists interact
and to institutional forces in such interactions that trigger information gathering by scientists.
Our prevalent perception is that scientists search for information to have knowledge that can be
transferred to new knowledge. We are accustomed to see the use of various information
resources as outcomes of various technical features of such resources. While this study
acknowledges that digital-library use is mainly for the purpose of knowledge generation, the
findings of this research suggest that practices of information gathering settle, partly, in response
to the demand of certain workplace forces and not just for acquiring knowledge for knowledge’s
sake. There are indications that more these scientists interact with entities beyond the boundary
of their organizations, more information become helpful for their “survival in the market”. In
order to identify those interacting forces, the research question RQ1(RQ1# How do the social
world of an organizational member influence and shape her/his information-gathering practice?)
was split into two following sub-questions:

RQ#1(a): What are the various patterns of interactions in which people as social actors, in
Indian academic and research institutes, engage in meeting the demands of their social world?

RQ#1(b): How do information-gathering practices help those social actors meet the institutional
forces of those interactions?

146
The sub-question RQ#1(a) addressed finer details such as:

(i)

With respect to information-gathering practices of the scientists, who are the extraorganizational entities with whom they interact?

(ii)

What kind of information demands are made in such interactions?

(iii)

What kind of institutional forces exist in such information demand?

(iv)

How similar or different are these extra-organizational information demands across the
selected cases?

The sub-question RQ#1(b) elicits what meaning is attached by the scientists to those information
exchange and information-gathering practices vis-à-vis meeting such institutional demands of
information in those interactions.

5.2

Interactions with external entities and information-gathering practice

How information-gathering practices become an automatic response to the environmental
demands of the scientists is the focus of this section. This section deals with research question
RQ#1(a) and presents findings on the external entities22 with whom the scientists of ORG1 and
ORG2 interact, the type of information demands that are made in those interactions and how
information-gathering practices help scientists to meet such information demands.

22

The term “entity” is used as a generic term to denote an organization, an individual or a collective of individuals with whom
scientists interact. Research funding agency, peer group, journal review system, or an individual scientist who is sitting in the
audience all are referred to as “entity”. As social actor, a scientist can have scope to interact with one or more of such entities.

147
The most difficult part of the data collection was eliciting responses from the scientists on
information searching. Information searching and screening are so much a part of the activities
of scientists; they cannot separate one reason from another behind their information related
activities. Any question on situations under which information searching becomes a necessity led
to the cryptic answer “always”. Similarly any question on why information is required mostly
resulted in the answer “need to know”. To work around this problem, following the principle of
phenomenological interviewing technique, scientists were asked how information gathering was
helpful in different situations and then it was followed up what the situations were. The
descriptions as emerged from scientists were examined through the lens of social actor.
Information-gathering practice was often found to be connected with various events that a
scientist faces while discharging her/his organizational role and responsibilities. Within an
organization, a scientist’s research activities mainly revolve around three broad events, namely,
project initiation, project progression and completion, and scholarly communication. Before
going into the details of the findings, some clarifications on these events are given here.

Project management life cycle, research life cycle and scholarly communication cycle are three
terms that often appear in any discourse that involves “research” as study object. A research as a
project has a finite starting and endpoint and passes through several stages. A research as a
process for knowledge discovery also passes several stages but it has a fuzzy starting and ending
point. A research is a never ending and spiraling process – when a research addressing a specific
issue comes to an end, it automatically gives rise to related issues that are pursued successively.
Scholarly communication too is a very extensive spiraling process associated with research.
Association of Research Libraries defines scholarly communication as “the system through

148
which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to
the scholarly community, and preserved for future use. The system includes both formal means of
communication, such as publication in peer-reviewed journals, and informal channels, such as
electronic listservs.”23 Elsewhere, scholarly communication has been defined as a cyclical
process in the advancement of scholarship. In this cyclical process content is generated,
reviewed, disseminated, acquired, preserved, discovered, accessed, and assimilated as new
knowledge. The concerns in scholarly communications are state of publishing, impact of
technology, economics, digital scholarship and so on 24 25 26. Scholars have also agreed to the
above definitions. As a field of study, scholarly communication focuses on how scholars use and
disseminate information through formal and informal channels and studies in this area cover the
growth of scholarly information, the information needs and use and relationship among formal
and informal mode of communication (Borgman, 1990). These three processes are independent
but connected as captured through the following Figure-5.

Doing research by the informants of this study is their organizational responsibilities. A scientist
may be at any specific cycle or at more than one cycle in the above figure. For example, while in
project cycle, a scientist can take part in the scholarly communication process.

The current study focused on a very specific aspect – it located an action of information
gathering using digital library and then followed the trail to reach to the point which triggered
that information gathering and to understand the institutional nature of that point of origin (the

150
lens of social actor). Based on what emerged from the informants, such information gathering
activities could be organized within more or less clear boundaries of project initiation, project
progression and scholarly communication. Keeping this in view, this reportage mentioned
project initiation, project monitoring and completion and scholarly communication as “events” in
the workplace of researchers. The focus is not on the phase of the research but on the
organizational responsibilities of the informants and different events that make them interact
with different external entities.

Coming back to our original discussion, for each of these events, scientists come into contact
with various entities that are located outside the boundary of their respective organizations.
Event-wise entities that scientists interact with and information demands from such entities, as
found in this research, are presented in the following sections and a summary is presented in
Table-9.

Observations

Types of information demanded and exchanged between scientists and the above mentioned
entities and mode of such information exchange are synopsized in Table-12. In this regard,
however, the findings are to some extent different from an earlier study (Lamb & Kling, 2003) in
which informational exchange was found to take place through formal report. It was even found
that for some industries, the reports must be made voluminous in order to establish that enough
information is covered. In this research, it was found that information exchange takes place
through both formal report and informal and verbal communications. Often, the scientists do not
compile any formal report but keep the information ready at hand before interacting with the
entities and present it when and if required.

These tables suggest that information gathering is often practiced by the scientists of these
organizations for more than “gaining new knowledge”; in order to discharge organizational

153
responsibilities, that is doing research, scientists have to interact with many entities outside their
respective organization. These interactions demand the exchange of information that is conveyed
to the scientist by rules, norms and cultural practices. Findings on various entities and their
information demand with respect to information-gathering practices of scientists are discussed in
the following sections.

5.2.1 Scientists’ interactions with external entities at project initiation phase

Various research funding agencies are entities with which scientists have to interact at this phase.
Before a research project starts, scientists go through what can be termed as a project initiation
phase. This phase starts when a scientist hits a research idea and ends with the confirmation that
the necessary financial support will be available for a certain period of time to test that idea. The
entities outside the workplace who matter most at this stage and with whom a scientist must
interact at this phase are various sources of funding. Such funding sources, or entities, support
different types of research with different aims. Consequently, the nature of the information
demand and the information exchange that takes place in the interactions with such entities are
different.

5.2.1.1

Entities supporting scientist-driven research

This group comprises various government agencies, inter-governmental agencies, international
agencies that provide funds for research initiated by individual scientists. Through such funding,
these agencies encourage knowledge generation out of fundamental research. Scientists in

154
organizations like ORG1 and ORG2 need support to conduct research based on their own ideas
in order to develop fundamental understanding of scientific phenomena in their respective
specialties. To this end, agencies under this category provide financial support to research
programs initiated at the individual scientist level. The idea, problem definition, entire planning
for the program are the responsibilities of the scientist who would apply for such funding.
Scientists have the liberty of choosing a problem, within the scope of the agency providing
funding. A large number of research projects in ORG1 and all projects in ORG2 are initiated by
individual scientists who look for various funding agencies under this category.

Information demand from this entity is both explicit and formal. These funding agencies have
standard procedures for receiving applications from scientists requiring support. There are
prescribed formats that must be filled out by an applicant. One specific component of the
prescribed format is a review of the literature. This format becomes a rule-like structure and
makes information exchange mandatory leading to extensive literature search by the scientists.
Informants view the information gathering and subsequent exchange from four different but
related perspectives. Those are:

(i)

Meeting the mandatory requirement of producing a literature survey as directed by
the prescribed format of application for funding.

(ii)

Recognizing the need of strong argument for establishing the importance of the
project and justification for funding (ORG2-SCT1-05, ORG2-SCT3-46).

(iii)

Establishing uniqueness of the proposed research - informants were very concerned
that in this age, access to information is much more than earlier days. In order to
show that their work does not overlap with the work of others and that it fits in with

155
the science being done in that area, the scientists keep abreast of the current literature
in the area (ORG2-SCT2-17).

(iv)

Remaining competitive in the market as receiving funding is competitive. Hence a
scientist must be perceived as a capable individual by funding agencies. To prove
their capability, a regular information gathering habit can be beneficial (ORG2SCT1-17/18).

Though ORG1 and ORG2 are different types of organizations in terms of organizational policy
and goals, scientists of both these organizations interact with this entity. ORG2 scientists opt for
this kind of funding because of the structure of ORG2. As discussed earlier, ORG2 is a grant-inaid organization and its scientists are to develop fundamental research and then publish. This
drives ORG2 scientists towards interactions with this entity. ORG1, on the other hand,
participates in scientist-driven fundamental research for four reasons: (i) to meet the mandate of
“earning” (ii) to meet the mandate of publications as criteria for career advancement (iii) to
develop, partly, infrastructure as funding provided under this category allows developing
infrastructure on a small scale (iv) another reason for ORMET scientists to go for this type of
funding is that they can work in a relaxed manner according to their pace and not be much
concerned with the outcomes of the research as such (ORG1-SCT2-09, ORG1-SCT4-19).

However, at ORG1 there is a new trend due to a very recent change in the policy. In 2009 when
the first set of interviews was conducted, there were some passing references to this change. But
during the second set of interview in 2012, the policy was settling down and ORG1 was found to
be slowly moving away from this type of government funding. Thus receiving funding from

156
other government agencies has been planned to be stopped. But there is a strategic shift. As the
emphasis on old values still remains and the scientists still need publications for career
advancement, junior scientists are still continuing with government- funded projects. Seniors
however, are gradually stepping into a different kind of projects:

“I took this responsibility because I do not need publications now ... but juniors need more
publications” (ORG1-SCT2-17).

Thus participation in scientist-driven government-funded research is a strategic decision within
ORG1 but is mandatory for ORG2. Despite the differences between these two organizations,
participation in scientist-driven research brings similar environmental influences on their
scientists in terms of information scanning and searching practices. Interactions with this entity
demand formal and mandatory exchange of technology information, in the form of a literature
review and through the prescribed application format. Thus often the information-gathering
practices of scientists are directed to meet these formal requirements.

5.2.1.2

Entities supporting industry-guided research

Government agencies in India also disburse funds from a different type of source. There are
certain corpus funds which have been developed jointly by the industries and the government.
The purpose of those corpus funds is to support research agenda that is beneficial for specific
industries. One such fund has been developed jointly by metallurgical industries in the country
and by government. Research supported by such corpus funds are collaborative activities of
industry and the organizations where scientists work. Agenda of such research projects are

157
developed based on industry-wide problems and scientists help industries to formulate such
problems. Research is also carried out by the scientists with close collaboration with the
industries. Apart from knowledge generation, these studies aim to develop some deliverables to
industries. ORG1 scientists engage in this type of research.

Informants described that information demand from this entity is met with both informally and
formally. Research projects under this category bring ORG1 scientists in touch with many other
organizations – academic institutions and industries that contribute to the research together
(ORG1-SCT3-07). Procedures for obtaining funds under this category do not follow the
straightforward process of making application in a pre-defined format. Scientists have to interact
with various stakeholders of such research projects from time to time, before the final papers
regarding financial support are placed. Such interactions demand preparedness on the part of
ORG1 scientists. At various interactions with those stakeholders, scientists have to display their
knowledge on the current state of their research. Information gathering activities by scientists are
often triggered by the urge to remain information-ready. It was very revealing that preparing
various information reports by ORG1 scientists became a practice only after one participant
industry demanded for information a few years back.

“<practicing the preparation of technology reports> I am here for more than 18 years.. of
and on.. first it came from XXXX Steel... about 12 years back… first time someone asked
for a state of the art ” (ORG1-SCT4-46)

While ORG1 has developed facilities for carrying on this kind of industry-supported research,
ORG2 scientists do not make attempt at such projects. Though some ORG2 scientists work in
collaboration with scientists of other organizations, they do not involve themselves in large-scale

158
industry oriented problems. One ORG2 informant explained why it is not possible for them to
join such projects – a big team is required which ORG2 scientists probably do not have:

“things have changed .... but these days government does not want to give grant in an
isolated manner .. they discourage this kind of small research works.. that is good in one way
but it is creating problem who wants to sit quietly on their table ..to do some research... you
must have a big team to do something big .. that is the issue “ (ORG2-SCT2-58).
All informants of ORG2 confirmed that their research do not involve industry as they limit to
fundamental research. Going for this type of research matches with the organizational mandate
of ORG1 and its scientists engage in seeking fund from this entity.

Thus, even though the nature of the funding agency remains almost same (that is, government
agencies) as described earlier, the aim of the research projects that are supported by the agencies
and participation of many stakeholders in the research program might change the nature of
information demand and the purpose of information gathering activities by scientists.

5.2.1.3

Entities procuring in-house research outcome

ORG1 scientists report another type of funding. More than funding, this can be considered a true
earning. This funding comes directly from industries that pay for the outcome of research, that is
technology developed or expertise generated within ORG1. This type of research can be
identified more as firm-specific problem solving. Individual industrial firms approach ORG1 to
commission a project in order to get a solution for their operational problems. ORG1 scientists
offer this kind of service by using their already generated knowledge as capital. The core features
of interaction with this entity are given in Table-14. The characteristic of interaction with this
entity is that no information exchange is demanded in such interactions.

In sum, when scientists transact a product or process developed by them and when the external
entity that is industries approach the organization in order to have that product or process,
interactions with those entities do not demand any information exchange. The reason for
mentioning about this entity in details is to highlight that all external interactions do not
necessarily lead to information demand and subsequent information exchange. ORG1 scientists
reported that they still consult digital resources (information gathering activity) in support of
research in this category but such consultation is required for their own knowledge. For ORG2,
this entity does not exist in its organizational environment and its scientists do not have to
interact individually with such entities.

160

5.2.1.4

Entities with prospective research collaboration

As mentioned earlier, ORG1 has recently undergone another change in direction in terms of
organizational policy. According to this new direction, ORG1 is gradually discontinuing
receiving government funding for scientist-driven research (ORG1-SCT2-01). Instead, industries
are now looked to as the new source of revenue. But unlike the entities who would simply
procure the outcome of in-house research as described in section 5.2.1.3, these new industry
partners are viewed as collaborators in the knowledge-development process. It becomes
incumbent upon the scientists of ORG1 to identify an industry partner and approach them.

Finding an industry partner that will agree to invest in the technology research offered by ORG1,
demands that the research conducted at ORG1 is acceptable. ORG1’s prime task is to convince
the industry (ORG1-SCT2-10). Industries have to be convinced that investing in the technologies
that would be developed by ORG1 will have a good return (ORG1-SCT5-08). Contrary to
government-funded, scientist-driven research that gave all importance to outputs such as papers
and patents, research outcome is the only criteria to draw industries towards this kind of funding.
This process of convincing involves exchange of information. ORG1 has to show the industries
that there will be value for their money. Sometime this process of convincing helps to educate
industries on the benefit of the technology. The process of exchange of information takes place
through presentations during face-to-face meetings (ORG1-SCT2-14), and the educating or
convincing requires actual data. Industries may have some idea about the technology but unless
they are convinced about the return, they will not invest:

161
“if you want to convince the people, you will give the data for example, for steel companies
we give data for new steel .. show the demand and there is a shortfall“ (ORG1-SCT5-20.)

The interesting part is how the information is placed before industries. Earlier, for the entity
supporting scientists-driven research, presentation of information in the proposal was mandatory
through a structured format. Thus a technical report on the technology or the process was part of
the proposal document. For this current entity under discussion, the information exchange,
however, takes place prior to submitting the proposal through meetings and discussion sessions
and the final proposal may not contain information in detail:

“but the proposal which will go to the industry .. will be 1 or 2 pages .. as small as possible ..
because nobody will read it if you give 10 pages” (ORG1-SCT2-41).
Thus, when entities expect a business return, the type of information demand and the nature of
information exchange often become different from those interactions that are oriented to
encouragement of knowledge generation.

5.2.1.5

Summary

A summary of various entities with which scientists of ORG1 and ORG2 interact, the nature of
information demand and exchanges is provided in Table-15 and Table-16. The construct social
actor illuminates the interactions that necessitated explicit information exchange between
scientists and external entities. Though ORG1 interacts with entities which procure the outcomes
of in-house research conducted at ORG1, those entities, according to the informants, are not
interested in any information exchange. As a result, those external interactions lead to “no

162
information exchange” or “nil information exchange”. No formal or informal information
exchange takes place in this interaction. It is obvious that all these information exchanges lead to
information gathering activities by the scientists.

5.2.2 External entities responsible for project review/monitoring

A formal review of a project proposal before it is approved and periodic monitoring of the
progress of the research are part of the life of a project. During this process, scientists have to
come in direct contact with reviewers who are appointed by the funding agencies.

Scientists’ information-gathering practices are often directed at this stage to display the
comprehensiveness of information provided and their knowledge of the current state of
technology. In order to understand how much stress they give on comprehensiveness of
information, one scientist was requested to consider himself in the place of a reviewer and judge
the proposal. The scientist was candid to admit that he would consider the applicant’s knowledge
of latest state an important factor (ORG1-SCT2-35). This can be extrapolated to the scientists
who apply for funds and can be assumed that they also try to communicate to the reviewers
about their knowledge of the current state of technology.

After the initiation of a project, the progress of research is monitored by the extended arm of the
funding agency. This is applicable for both ORG1 and ORG2. This review process demands
information awareness and appropriate information coverage. These information resources help
scientists to be a more competitive candidate for a project (ORG1-SCT6-10 & 11).

As long as the project is continued, it is monitored from time to time by a monitoring committee.
While the project proposal and its review demand adequate knowledge of the current status of
the field, the monitoring demands a proof that “enough has been done” (ORG2-SCT3-48/49). In

165
order to ensure that “enough-ness” scientists have to know the current literature so that they can
establish the adequacy, if challenged.

One informant reported that during the direct interaction with the monitoring committee, he
remains prepared on aspects beyond his project. In a direct interaction and conversation with
experts, the discussion can turn to any direction and it is safe to remain updated about the current
state of the technology in general (ORG1-SCT4-54). Such preparedness with information also
shows him in good light before reviewers as a representative of ORG1.

As it stands, interactions with entities that scientists come across at this stage are direct and
sometimes demand more broad information. Exchange of information is often necessary here to
establish the completeness of the work. Such exchange of information takes place verbally in
face-to-face meetings.

5.2.3 Interaction with entities during scholarly communication process

Scholarly communication is a process in which scientists take part, in addition to their assigned
jobs within the organization. Information exchange is most obvious in this process. This
communication process may take place in a formal or informal mode. Before presenting the
findings in this regard, a brief introduction on how scientists of ORG1 and ORG2 become part of
the scholarly communication process is described.

There are two reasons for scientists participating in the scholarly communication process. One is
the organizational mandate that considers publication in good journals as credentials for career

166
advancement. This career incentive drives the scientists to attempt to publish their works in
journals and also in conferences. The other reason is that according to the culture of the scientific
community, research findings are shared within the community in order to help science progress.
Science has its own institutionalized system which facilitates verification of each knowledge
claim. A scientist, who aspires to create new knowledge or claims to have created new
knowledge, has to stand before this process of knowledge verification. Impartial and rational
examination of any scientific claim is the culture of an epistemic community27.

This section describes various entities and the nature of interactions and information exchanges
during the process of scholarly communication, as perceived by the scientists.

5.2.3.1

Interaction with the institutionalized review system

The review system is an essential component of the journal publishing system. Because of their
roles in such an institutionalized system, reviewers command respect from the prospective
authors. Reviewers may seek clarifications, raise questions or suggest an alternate explanation of
a result. In all those cases, it is incumbent upon the scientists to satisfy those clarifications or
answer the questions.

The interactions between journal reviewers and the scientists are formal and indirect. It is formal
because all communications are conveyed through written reports. Clarifications/questions are
sent to authors formally and scientists also send their responses. It is indirect in the sense that for
this purpose reviewers and scientists do not interact face-to-face.
27

Epistemic community is discussed in more detail in Chapter-8,

167

Interaction with the review system creates immense information demand on the scientists.
Collecting extensive as well as most current information becomes essential as only information
might help them achieve the following:

(i)

To satisfy the questions raised by reviewers who are in more powerful position with
respect to the scientists28;

(ii)

To establish the viewpoints and merits of the findings against the challenges posed by
reviewers and thus assert themselves, notwithstanding their respect for the reviewers ;

(iii)

To establish the merit of their work over others by comparing what other researchers
have done, processes followed and results obtained;

(iv)

To establish that their research is connected to that carried out in their field and their
ideas are not “absurd”; by providing citations to other published works, this
connection is established;

(v)

To cover as much information as possible and display it in an attempt to avoid any
adverse comments on the gap in information. This, scientists feel, is essential for two
reasons. First, in the current age of Internet, no data can be suppressed. Second, in the
current ICT supported reviewing process, many publishers allow reviewers to access

28

While scientists generally admitted the supremacy of the reviewers to raise questions on the claims made in their papers, a
different perspective emerged from some informants of ORG1. One scientist commented that by providing information,
citations, reviewers are assisted in understanding the perspective of research. A similar view was echoed by , another scientists
who conceded to this notion of “being helped”. He admitted that accepting the reviewing job is rewarding because that gives the
scope of updating the knowledge.

168
respective publisher’s journals as part of the review process resulting into easy tracing
of information/citation by the reviewers;

Overall, scientists of both organizations take active part in communicating their research findings
through journals. Journals are the most institutionalized mode of such communications and
reviewers form a part of such institutionalized communication. Thus responding to the reviewers
becomes a rule-like activity. Even when scientists want to establish that they are correct and not
the reviewers, they need to provide enough evidence from the literature to support their view.
This leads to extensive searches for information.

The process of knowledge claim review also directs the discussion towards the notion of
“epistemic community” and “invisible college”. A separate discussion follows in Chapter-8 on
whether or how these scientists form a part of epistemic community and invisible college and
how those entities might shape the information-gathering practices by the scientists of these
organizations.

5.2.3.2

Interaction with knowledgeable individuals

Scientists also participate in another form of scholarly communication when they present the
findings of research in conferences, professional meetings, project monitoring meetings that are
attended by peers or “knowledgeable individuals”. These face-to-face interactions with peers
generate information demand of a dynamics that is different from the interactions that are
described in previous sub-sections. These interactions are direct in the form of question
answering sessions and the mode of information exchange is verbal and informal. Unlike the
reviewing system in which scientists get a reasonable amount of time to find information and

169
frame an answer, information demand in such face-to-face interactions must be met
instantaneously. As the interaction takes place through discussions, such interactions sometimes
may lead to information demand on a more general or related areas. Thus an information
readiness is considered a safe strategy by the scientists.

Additionally, the interaction taking place in the presence of an audience creates a different
dynamic. Scientists acknowledged that it is a highly embarrassing situation if contemporaries or
junior peers in such an audience point out that the author’s control over the published
information is questionable. They also admitted that they can only claim to be peers when they
are on par in terms of knowledge with others.

In such interactions, it becomes very challenging for the scientists to display themselves at on par
with those knowledgeable individuals in a large gathering. This leads the scientists to engage in
information scanning and updating not only in their own area of research, but also in more
general but related areas.

5.2.3.3

Interaction with the scientist community – competition and
connection

Information gathering is also directed at keeping track of competitors and collaborators in a
specific area of research. Scholarly communication opens a platform where scientists meet their
prospective collaborators and competitors. Science progresses through both collaboration and
competition.

170
Information gathering, with respect to competition, can be helpful for scientists in various ways.
Information sensitizes them regarding new open issues for research and helps in strategizing to
move ahead of others so that their work is recognized by other community members. Scientists
feel a sense of supremacy when they can publish ahead of others so that others must have to cite
their works. Regular information gathering/scanning helps them to monitor the publishing trend
so that they can plan the timing of their own publications. One scientist at ORG2 was confident
of her authority and stated that no one in her area can avoid citing her work.

Getting to know the publications also helps scientists to strategize on how to show the novelty of
their work compared to what has already been published. Unless this novelty is established,
publishers do not accept a paper for publication. Besides, knowing the literature was also felt
important by the scientist to survive in the “market”. Knowing publications and their quality also
help scientists to identify a space within the community where their work will be appreciated and
where they can build an intellectual space of their own (ORG2-SCT2-18, ORG2-SCT2-63). One
ORG1 scientist reported the benefit of being “on top of the information” (ORG1-SCT5-57) in
making his voice heard over competitors at the negotiation table. Table-17 shows examples of
various prevalent dimensions of competition within the community.

At the same time, connections with members of a community are equally important for
collaboration without which modern science cannot progress. Through publications, scientists
working in the same area at different geographical locations come to know each other and
develop collaboration. Scientists’ habit of regular information scanning helps them in this regard
too.

171
Staying connected to a community is also important for yet other reasons. There are gains of
being informed and risks otherwise. Unless informed, scientists may put forward proposals that
might not get an interested audience and will thus be disconnected from the community.
Redundant research will earn them disapproval of other community members. On the other hand,
community members remain up to date and can recognize novel work and appreciate good work
as well as its authors. Table-18 shows examples of how scientists’ information-based actions are
reciprocated by the community.

5.2.3.4

Interaction with the knowledge dissemination channel

Journals as a knowledge dissemination channel become another entity which scientists come
across as they receive invitations for editorship or writing reviews. These assignments are in
recognition of the reputation of the scientists. With respect to this professional recognition,
scientists view information gathering from two different perspectives:

(i)

At one level it is important to keep themselves knowledgeable by extensive reading
which will be transmitted in their judgment while reviewing. This will lead the
editorial board to have trust in the knowledge base of the scientists as reviewers
(ORG2-SCT3-25).

(ii)

At another level, it is important to search for literature in order to understand the
literature and the merit of the paper received for review (ORG2-SCT3-53).

Besides, intense search for information is required when they enter into writing a review on a
specific topic for a journal or prepare a review in the discipline.

5.2.4 Interaction with administrative entities

Scientists of both ORG1 and ORG2 reported interacting with administrative authorities. Various
information resources meet the demands of such interactions. ORG1 is subjected to queries from
higher administrative bodies regarding project status, expenditure status, and so on. A

175
management information system developed internally is used by ORG1 scientists to meet such
information demands.

A different type of information gathering is done by scientists in this regard. Information on their
own publications is required to be produced in their applications for awards, grants and so on.
Scientists regularly collect such information. ORG2 scientists also collect such information in
order to establish the organizational performance when subjected to government review. Such
reviews are conducted once every few years. During the time of review, individual scientist’s
performances are considered. One of such indicator of performance are various citation measures
such as h-index and the impact factors of journals where her/his papers have been published.

5.3

Characteristics of information demand from various entities

The characteristics of information demand during interactions with various entities as discussed
above can be summarized from three angles. Those are (i) whether interactions with the entities
make a demand for information exchange; (ii) what is the nature of such information exchange;
and (iii) the type of information to be exchanged.

Demand on information exchange: the previous sections suggest that whenever knowledge
development is the business for scientists, information exchange is often mandatory during
interactions with various entities that matter in such knowledge development processes. On the
other hand, when the business is on the knowledge-based processes such as the cases of
industrial firms seeking solutions for their operational problems from ORG1, there is no
information demand and/or exchanges during the interactions. As explained by scientists, such

176
industrial clients do not care for the supporting information, interactions with this entity does not
demand any information exchange.

Nature of information exchange: while most formal and rule-like demands for information
exchange take place through formal reports, such as literature reviews and responses to reviews,
in many instances – as reported by the informants – information exchange takes place informally
and verbally. Formal and explicit information demands are made when (i) scientists apply to
different agencies for funding; (ii) scientists apply for awards; and (iii) interact with a reviewing
system. Applications for funding or for grants are to be made through specific formats where
those formats make explicit demands for literature review/citation data of publications. Informal
and verbal exchange of information takes place mostly during face-to-face meetings.

Type of information exchanged: For these scientists it is technical and scientific information
available in journals and similar channels that is predominantly exchanged. Wherever literature
review is required, the review report is based on such information. As ORG1 is now taking a
new direction, the scientists of ORG1 are also looking for market and business information to
interact with industries. While applying for awards or in response to some high level
administrative authorities, information on citation-related data are required. Some of the
information-specific tasks require specific object-level data that are not available through any
formal channel. Such information is collected by means of a personal drive.

177

5.4

How information gathering helps in interactions with external entities

This chapter started with conceptualizing scientists as social actors with respect to their
information-gathering practices. This led to identifying various other organizations and
individuals, referred to as external entities, whom the scientists come across while meeting the
goals of their respective organizations. It also helped to identify various information demands
raised during the interactions between scientists and those organizations and individuals. In order
to meet those information demands, scientists regularly engage in information gathering
activities.

The enquiry surrounding social actor was further extended to understand, how those scientists
view such information-gathering practices or what meanings they attach to their information
gathering activities when triggered by such information demands. This understanding was guided
by another sub-question (RQ#1(b): How do information-gathering practices help those social
actors meet the institutional forces of those interactions?).

This section addresses this sub-question. To this end, the interview transcripts were subjected to
thematic analysis that elicited several concepts. Scientists perceive that information-gathering
practices and responding to information demands helps them, in: (i) Alliance formation (ii)

5.4.1 Alliance formation – a strategy through information-gathering practices

Information-gathering practices and subsequent information exchanges are important in the
formation of alliances between research organizations and industries. ORG1 is now pressured to
find those industries that will agree to be research partners. The scientists are targeting industries
to adopt the processes/products developed by them and produce the materials in large scale. In
this new relation the partner industry has to understand the theoretical basis of the technology
and ORG1 scientists have to understand the marketability of the technology so that the
partnership becomes beneficial for the industries. Scientists recognize that on the one hand they
need to educate industries about the prospect of futuristic materials they have developed in the
laboratory, and on the other hand they have to convince and assure the industries about the
business prospects. Thus while interacting with industries, they are often required to produce
convincing data about the futuristic materials and project themselves as credible partners. This is
possible when they have enough information, both in the area of technology and technocommercial matters, and they use that information to facilitate the interactions.

Data supporting business success and business prospects of the technology/materials are very
much essential in those exercises. According to the scientists, it is most important to provide
evidence that a similar product has a market prospect. At the same time, ORG1 scientists are
aware that industries too keep watch on current scenarios regarding such new materials and/or
processes. Making a proposal without the support of knowledge on the current status might risk
the credibility of ORG1. Hence ORG1 scientists regularly scan and compile information for
ready reference during interactions with such industries. Table-19 highlights the examples of
various dimensions of “Alliance Formation” with regards to information-gathering practices.

“if you want to convince the industry then you should have in your background this
information .. otherwise you cannot convince the industry “ (ORG1-SCT2-40)
“if you want to convince the people, you will give the data for example, for steel
companies we give data for new steel .. show the demand and there is a shortfall .. so if
you people can venture into that .. whatever structure into that” (ORG1-SCT5-20)
“.. if it is a sponsored project then convincing <without data> will be really very difficult
task” (ORG1-SCT5-47)
“oh yes .. if it is a large project, we have to prepare a report .. as I said, factual things
have to be there .. someone has written something” (ORG1-SCT5-25)
“.. we need a partner .. we are going for a particular steel .. so if I give a proposal
without proper knowledge .. they know what is going on across the globe .. will say
already someone has done it or they themselves might have done that .. no point .. why
do I fund your research” (ORG1-SCT5-79)
“if we do not get those information, we have to skip that information .. it is happening
many times .. many information are not really available..<on credibility if information is
not there> yes (stresses)” (ORG1-SCT2-32)
“but without proper knowledge if I tell them that I am going to have that product .. which
someone has patented .. they refuse .. and I have to <even in same area> use different
process otherwise there will be patent infringement .. so I have to be very cautious ..
otherwise they will not accept” (ORG1-SCT5-81)

Even though information is so important and vital in alliance formation, there is no formal
exchange of information. ORG1 scientists use the information extensively while making
presentations to the companies. But the final proposals that are sent to companies/industries for
financial consideration are very small reports bearing succinct information because, as reported
by the scientists, the prospective industry partners would not have time to read a large report
(ORG1-SCT2-42).

5.4.2 Confidence building supported by information practices

Information-gathering practices lead scientists to collect “evidence” in order to establish that
their works are not idiosyncratic but are, rather, part of a progression of research done earlier29.
This is an important aspect of science research. Citing earlier works helps them in gaining the
confidence of their research community. Taken from a different angle, this is the characteristic of
an epistemic community where members build upon a specific school of thought.

Confidence building is not only necessary in publishing research outcomes, but it was also found
important often when scientists engage in other interactions. A convincing proposal that could
earn financial support must demonstrate that the applicant scientist has comprehensive
knowledge about current knowledge. The project monitoring stage invites many questions from
the project evaluators and unless well read, scientists cannot justify or satisfactorily respond to
the evaluators. Table-20 gives examples of the notions of “evidence” and “convincing” in the
process of confidence building.

29

There are other views of citations too. Authors cite to contradict. This has also been captured and reported in “identity”.

5.4.3 Establishing identity with the help of information-gathering practice

Scientists are sensitive about who they are, their credibility, and the novelty of their work when
they interact with anyone. Not only as an individual scientist, but also as a representative of an
organization, group or country they are extremely protective about their identity. As it emerged
from the interviews, information-gathering practices equip them with adequate information and
contribute to building/retaining their identity.

Identity has different shades. Scientists desire to be identified as knowledgeable and credible.
They are also keen to have a community identity. Scientists are concerned about projecting
themselves as knowledgeable individuals (Table-21: Identity – knowledgeable self). They often
meet peers at face-to-face meetings such as project review boards and so on. These peers are
subject experts and are in the forefront of research. Discussions in such meetings often extend
beyond the scope of the specific research agenda. Scientists not only want to participate in such
discussions, there is also a desire to establish their knowledge in those areas. On all such
occasions, scientists want to rise above the situation. Going unprepared to such direct interaction
platforms can be very embarrassing. Situation can also be very embarrassing if any challenge
comes from contemporaries or juniors30. Overall they try to update themselves before such
meetings and interactions. They sometime try to assess who else might be coming to the
meeting, their areas of specialization and then accordingly make adequate preparations so they
can participate in the dialog. As one scientist admitted, if he wants to be considered a peer, he
must keep himself updated.

30

Interestingly, one scientists agreed that if such challenge comes from a more senior person, that can be turned into learning
opportunities.

183

Credibility is another aspect that scientists want to establish (Table-21: Identity – credible self).
Whenever they submit research projects or write papers for journals, scientists examine a whole
range of literature and try to establish the point of novelty and the credibility of their work
compared to that published in the related literature. Thus, regular information-gathering practices
often become necessary.

Collective identity (Table-21: Identity – collective) is also considered important by the
scientists. In a meeting where scientists meet their international peers, they are sensitive about
the fact that they are representing the country and should remain as much informed as possible.
On other occasions when a scientist represents the laboratory, she/he remains careful so that the
lack of knowledge does not bring shame to the organization.

Another interesting aspect of identity is ego. One ORG2 scientist candidly admitted that anyone
proposing a study in her area and not citing her paper would have made her angry (ORG2-SCT370). This can be reversed to infer that scientists keep watch on the literature published by
authorities in the field and cite those works lest they insult the reviewers.

5.4.4 Information-gathering practices in support of gaining recognition

Recognition is very important to scientists. Recognition can be either from other scientists or it
may be giving attribution to other scientists. From this perspective, scientists consider electronic
resources and information-gathering practices very helpful. As their publications are archived in
various resources, they view such resources as a platform to showcase their work and gain
recognition from others (ORG1-SCT4-80). Information-gathering practices are used by scientists
to keep watch on the work of competitors, and it creates pressure on the scientists to work
quickly because whoever publishes first will be cited by others and thus will earn recognition
first (ORG1-SCT5-73 ). Scientists who are confident that they are the pioneers in an area are also
confident that others will come to know about their work and will have to cite them, resulting in
growing recognition (ORG2-SCT3-42). One informant confided that peer appreciation in the
form of knowing and recognizing one’s work are all that matters, and without such recognition a
scientist is an idle person (ORG2-SCT2-21). They are also careful about recognizing and thus
acknowledging predecessor’s work (ORG2-SCT1-28).

5.4.5 Scientific inquiry and the role of information practices

The role of information practices in scientific research is well known, and information is the
backbone of scientific research. In this study the traditionally accepted role of information,
namely merit and newness of knowledge are evident. There were, however, some additional
views about information practices articulated by the scientists. Those are continuity, challenges,

188
and successful participation in the scientific inquiry and how information practices help in these
areas.

Doing research is the process of conducting scientific inquiry. The process of scientific inquiry is
highly institutionalized through the review process at various stages – from proposal writing to
presentation of findings. In that entire process, information gathering and subsequent information
exchanges have various shades as viewed through the eyes of scientists. For instance,
information helps to establish the merit of a research proposal (Scientific inquiry – merit).
Having established the merit of the proposal they can argue why their projects are worth funding
(ORG2-SCT3-46). Initial information search helps the scientists to understand how earlier
research was done and whether they can surpass previous efforts, thus increasing their chance of
being funded (ORG2-SCT3-09).

The aim of scientific inquiry is to create new knowledge (Scientific inquiry – new knowledge).
This notion of “newness” has to be underscored in different ways. Knowing what has already
been done prior to embarking upon a proposal is thus important. (“we have to be very thorough
about our information…...make sure that there is no unnecessary overlap” -- ORG2-SCT2-17).
That there is “no point in reinventing the wheel” has been echoed by scientists of both ORG1
and ORG2 and here is the role of information-gathering practices (ORG2-SCT1-22). Scientists
not only generate new knowledge per se, but they are also entrusted with generating new metaknowledge, i.e., a review of what knowledge has already been created. Creation of this metaknowledge certainly requires being aware and having access to the literature (ORG1-SCT6-13).
At the time of communicating results of their research through papers, they have to establish the
“newness” of their findings. To this end, existing data are collected directly and are used to

189
interpret the findings (ORG1-SCT6-14). At the same time, the absence of prior data is also
viewed by scientists as an opportunity to claim the newness of their work, although at times, they
may feel insufficiently capable of convincing others (ORG2-SCT3-51).

So far, we know that scientific research, or any research, takes advantage of gaps, and that new
studies are designed based on such gaps. The scientists in this study confirmed that they are
concerned in establishing that their work exhibits continuity with earlier work. Scientific inquiry
progresses in a continuous way. Hence though it is necessary to show the “newness” and merit of
one’s work, it is equally important to establish that the produced new knowledge is not
something abrupt. This implies that scientists need to constantly find and understand the status of
science in a given research area (Scientific inquiry – continuity) and relate their findings to the
past findings. By providing the state of the art report, they try to achieve this (ORG1-SCT1-06).

A very interesting statement was made by one scientist regarding the continuity of scientific
research. By establishing continuity, they can also make themselves accountable to the sponsors
with respect to the advanced nature of their work compared to earlier findings (ORG1-SCT4-40).
One informant who works in plant genetics admitted that society is very sensitive to the outcome
of research in this area and scientists, in addition to conducting scientific inquiry, also have to
counter concerns of social activists. They have to convince these activists at meetings and it’s
helpful if they can demonstrate that others are also engaged in such research (ORG2-SCT1-58 ).

Scientific inquiry constantly faces questions from peers. Scientific claims have to clear
challenges and doubts before knowledge is made public through journals (Scientific inquiry –

190
challenge). Scientists consider it as challenge to establish that their views are correct (ORG2SCT1-15). Even very senior scientists respect such questions from the reviewers and attempt to
satisfy them (ORG2-SCT3-13 & 14). The challenge can be in the form of a question on the
correctness of procedure, findings, and so on. In the face of such challenges, scientists return to
the literature to verify and defend their arguments. Another form of challenge faced by scientists
completeness – has enough work been done? Consulting the literature exhaustively they try to
establish the comprehensiveness of their work (ORG2-SCT3-49).

The openness of the data in the Internet era poses another challenge. The Internet has facilitated
access to vast stores of information and it is hardly possible to suppress any data because
someone may detect such omissions and point them out. As a precaution, scientists try to be as
comprehensive as possible in their searches (ORG2-SCT3-35).

Another form of challenge is faced by scientists when they present data in face-to-face meetings.
One informant admitted that the dynamics in such meetings is completely different from the
challenges faced from journal reviewers. The presence of many peers in the same place
simultaneously brings a range of information in such meetings. Challenges can come from any
peer who is better informed. Not being able to address such challenges outweighs the success of
publishing the paper on that topic. Hence, scientists strategize to keep up-to-date before going to
such meetings (ORG2-SCT2-39). While information-gathering practices help scientists to face
such challenges, when such practices are not successful, it becomes very hard for them to meet
the challenges (ORG2-SCT3-17).

191
Successful participation in the ongoing dialog within the community (Scientific inquiry –
successful participation) is another mark of scientists. Such dialog may take place through the
formation of a sound research project. Unless well informed, scientists may not be able to
formulate research projects and will not get entry into the community (“they submitted their
projects .. they have not gone thoroughly through the literature .. so they could not frame the
proposal properly” -- ORG2-SCT3-69). This is another indication on how scientists think it is
important to learn how to find information and use it strategically.

5.4.6 Load sharing through information practices

Information scanning sometimes can be viewed as load sharing with other entities. On several
occasions, scientists compile and produce information that ideally should be done by the entities
with whom they are interacting. Thus producing such information shifts the load from the entity
to the scientists. This, however, has become a practice within the scientific community. For
example, administrative authorities require information about the performance of scientists in
terms of impact factor of journals where their papers have been published, h-index, and so on.
But it is the scientists themselves who help them by providing such information from citation
indexes (ORG2-SCT3-82).

5.4.7 Performance evaluation reporting

Another way the scientists look at their information scanning for various bibliometric data is to
support their performance evaluation. Information-gathering practices of scientists are not
limited to finding scientific information only. Scientists are often stressed to establish their

192
performance and look for other data to address this. It was the informants from ORG2 who very
respectfully mentioned searching for information such as the impact factor of journals or citation
counts. Being a grant-in-aid institute, ORG2 has been subjected to a few evaluations by the
government. One of the points such evaluation teams underscored was the impact factor of
journals in which they published their papers. The informants acknowledged that considering
impact factor and the h-index as a mark of success started abroad and now is now adopted in
India too (ORG2-SCT2-50). This is also applicable when they are considered for promotion
(ORG2-SCT2-47). As well, such data is required by agencies offering various fellowships
(ORG2-SCT1-14).

5.4.8 Developing and maintaining relationships within a community

As mentioned earlier, the community is a remarkable entity with which scientists have to
interact. Community members are dispersed all over the world but they are connected through
publications. The community also overlaps with other entities such as journal reviewers, project
review committees, peers in face-to-face meetings and obviously a large number of audiences
who come to know about the research through their own information-gathering practices. The
community sets the norms, provides a field for collaboration and networking, while at the same
time community members compete. Scientists attempt to develop their own network so they can
depend upon such members for their intellectual work. Information-gathering practices often
help scientists learn who is working in their respective areas and to develop such a network,
respond to the competition generated within the community, develop research problem that the
community would approve, connect to other members of the community and also to inform the

193
community. Table-22 provides various facets of community relationships and shows with
examples how information gathering might help in each facet.

Example
“yes that will help me … if somebody at Edinburgh -- someone is sitting there and
doing particular type of research I am doing … she or he is thinking in same way
that I am thinking .. sometimes there is head block – I cannot progress further or
vice versa – so if we can exchange our ideas then it can open the head block” –
ORG2-SCT1-07).
“: <how electronic resources help in social world> people know each other –
people know me by name ,,more number of people are referring . when they say
that I have read your paper. shows standard of my work (the term social world did
not go well) – it helps me in introduction” (ORG1-SCT1-24)
“absolutely .. like we know that <refers to some product> .. so I know who are the
people working ..if I publish they would cite my paper or if they publish I have to
cite their paper .. so that is a pressure .. but another way it is good also .. we know
who are the competitors” (ORG1-SCT5-73).
“for example there are databases which can connect ..publications..you are
interested in one author .. his publications and then you go to his ... in this way you
can create a hierarchy of papers….which could give you some idea about what is
the current trend in the research .. .in fact you can read the minds of the
scientists…actually visualize what they are trying to do ..given this you have to take
into account your scientific interests, professional interests.. after all you are
expected to perform….so only thinking about science will not help always” (ORG2SCT2-19 & 20)
because your cannot do anything redundant now a days ...... now everybody knows
what is happening in the world ... either you do something novel or you do not do
anything at all…if you do something redundant, people get upset with you... even
they will ask you to sit quietly and not to do anything .. so you have to be very
careful in seminar talks ... so that you do not talk anything redundant” (ORG2SCT2-62)
– it is a major risk ... you are totally out of business ... only thing you will have your
job and salary .. and you will be totally out of business .. because it is a government
job, I will not loose it ... otherwise that is the end “ (ORG2-SCT2-33)
“first you do not want to duplicate what already has been done.. you want to make
sure that whatever you are publishing is not duplicated….and apart from that you
of course want to know what has already happened…. How you are adding… you
have to show novelty in your research… that novelty has to be vis-à-vis other
researchers’ works..” (.ORG1-SCT4-75)
“the risk is that you cannot communicate actually .. it will be communication
problem .. communicate to your stakeholders .. communicate to your peers also ..
this is always true .. for all types of projects” (ORG1-SCT2-44)
“I match with my findings – I know they are important – how of the rest of the
world they think its importance – so I have to match with other’s information”
(ORG2-SCT1-38)
“and in fact we thought that there is no review in this field – so and there may
(some technology details) and we found that this is the area that we were supposed
to bring our one review for the benefit of international community of
researchers“ (ORG1--SCT3-19)

194

5.4.9 Compliance in the form of technical reports

Information-gathering practices and subsequent information exchanges are also seen as a form of
compliance with various institutional processes that are part of the work lives of scientists. For
grant-in-aid projects, which are also scientist-driven research, proposal formats make it
mandatory to submit a literature review (ORG1-SCT2-43). This procedure is the same
irrespective of the funding agencies, namely any government department or NSF or the Welcome
Trust. The format for application is “telling” or “binding” since one component of such a
reporting format is to submit a literature review. Other scientists also agree that developing a
state-of-the art report for technology is unavoidable (ORG1-SCT4-34).

While funding agencies make it mandatory to prepare literature-based status reports using a
prescribed format, for ORG1 this practice has also settled over the years to apply to other types
of research in which industries participate. One of the scientists recalled that though he had been
in ORG1 for nearly 18 years, it is only about ten years ago when one industry participant
suggested that a status report be prepared. Such an informal process has now settled into a formal
one in ORG1 and for almost all major research projects they prepare such a report at the start,
even though there is no prescribed request for doing so.

A few observations on the notion of interactions

Interaction – the term often used in this chapter – is very broad and hence may lead to questions
such as how interactions among scientists themselves contribute to information gathering and
information exchange. There also may be questions on whether there is any effect of such
interactions on interactions with the entities as described in earlier sections. This section clarifies
these issues.

There is no doubt that scientists within an organization interact among themselves in all three
events as identified in previous sections. They share each other’s expertise in order to face the
external entities. In other way, it can be said that external interactions sometimes drive internal
interactions and information gathering activities. Similarly, there were indications that scientists
interact among themselves in order to find a way to interact with external entities, that is
prospective research collaborators and exchange information. Beyond this point, in this research
it is not possible to say precisely how such internal interaction is impacting information
gathering or information exchange with external entities. There are several reasons that are
highlighted here.

First, interaction has been framed within the construct social actor, in this study. Accordingly,
focus was on interaction that takes place between an organizational member and an external
institutional body. This set the direction of observation (action origin of action). The research
did not have much scope to look at the action with further granularities. The information
gathering activity which could be a collaborative activity or an individual effort was the starting
point.

196

Second, any further probe into the interaction at local level to support information gathering
activities would have required the scientist to recall many finer details which are part of day-today activities. Capturing such details at micro level through interview process would have
created a cognitive load on them. An alternate process could be either a quasi-experimental
process or to follow scientists in their laboratory and observe them. This study did not have any
provision of either of these methodologies as explained in chapter 3. Because of the combination
of the research questions raised and methodology adopted, it is not possible to provide any
picture on the impact of external interaction on the internal interaction or vice-versa.

There is no doubt, however, that the glimpse about internal interactions, that occasionally
surfaced in the overall picture of information gathering can lead to a more detailed study on how
such internal interactions contribute to external interactions.

5.6

Chapter summary

This chapter reports on what constitutes an organizational context, with whom scientists have to
interact, what types of information demands are made in such interactions which trigger
information-gathering practices by those scientists, what are the characteristics of information
exchanges that take place between scientists and their organizational context, and how scientists
view such information exchanges. These findings helped to build answers to the two specific
research questions, which are (i) What are the various patterns of interactions in which people as
social actors, in Indian academic and research institutes, engage in meeting the demands of their

197
social world (RQ1a)? (ii) How do information-gathering practices help those social actors meet
the institutional forces of those interactions (RQ1b)?

The scientists of Indian academic and research organizations that were selected for this research
have to interact with various individuals and organizations that are located outside the boundary
of their respective organizations. Those external individuals and organizations are either
institutions or representatives of some institutions. Those institutions include funding agencies,
industries both in the form of research collaborators and customers, the journal review system,
the scientific community, and the scholarly communication system.

Interactions with some of these entities create demands for information and scientists have to
meet them in various ways. Hence the exchange of information as a resource often takes place
between the scientists of these organizations and those institutional entities. Some information
exchanges take place formally, through written reports. There are, however, several occasions
when such information exchange takes place informally and verbally. Though bibliographic
information forms a major component in such information exchanges, some are dependent on
business and techno-commercial information.

These information exchanges and ultimately information-gathering practices help these scientists
in several ways. Information-gathering practices were often found to help the scientist in selected
cases in complying with the mandates of funding agencies, developing an alliance or partnership
with industries, gaining confidence of those who would invest in their research, and developing
and maintaining community relations in several ways. Information-gathering practices are also
essential in abiding by different administrative norms.

198

In sum, information gathering activities are practiced by scientists of the organizations selected
for this research in response to various information demands of various institutions located
outside the boundary of their respective organizations. These information-gathering practices are
translated into information exchanges during their interactions with those entities.

CHAPTER 6: TECHNOLOGY-IN-PRACTICE AND DIGITAL
LIBRARY USE
6.1

Chapter introduction

The overarching goal of this research is to investigate how the practice of digital-library use by
people in selected Indian academic and research institutes is shaped by organizational and social
contexts. The question is divided into two parts. First, enquiry was directed at understanding how
information-gathering practices that motivate digital-library use are connected to the
organizational contexts of scientists. The study showed that different organizational and
individual entities create an institutional environment for academic and research organizations.
This institutional environment triggers various information-gathering practices by scientists.
These findings have been presented in a previous chapter.

This chapter deals with the second part of the research goal, which was to investigate how digital
libraries are used (or not used) to support information gathering activities of scientists and how
different factors contribute to such digital-library use. This aspect was problematized through a
research question – what are the various extra- and intra-organizational factors mediating the
practice of digital-library use in information gathering activities of organizational members
(RQ#2)?. More specifically, this research question aims to understand the characteristics of
digital-library use by scientists (RQ#2a: What are the various emergent practices of use of
digital libraries, both at the digital library level as a whole and at the feature level?) and the
issues that contribute to such use or non-use of digital libraries (RQ#2(b): How are such

200
practices accounted for by different extra- and intra-organizational factors). The findings of
these research questions are presented in following sections

To help the readers at this point, the methodological issue of foregrounding information
gathering activities and not digital libraries is reviewed. The term digital library has a profound
flavor of computer technology. Some people may not use digital libraries for various reasons,
one of which is they are not very comfortable with technology, though it may be difficult to
admit this. As a result, any reference to digital libraries in the beginning of a conversation might
have resulted in idealized and not actual responses. To minimize the chance of this, informants
were engaged in discussion to reveal how important their information gathering activities are.
Digital libraries were to be foregrounded later. In the course of discussion, however, it was found
that scientists mentioned electronic resources during discussions. It left no doubt that they were
describing what they really do; they were not trying to build an image of digital library users.
This strengthened the methodological soundness of the data collection plan.

Digital-library use has been viewed through the lens of a sociological concept – technology-inpractice. The rest of this introductory section is devoted to a brief discussion on this concept and
the relevant literature.

6.1.1 Theoretical background

The notion of technology-in-practice was proposed by Orlikowski (2000) and it was developed
out of structuration theory (Giddens, 1984), which is about how structures are developed,
maintained and changed within social systems. Structuration theory posits that social practices

201
are mediated through facilities, norms and interpretive schema. A social practice is developed by
the members of a group depending on the facilities available to them (e.g., land, buildings, and
technology), the norms that inform their ongoing practices, and their knowledge (both tacit and
explicit) of prior action and the situation at hand. Using those facilities, knowledge as well as
their habits of the mind and body, those members recursively instantiate and thus reconstitute the
rules and resources leading to a visibly “structured” social action.

Technology-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000) is the enacted structure of the action of technology
use. A parallel has been drawn between technology use structure and supermarket use (Lave,
1988, pp.150–151). For the individual shopper, the supermarket is a repeatedly experienced,
personally ordered and edited version of a setting of activity. Some aisles in the supermarket do
not exist for a given shopper as part of her setting, while other aisles are rich in detailed
possibilities. Similarly, the use of a technology involves a repeatedly experienced, personally
ordered and edited version of some of the properties of a technological artifact. For example,
people, at best, use repeatedly 25 percent of the functionalities of office software packages such
as word processing and spreadsheets. Those properties become visible to users most of the time
and are implicated as rules and resources, resulting in a particular structure of the use of those
software packages.
While using a technology, people draw on its material properties as a source of rules and
resources as well as on their skills, power, knowledge, assumptions, and expectations about the
technology and its use, influenced typically by training, communication, and previous
experiences. People gain experience about technology in various ways – by using other
technologies, by participating in various communities, and also from the environment in which

202
they work. In sum, experiences, knowledge, meanings, habits, power relations, norms, and the
technological artifacts at hand – all contribute to the structure of the use of specific technology.
User belonging to same community undergo same training session, socialize among themselves,
have comparable on the job experience and all these lead to their display of similar technologyin-practice.

Technology-in-practice can vary among users as rules, resources and conditions for a technology
use can be experienced differently by different individuals and differently by the same
individuals depending on the time or circumstance. An example of this is the use of tax return
software (Orlikowski, 2000). This tax return software may be used for printing blank forms, for
learning current tax codes, or for learning the interface of such software, depending on the
interest of the users. During most of the year, this software is typically ignored and no rules and
resources are enacted as they are not implicated (implying no technology-in-practice).

Technology-in-practice, that is the structure of technology use changes as all social structure
changes through human action. Users, over a period of time undergo changes in awareness,
knowledge, power, motivations, time, circumstances, and the technology itself. For example,
users may also choose to enact different practices of technology use. This may happen as they
become more knowledgeable about using the technology (through attending a training class or
watching a colleague’s use) or because they have changed jobs and now need to use the
technology differently in their new work community. Thus meanings, expectations, associations,
and conventions attached to the technology and its use are not static.

203
Orlikowski (2000) explains how different work groups’ interests, organizational demands on
them and different perceptions can contribute to different practices within the same organization.
She uses “Notes” as an example –software that was installed on the desktops of employees of a
company. This software was very powerful in promoting and supporting cooperative work
within the organization. It was found that two groups – “technical support” and “consultants” –
were enacting different technologies-in-practice for the same software. “Technical support”
members were free of a competitive culture, not subjected to “up-or-out” career tensions or
“billable hours” pressure. Members of this group were found to use many features of the
software and thus promoted their collective technical work and cooperated with each other. They
also modified the technology over time as they added data to the databases and created or
customized databases. This was one kind of technology-in-practice that emerged from this group.

Another technology-in-practice for the same software emerged from the members of
“consultant” group. This group was found to use the technology in a minimal way. This group
was subjected to stiff competition (up-or-out), higher performance (billable hours). The
competitive culture strongly reinforced by the ‘‘up-or-out’’ career path was seen by many
consultants as encouraging the development of individually distinctive competence. This
increased their reluctance to use Notes to share expertise, and reinforced their firm’s practice of
rewarding individual effort and distinctive competence rather than cooperation and knowledge
sharing. Similarly, this group was doubtful about the relation between the technology and the
performance of the company. The training conducted for this technology was also very abstract
and technical. Overall, Notes triggered their fear that use of its collaborative properties would
threaten their status within the company and this resulted in minimal technology-in-practice
(Orlikowski, 2000).

204

Technology-in-practice as an enacted structure of technology use makes visible the emergent and
situated use of technology as shaped by organizational members. Such enacted structure is the
result of how users experience some or all properties of the technology. By focusing on this
emergent structure, a view of technology use emerges that can describe what users do with
technologies as enactment. It can then be further extended to understand whether such emergent
structure is associated with any specific work groups or is a result of some organizational factors.

In another study the concept of technology-in-practice explained how inter-organizational social
structure came into force and made the users take note of material capabilities of a geospatial
information technology (GIT) which were otherwise ignored and to enact those material
capabilities (Harrison, Pardo, Gil–Garcia, Juraga, & Thompson, 2007). Sharing geospatial
information across regions and integrating this information with other data set are core to
successful use of GIT. In this particular case study, actors brought a set of diverse technical
facilities and resources, pre-existing and newly adapted norms, and the interpretations of reality
that were very specific to the organization. Members of different groups interchanged their
knowledge, meaning system, learned from each other and this resulted into a rich technology
innovation.

In drawing on these structural properties, users’ experiences are shaped by material aspects of
the technology, that is, its “facilities,” but they are also shaped by norms for appropriate behavior
within an organization and with respect to a technology, and by interpretive schemes drawn from
the institutional context through which structure is instantiated. Thus, an important part of
analyzing a technology-in-practice is to understand how structural properties of the social

205
system, through the modalities of facilities, norms, and interpretive schemes, shape users’
tendencies to enact technology in particular ways, giving rise to the possibility of structural
reconstitution.

Another case study of Geographical Information System (GIS) draws attention to cultural and
educational aspects associated with limited use technology-in-practice of GIS (Walsham &
Sahay, 1999). One of the examples of the effective use or “substantive use,” as termed by the
authors, of a GIS in this case would involve district forest officers using the GIS outputs on a
regular basis to support decisions about what kinds of trees should be planted in particular
wasteland areas in order to help restore these lands. This was found not to be happening. The
main reason for this was the absence of a relatively stable set of key actors with aligned interests
related to the GIS. The creation and maintenance of such key actors demanded a long process of
changing social attitudes and structure. For example, GIS requires a map-orientation but maps
were not deeply embedded in the social and cultural life of the case in study. In order to blend
decision making process of administrators and output of GIS technology changes were
necessary. The cultures of data sharing and cooperative work approach were also found essential
for effective and substantive use of GIS.

These examples suggest that by using the lens of technology-in-practice or structuration of
technology use of digital libraries by scientists it is possible to (i) identify the extent of using
various features of digital libraries and (ii) to identify various factors that contribute to such
patterns of digital-library use.

206

6.1.2 Technology-in-practice and research questions on digital-library use

In this study, technology-in-practice, that is, the enacted structure of the action of technology
use, has been mapped on digital-library use. Overall the research question – what are the various
extra- and intra-organizational factors mediating the practice of digital-library use in
information gathering activities of organizational members? (RQ#2) – has been formulated to
understand the structure of digital-library use and the factors that are instrumental for such
structuration. This research question has been further split into two sub-questions. These subquestions and the rationale for the formulation of these questions are discussed next.

As discussed earlier, the concept of digital library in this research has been conceptualized as a
collection of electronic resources that are available to an organizational member. Such a
collection includes subscribed electronic content, electronic contents under open access, locally
developed repositories and any other channels of information transfer such as email, listservs,
blogs, and so on. The analogy to supermarket use (Lave, 1988, pp.150–151) as mentioned earlier
applies here. From the perspective of a user of a digital library, some of the component resources
may be non-existent and some are prominently visible. This leads to repeated use of those visible
components by that user. This is one level of structuration of digital-library use. At another level,
the structuration takes place when a user repeatedly uses one or more features of digital libraries
just as most of us use only a limited number of features of office software packages most of the
time. This structure of use or technology-in-practice with respect to digital libraries has been
captured through the question: What are the various emergent practices of use of digital
libraries, both at the digital library level as a whole and at the feature level? (RQ#2a).

207
After understanding the emergent use of digital libraries, this research also identified the factors
that contribute to such use. As seen in the literature, factors which may play a role in developing
a technology-in-practice are not necessarily confined to the technological features of those
resources. Issues such as workplace incentive, training, orientation, and organizational
environment can facilitate the use or non-use of any ICT. The research question (RQ#2b: How
are such practices accounted for by different extra- and intra-organizational factors?) reveals
issues that contribute to the emerging structure of digital-library use by Indian scientists.

6.2

Pattern of digital-library use by scientists of study sites

This section elaborates on the structure of the use of digital libraries by addressing the question
#2(a): What are the various emergent practices of use of digital libraries, both at the digital
library level as a whole and at the feature level?

For the purpose of this discussion, electronic resources accessible by the scientists of an
organization are divided into several categories31. Electronic resources, available through
subscription, are broadly divided as: (a) bibliographic aggregator’s databases;32 (b) bibliographic
publisher’s databases;33 (c) bibliographic special databases;34 and (d) non-bibliographic

31

The naming that has been adopted for each of these categories partly aligns with that available in various literature.
Standardization of such naming, however, was not aimed at this stage. The purpose of adopting the naming was to convey the
type of resources covered under each category.
32
These are the databases aggregating bibliographic citations and sometimes full text from journals/magazines published by
different publishers. These databases are electronic counterpart of erstwhile A & I secondary sources. Web of Science, JSTOR
archives and databases from Proquest, EBSCO are considered here for this category.
33
These are databases produced by publishers on their respective contents. For example ScienceDirect which is produced by
Elsevier on contents published by Elsevier belongs to this category. Almost all major publishers now bring out their own
databases.
34
This category includes databases of patents, standards.

208
databases35. In addition, other electronic resources that were also kept within the purview of the
study are open access resources and institutional repositories. It must be noted that publisherspecific databases restrict contents to only those published in that respective publisher’s books
and journals. On the other hand, aggregator’s databases provide information across publishers.
Though both these categories use search engines, aggregator’s databases are truly information
searching devices and such search engines have varieties of features to help users search for
information.

The findings of the question RQ#2(a) are presented separately for the scientists of ORG1 and
ORG2. Because of disciplinary differences, the resources used by each of these two
organizations are also different. After presenting the findings separately, a comparison is made
of the differences and similarities in the practices for those two organizations.

6.2.1 Digital-library use by ORG1 scientists
Electronic resources available for ORG1 scientists can be found on their website. The
organization has access to a number of bibliographic aggregated products namely, METADEX,
Web of Science and so on. Various publisher-specific resources are from Elsevier, Springer,
Wiley and various societies. In addition, patents and standards are also available to the scientists.
Table-23 summarizes the pattern of use of various resources by the informants of ORG1. The
highlights of the use of these resources are:

35

Databases containing non-bibliographic data

209
(a)

Google was frequently referred to as a search engine. Some of the informants were
articulate in clarifying that Google is useful for general information;

(b)

Publisher-specific bibliographic databases were frequently referred to with reference to
information searching. One informant even mentioned that if she does not get satisfactory
information in ScienceDirect (Elsevier’s service), she tries Google;

(c)

Two informants mentioned METADEX, one of the most important bibliographic
aggregated service. One of those informants mentioned that he has abandoned using
METADEX. Another informant was able to recollect how search is conducted in a
structured way in METADEX;

(d)

None of the scientists interviewed mentioned using Web of Science – another aggregated
service – for scientific content information searching. One informant mentioned this
service with reference to citation data only;

(e)

Information available from virtual universities (specific sites maintained by individuals or
groups) are also used;

(f)

There was an additional perspective on the use of publisher-specific sites. When
scientists receive papers to review from a journal, the respective publisher often allows
them to consult its publications for a certain period of time. ORG1 scientists use the

210
citations in the paper received for review as well as those publisher-specific journals to
update their knowledge;

(g)

Though a patent search is required before filing for a patent, a new reason for patent
searching was revealed. As the organization is now trying to identify collaborators who
will translate their research ideas, the scientists often use the patent search to help
establish the novelty of their ideas;

(h)

In a new organizational environment, these scientists are in need of market information
on new technology/products. Such information is not available in conventional
journals/books. Various company websites are now consulted for this purpose;

(i)

Information is collected directly from manufacturing plant, whenever required, using
personal connections, as such data is not available in any published source;

(j)

Personal communication channels, such as email, are also used to receive information.

Various features of electronic resources used by these scientists (Table-24) can be summarized
as below:

(a)

Simple keyword search is the predominantly used feature of electronic resources;

(b)

Electronic alert systems of various publishers are used by some of the informants;

(c)

While one informant spoke about a very limited use of the advanced features of a
resource, the rest repeatedly emphasized using keywords for searching. One informant
categorically reported that he does not use any advance features;

6.2.2 Digital-library use by ORG2 scientists
ORG2 library website properly lists and displays the various electronic resources under each of
the categories as mentioned above that are accessible by the scientists. Table-25 summarizes the
resources used by ORG2 informants as reported in the interviews. Two of the ORG2 informants
are working in Plant Genetics area and one informant is working on microbiology (Human
Genetics).

The important findings with respect to digital-library use by ORG2 scientists are:

(a)

Google occupies a significant position as an information search mechanism by the
informants in the area of plant genetics. On the other hand, for the other informant
(human genetics), Pubmed was the mechanism for information searching. None of the
scientists could remember the name of any aggregator’s database for information
searching. Interestingly, Pubmed does not figure in the website of ORG2;

(b)

Apart from Google, publisher’s packages are found to be the major information resources
for the scientists, specifically those working in the area of Plant Genetics.

(c)

The use of Web of Science, an important resource of a kind different from aggregator’s
databases38, was mentioned during the discussion but the scientists’ uses of it always
referred to finding information such as the impact factor of journals. This resource was

38

Web of Science can be considered as a value-added aggregator’s database. It aggregates information from different publishers.
At the same time, value is added by linking citations and providing various bibliometric information on journals.

215
never mentioned in the context of scientific content information searching. More
discussion on this can be found in following sections.

(d)

Often, Google and Internet were used interchangeably and used as a conflated term. For
example, when one informant was asked to give a demonstration on searching on Google,
he opened the browser which was set to Google as a default and then from the search
history of the browser, brought out the URL of Pubmed and started searching. Similarly
when lightly probed after referring to the Internet as a searching mechanism, some
informants mentioned that they go to specific publisher/journal websites for searching;

(e)

Citation managers are also referred to as resources;

(f)

Special databases such as sites where various government departments upload various
information are used for very specific cases;

(g)

There are instances of non-use of digital libraries in favor of using non-digital resources.
Such non-digital resources are personal communications, printed books, and so on. One
of the informants mentioned that some part of her support data is collected directly from
farmers;

Various features of electronic resources used (summarized in Table-26) by ORG2 informants
are:

(a)

Keyword search is the feature used by all informants. In fact, searching is often referred
to as “very simple” by most informants. Keywords include subject keywords and author’s
names;

(b)

ORG2 scientists avail themselves of registering with Table-of-Contents services with
various journals and receiving updates;

(c)

Only one ORG2 informant (Microbiology) reported using various advanced features of
Pubmed;

(d)

All informants reported searching for bibliometric data such as the impact factor of
journals, h-index, and so on. The reference to the use of Web of Science was typically
associated with finding this type of information.

6.2.3 Digital-library use – similarities and differences between study sites
The points of similarity with respect to digital-library use between the two organizations’
scientists are:

(a)

Google is predominantly preferred to any aggregator’s database for information
searching; there was one exception – an ORG2 scientist reported using Pubmed, an
aggregated database preferentially over Google;

(b)

Publishers’ databases are used extensively for information searching;

(c)

Citation databases were referred to in the context of finding the impact factor of journals;

(d)

Non-use of digital libraries was the result of non-availability of certain information in
conventional information resources;

(e)

In neither of these two sites did scientists consult other channels, such as blogs or wikis.

Digital-library use of ORG1 scientists, however, differed from that of ORG2 scientists in the
following ways:

(a)

In their information-gathering practices ORG1 scientists have started using websites of
various companies. Due to a new organizational policy that mandates industry
collaborators, information cannot be found in the conventional scientific literature alone.

219
On the other hand, ORG2 continues to have a stable policy with respect to its identity as a
grant-in-aid organization, and, thus, its scientists participate in scientist-driven
fundamental research only. They continue to use bibliographic databases for the most
part, with occasional use of special data sites;

(b)

Special databases such as patents are used by ORG1 scientists from a new perspective –
those are used not for filing patents but to update their knowledge and to convince their
possible industry collaborators about the newness of their technology and how worth the
investment it is;

(c)

Though scientists of both sites reported their involvement in reviewing journal papers,
ORG1 senior scientists viewed this task as one of the ways to keep themselves up-todate.

6.3

Factors facilitating/constraining digital-library use

The lens of technology-in-practice sensitizes us to the fact that the use structure of a technology
is associated with several factors beyond the technological features or capabilities of that
technology. Understanding such factors is as important as it is to observe the use structure. This
section reports the findings in this regard for digital-library use by scientists. More specifically,
this section addresses the question – how are such digital-library use practices accounted for by
different extra- and intra-organizational factors (RQ#2b).

220
Digital-library use, as found in this research, has various shades. These uses can be identified as
non-use, delegated use, selective use and normal use. The term “non-use” is linked to those
incidents when information requirements could not be met by consulting digital libraries and
hence various other channels were used by scientists to support information gathering activities.
“Delegated use” of digital libraries happens when scientists use digital libraries to support their
information gathering activities but they delegate the task of searching to someone else within
the organization. However, they still continue to have some experience in using digital libraries
and occasionally use these resources by themselves. The term “selective use” is linked to those
situations where informants reported their use of a certain components of digital libraries while
ignoring some others. The term “normal use” refers to all other utterances by informants about
their use of digital libraries.

The factors associated with digital-library use patterns as reported in the previous section are
grouped as: (i) environmental; (ii) technological; (iii) organizational; and (iv) personal. Table-27
and Table-28 present those factors as emerged from data from the interviews with ORG1 and
ORG2 scientists respectively. It may be noted that while some of those factors facilitate digitallibrary use (identified as enabler), some other factors lead to avoidance of digital-library use
(identified as restrictive).

6.3.1 Environmental factors facilitating/constraining digital-library use

The information environment that contributes greatly to digital-library use can be viewed from
two perspectives. One of these is the availability of full content and not just a citation from most
of the resources. Earlier information resources provided citations only; the full content would
then be procured separately, which was referred to as back-up service. The technological
advancement has changed the search scenario, to a great extent collapsing the back-up service
and information search facility. This has had a great impact on using bibliographic information.
As one scientist compared earlier times with the present, he commented that information
available earlier was not so significant because, earlier, the content of a citation was not easily
available (“.no there were some CDs but only abstracts” – ORG1-SCT5-66). Relating digitallibrary use with the availability of full text thus validates the age-long basic philosophy of
information services, that is, back up services are as important as knowing the citations. Current
electronic resources that package both the citations and respective articles together to varying
degrees meet the demand of back-up services instantaneously, or at least very quickly.

This new information environment has also changed several work practices. Journals, while
offering review jobs to scientists, also allow them to have access to major journals of the same
publisher for a limited period. Scientists often do not have access to some or even most of these
journals. They view this facility as an opportunity to upgrade their information base.

As large volumes of information are now available electronically, scientists search intensively in
order to ensure that they do not miss any information. There are two driving forces behind this
intensity of searching. One is that the practice of leveraging the journal reviewing system for

225
personal education, as mentioned above, is known among the scientists. They now know it is
easy for the reviewers to verify any piece of information or claim made by them. Hence to stand
by their claims they need sufficient evidence. We have seen in previous chapters that scientists
view their information gathering activities as a way of supporting the credibility of their research
and as a way of collecting evidence in the face of challenges from journal reviewers. This is the
link between scientists’ information gathering activities and the support offered by the current
electronic information environment.

Another driving force is the awareness that others in the field also have similar access to such
vast information. This awareness prompts scientists to engage in intensive searching of digital
resources because they want to know who their competitors are and how they can make their
own space in that competition. At the same time, they also look for collaboration. Thus
scientists’ perspective on their information gathering activities as supporting competition and
collaboration within the community are transformed into their digital-library use.

One other aspect of the information environment is the non-availability of certain types of
information in digital media. Operational data from manufacturing plants is one such example,
which, if found at all in any archive do not provide current information. When scientists require
such data, they do not try to search any digital resource; they collect the data themselves.
Similarly, for research management data, scientists depend on their internal management
information system.

Certain types of information are not available in any published source for one or more of
following reasons: (i) the restrictive nature of the data; (ii) the nature of the scientific problem

226
investigated; (iii) the nascence of the issue; and (iv) the location of the research. Sometimes,
scientists withhold certain information for various reasons and other fellow scientists have to
depend on their personal channels such as informal meetings and email for information.

Research agendas that are quite new or not relevant internationally do not generate information
in digital media. For example, one scientist reported that she hardly got any help from digital
resources or the Internet as the problem she was working on was quite new and was very specific
to Indian conditions. International journals do not see the importance of such problems and
hence do not accept publications related to such areas resulting in non-availability of information
through normal channels.

The location of the scientist may provide another reason for non-availability of information. A
scientist was working to develop a very specific technique in a laboratory not normally dedicated
to such problems. She had a double-edged problem. The area being completely new, there was
very little information available through journals. Additionally, since the laboratory did not
normally support research in this area it did not procure relevant resources. With both these
aspects put together, she hardly ever has any incentive to use the digital resources available at
her locality.

In summary, the information environment of these scientists can, at best, be described as skewed
towards certain types of information and as a result, for some cases, scientists may not depend on
digital libraries.

227

6.3.2 Technological factors facilitating/constraining digital-library use

The current trend of availability of large volumes of digital media information is only one of
several important factors that contribute to digital-library use. As this availability is intricately
associated with technologies, how enabling or constraining such technologies are also matter.
Technologies are enabling when they ensure effortless connection and handling. Considering that
this is the age of mobile technologies, the ability to use such devices with digital libraries can
also be seen as an enabling factor.

Any technology demands a certain amount of learning, which, depending on the cognitive
demand it makes, can be another facilitating or limiting factor. The interviews revealed that the
technological features that matter to users for digital-library use could be broadly categorized as
access mechanisms, ICT tools, and learning load.

Technologies are enabling when the same ensure effortless connection and handling. There are
various layers at which such effortlessness can be identified. One such layer is usefulness of
gadgets that can be used by scientists. Backup devices such as pen-drives are not only small in
size, but also portable and can hold a “small digital library” – as one scientist said – that can be
carried and read anywhere. Another layer is the learning load. Any technology demands certain
amount of learning which, depending on the cognitive demand it makes, can be another
facilitating or limiting factor. Referring to a specific aggregator’s database – one supposed to be
the most respected information retrieval system in his area – one scientist reported how he
dislikes learning the structured way of retrieving information from that system and though he had
to use this resource at one time, he has now switched over to another resource that does not

228
demand as much of his time to learn. Surprisingly, there was also another perspective, and this is
discussed in more detail in one of the following subsections.

Technological features which matters to users for digital-library use, as emerged from interviews
could be broadly categorized as access mechanism, ICT tools and learning load.

6.3.2.1

Digital-library use as a function of access mechanisms

One utterance came from many informants regarding the use of digital resources is “easy.”
However, when asked to elaborate on how or why this is so they found it very difficult to
describe. “How can I say how easy it is?” said one informant. What emerged from the discussion
is that the “ease” of use can be associated with the accessibility of these resources. The
accessibility, in turn, can be viewed at two levels – simple operations and the time factor.

According to the informants, electronic resources are easy because using them requires simple
operations -- just type and get the information. Such simple operations help to identify required
information from the massive information archives. If required, users can also customize the
data, which was difficult to do in the past for printed resources. The speed with which data can
be retrieved is also another aspect of access. Required information is retrieved fast, thus saving
the time of the researcher.

6.3.2.2

The Role of ICT tools in electronic access

New ICT tools also contribute positively towards the use of electronic resources. Wireless
Internet connectivity helps connect to the resources from anywhere. Portable gadgets such as

229
laptops and removable backup devices accentuate the benefits of this wireless connectivity.
Digital libraries are not only accessible, they are portable too. Small back-up devices can be used
to download and carry required information. One scientist described how easy it is to make a
copy of an article on a small flash-drive or on his laptop and read it while travelling. He looks
forward to the use of even smaller gadgets. Citations managers are another interesting
technology support. Scientists not only use the digital libraries as part of their information
gathering activities, they can also download required information from those citation managers
and make a bibliography in no time. The integration of various ICT tools, both at the hardware
and software levels, helps digital-library use more meaningful to scientists.

6.3.2.3

Learning load as a factor in electronic resource use

Very few informants were able to articulate what is “easy” about Google, the platform from
which they start many of their searches. One informant explained that using METADEX requires
some level of expertise – one has to know how to frame search queries in a structured fashion.
He admitted that he had stopped using METADEX. Scientists with their busy and otherwise
demanding schedule avoid this load. The successful use of digital libraries demands an
investment of time and learning. One scientist described how various complex features of
Pubmed can be used to get very specific information. Interestingly, this is the opposite of what
other scientists reported. At one of the sites, the older scientists demonstrated a clear dislike for
resources that placed a cognitive load on them. Responding to a question on whether she would
be interested in using new resources, one scientist confided she would be, provided she did not
have to invest much time and energy in learning how to use them. One of the scientists described
how the searching was difficult for printed resources and thus searching used to be avoided.

230

Even though no correlational study was done on the choice of resources creating less learning
load on age or other factors, it appeared that: (i) older scientists prefer less learning effort; (ii)
scientists with very busy schedules prefer resources that require less learning effort; and (iii)
scientists from the discipline that has more institutional influence on the resources to be used
prefer a resource produced by such an institution. The section of scientist who works in human
genetics give much value to Pubmed, which is produced by a division of the National Library of
Medicine – one of the most highly respected institutions41. The scientist who preferred using
Pubmed also knew that it is produced by NCBI. No other scientist interviewed could say clearly
who the publishers of the databases they used were.

Such findings explain why Google is used by many scientists. A simple and quick search
interface that demands less learning and time load is attractive even though such a search may
result in a less comprehensive result.

6.3.3 Organizational factors facilitating/constraining digital-library use
Notwithstanding the favorable information environment and technological support facilitating
handling of digital electronic resources, for organizational members such as the scientists in this
study, there are other issues that facilitate or constrain digital-library use. The benefits of
technological developments in digital libraries that have taken place outside the organization can
also reach the scientists through ICT42 and the infrastructure policies of that organization. There

41

This researcher started collecting data from another site where mostly scientists work in human aspect of biotechnology.
Unfortunately, because of political disturbances in that part of the country, she could not go back to complete the data collection.
But two scientists who were interviewed also affirmed their dependence in Pubmed
42
Information & Communication Technology

231
are other non-technical issues too. One of these is the organizational policies that guide the type
of research activities to be undertaken by its scientists. The more an organization is committed to
knowledge generation, the more its scientists will require various information resources.
Organizational issues which can further structure the use of digital libraries are discussed next.

6.3.3.1

Organizational policy leading to various digital-library use

Digital-library uses vary, both in terms of intensity and variety, depending on organizational
policy. As scientists get engaged in scientist-driven research or industry-driven research, they
have to constantly strive to upgrade their knowledge and also have to establish the soundness of
their knowledge. For this purpose they use electronic bibliographic resources. These
bibliographic resources are also used by scientists when they engage in activities related to
publications, since publishing in good journals is the mandate of academic and research
organizations. However, within ORG1 as senior scientists move to research administration, the
demand for publications on them is eased and they do not use bibliographic electronic resources
as much. Interestingly, these senior scientists now use their editing assignments as a way to keep
themselves updated. As they review research papers of their junior colleagues or receive such
assignments from publishers, they examine the reference lists provided in those papers in order
to learn the latest developments. These scientists also take the opportunity to update their
knowledge while reviewing since publishers open their archives to the reviewers as part of the
reviewing agreement. This culture of the publishing world fits nicely with the scientists who
have otherwise very busy schedules and do not get an opportunity to stay current.

232
A different type of digital resource is used when organizational policy changes from pure
academic research to industry oriented research. As the very recent change in the policy of
ORG1 focused on reducing government funded research and increasing industry oriented
research, the scientists of the organization found it of utmost importance to find an industry
partner. In order to negotiate convincingly with industries, scientists required more business
information than technical information. This leads to the use of not only different types of
information but also different types of resources. The scientists who are part of the new initiative
of ORG1 reported searching the websites of various companies engaged in developing similar
processes or products. They also use house journals of various companies available on the Web.
Resources which earlier had no visibility to the scientists are now drawing their attention and
thus resource-wise, a new use structure is emerging.

In sum, organizational policies can shape who will use digital libraries. Such policies can also be
instrumental in expanding the scope of digital libraries by including new types of content.

6.3.3.2

The role of ICT infrastructure in digital-library use

ICT infrastructure within an organization is an important issue with respect to digital-library use.
To look at it from another perspective, the Internet use within an organization is largely
dependent on this infrastructure and digital-library use is also dependent on it. This infrastructure
includes computers, Internet speed, and the local area network. Several scientists compared the
situation in earlier years with the present. Scientists of both organizations described the
inconvenience in the past when computer facilities were centralized and limited in their
respective organizations. Scientists had to make a provision of time for consulting digital

233
libraries since they had to go physically to such computer centers or information centers. As the
resources were shared, there used to be restrictions with respect to time allocated for using
Internet facilities. Senior scientists were not comfortable in sharing such resources with their
juniors. ORG1 scientists mentioned that in all their project proposals, they used to allocate
money for procuring computers over which they would have more control.

The current situation is improved. Both case sites have good local area networks within the
office campus and scientists’ workplaces are connected to this network. As organizational policy,
each scientist is given a computer. This has eliminated the need of going to another place and
sharing resources with others. Some scientists emphasized that access to a local area network has
been a great support for using digital libraries. This improvement in infrastructure has become
instrumental in their using digital libraries in a relaxed manner and at their own convenience.
One scientist commented that now library and laboratory works are interleaved. Whether such
infrastructure could add to the quality of the information retrieved was difficult to measure since
the quality of retrieval depends on many other factors such as search strategy and so on, but there
is certainly more use of such resources. One scientist candidly admitted that in the all-print era,
such extensive searching was not possible. With very little variation, almost all senior scientists
described how tedious it was in olden days to collect information from printed resources and
maintain it on cards.

Most of the scientists explained that their time and energy are now conserved. Going to the
library for study demands that separate time be allocated and planned. Digital-library use, to a
great extent, depends on how it is deployed within an organization with the help of ICT. A good
ICT facility, connecting users to the Internet from their work table becomes instrumental in

234
saving users’ time to go elsewhere for consulting such resources. Collapsing laboratory work and
consulting digital libraries is gradually becoming the work culture of academic and research
organizations.

The quality of the Internet as infrastructure also contributes to digital-library use. The difficulties
faced by slow Internet speed and lower bandwidth were referred to as obstructing factors in the
Internet and digital-library use.

6.3.3.3

Digital-library use and its relation to workload

Within an organization, the nature of the job and its associated workload also affect digitallibrary use. At one level, there is pressure on scientists to remain updated in order to survive in
the competitive market. They need to consult bibliographic resources in order to know the
current status of technology so they can develop meaningful and competitive research proposals,
defend their knowledge claim made in scientific publications, and establish their knowledge
status to peers. They need to consult various citation databases for bibliometric information so
that they can defend their claim for an award or a fellowship, or strategize their publications.
They have to consult the management information system developed within their own
organization so that they can respond to the queries of higher controlling bodies who monitor the
progress of research All these demands make the scientists reach for bibliographic resources,
resources providing citation information, resources providing business information and so on.

On the other hand, scientists who have become senior within ORG1 are required to take up much
research related administrative responsibilities, including negotiation and travelling. The
commitments in higher positions leave little time for them to consult various electronic resources

235
by themselves. All interviewed scientists of this group admitted that ideally they should have
consulted the resources themselves, and even with their busy schedules, they do try to set aside
some time for consulting them. The time they are able to dedicate to this, however, cannot meet
their total information requirements.

There was one exception, however. One ORG2 scientist explained that now that he is senior, he
does not have to do as much laboratory work and spends a good amount of time in using these
resources. This is contradictory to what was reported by senior scientists in ORG1 who reported
shortage of time leading to less consultation of bibliographic databases. The possible explanation
for this difference can be that when organizations mandate a wide range of research for their
scientists, time management becomes very important. ORG1 scientists not only do small
research projects initiated by themselves (scientist-driven research), but they are also part of
various industry driven network projects in which they and scientists from other organizations
participate. Managing research of such a large scope demands a great deal of administrative
work related to research. Thus senior ORG1 scientists find it difficult to consult electronic
resources regularly though all of them admitted that they want to consult such resources
regularly. Thus seniority does not always lead to less or no use of digital libraries.

6.3.3.4

Organizational support system and delegated digital-library use

If workload creates hindrances to the use of digital libraries, as described in section 6.3.3.3,
organizational support in the form of additional manpower facilitates the use in a delegated
manner. Digital libraries are used in delegated mode when there is provision for support staff
who can consult digital libraries on behalf of others. Senior scientists who are engaged more in

236
research administration do not get adequate time for consulting electronic resources and thus
delegate the task of consulting digital resources to others. ORG1 provides additional support
system to these scientists to manage their research related activities by appointing junior level
personnel. These senior scientists delegate the majority of their information requirements to
support personnel who regularly conduct searches. Similarly, scientists who have a large
research program managed by a group of junior scientists or research scholars under them, find it
difficult to conduct searches for everything by themselves. In this case, too, each scientist or
scholar is delegated to conduct information searching in their respective areas. This is contrary to
the practice followed by junior scientists or scientists conducting small research projects who
conduct information searches themselves.

6.3.3.5

Digital-library use for performance evaluation

Awards, fellowships and special grants are ways of recognizing a scientist’s achievements.
Scientists aiming for such recognition are required to submit their nominations. Those
nomination documents must include various citation related information on their publications. In
addition, from time to time ORG2, as grant-in-aid organization, is subjected to special review. At
that time ORG2 scientists have to submit various data related to research. Citation information
on their publications is one such kind of data and thus scientists often consult electronic
resources of this genre. At the same time, it is worth noting that such emphasis on bibliometric
data with regards to performance evaluation has made the scientists view citation indexes
partially or in a different way that was not intended by the producer of such databases. This can
be likened to unintended consequences, as described in the characteristics of research conducted
under the paradigm of social informatics.

237

6.3.4 Personal factors facilitating/constraining digital-library use
Digital-library use is also affected by the personal traits of scientists. Though these personal
traits are driven and facilitated by environmental, technical and organizational factors,
nonetheless, these traits together shape digital-library use. Those individual traits are discussed
here.

6.3.4.1

The habit of using digital libraries

Most scientists reported their regular habit of searching for information. Some of them could
specify the periodicity of their search such as once or twice a week. Other scientists could not
give such specific information but mentioned they often browse when they have time. As
mentioned earlier, senior ORG1 scientists delegate their searching to support personnel. Even
those scientists admitted that had they been able to manage time, they would have gone for
regular information browsing by themselves.

6.3.4.2

Perception of resources as a factor for selective use of digital
libraries

Scientists’ perceptions about resources make them prefer one resource over others. As it
emerged, one scientist thought that Google covers everything and that is the reason for that
scientist’s always approaching Google first. Similarly, another scientist’s perception that the
range of ScienceDirect is much higher than METADEX drives him to search ScienceDirect most
of the time. In general, scientists had the idea that specific publishers’ sites provide enough

238
information and it does not occur to them that such databases restrict information to the
respective publishers only. Another example in this regard is scientists’ perception that citation
indexes such as the Web of Science are associated with bibliometric data. Reward and career
advancement within an organization require good publications as one of the several measures of
achievement. This measure is captured by several citation related data such as impact factor of
journals and h-index. Mostly scientists relate the use of Web of Science to finding such data.
Apparently, according to their perception, these citation indexes only help in finding such data
(and not other information).

Similarly scientists’ perception about citation index like Web of Science is associated with
bibliometric data such as impact factor of journals. The rich content and particularly many
valuable feature of this resource completely escape the notice of the scientists. As mentioned in
earlier section 6.3.3.5, this can be described as an example of unintended use of technology.
Rewards and career advancements within the organization require good publications as one of
the several measures of achievement. Organizations emphasize information such as the impact
factor of journals and the h-index as measures of the quality of publications. As this information
is available in one of the publications related to Web of Science, scientists relate the use of Web
of Science to finding such data. This can also be treated as an example of how the powerful
organization can be instrumental in making its members develop the image of a resource.

6.3.4.3

Desire for personal achievement as a factor in electronic resource use

Desire for personal achievement is another factor driving scientists to use electronic resources.
Their competitiveness is recognized in various ways. Scientists are keen to establish their

239
credibility with project review teams and peers. They are concerned about getting continuing
support for their research projects and about maintaining their reputations or in other ways
“surviving the market”. One of the keys to this survival is to propose research projects that are
not duplicative and at the same time connected to the research trend in the specific area. To this
end, they need to consult information resources so that they can have up-to-date, comprehensive
knowledge about what is going in the field and who the key players are.

6.3.4.4

Digital resources as labor-saving devices

One factor, overwhelmingly mentioned by scientists was that using digital resources is very labor
saving and stress reducing compared to print days. Almost all informants reported that going to
the library has been reduced tremendously and they appreciated that the digital resources have
saved their time and energy and that now they can interleave their laboratory work and library
research from their table.

6.4

Chapter summary

This chapter reported the findings related to the various use structures of digital libraries by the
scientists of two academic and research organizations and the associated factors for such use
structures. Scientists of both the institutes selectively use a few of all resources available to them.
As well, they use a few features of those digital resources. The associated factors for such
digital-library use can be viewed along four dimensions, namely, environmental factors,
technological factors, organizational factors and personal factors.

240
The current digital information environment is very meaningful to the scientists as it provides
citations and content together. This environment has also brought a new work culture that
presents the scientists with both threats and opportunities. There are threats because the same
information is available in the hands of the competitors. There are opportunities because it
provides the scope for collaboration.

The technological factors that add to the environmental factor of digital-library use are access
mechanisms, various ICT tools and the learning load on the scientists. Availability of
information is meaningless unless there are simple ways to access and use it. Similarly, various
ICT tools – both hardware and software – are integrated with digital libraries thus making it very
useful for the users. However, despite these environmental and technological factors, users may
avoid certain digital resources because the cognitive demand those resources make on them.

The benefits of the information environment and the technological environment can only be
maximized through the organizational environment. Intellectually, the more the organizational
policies create mandates on the scientists to tread new paths in research, the more scientists use
different types of digital resources. Physically, the way an organization provides ICT facilities to
its scientists influences how comfortably and diligently those scientists use the digital resources.
Operationally, organizational support provided to busy scientists who are otherwise engaged in
many research administration tasks facilitates their continued use of digital libraries by
delegating the use to the support personnel. There are also interesting use structures during
performance evaluation of the scientists. The current culture of organizations to emphasize the
quality of journals in which the scientists should publish has been instrumental in seeing a

241
particular digital resource as a support tool in this regard. In that process, they were found to
completely ignore the content value of that resource but focus on the evaluative capabilities.

Finally, various personal factors also contribute to the digital-library use by the scientists in such
organizations. The habit of searching regularly, perceptions developed about the resources, and
the opportunity for personal achievement work together with other factors motivating scientists
to use digital libraries.

CHAPTER 7: VERIFICATION STUDY
7.1

Chapter introduction

This chapter presents the results of a verification study which was conducted at the end of the
original research. The verification study aimed to ascertain the trustworthiness of the original
study and its findings.

The research aimed to understand how digital-library use in Indian academic and research
institutes is being shaped by organizational and social contexts. Four specific questions pursued
in this study were: (i) what are the various patterns of interactions in which people as social
actors, in Indian academic and research institutes engage in meeting the demands of their social
world? (ii) how do information-gathering practices help those social actors meet the institutional
forces of those interactions? (iii) what are the various emergent practices of use of digital
libraries, both at the digital library level as a whole and at the feature level? (iv) how are such
digital-library use practices accounted for by different extra- and intra-organizational factors?

The study was conducted using qualitative and naturalistic research methodology. Using a
multiple case study approach, data were collected primarily through the guided interviews of
scientists working in two scientific research organizations in India. The recording of those
interviews were transcribed and subjected to inductive content analysis leading to the emergence
of various themes. Those themes were used to address the research questions of this study.

This rest of this chapter is devoted to describe the need for, and the rationale, design and findings
of the verification study.

7.2

Verification study – its relevance

Trustworthiness of a study is one of the vital aspects of research. For studies that use
experimental design and draw conclusions based on statistical procedures, trustworthiness is
addressed by internal validity, external validity, and reliability. This research was conducted
under a naturalistic, qualitative and interpretive paradigm. The researcher herself was the
instrument for data collection. The findings of the research were interpreted by her, as well, by
using theoretical sensitivity. Hence the trustworthiness of the study should be supported by
credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). There are
several ways to establish the trustworthiness of a qualitative study, such as, triangulation, peer
debriefing, and member check.

Triangulation is one of the ways to establish the trustworthiness of the findings. Triangulation
was conducted between the accounts of two members from the same group within an
organization, and between the member’s account and the organizational picture as it emerges
from documentary and other sources.

Another process towards establishing trustworthiness, which was followed throughout the data
collection and analysis, was peer debriefing. Regular weekly meetings were held with another
doctoral student discussing the modification of interview questions, observations and categories
that emerged.

244
Reconstruction gives more credibility to the findings of a naturalistic, qualitative study. Member
check is an important tool that can be used towards establishing the credibility of reconstruction
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985). For this reason, throughout the study an in-process member check was
carried out. As themes began emerging from the first few interviews, these themes were then
presented to the next interviewee in the form of light probes. In order to eliminate any chance of
influencing the interviewee, those questions were placed at the end of the interview only.
Further, a terminal member check was also conducted on a few selected themes though the
response rate was very low.

Another extended form of member-check was conducted in the form of a Delphi-like study at the
end of the main research. A few scientists from another organization were invited to participate.
Some of the important findings of the research were placed before them as statements and their
opinions, based on their experiences, were requested. This process was adopted to sample check
if some of the themes are transferrable in another context.

7.3

Verification study based on Delphi technique rationale and design

This verification study was designed after a well-known research method – Delphi technique.
Delphi is a structured group communication process in which data is elicited and collated from a
group of experts or panelists (Busha & Harter, 1980). This technique is suitable when one or
more of the following conditions exist:

245
(1)

the purpose of the study is to generate consensus of opinion of a panel of experts on a
selected issue. A well rounded consideration of an issue is possible when all the experts’
views are brought together.

(2)

such people whose opinions matter, are located in geographically diverse places and
bringing them for a meeting is expensive;

(3)

the experts have an investment in understanding or contributing to the phenomenon under
study;

(4)

the experts need to reflect on several issues before giving their opinions and hence the
time restriction under which a meeting is conducted, creates a hurdle for such reflections;
and finally;

(5)

there is a likelihood of emergence of extremely opposite opinions from the
experts/panelists which in any meeting may result in a group dynamics leading to the
dominance of a powerful group. The adverse effects of this group dynamics can be
eliminated and the experts are enabled to express their opinion freely, by keeping the
identity of each of the experts/panelists, unknown to others.

The method is based on the judgment of the selected experts, and does not rely on previous
historical data being available. In addition, the method is typically intended to provide a
judgment or opinion on the specific subject area, rather than producing a quantifiable measure or
result. This technique has been found useful for planning and forecasting.

246

The steps that are to be followed in a study employing Delphi technique are outlined below:

1. A group of experts are selected and contacted;

2. The first phase explores the subject being researched, giving experts the opportunity to
contribute information. Generally, information is collected, in this phase, through open ended
questions;

3. In the second phase, experts’ opinions are collated and an understanding is developed on how
the group views the issue. This structured view is presented back to the experts, as controlled
feedback, indicating points of disagreement and the degree of disagreement on each point.
The experts are given option to revise their earlier stand on contentious issues. At this stage a
structured questionnaire may be sent to the experts. This round may be iterated more than
once;

4. If significant disagreement is traced, the third phase is used to explore that disagreement and
determine reasons for differences.

5. In the fourth phase, a final evaluation is done on the opinions of the experts and points of
agreements are filtered out.

The verification study adopted a Delphi technique though the study was not intended for
planning or forecasting. However, the technique provided an opportunity to know the opinions of

247
organizational members of another comparable site, on the pictures of digital-library use that
emerged from the study. It also gave a scope to generate new pictures, of digital-library use, that
did not surface in the main research. Besides, though the participants of this verification study
were not geographically dispersed, keeping the time and cost of data collection at a manageable
level was a concern of the researcher. Hence this technique was adopted.

The core features of the study are:

(1) All experts were selected from a third organization. Keeping in view that the main study
followed case research method to focus on organizational context, it was appropriate to select
experts from another case;

(2) Based on the findings of the main study, several theme statements were developed and
placed before experts;

(3) Generally, in studies using Delphi technique, experts are asked about their opinions. In this
verification study, experts were asked to give their opinions on the theme statements based
on their experiences and then to narrate those experiences, if possible, in support of their
opinion. This helped verify that the opinions of the experts were grounded in reality.

The organization selected for this part is structurally the same as ORG1. It is also one of the
research organizations devoted to industrial research in the area of special materials. It has access
to a fairly good number of electronic resources, although, from the responses of the experts, it

248
emerged that there is shortage of funds that affects this collection. Twelve scientists were invited
to participate in the study and five of them responded.

7.4

Findings of the verification study

The questionnaire was developed in the form of statements (Appendix-1). Eleven themes from
the main research were used to develop statements for the verification study. Those themes were
on how information gathering and digital-library use help in (i) Alliance formation, (ii)
Confidence building, (iii) Identity – knowledgeable self, (iv) Scientific inquiry – challenges, (v)
Scientific inquiry – successful participation, (vi) Compliance, (vii) Community relation and
competition . The rest of themes were on how digital-library use is affected by (i) Learning load,
(ii) Labor saving devices, (iii) Organizational work load and delegated use of digital libraries and
(iv) Information environment and non-use of digital libraries. The findings of this study are
presented in Table-30.

The table indicates that there are strong agreements on several themes as below:
(i)

Digital libraries help scientists to present a strong case for their research proposal
outcome and thus leads the way to the formation of partnerships between industries and
the research organization (Alliance formation);

(ii)

Digital libraries help to establish the link between the research proposal and the past work
done – this leads to funding agencies’ confidence in the research proposal (Confidence
building);

249
(iii)

Challenges posed by powerful editors of journals, particularly when they make
suggestions for more experiments, can be successfully countered with the help of digital
libraries (Scientific inquiry – challenges);

(iv)

Digital libraries help researchers propose a research scheme which can be acceptable to
the research community (Scientific inquiry – participation);

(v)

Digital libraries are truly labor saving devices and collapse the distance between
laboratories and libraries (Labor saving devices);

(vi)

As digital libraries are accessible by competitors, scientists meet the competition by
making exhaustive consultation of digital libraries (Community relation –
competition);

(vii)

There is still non-use of digital libraries in those areas for which digital libraries are not
available (Environmental factor – non-use);

There was moderate agreement on the following:
(i)

Digital libraries that demand learning load, are generally avoided (Learning load);

(ii)

Scientists with high workload and with support from organization do not use digital
libraries by themselves; they delegate the task to their support system (Work load and
delegated use);

There was complete disagreement on the finding that consultation of digital libraries is required
to comply with rules and is done perfunctorily just to meet the requirements (Compliance). One

250
of the scientists elaborated that though they cannot control whether the reviewer might go
through the report carefully, they do not want to leave anything to chance and hence must make
this part of the proposal extensive. That this theme was put intentionally in negative tone
(Appendix-1: statement-6) such strong disagreement actually strengthen the original finding that
compliance from funding agencies strongly forces the scientists to engage in information
gathering using digital libraries.

It may be noted that for the themes, except “Compliance”, the degree of disagreement, where
found, was only partial. Those disagreements actually did not negate the themes. Neither did
such disagreements add new dimensions to the themes. For the theme “Alliance formation”, the
scientist who partially disagreed commented that “Indian industries are hardly interested in
funding research”. This implies that the scope of “Alliance formation” with Indian industries is
not very high. Similarly, the disagreement on “Confidence building” qualifies that such
situations occur for research funded by the government. Similarly, for the theme “Scientific
inquiry – successful participation” and the use of digital libraries in this regard, one scientist
pointed out that not all information is available in electronic format thus underscoring that
information gathering is important for this theme by entire requirements may not be met with
electronic environment. This in fact, strengthened another theme “Information environment
and non-use of digital library” that emerged from the study. Please consult Table-24 for more
details.

As the response from the scientists did not lead to any major disagreements, this study was
closed at this phase.

Agreement
Agreement was strong. Two specific points highlighted
were (i) industries sometimes, are not only interested in
the outcome but also want to know who are the
scientists involved in such research which can be
quickly found from the resources (ii) industries are
keen to see the value of the outcome, in its
commercialization
Agreement was strong – it is not only link but also the
strategy to change an ingredient to research, based on
lit review was important. Another informed the
importance of comparison of all past work to the
current and highlighting the comparison, particularly
for projects with international counterparts

Disagreement
Only point of disagreement was
that Indian industries are hardly
interested in funding research

Agreement was there for situations when speaking to
wider audience such as seminar, conferences - how

Disagreement was for project
meetings – the points of
discussions were generally focused
and scientists own knowledge is
sufficient

Strong agreement was for those challenges which
suggest to do some experiments afresh – scientists then
go back to the literature, compile data from reports
published showing that similar experiments were
already performed, results of those experiments and
link with their own findings
Strong agreement in general

Partial agreement – the reason is high level scientists
may sometime delegate this task to their juniors who
would not pay attention to this part

Comment

Only point of disagreement was
that this kind of exercise is
important for government funded
research

Irrespective of disagreement,
every one concurred that they
have to continuously monitor
current literature

Disagreement was on the nonavailability of electronic version of
every resources
Strong disagreement – generally
they have trust in reviewers’
scrutinizing this part

This question was placed in a
negative tone; It was presented
as if the compliance is to meet
the formality outwardly.

252
Theme
Learning load: Digital libraries
demanding cognitive load are
generally avoided

Agreement
Moderate agreement – reasons are late learners of
electronic medium and heavy work schedule

Labor-saving devices: digital
libraries now save labor and
time of scientists

Strong agreement – particularly one scientist
elaborated how they can check data now from the
laboratory itself without going to the library

Work load and delegated
digital-library use:
organizational work load and
support system lead to
delegated use of digital library
Community relation –
competition: digital library is
now accessible by competitors
– this awareness make the
scientists consult the same
extensively

Moderate agreement

Information environment and
non-use of digital library:
Non-availability of certain
types of information lead to
non-use of digital libraries

Strong agreement

Strong agreement

Disagreement
Disagreement – when extensive
data mining is necessary, even
difficult systems are learned and
used
Little disagreement on those cases
for which electronic resources are
not available

Comment

This aspect was further
verified through another
question against which
everyone responded that now
they can connect to Internet
from their office work table
In principle, it was agreed
upon that scientists must keep
themselves up to date
The disagreement was not on
the matter that others have
access and thus raising the
level of competition –
disagreement was that
scientists sometimes still
found not being exhaustive

Chapter summary

This chapter reported the findings of a verification study which was designed using a modified
Delphi technique – an approach that uses structured group communication. The study was
conducted using a panel of scientists (treated as experts in this study) selected from an
organization similar to ORG1 – the case selected for the main study.

The findings of this verification study confirm that with minor qualifications, the themes that
emerged from the main research hold for this verification site as well. Under similar
organizational contexts, digital-library use can be attributed to various institutional forces that
exist in the organizational environment and at the same time, the use takes specific structures
which can be attributed to various extra and intra-organizational factors.

CHAPTER 8: CONCLUDING CHAPTER

8.1

Introduction

This chapter devotes to the discussions, conclusions, limitations, implications and the future
study. A summarization of the findings is made and those findings are then discussed in the light
of the theoretical constructs used in the study. The conclusions, based on the findings, follow this
discussion. The contributions, limitations of the study, implications of the findings and the
direction for future research are highlighted at the end of the chapter.

8.2

Discussion

Successful use of any information and communication technology is not merely using its
technological features perfectly. The technology must fit into the social environment and
meaningfully serve the purpose, for which it was introduced into that environment. This is a very
pertinent way of looking at any technology use within an organization that invests in developing
technology infrastructure.

Unless this environment is taken into account and examined, justification for the financial
investment for the technology becomes impossible (Kling, 2000). This issue of looking at the
environment – understanding the use of technologies within it – is even more relevant to
organizations located in an economy that is still in the process of progressing and that has been
investing immense sums of money for expensive infrastructures with the goal of generating the
capability of its use for the betterment of the country.

255

The context of use, however, is a very large and vague canvass. In this study an attempt has been
made to precisely capture some of the components of organizational context that drive the
members of an organization to use (or non-use) digital libraries. A broad research question was
formulated. The question was how digital-library use is being shaped by organizational and
social contexts of Indian academic and research establishments. This section provides a succinct
overview of the overarching and specific research questions and the theoretical constructs used.
Following this overview, discussions of the findings in the light of the theoretical framework are
presented.

8.2.1 The research questions and the theoretical constructs – a glimpse
The set of research questions presented in Chapter-1 are as follows:
Overarching research question: How is the practice of digital-library use by people in Indian
academic and research institutes being shaped by organizational and social contexts?
RQ#1: How do the social worlds of an
RQ#2: What are the various extra- and intraorganizational member influence and shape
organizational factors mediating the practice
her/his information-gathering practice?
of DL use (including non-use) in
information-gathering activities of
organizational members?
RQ#1(a)

RQ#1(b)

What are the various patterns of
interactions in which people as social
actors, in Indian academic and
research institutes, engage in meeting
the demands of their social world?
How do information-gathering
practices help those social actors
meet the institutional forces of those
interactions?

RQ#2(a)

RQ#2(b)

What are the various emergent
practices of use of digital
libraries, both at the digital library
level as a whole and at the feature
level?
How are such practices accounted
for by different extra- and intraorganizational factors?

Conclusion: How do the organizational contexts in Indian academic and research institutes shape
DL use by organizational members?

256
The more specific questions, developed to answer the two major sub-questions of this research,
namely RQ#1 and RQ#2, are:

(vii)

What are the components of the contexts of members of an academic and research
organization?

(viii) What is the institutional nature of those components?
(ix)

What kind of information demand is made on organizational members by those
constituents?

(x)

How might information-gathering practices can be considered as helpful for those
organizational members in meeting such information demands?

(xi)

In the process of consulting digital libraries in order to support such information
gathering activities, what structure of digital-library use emerge? and

(xii)

How might the organizational context account for such digital-library use structure?

Answers to these questions were facilitated by using two theoretical constructs, namely social
actor and technology-in-practice. Social actor is an organizational individual whose actions are
responses to interactions with various institutionalized entities. These institutional entities are
located outside the boundary of a specific organization but members of an organization often
have to interact with them while discharging their organizational responsibilities.

Two Indian academic and research organizations were selected as cases for this research.
Scientists of each of these organizations were organizational members in this study. In viewing
them through the lens of social actor, the information-gathering practice and digital-library use
of scientists in Indian academic and research organizations were often found to be triggered by

257
interactions between those scientists and various entities outside their respective organizations.
Those entities have certain institutional characteristics and their information demands become
workplace demands for those scientists.

Technology-in-practice is the structure of the use of technology and this structure is facilitated by
various organizational characteristics and not only by the capability of the technology itself.
Using this lens, the research elicited a structure of digital-library use that could be associated
with a variety of organizational factors.

A theoretical explanation of the findings and the concurrence with and differences from the
literature are presented in the following sections.

8.2.2 Components of organizational contexts and information demand
The core of the construct social actor is that a socially rich description of context is possible
when the entities outside the boundary of the organization are considered. Interaction with those
entities is mediated by the exchange of some resource and certain routine actions with them are
then carried on to facilitate such resource exchange. Information-gathering practices using digital
libraries can settle in as routine actions and this can support information exchange during the
interaction with external entities. Such practices can sometimes settle in as rules, some as norms
and some other situations demand that organizational members either follow others or recognize
as intelligent individuals that the interactions demand information practices using digital
libraries.

258
Mapping scientists of organizations selected in the study, onto the construct of social actor,
helped to reveal:

(i)

Whether information-gathering practices of scientists are triggered by entities
residing outside the organization and the institutional characteristics of those
entities – the findings of the research in this regard suggest that there are many occasions
in which the scientists have to interact with external organizations or individuals and
those interactions demand information exchange. Those entities have distinct institutional
characteristics that become visible to the scientists. Those scientists found that
information exchange helps them to comply with the information demand of the
interactions. In that process information-gathering practices of scientists and digitallibrary uses become a routine job within the organization.

(ii)

Whether such information-gathering practice meaningfully lead to information
exchange between the organization members and those entities – the findings showed
that scientists could often associate their information exchange and information-gathering
practices to different meanings, depending on the nature of entities with which they
interact and exchange information.

Figure-6 provides an overview of the organizational contexts of both the selected organizations.

8.2.2.1

External institutional entities of regulative structure

Some of the entities scientists come across do have the characteristics of a regulative structure.
Those are mainly various government funding agencies and some funding agencies located in
other countries. Interactions with these entities require information exchange and it must be
made in a formal way. Applications for funds must be made in a prescribed format, which
includes a direction for submission of a literature review. Another such agency of this nature is
patent granting authority. The formal application for filing a patent requires a review of all
relevant patents in the specific area.

When scientists engage in individualistic research and require financial support, they depend
upon various government agencies and comply with this information requirement whenever they
apply for funds. This is a major activity of scientists – all scientists who were interviewed
reported their attempt to obtain funds for their own research. Patent filing, however, was not a
very intensive activity as it is considered one of the achievements during career advancements.
Besides, not all types of research lead to patents. These government agencies do not have an
official regulatory structure such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Interactions with
such agencies, however, are unavoidable for the scientists of these two organizations.

It was noted that despite the differences between the two organizations, scientists of both the
organizations interact with this entity. ORG2 policy requires that its scientists do basic research.
Funding for such research can come only from various government agencies and from a few
foreign organizations. Hence their interactions with this entity are obvious. ORG1 is mandated to

261
do research and help industry. Interestingly the mandate for scientists in ORG1 to bring in
earnings through research was implemented in a different way. In order to show earnings, ORG1
scientists began pursuing basic and individual research with the help of government funds. As
well, at the time of career advancement, ORG1 scientists have to demonstrate their output in the
form of published papers. They confided that getting papers published out of industrial research
is difficult. According to them, fundamental research produces results that are comparatively
easy to publish. These two issues – earning and publishing – were often found to be the reason
that ORG1 scientists pursue basic research and funding from government agencies. This way of
meeting the organizational mandate causes them to interact with entities having a regulative
structure.

8.2.2.2

External institutional entities of normative structure

Normative institutional structures are generally carried through training or membership in
professional/trade organizations. A member of a specific organization picks up the ways of doing
things that are approved by that organization. Information-gathering practices of scientists in this
study could also be attributed to such normative practices.

Scientists acknowledged the value of their doctoral training on information-gathering practices.
This was strongly emphasized by those who received their doctoral degrees in countries such as
the US or in the elite institutes of their own country. Comparatively, those who were trained in
an Indian university setting did not emphasize their doctoral learning processes as much. These
scientists, as well as older scientists, acknowledged that their major learning took place when
they went abroad to pursue advanced research. This picture of learning of information gathering

262
is not surprising because during the print era and even in the beginning of the electronic era,
Indian academic organizations were starved for information resources, as pointed out in the
initial chapter. Besides, during those times, formal training on information literacy was not a
general practice in academic settings.

But mere training cannot be sufficient for developing information-gathering practices as the
norm in one’s work life. The information demand from the environment works as the main
ingredient for setting the norm. One ORG1 scientist said that even a few years back it was not
the practice to develop a literature review for many industry-initiated research projects. In one
such project, the industry partner suggested preparing a literature review on the technology. This
scientist explained that since then, it has become the practice for ORG1 scientists to prepare
literature reviews for all such projects. The informal practice which started at the behest of an
industry partner is now established as a formal practice.

For both of the organizations, a large part of normative information-gathering practices could
often be attributed to interactions with the scientific community. Communications with other
scientists through publishing in journals and presenting papers at conferences/seminars are part
of a scientific life. Moreover, for both the organizations, publications are considered important
measures of achievement at the time of career advancement. The entire range of activities
regarding knowledge dissemination and communication can be viewed as interaction with the
epistemic community/invisible college. The followings sections describe these two social
organizations and highlight their possible role in the information gathering activities of scientists.

263

8.2.2.3

The epistemic community and invisible college as normative
structures

Any study involving knowledge creation cannot perhaps avoid a discussion on epistemic
community and invisible college – two institutional entities spread all over the world and
controlling and influencing knowledge generation. Though the current study is primarily on
digital-library use, we have seen that a major part of the use of digital libraries is associated with
knowledge creation. Hence it is appropriate to look at the role of these two institutions on the
information-gathering practices of scientists in Indian academic and research organization. Brief
descriptions of each of these two organizations are given below. These descriptions are followed
by an examination of how scientists in the current study are linked to these organizations and
how memberships in these organizations influence information-gathering practices.

8.2.2.3.1 The epistemic community and invisible college – a brief description
An epistemic community is an overarching social organization populated by people having
special knowledge relevant to a certain task. The knowledge can be tacit (Ha°kanson, 2005),
coded (Gittelman, 2007), or both. Membership in an epistemic community is generally global in
nature. With regards to science researchers, the objectives of the epistemic community are the
production of knowledge itself (Knorr Cetina, 1999) and to purge knowledge of the personal,
context-specific and idiosyncratic features. These objectives are attained by the community
members adhering to well-understood rules and codes of conduct governing the creation and
dissemination of the knowledge (Amin & Cohendet, 2004; Cowan, David, & Foray, 2000). Some
of the characteristics of an epistemic community that are pertinent to this discussion are: (i)

264
members of the community communicate substantive research findings through publications that
have to undergo the peer review process (Allen, 1977, p. 41); and (ii) members receive prestige,
citations and rewards arising out of publications, and they develop connections within the
community.

Another social organization, similar to an epistemic community involving scientists, is an
invisible college (Crane, 1972), which is a network of productive scientists. Invisible colleges
contribute to the growth and productivity of a field in terms of publications. During the growth
of a field, a few lead and productive scientists are often cited by others across different groups.
One way to publish rapidly is to apply the same procedures, tasks, or pieces of equipment over
and over, introducing new variables or slight modifications (Crane, p.55). Researchers, in the
pursuit of career advancement by number of publications, produce papers out of studies along
these lines. In that process, they cite earlier works. Thus, social circles of research areas have
invisible colleges that help to unify areas and to provide coherence and direction to the field. The
central figures of a field and some of their associates are closely linked by direct ties and develop
a kind of solidarity that is useful in building morale and maintaining motivation among
members. This network is manifested through the chaining of citations. Thus, over a period of
time, some papers of some authors are highly cited by others implying that those authors have
developed their followers or groups. Members of such groups communicate with each other to
discuss various issues related to their research problems. Such groups are formed around the
most productive scientists.

265

8.2.2.3.2 Information-gathering practices and normative structures

Further discussions in this connection must be limited in this study since the details of the
similarities and differences between these two social organizations are outside of the scope of the
current work. For the purposes of the current discussion it can be said that the scope of an
epistemic community is much larger than that of an invisible college in terms of membership43,
issues44, and collaboration. The scope of the invisible college is limited to the growth and
productivity of a subject area in terms of publications. Second, the discussion here is limited to
how the epistemic community and invisible college might provide context as a normative
structure that makes information demands on the scientists and thus triggers informationgathering practices.

Scientists of both the cases under study attempt to publish in internationally reputed journals.
Publication is an organizational mandate for these scientists. In addition, scientists tend to
publish irrespective of the nature of the organizations where they work (Gittelman, 2007). By
doing so, they communicate substantive research findings that have to undergo peer review
process. Out of these publications they receive prestige, citations and rewards. This process
makes them a member of their respective epistemic communities. Similarly, publications enable
scientists to participate in the growth of their respective fields and to become natural members of
their respective invisible colleges. Making a departure from this point, the following discussion
will highlight how information-gathering practices of these scientists are influenced by these
social organizations.

membership can be discipline-wise or practice-wise such as open source software development
Code for membership, prestige, rewards

266

As scientists communicate their substantive research findings to their epistemic community they
undergo scrutiny through the peer review process. During this process doubts about the findings
are raised or clarifications on some issues are sought. At that time, scientists look for supporting
information and consult various resources to establish that their views/findings are correct. Thus,
developing community relations, gaining recognition, and scientific inquiry are a direct outcome
of the role of the epistemic community on information-gathering practices. Scientists also
reported regularly scanning information in order to ascertain their position within the epistemic
community. They keep watch to see if their papers are being cited, specifically in journals with a
high impact factor. While it is pleasing to know that one’s paper has been cited in a journal with
a high impact factor, it is also an alert of probable competitors. Scientists often reported that
keeping track of trends in publications helps them to set a target to publish ahead of competitors
so that the paper gets a chance of being cited and it can elevate the position within the
community. Alternately, keeping track of information also opens up the possibility of networking
and collaboration and thus developing a group within the epistemic community. These are all
efforts towards maintaining community relationship.

Scientists in this study viewed receiving offers for editorship of journals or for writing a review
paper as marks of recognition of their knowledge. Once they acquire the recognition, they strive
to retain it and engage in regular scanning of information resources so that they can stay updated.
Table-31 provides a succinct view of how the scientists in this study attempt to retain the
membership of their epistemic communities and invisible colleges with the help of informationgathering practices.

There are, however, doubts about the production of “neutral knowledge” by an epistemic
community (Miller & Fox, 2001). More on this is discussed in Section 8.2.5.2.

In sum, the epistemic community and invisible college are part of a normative structure in the
organizational environment of the scientists. Organizational policy that considers publications as
one of the achievement of scientists brings epistemic communities and invisible colleges –
entities with a normative structure – into the organizational field. This often leads to informationgathering practices being established in the organization as a norm.

8.2.2.4

External institutional entities and cognitive structure

On several occasions, the scientists in this study recognized intuitively that information-readiness
is the way to survive an uncertain situation, for example, interactions with which they were not
familiar. They found the best strategy was be information-ready and exchange such information
during the interaction and extract benefit from it. In fact, the recent policy revision within ORG1

268
that earnings from research must be implemented in a true market sense has opened up the
external organizational environment for ORG1 for industries to enter the scenario. Because of
this new way of implementing existing policy, the organizational environment of ORG1 now has
more different types of entities than does ORG2. This has resulted in an information demand on
ORG1 that is also different from that on ORG2. In order to successfully interact with industries,
ORG1 scientists often search for new types of information. In that process they expand the scope
of digital libraries by searching websites and house journals of various companies. They can then
successfully present such information during negotiations and earn the confidence of prospective
industrial research collaborators.

Another example of such an intuitive practice of information gathering occurred when scientists
are expected to meet peers in face-to-face meetings. Those peers are “knowledgeable
individuals” and scientists make every endeavor to remain information ready so they can
participate in any discussion. Sometimes scientists attempt to understand the background and
area of specialization of the peers, specialists and industrialists with whom they might meet and
prepare accordingly. Information scanning is directed towards this preparedness.

Entities of regulative or normative structure provide clear signals to scientists, either through
instructions or through training, that information exchange is the way to facilitate interactions
with those entities and also allow scientists enough time to prepare for information. On the
contrary, entities of cognitive structure push the scientists to an uncertain situation. As the
scientists enter the market – with true objective of earning – where they have to convince the
industries about the merit of the research conducted by the organization, benefits of collaborating
with their research, there is no structure which scientists can follow. Compared to other types of

269
research, this is an endeavor to earn research funding. But there is no formal format through
which project proposal can be submitted to industries. To overcome this uncertain situation and
to convince industries, scientists collect information from various digital resources and present
those information during the negotiation which can prolong for quite some time. The scientists
take the help of information exchange under the belief that industries are also aware of what is
happening, they can be convinced only if it is shown that scientists are also aware of what is
happening and how successfully that knowledge can be transferred to some technology or
product. This belief that information is one of the ingredients to convince industries drives them
for information gathering and results in information exchange during all face to face interactions.

Similarly, scientists engage in face to face meetings with others that bring certain degree of
uncertainty. As a scientist speaks before an audience, he can be unexpectedly caught unaware of
some information, if he is not well prepared. Besides, speaking with peers may sometimes lead
to another related area. This is also a situation of uncertainty. Here too scientists believe that the
audience/peers always keep track of current information and to match their knowledge, she/he
must be information ready. Both the cases of uncertainty and resorting to information gathering
based on the belief that others engage in similar activities are the examples of mimetic
isomorphism – organizations modeling themselves after others to dispel fear of uncertainty
(Elliot & Kling, 1997). It can be summed up by saying that direct interactions with external
entities always create a situation of uncertainty and social actors depend on their belief system
which guides them for information gathering activities.

270
Thus DL use often settles within the organizations under study not only as response to rules or
norms but also for the intelligent assessment of the users about the unpredictable situation and
mimicking others in terms of information gathering. This cognitive structure or mimetic
isomorphism is the essence of new institutional theory on which the construct social actor is
based. The presence of this cognitive structure in the informants under study extends credence to
the premise that organizational members are social actors in regards to DL use.

8.2.3 The dimensions of social actors in present study
Lamb and Kling (2003) characterized social actors along four different dimensions. Those
dimensions are affiliation, environment, interaction and identity. This section describes how
information-gathering practices of scientists as social actors can be mapped onto these four
dimensions.

Affiliation is the network of relationships connecting an organizational member with other
organizations. This relationship may be developed at the organizational level or directly by
members. The findings suggest that different types of affiliates produce different information
demands. Depending on the type of affiliates scientists see their information gathering activities
differently. When the affiliate is a government funding agency, information practices help them
in complying with directives. On the other hand, when the affiliate is a prospective research
collaborator, information-gathering practices help them in alliance formation with such
industries. For affiliates such as journal editors/peers, information-gathering practices help them
in collaboration or competition.

271
The environment is the stabilized, regulated, and/or institutionalized practices that circumscribe
organizational actions and is created by the type of affiliation the organizational members
develop with others. Lamb and Kling (2003) described how the strong influence of national and
international fiduciary standards drive real-estate brokers to consult electronic information
system. In some cases, the environment encourages the building of electronic information
systems that in turn are used by the organizational members. For scientists of research
organizations such an environment leading to information-gathering practices was often found
stabilized by international practices in the area of knowledge generation. As one scientist in this
study stated, the application format for funds at various agencies is similar to that of any
international funding agency. Similarly, one scientist remarked that the practice of inclusion of
metrics such as the impact factor of journals in career advancement documentation was imported
from other advanced countries. It has resulted in an awareness and requirement for such
information. As well, as scientists interact with international journals in order to get their papers
published in them, information practices might be largely governed by the world culture in this
regard.

Interaction is the package of information that is exchanged with affiliates and also the media of
such exchanges. Different types of affiliates demand different types of information packages and
modes of exchange. Lamb and Kling (2003) found such exchange always took formally. In this
study, formal information exchange often happened, such as in producing a technology report.
For the most part, such exchanges were for the purpose of seeking research funds, either from
government agencies or from international organizations that are aimed at supporting scientistdriven research projects. Some exchanges that had been initiated informally, such as with
industry partners, were now established more formally.

272

But for the majority of interactions the information exchange takes place informally. Scientists of
both organizations emphasized that informal information exchange is equally important for them,
particularly during meetings. Such meetings are attended by specialists, peers, and so on.
Scientists remain aware that knowing the information and suitably presenting it during
discussion is important. ORG1 scientists often described that their information-readiness, at the
time of negotiation with an industry, should be reflected during the meetings. The formal project
proposal should be a very concise document as “no one has time to go through a voluminous
report”.

Identity is the presentation of the self either as an individual or as a collective entity. It was
perceived by the informants who participated in the study that such an image of self would be
enhanced when affiliates are shown that organizational members can work fluently with ICT
(Lamb & Kling, 2003). For example, it was important for a broker to present his ‘track record”
or for an attorney to demonstrate to her client that her expertise covers certain areas. Preparation
of various packages with the help of various ICT tools was perceived by the members as
advantageous and competitive. In order to present the collective self, those who lacked the skill
of ICTs, hired up-to-date skilled staff or trained current members.

Identity is very important to the scientists – both as individuals and at the collective level.
Scientists are conscious of projecting who they are and how knowledgeable they are. All
scientists across the two study sites felt they must be viewed as well-informed by others with
whom they come across in a meeting or conference. However, there was no hint that these
scientists linked their identity to their ability to use ICTs. They were more focused on displaying

273
themselves as “knowledgeable selves”. It is important that others at a meeting, for instance, must
recognize their information awareness. In submitting papers for publication, in order to get them
accepted they highlight how their papers excel and are different from others. They do not think it
is important for others to know they got such information from a digital library. At the same
time, these scientists are aware that their competitors also have access to such information
infrastructure. Hence submitting a proposal which is a duplication of work, or not citing a
scientist who is already well known in the field are not taken kindly by the community. Not
keeping track of information may make them “out of community”. Thus not using the ICT might
lower their stature within the community but its use is now an accepted norm.

This difference between the literature and the current research is probably because the notion of
social actor was developed based on the work done in the late nineties. At that time, various
ICTs were just getting introduced. As shown in Chapter-4, both the organizations selected for the
study now have access to sufficiently sophisticated ICTs and hence ICT use has become almost
mundane within the community and society at large.

8.2.4 Digital-library use patterns through the lens of technology-in-practice
Even though information-gathering practice and subsequent digital-library use were found to
have been routinized within the selected organizations, this research brought another lens to bear
on how digital libraries are used for information gathering within those organizations. Digital
libraries have a technological component and this aspect was expected to have added another
layer in developing the practice of digital-library use. Another construct – technology-in-practice
– was used to understand this aspect of technology use.

274

Technology-in-practice is the use structure of technology or to put it simply, the pattern of
repeated use of a technology. For any technology, a few of the features are repeatedly used by
the users and thus a structure of use becomes visible. This use structure may vary. The same
person may display different use structure at different points of time. Different groups in the
same organization may also exhibit different use structure. Such use structure can be attributed to
various organizational factors and not to the technology per se.

The pattern of digital-library use that emerged from this study could be identified as non-use,
delegated use, and selective use. Non-use, or limited use, of a technology could be associated
with a specific group in earlier studies (Orlikowski, 2000). The reasons why a particular group
was not using Notes – a specific software – or was using its features minimally were:
(i)

The group was subjected to strong pressure with respect to their time – each of their
working hours was billable:

(ii)

The members of the group faced strong competition within the organization for
retaining their job.

These two aspects dissuaded the members of that group from investing time in learning Notes or
sharing information through Notes, which might have made them less competitive.

Figure-7 depicts the overall idea about the digital-library use within the organizations. The figure
shows the overall availability of various types of digital resources and features or capacity of
such resources. Ideally, a trained user or information scientist is expected to use a mix of all
types of resources by using all types of features available. This is not happening, however. It

275
may be noted that the notion of non-use and delegated use could not be captured in this figure.
The figure shows the pattern of use only.

Non-use of digital libraries, in the current study, could not be attributed to any differential
organizational policy for any of the organizations selected. Non-use happens when scientists
know that a certain type of information is not available in digital media. For example, ORG1
scientists’ requirement of data from industrial plants cannot be met readily through any digital
archive – hence for such information they do not use any digital resource. Two specific cases of
non-use demand a separate discussion which is presented in section 8.2.5.3.

277
Overwhelmingly, scientists were found to use digital libraries selectively. Selective use has
various shades. It could be traced at two levels – at one level it was selective use of resources and
at another level it was selective use of features of any resource.

Organizational policy often could be associated with two different use structures within ORG1.
While junior and middle level scientists use Google and publisher’s packages predominantly,
senior scientists search for the websites and the house journals of various companies. Such uses
were found to be associated with the following reasons:

(i)

Senior scientists of ORG1 have to take more responsibilities in research
administration and take more initiative to bring in industry partners for research. This
leaves very little time for them to use digital libraries by themselves;

(ii)

The organization provides a support system in terms of manpower so that senior
scientists can delegate their information seeking requirements;

(iii)

Having reached the maximum of their career advancements, these senior scientists are
not required to show performance through publications and hence do not engage in
government funded, scientist-driven fundamental research, extensively, that leads to
publications; and

(iv)

Senior scientists are more involved in research proposals for which they look for
industry collaborators – a new feature of ORG1. This activity leads them to use

278
websites and house journals of various companies in search of various market and
techno-commercial information.

The general use structure for both organizations, apart from that mentioned above,45 can be
described as selective use with the following characteristics:

(v)

Search for information starts either at Google or at publishers’ sites;

(vi)

Scientists of both ORG1 and ORG2 have access to an array of aggregated databases,
covering multiple primary resources, which are the ideal point to start to search for
information. However, those facilities seemed to remain unused by these scientists.

(vii)

At feature levels also, those scientists referred to simple keyword search. A few
scientists were specifically asked during the interviews whether they use any of the
advanced search features and the reply was negative.

This selective use structure and scientists’ repeated utterances of “easy to use” across both the
organizations indicate the scientists’ preference for using simple systems over complicated
systems that demand more learning. One scientist at ORG1 described how earlier he used one
such aggregated database but has given up on its use since the system is very structured and
needs learning. He and many other scientists, however, admitted that Google search results in too
many hits and is not good for a subject specific search.

45

There was one deviation in the use structure and is discussed in section 8.2.5.1

279
The other reasons which might contribute to digital-library use, albeit selective use structure, are:

(i)

Environmental – the availability of vast amounts of information online – both citation
and full content together – encourages the use of such resources. At the same time,
such an information environment that is also accessible by other scientists makes the
environment in which a scientist has to survive very competitive;

(ii)

Technological – technological advancements, such as quick access to resources over
the Internet and interfaces between such resources with small and mobile devices are
some of the facilitating factors;

(iii)

Organizational – organizational infrastructure of ICT deployment, which translates
into each scientist having her/his own computer as well as Internet connectivity from
their own office space are great facilitating factors for digital-library use. Users could
specifically distinguish this current facility from that of an earlier one when they had
to run to a centralized place and share such ICT facilities with others. This brings a
sense of democratized environment in which information is available to all, both in
principle and in practice. When such democratization does not happen, for example in
a case in which ICT facilities used to be favorably deployed for senior scientists and
excluded junior scientists from use (Adams, Blandford & Lunt, 2005) – different use
structures might emerge;

(iv)

Personal – all of the above three factors have culminated into an image of digital
libraries in the mind of scientists. Now they find digital libraries as time-saving and
labor-saving device as they do not have to run to the library – thus saving time, and

280
not having to move heavy printed journals – thus saving physical labor. Scientists
now feel that their laboratory and library are together. Nonetheless, some of their
perceptions about the comprehensiveness of a resource or difficulties in learning a
resource are also contributing to their limited use of such information facilities.

8.2.5 A few special observations and possible explanations
Case study based qualitative research has an important limitation. That limitation is about
coming across some strikingly interesting finding from a single data point. The research
paradigm does not provide the scope for establishing whether such findings are idiosyncratic to
one specific informant. At the same time, only qualitative research can help to unearth such
interesting findings. As some structure has to be brought on the findings during final analysis,
some of such interesting findings may not find a place in that structure. But given the very real
nature, such findings deserve some explanation based on educated guess of the researcher. There
were a few observations emerged from the study that were different from the predominant
findings. These came from individual scientists or were about individual digital resources.

One of the findings was about using a specific resource – the ideal type of resource – by one
scientist. This finding was completely opposite to what has been observed mostly. Another was
about a particular situation of a scientist and her non-use of digital resource for reasons beyond
what have been reported by most of the scientists. The other was the non-use of a very reputed
resource for a very surprising reason. All three findings are presented here with possible
explanations.

281

8.2.5.1

Field difference, social organizations and digital-library use
structure

An exceptional case was found in which an ORG2 scientist working in the area of human
biology described a digital-library use structure that was different from that of others. He
asserted categorically that his search always starts with Pubmed. He also demonstrated some of
the ways of conducting his searches that left no doubt that he uses many advanced searching
features of this tool. He admitted that learning to search Pubmed requires an investment of time
because the advanced features are complicated. However, he patiently learned those complicated
features over the years. From the perspective of information professional this is an ideal process
of searching for information, but it is markedly different from that practiced by others, including
other ORG2 scientists doing research in Biotechnology (plant genetics) who reported using
either Google or specific publishers’ sites. We can speculate on this variation by bringing to bear
the theories reported in the literature.

PubMed is a service that provides free access to MEDLINE®, the NLM® database of indexed
citations and abstracts to medical, nursing, dental, veterinary, health care, and preclinical
sciences journal articles. It was developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM)46. An ideal information search should always
start with services such as Pubmed (or the equivalent for other fields of specialization) because
(i) such services are publisher neutral and more inclusive and thus by using such services users
can have access to information published by many sources; and (ii) the search engines and

46

http://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/pubmed.html

282
retrieval system help to conduct searches in the more structured and advanced manner that is
required to retrieve very specific information.

One possible explanation could have been organizational policy which keeps senior scientists
very busy in research administration and thus allows very little time to invest in learning
complicated system. This is applicable for senior ORG1 scientists. However, as ORG2 scientists
are not mandated to take up large projects, such time constraints are not applicable for ORG2
scientists working in any branch of Biotechnology. Hence organizational policy cannot be a
strong contender to explain this different use structure.

We can now turn our attention to the discipline-specific social organizations and their influences
on various fields. In related studies involving scholarly communications, the role of social
organizations has been unambiguously recognized (Kling & McKim, 2000). For example, being
major publishers in respective fields, these organizations shaped the communication of findings
in open access channels differently for many years. The comparison of restrictive policies
promoted by societies in the areas of psychology and chemistry with those of computer science
and physics illustrate this. Prior to and in early 2000, the American Psychological Association
instructed authors not to post articles on the Internet, intended for sending to its journals47, while
the American Chemical Society declared48 that any manuscript posted on the Internet will be
treated as “already published” and will not qualify for submission to its journals. The
Association of Computing Machinery, on the other hand, liberally allows authors to post preprints and post-prints on any personal server. Such policies adopted by scholarly societies led to
differential practices of posting in preprint servers by scientists of different disciplines. In
47

48

However a new instruction dated November 1, 2008, relaxes some of such restrictions (http://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/posting.aspx)
Modified condition is effected from January 1, 2014

283
addition, in some disciplines, such as biology, it is a practice for scientists to use different digital
corpora to submit their findings.

There are some other characteristics of social organizations of a discipline that shape scholarly
communication processes. Those are scientific orientation of a field, strategic and functional
dependence within a field, concentration of communication channels, links to market, size of the
research field, and so on.

Fields with a variety of scientific orientations may require the scientists to consult multiple
sources in various ways (Talja & Maula, 2003). Strategic dependence is the extent of
coordination of research programs and functional dependence is the extent of demonstrable
usefulness of a researcher’s result for others’ research (Fry & Talja, 2007). Depending on the
weight given within a field on this dependence, scholars may have to consult resources widely or
narrowly.

The concentration of communication channels (number of journals) is another important
characteristic of a discipline (Matzat, 2009). If the results of ongoing research are published in a
small number of journals, the research studies are much more visible than those in fields with a
low degree of concentration. This visibility, in turn, lowers the risk of harming one's own career
advancement through the sharing of information using channels such as Internet Discussion
Groups. If the link of the research to the commercial market is too strong, scientists would be
inhibited in sharing information informally – leading to the distribution of information only
through formal channels. In larger research fields, researchers are unknown to each other, which
may lead to informal communication and thus may discourage researchers from communicating

284
informally with each other through discussion groups (Matzat, 2009). The core of these points is
that depending on certain characteristics of a field, scientists may avoid informal communication
channels and thus use formal channels such as established journals or conferences for
dissemination of their research results.

Keeping in view the above possible explanations, the strong use of Pubmed and not Google or a
publisher-specific site by this scientist can be explained as follows:

(i)

As ORG2 wants its scientists to pursue fundamental research that can be carried by
the respective scientists without being bothered by coordination with other
laboratories, the strategic dependence required by this scientist is almost nil. In fact,
this scientist candidly admitted that he does not take up large projects that require a
great deal of coordination with laboratories with large facilities. For him, the
functional dependence is important in the sense that he requires that information that
would be useful for his own research.

(ii)

His field of research is strongly related to the market, specifically the pharmaceutical
market. Hence the research results are most probably published in standard journals
so that the authors do not lose their credits.

(iii)

PubMed is brought out by National Library of Medicine (NLM). The high stature of
NLM within the professional field instills confidence in the quality of information
provided by Pubmed and reifies its presence.

285
By contrast, ORG1 is a place where scientists from different disciplines work together. The
participants in this study included scientists of a variety of backgrounds, namely, metallurgists,
chemical engineers, physicists, chemists and even bio-chemists. Thus any one particular group of
scientists, physicists, for instance, contributed to developing new materials and their scholarly
communications were not limited to physics journals only. Strategic dependence is as important
as functional dependence for ORG1. Hence no single discipline-specific social organization
guides the information behavior of these scientists.

8.2.5.2

Misplaced identity of a technology – the case of Web of Sciences

Another interesting observation was on the use of a very highly specialized information resource
– Web of Science. This is the Web version of an erstwhile abstracting and indexing print
resource, namely, The Science Citation Index. Web of Science has a cognate publication that is
Journal Citation Report (JCR). JCR provides lists of journals in each discipline. Within each
discipline, journals are ranked according to a measure known as the impact factor. The impact
factor for a journal is the ratio of the number of total citations received by the journal in any
given reference year to the number of articles published in that journal in the previous two
consecutive years. Thus, the impact factor is a measure of average citation to a journal – that is,
one of the metrics of the performance of a journal. In addition, JCR also generates and provides
other bibliometric information, among these the half-life of a journal, an h-index of authors, and
others. The Web of Science offers many features that are comparable to those available in other
bibliographic databases; however, it indexes only those journals listed in JCR. Notable among
other searching features is information on how many times a retrieved item has been cited and

286
the details of those articles that have cited the item. This facility can be used to develop a
chaining of citations and a citation map.

Both the organizations selected for study subscribed to Web of Science. The interesting points are
(i) scientists of both the organizations associated this resource to bibliometric measures,
specifically, to the impact factor of journals; and (ii) they admitted they do not use this resource
at all for their information searching. Some of the scientists were specifically asked whether they
were aware of this resource. The typical responses were either she/he knew that it provides
measures such as the impact factor of a journal or that they were not familiar with it at all. The
lack of awareness of this resource was surprising because the websites of the respective libraries
were checked before commencing with interviews and it was listed on both.

Lack of awareness of Web of Science can perhaps be explained by the simile drawn between
supermarket use and technology use by organizational members (Lave, 1988, pp150-151). As
described earlier, like some of the supermarket’s aisles, some of the properties of a digital
library, remain invisible to the users. Drawing parallels to this example of supermarket use, it can
be inferred that at least for the scientists who participated in the study, across both the
organizations, Web of Science was not included in their repeatedly ordered, personally
experienced and edited versions of the settings of electronic resources.

Two terms appeared off and on during the interviews. The first one was “earning” and this term
was limited to the discussions with ORG1 scientists. The other was “publishing in good/high
impact factor journals” that appeared during the discussions with scientists of both the
organizations. Some time since the end of the eighties the notion of “good journal,” meaning

287
those with a high impact factor, was promoted within the organizations pursuing scientific
research. In ORG1 there were many of discussions about improving publication standards and
thus the visibility of the scientists. ORG2 scientists recall that the notion of “good impact factor
journals” was brought into their organization about ten years or so ago.

Career advancement is an important part of organizational life. At the point of career
advancement scientists’ performances are measured by several indicators. Publishing papers in
journals with a high impact factor is one such indicator. It’s worth mentioning here that scientists
see two aspects of their research – outcome and the output. Outcome is considered in terms of
technology/product developed or ideas advanced. Output is considered in terms of publications
in journals/conferences, patents filed, and so on. One ORG1 scientist frankly admitted that
sometimes outcomes of their research is not so significant, but output is always important as it
counts at the time of career advancements. Funding agencies also measure the success of the
research in terms of output.

There are also other occasions when scientists refer to the “high impact factor of journals” and its
importance in their working life. One ORG2 scientist mentioned that she always published in
high impact factor journals and the organization could not ignore that performance while
considering her reappointment. Several scientists mentioned that while applying for any
grant/reward they always provide the list of their publications and the impact factor of the
journals in which they published. One ORG1 scientist showed the communication from the
editor of a journal on how publishing a review article by their group in that journal had increased
its impact factor. An ORG2 scientist described how he continuously monitors whether citations

288
to his publications are made from any journal with an impact factor higher than the journal of the
cited article.

In ORG1, however, there are scientists who do not agree about the rationale of using the impact
factor as the absolute measure of the quality of a journal. To a question on how he uses Web of
Science, one ORG1 scientist related that he does not as he does not believe that impact factor is
an appropriate measure of the quality of a journal. But, he also admitted that another colleague of
his provides him that information regularly. Even if they do not use it, though, they too
associated Web of Science with the impact factor of journals and not with information searching.

The strong promotion of the notion of “high impact factor journals are good journals” by
organizations, with the aim to promoting the quality of publications by their scientists has
created a strong image in their minds that this resource can provide only such information. This
image of Web of Science has further been strengthened by various funding/rewarding agencies
seeking information on impact factor of the journals where an applicant has published. The
powerful content and search facility remain completely invisible to the scientists. As a result, as
far as could be ascertained in this study this resource is never associated with information
gathering activities.

The above phenomenon can be explained as Orlikowski (2000), stressed that while using a
technology, people draw power, knowledge, assumptions, and expectations about the technology
and its use. Training, communication, and previous experiences influence these aspects. Users
also draw on their knowledge of and experiences with the institutional contexts in which they
live and work, and the social and cultural conventions associated with participating in such

289
contexts. In certain situation such expectation can override the capability of the technology as it
was found for Web of Science. The content and powerful search features were completely
ignored and the resource was either used for a minimal reason or not used at all.

8.2.5.3

Non-use and epistemic communities/invisible colleges

Two more cases of non-use of digital libraries warrant some discussions. One ORG2 scientist
described her non-use of digital resources for one specific type of research. According to her,
there is no information in this area because advanced countries did not have such agricultural
problems until very recently. Hence in all the time she was working on this very country-specific
problem she had problems finding information. She also struggled to get her papers accepted in
good journals published in advanced countries since the editors of those journals would not
admit that a problem such as the one on which she was working existed.

Another scientist reported an almost identical problem. This scientist originally trained in biochemical science moved to ORG1 and initiated her research in a new setting different from her
area. The problems she faced were (i) the field being very new, the research was still limited to
observation levels; (ii) there was not much published in journals; and (iii) she being placed in an
engineering laboratory, which was yet to accept this new research paradigm, found it difficult to
access the minimum resources that are available because she was the only scientists who would
use such expensive resources.

Though one view of the purpose of an epistemic community is to produce “neutral knowledge,”
there is a different view, however, according to which knowledge is dependent on perspective.

290
Earlier projects, histories, and perspectives guide scientists to figure things out, and thus science
is culturally and historically situated (Miller & Fox, 2001). This view of epistemic community
and invisible college can possibly explain why the ORG2 scientist does not get enough
information support. As the issue that she pursued was not global in nature, it finds a place
neither within a given epistemic community nor within the scope of an invisible college. Hence
no information is generated in her area that can induce her to use digital resources. This also
shows how the information environment can be created by these two social organizations.
Because of the lack of published reports, gaining the confidence of peers and getting papers
published become extremely difficult. Information-gathering practices make her aware of such
difficulties, but at the same time it becomes a challenge – the absence of published information
enables her to claim the newness of her knowledge claims.

While for this ORG2 scientist the information environment is created by the global epistemic
community, for the other scientist in ORG1, the epistemic community is more localized. As the
organization is mandated to work in engineering areas involving non-biological materials, an
individual researcher attempting to develop a link between the two paradigms of research finds
difficulty in getting information infrastructural support within the organization. Whatever the
reasons are, in both cases the situation leads to non-use of digital resources.

8.2.6 Digital-library use – observations across cases
In a multiple case study, findings should be same or should be different for predictable reasons.
This is the strength of research following this strategy (Yin, 1994). It was a conscious choice of

291
the researcher to select two organizations of different types in order to see whether the
organizational contexts, when sufficiently different, lead to shape digital-library use differently.
This section discusses how the findings were similar or different for these two cases and possible
factors to which such similarities or differences could be attributed. To begin with, a summary of
the characteristics of both the organizations is presented in Table-32.

Table-32 indicates that both the organizations have on par ICT and resources facilities. This
certainly leaves out any explanation of a digital divide in terms of resource and access among the
scientists of these two organizations. Hence the nature of each organization in terms of goals,
policies and program can be considered to be the only discerning context.

How similar are the organizational environments for ORG1 and ORG2 and how such
similarities are reflected in the digital-library use of the scientists of these organization?

Figure-6 reveals that there are certain similarities in the organizational environment of both these
organizations. Both the organizations support scientist-driven funded research and taking part in
scholarly communication is mandatory for these organizations. For funded research, the funding
agencies are the major stakeholders. The standard and explicit procedure for funding creates a
rule like structure that make information gathering as compliance and digital-library use can be
viewed as part of that compliance. In addition, for scholarly communication, scientists of both
organizations are often pressured for digital-library use. The stress on publications and the link
between publications and career advancement in both organizations effectively made the
normative structure of the environment similar for both organizations. In addition, scientists of
both the organizations participate in various seminars, conferences that lead to face to face
meetings. These interactions bring a degree of uncertainty about their interactions with external
entities, primarily peers, and cognitive structure drives scientists to consult digital libraries to
meet the unexpected information demand from such interactions. Overall, scientists of both the
organizations consult digital libraries of bibliographic information in all these cases.

293
The similarity between both the organizations, in terms of types of external entities, information
demand created by such entities, digital resources used by scientists may give rise to the
speculation that irrespective of organizational context, the digital-library use remains same and
thus context does not matter. However, as mentioned earlier, the reason behind the similarity
between both the organizations resulted because of the way the mandate of “earning” was
implemented in ORG1 by considering research grant from other government agencies as earning.
This implementation made ORG1 scientists to participate in individual research projects funded
by other government agencies. This implementation brought similar kind of external entities in
the organizational environment of ORG1 and ORG2 that lead to similar type of information
demand and use of digital libraries. This made ORG1 look similar to ORG2 and results in many
similarities with respect to information-gathering practices between these two organizations. In
fact, until a few years back, when ORG1 started to moving to other types of research, there was
probably no difference between ORG1 and ORG2. As long as there are similarities in
organizational context, similarities in the findings related to digital-library use confirm that cases
under similar contexts should show similar findings (Yin, 1994).

How different are the organizational environments for ORG1 and ORG2 and how such
differences are reflected in the digital-library use of the scientists of these organization?

As ORG1 moved to research areas in which industries are also stakeholders, its organizational
environment expanded. Its scientists now participate in research projects that are funded by
government and research agendas are developed jointly by industry and ORG1. Such research
projects sometimes involve other research laboratories and academics from reputed
organizations. Unlike scientist-driven research, for which information gathering using digital

294
library takes place as compliance, this activity has developed more as a norm, from an informal
to a formal activity for the researches involving industries. According to a scientist, this activity
was not followed even a couple of years back and started as one of the stakeholders suggested.
An informal demand from industry for a technical report has now been transformed into a
regular and formal practice of producing such reports. Research projects of this type are
reviewed or evaluated by committees made up of industrialists, technocrats and academics. Faceto-face interactions with such people in those meeting often bring an uncertain situation and
cognitive structure guides scientists to be information ready in those meetings. Digital libraries
are used in support of information gathering activities in order to cope up with such uncertainty.

Very recently, the notion of “earning” has been implemented in ORG1 in a market oriented
fashion. ORG1 is now targeting industries for partnering with their research projects. In this
changed scenario, industries are entering as external entities into the picture of the organizational
environment. Though it is too early to make any conclusive comments on how this new
component will finally shape the information activities within ORG1, scientists involved in this
area already feel the need for different information practices and have been orienting themselves
in this regard. They are looking for new sources for information and new ways of packaging it
for exchange with industry. Scientists realize that information exchange is important during the
process of negotiations. But neither there is any prescribed rule nor any normative direction on
how to conduct such information exchange. Scientists believe that it is important to convince
those prospective partners by providing information on latest developments in the field, the
business scope and also where can be the prospective market of their product. Thus not only
technical information, but also market information is also becoming an important constituent in

295
information package prepared and exchanged. In order to collect such information, scientists
often use different kinds of digital resources – namely, websites of various companies or house
journals posted by such companies. Thus digital-library use of ORG1 scientists is different from
that of ORG2 in the sense that not only ORG1 has different entities in their organizational
context but they also use different types of digital resources.

Scientists of each of the organizations use some special databases. ORG1 scientists use patent
databases for their business negotiations. There were also report from some of them of their use
of the Web based archives of lecture materials and other materials maintained by individual
scientists. Such materials are useful for their self-development and also conducting classes.
Similarly, some ORG2 scientists reported use of special databases to update information on their
findings – that is the prevalent way of intimating their peer community about their new findings,
use of genetics databases for verifying information. Besides, one scientist reported of occasional
use of some government sites to collect biotechnology related data. Such data is helpful for
preparation for a discussion with people engaged in movement related to environment pollution.

The discussion above shows that organizational environment of ORG1 contains more variety in
terms of external entities than that of ORG2. Though there are some overlaps between the types
of digital resources used by scientists of these two organizations, there are differences too
between the types of resources used by them. There are however, striking similarities between
these two organizations, in their use of technical features of digital libraries. This has been
despite the difference in the fields of specialization that are served by each organization. Overall,
scientists of both the organizations were found to prefer simple resources, use minimal features
of resources and almost completely avoid certain resources.

296

8.3 Context, its nature and location – the researcher’s reflections
With the findings of the study at hand, certain questions emerge on the context. Those questions
are whether context really matters in digital-library use, are users aware of their context, are
there relations between external context and internal context and so on. This section attempts to
address some of those issues.

Does context really matter in digital library use? The findings indicate that technological
exploitations of digital libraries – using the types of resources and technical features of those
resources – are predominantly same for both the cases. This may give an impression that
organizational context does not matter in digital-library use. This impression, however, is not
correct. Certainly for both the organizations, the use of technical features of DL emerged same
but this is one of several layers of use in this study. The reasons explained here.

As discussed in section 8.2.6, though outwardly ORG1 and ORG2 are different, implementation
of certain policy in a particular manner within ORG1 reduced the internal difference between
these two organizations. In this respect, the information demands generated by external entities
are the same and digital-library use acquires same meaning for both the cases. This similarity is
expected as in a multiple case study, the findings for similar cases should be same (Yin, 1994).

On the other hand, as new dimensions are added to the organizational context of ORG1, the
organizational context of ORG1 expands (Figure-6). This new and expanded organizational
context creates new types of information demand and digital-library use acquires more meaning.

297
As a result, compared to ORG2, ORG1 now has more variety in information demand from
external entities, its scientists are using greater variety of digital resources and digital-library use
in ORG1 has more meanings.

It will be an educated speculation that in future if ORG1 stops scientist-driven, government—
funded research (a possibility expressed by one of the informants) and drives for only industry
collaborated research, its organizational context will be very different from that of ORG2. Such
difference may be reflected in their information gathering activities, in terms of types of
information and information resources.

Another example of the difference in context leading to difference in information gathering can
be found from the literature. In the introduction it was mentioned that ORG2 in Biotechnology
area was selected in order to compare the findings with the literature. From the literature (Lamb,
King and Kling, 2003), the information gathering activities of a pharmaceutical company that
was placed in a strong competitive market and surrounded by compliances of various authorities,
appeared to be very extensive and aggressive and up to date until the point of submission for
renewal of license. The sense of “winning and retaining the market” by using information
gathering activity as one of the means, was very clear in the literature. Such extensiveness and
competition was not found in the information-gathering practices of ORG2. It was one time,
routine activity as compliance to the funding agencies in ORG2.

The next question that arises is whether there is any relation between external and internal
context and if so, did it play any role in this research. The study suggests that ultimate DL use
has several layers and is often mediated by contextual factors at different levels. These different

298
levels of context are interconnected with each other and produce a resultant force on DL use.
While social actor helps to identify external contextual factors, technology-in-practice points to
both external and internal contextual factors.

Interactions with external entities in the form of formal organization, social organization and
individuals often trigger DL use that acquires a meaning in such interactions. At the same time,
global information environment, specifically the availability of citation and content together and
awareness that competitors too have access to these resources create an impetus on DL use. Thus
information demand from external entities and global information environment complement each
other resulting in scientists’ use of digital libraries. The other component of external context that
further accentuates the use is the technological environment comprising accessibility, portability,
interfacing capability of DLs with other ICT tools.

Internal context, however, also contributes to DL use. Within the organization, its research
policy determines the external environment and also creates a division amongst the science
workers. This external environment and internal division results into a specific use structure in
terms of resources. As we saw, ORG1’s policy to conduct research in collaboration with
industries have driven the senior scientists to approach for such projects and interactions with
industries demand that those scientists consult digital resources that are different from those used
in other research projects. Such division leads to specific contexts for individuals in terms of
tasks to be performed, role of a member within the organization etc. All these make up what has
been referred to earlier as “within the organization context or internal context”. At any point of
time such internal context may vary from one scientist to another leading to different type of

299
information gathering. This context may even vary for an individual scientist over a period of
time.

ICT policy of organization too contributes as internal contextual factor that must be reckoned
with. Without a generous ICT policy under which scientists are free from any worry to access
and consult DLs directly from their workplace, a different picture might have emerged.

Thus at any moment, there are interplay between internal context of an individual scientist and
external context of the organization. In this study, however, this interplay did not affect the
findings as the starting point of observation was the information-gathering practice of individuals
(a resultant action of her/his internal context).

The next issue is whether context resides in the mind of the user or context is a researcher’s
construct. The findings suggest that technology users are aware of the power relation between
them and external entities. For example, even very senior scientists admitted that a reviewer’
question must be honored with sufficient information support. This awareness of users about the
powerful position of the external entities has been acknowledged in the notion of social actor.
On the other hand, this researcher did not see that the informants view those external entities as
“context”. Users view the interactions with those external entities as part of their job. It is only
observable when informants could describe how their information gathering is linked to those
external entities.

300
A related question is whether each scientist has a different context. It must be recognized that at
the actual moment of operation, each scientist has her/his own context. This is particularly true
while internal context is considered for scientist. But that is a very micro view of context. Such
individual contexts are also fleeting in nature and difficult to capture beyond experimental level
as recognized (Fidel, 2012). In fact for any scientist such context also changes very frequently.
This study did not attempt to capture context at such micro level.

The choice of easy-to-use resources and simple features of resource by the scientists sensitize us
about the quality and relevance of information that are retrieved by the scientists. Information
Science has always stressed on relevant and quality information. This is the point of departure of
the design efficient information retrieval system. Complicated search features have been
developed to help retrieve information with a balance between recall and precision. The findings
of this study make us to think on the position of relevance with respect to the findings. The
researcher’s reflections on this matter are presented here.

Information gathering, preparing technology report/bibliographies have long been entrusted with
professional librarians/information scientists. It is still probably done in many places. However,
in the two cases selected for this research, scientists themselves were involved in their
information gathering activities. In some cases this activity is delegated to juniors who help them
in their research. While by training, librarians/information scientists are likely to use credible
information resources and using many more advance features of such resources, scientists seem
not to be very aware of the process of establishing the relevance. It is certain that they find out
relevant information – otherwise it would have been difficult for them to survive – but they do

301
not follow the standard procedures. Notwithstanding the availability of standard information
finders and of powerful features supposedly to increase the relevance of retrieved information
and the information professionals’ concern about helping users getting relevant information,
actual users in the current study seemed not to be concerned whether they were missing relevant
information. Though the issue of quality and satisfaction was not rigorously pursued, there was
no indication that informants were not satisfied with retrieved information that they used for
various purposes. Informants mentioned about the difficulties when the Internet is slow but
sounded very accommodative that Google often retrieves too general materials.

All these as mentioned above leaves room for speculation on how much importance is given to
relevance in real world, whether the abundance of information now has reduced the importance
of relevant information, whether there is a tread off between relevance and quick information, or
what has been observed is a very specific trait for the cases that were selected. More importantly,
the question arises is whether there is a paradigm change in how users look at the issue of
relevance “relevance”. As this research never targeted to measure the quality/relevance of the
information, it is not possible to provide any conclusive evidence in favor or against any such
hypothesis that by using digital libraries in a limited way, scientists are missing quality/relevant
information. Future studies may attend this particular area. The findings, however, aligns with
the characteristics of social actors – people are not users of digital library. In their extreme busy
schedule, they hang on what worked easily for them – centrality is not on technology or its
output, it is on what works easily.

302
The findings give rise to another question on whether context matters same or differently for
different users. Going by the notion of multiple case study (Yin, 1994), similar context should
produce identical results or different results for predictable reasons. This is corroborated at least
by the present study. Context can be compared to the large sky, a fraction of which was possible
to capture through this research. The study looked through the eyes of the informants at their
digital-library use and traced the external entities that made up that large sky. Incorporating more
number or different types of organizations could have brought more granularity of organizational
context. Quantitative paradigm of research considering context as external variable would have
been more helpful to establish whether context matter differently for different people Moreover,
the direction of observation in this research was from action (information gathering) to context –
this direction is required to be changed in order to garner support for any hypothesis in this
regard.

This study contributed to develop a larger picture, based on individual account, of organizational
context and its components that pressure organizational members in using digital libraries. This
also met the initial target of the research, that is, to develop a description of context which is
largely absent in the literature of information need, seeking and use. However, in comparison to
the micro-view of context of individuals which is very fleeting in nature and difficult to capture
beyond experimental studies, this macro-view of organizational context is more stable and can be
expand when more organizations of different types and in different cultures are included.

This research started by pointing to the limitations of using usage data as the only measure of
digital-library use. Bishop (1998) pointed out that usage data cannot say how scientists use such

303
download. By developing the meaning of use, this research sheds light on how digital libraries
are exploited in the workplace of scientists.

8.4 Conclusion
This study was conducted within the paradigm of qualitative and naturalistic research, using the
case study approach. It did not take any of its findings outside the selected cases for measuring
the statistical significance of those findings. Hence, it is not claimed here that the following
conclusions are universally true. Besides, the context is ever-changing. Organizations change
their policy or the way of implementing the existing policy, as found in the case of ORG1. New
developments take place for technological infrastructure. Thus change of time and space that
make up the boundary of a case can influence the phenomena that take place within it. The point
of departure of this study was to explore whether a descriptive account of the context of digitallibrary use can be developed and whether such context might shape digital-library use. As far as
the selected cases are concerned, organizational context could be captured in terms of various
components and those components could be attributed to information-gathering practices with
the help of digital libraries. The findings can be summarized as:

(i)

Predominantly Information Scientists view digital libraries as tools at the hands of
information seekers such as scientists who use this tool in order to fill their
knowledge gap in the process of creation of new knowledge. There are, however,
other views of digital-library use. From organizational perspective, knowledge
creation is the business of those research organizations that appoint scientists for
doing research. These research organizations, like any other business organization,

304
are located within varying degree of technical and institutional environments made up
of various entities. Scientists have to interact with these entities as part of their
organizational responsibilities and such interactions create information demand on
them. Scientists are obliged to meet those information demands as they recognize the
power relation between them and those entities. Digital-library use of these scientists
can often be associated to meet these obligations. Thus digital-library use acquires
different meanings for the scientists depending on who is creating the information
demand.

(ii)

Social actors are new institutional view of technology users within an organization.
They not only use technology in order to meet compliance or norms but also use it
based on the belief that others who matter in their workplace use that technology.
Thus technology use results as mimicking those others. This mimicking others either
by observing or through belief structure is an important aspect of new institutional
view. Such mimicking takes place when individuals under study are in an
unpredictable situation that does not guide them either through rules or through norms
what should be the best way to cope up with the situation. When a research
organization enters a market driven situation, as we found for ORG1 or when it is a
matter of competition within the knowledge world as we found for the scientists from
both the organizations, scientists are placed under such unpredictability. They attempt
to win the situation and digital library use becomes helpful in such situation. However
such uses of digital libraries are often the result of their belief that others also use this
resource and a successful interaction with those others requires consulting digital

305
libraries. This is the social actor view of scientists under study. As the social actor
view of scientists helps to see how digital library use can be related to demand of
organizational environment, it also helps to see how this ICT enabled tool helps to
meet organizational goals.

(iii)

Despite an array of meanings of digital-library use emerged depending on the entities
of organizational environment with which the scientists of selected organizations
interact, the process of actual use was found almost similar for both the organizations
with some variations. Often the action of use was not related to content or
technological merit of a resource. Rather it was a resultant action of the information
environment, ease of access and use of a resource, organizational facilities provided
to access such resource and several personal issues such as habits of searching,
perception about a resource and the likes. As a result, often scientists were found to
use the easy search engines like Google and avoiding systems that create learning
load, the resources which provide full content rather than citation only. There were of
course some data points that showed a different picture but such picture was not
common across the data points of the study. This aspect supports the notion of
technology-in-practice which stresses that the capabilities of a technology are
available same to anyone who has access to it; however, the actual use depicts that
some of those capabilities are recurrently visible to users and such visibility can be
attributed to various organization-related reasons.

306

Hence, it can be concluded that for the organizations selected for this research, the use of digital
libraries is often the result of workplace demands. These demands are created by various
institutionalized entities outside the boundary of those organizations. At the same time, the use of
digital libraries as technology is shaped by another set of contextual factors from both within and
outside the respective organizations.

The meaning system attached to digital-library use, as emerged from the study, connects the
digital-library use to the organizational responsibilities of the members. This does not mean that
the research minimizes the role of digital libraries in information seeking which is triggered by
the desire to acquire knowledge or by the knowledge gap faced by the scientists. But often
information gathering activities and digital-library use were found associated with organizational
responsibilities in this research. This association indicates the social relevance of digital libraries.

In the introduction, it was mentioned that this research is as much about the context as it is for
digital-library use. The study shows that it is possible to draw a larger and stable picture of
context – organizational context in this case – compared to transient immediate context of
information seeking. More importantly, this research did not relegate the context to a mere
background – context had an active association to digital-library use.

307

8.5 Implications of the findings
The implications of the findings of the research can be viewed along several dimensions. Those
are theoretical implications, methodological implications, and practical implications such as
information literacy training, system design etc. Those dimensions are discussed here.

8.5.1 Theoretical implications
The findings suggest that the selected theoretical constructs – social actor and technology-inpractice – were helpful lenses to explain the digital-library use of scientists. It was possible to
have inner view of how scientists of study sites relate their DL use to different situations that are
generated from forces external to the organizations. Thus, the findings overcome, at last
partially, the limitation of download data to reveal whether an attempted access to DL is
associated with an intended use (Bishop, 1995). The findings also suggest that though outwardly
all information gathering activities look same – those are in response to fill the information need
of individuals – those activities have inner meanings that are indicative of digital-library use.
Those meanings take shape depending on “the other” with whom the user is interacting, and how
powerful “the other” is in that interaction. The findings also showed how the digital-library use is
being institutionalized within the selected cases – a core capability of the construct social actor.
At the same time the outcomes of the research also suggests that the constructs are applicable
beyond business firms (Lamb & Kling, 2003) or specific ICT (Orlikowski, 2000).

308

8.5.2 Methodological implications
Case study based qualitative research attempts to provide deep insight into the phenomenon
under observation and build the picture inductively. This process may lead to such questions as:
(i) is there a way to confirm that every type of digital-library use within a case was captured (ii)
could it happen that findings in the current study is too skewed given the fact that there were
only 3 informants from ORG2 as against 15 from ORG1 (iii) how to ensure that all data that
emerged from the research were properly captured. Some reflections of the researcher in these
issues are provided here.

For none of the cases, all prospective data points could be covered. This, however, is the
characteristics of the research paradigm and methodology adopted. The study aimed to build the
picture of the organizational context of DL use and captured as many types of relation between
DL use and organizational entities as reported. In that process, all relations, as described by the
informants were considered even though a few relations were reported just by one informant
because that helped to add a new dimension in the digital-library use within the organization. As
highlighted in Section 3.4.2, care was taken to recruit scientists working in different types of
projects. In all likelihood the research did not capture the entire list of relationship between DL
use and external entities. However, it can be said with certain degree of confidence that the
research captured an exhaustive list within each case.

Were the findings too skewed in favor of ORG1 from where 15 scientists participated as against
3 participants from ORG2? In other words, was it possible to see a different picture had more
scientists from ORG2 participated in the study? Or was it possible to see a different result, had a

309
large organization in the area of Biotechnology been selected instead of ORG2? In this
connection, it is important to go back to the backgrounds of both ORG1 and ORG2 which have
been discussed in Chapter-4. It may be recalled that organizational policy and the mode of its
implementation together contribute to create organizational environment. The policy of ORG2
encourages its scientists to do research with the help of grants received from various government
agencies and those researches are generally individual scientist oriented. This is where the
organizational context is different for ORG2 from that of ORG1 whose scientists are required to
do industrial research and earn in a more business like environment. As long as the
organizational context is same, the findings are not likely to be affected by the size of the
organization. Besides, for ORG2, nearly half of the scientists, engaged in the research in
Biotechnology, participated in the study. However, if the study could involve a biotechnology
organization of different type, it is quite likely that some more typologies with respect to DL use
would have emerged from the data.

8.5.3 Practical implications
The practical implications of the findings are directed to such areas as information literacy
programs, and system/interface design. The premise of these implications is that relevant and
quality information can be obtained through effective use of systems and one or more of these
directions help getting such quality and relevant information. At the same time, this approach
places importance to the centrality of the technology. Keeping this in mind, some practical
implications of the study are discussed here.

310
Almost without exception, the informants in the research confirmed that do not turn to libraries
always for getting required information. It remains to be verified with actual data whether
libraries in organizations under study and elsewhere are shrinking in terms of manpower in this
regard and whether the job of searching is not delegated to librarians (with an expectation that
use pattern will be different). However, forcing the users to turn to librarians for their job will be
against the spirit of information literacy and current digital environment. The objective of
information literacy programs is to develop lifelong learners and empower users. Current digital
environment certainly favors this empowerment and users should turn to libraries in seeking help
in information gathering, only when they think that they are not getting satisfactory information.
At the same time, in all probabilities, it is not possible for a scientist to turn to libraries while
preparing for a seminar or before going to a meeting for evaluation of her project. Besides, some
of the interesting happenings as found in the study that library and laboratory are now
interleaved cannot be turned back in this electronic age.

Information literacy programs can be used in two ways as intervention. First, the value of
authoritative information should be highlighted. Second, information literacy program must be
initiated at an early stage of education of individuals. For all the scientists who were interviewed,
learning the use of digital libraries happened when they were on job. An earlier sensitization not
only on the value of information but also the value of authentic information sources and
maximizing the use may change the situation. It may be recalled from the study of Walsham &
Sahay (1999), training the users on maps was thought one of the ways for meaningful use of
GIS. However, success of such information literacy program can be expected if the paradigm of
relevant and quality information still holds good.

311

It is an educated guess that now as well as in coming days, users will first be introduced to
Google and then to any specific DL. The implication is that Google’s simplicity will always be
known and appealing to users. The world of digital libraries, on the other hand, is still
complicated and more importantly, fragmented. It is fragmented in the sense that no single DL
can meet all the requirements of a scientist in a single sitting. Providing a single window to all
resources may be a good solution. Federated search engines, Discovery services are new tools in
this regard that are coming to the market. However, each of these two services has its own
demerits, both technology and business wise. Besides, both this category of services are
expensive. So it still remains to be seen how these services are picked up and bring any change
in DL use structure in coming days.

8.6 Contributions of the study
The contributions of the study are:
A new way of understanding the use of a technology:
The use of a technology is generally measured in terms of numbers – number of people using the
technology, or the number of times the technology is used. This has been predominantly the case
of measuring the use of digital libraries. Such numbers have, so far, been used as strong
indicators of the use of digital libraries.

The number of uses, however, cannot tell us how the technology is put to actual use. This is
particularly true for usage statistics of digital libraries. For example, if measuring the use of the
Internet by ordinary people is the objective of a study, a specific segment, such as the banking

312
segment for instance, may be chosen. Then the study can collect data on how many customers of
different banks have utilized the online or mobile banking facility and the Internet use statistics
may be correlated to such banking segment data. This kind of correlation can reveal the extent to
which the Internet is used for a very important aspect of life.

In information environments supported by organizations whose primary objective is knowledge
creation and to contribute to the self-sustenance of society, it is much more difficult to ascertain
such a correlation. Besides, in many information environments users’ hoarding habits are a
known information behavior. Thus, a part of download data may be due to such a habit.

This study looked into how the environment poses challenges to scientists regarding knowledge
claims made by them and how digital libraries help them in meeting those challenges
successfully. With respect to an organizational environment, such challenges are raised by those
to whom those knowledge claims matter. By identifying those entities, this research developed a
more detailed description of the context, which was by and large absent in context-based
information behavior research. The research then also revealed the possible meaning of digitallibrary uses by those scientists in the process of responding to the challenges from such entities.

A new way to understand the social relevance of digital libraries
Another contribution of this study is to understand the social relevance of a technology in an
environment that is culturally different from the one where it was developed. So far, qualitative
studies on digital libraries/ICTs paid attention to how actual users might contribute to their
development and use. However, many ICT-enabled technologies are developed within one
specific economic and cultural environment. Those technologies are then globalized as other

313
countries/cultures adopt those technologies with a view to improving their social lives. As each
technology is inscribed with cultural values of the place of origin, it is worth investigating how
such technological properties are appropriated in another culture.

Some of the findings of this research on the digital-library use structure show that though digitallibrary use has a meaning for the scientists who use it, the use structure has some interesting
features. The observations on the use of Web of Science or high use of Google by scientists in
their search of information attest to such peculiarities.

8.7 Limitations of the study
Digital-library use is a global phenomenon and hence a question may arise on whether the
findings can be comparable with similar organizations within the country as well as
organizations in other countries. The research does not make this claim although the verification
study confirms some of the findings to a great extent. The findings of this study are limited to the
selected cases only, and generalization to any population was not the objective of this study.

Organizations are different depending on their objectives and also on the economic and social
environment within which they are set. There are research organizations in India that work in
highly confidential areas, such as defense or nuclear science. As government totally funds those
organizations, scientists of those organizations are unlikely to look beyond their organizations
for research funding. Unless organizations develop affiliations with external bodies/individuals,
the external organizational environment does not get created for them and it may be difficult to
establish that digital-library use within those organizations is in response to the demands of such

314
an environment. Similarly, research organizations in other economies and cultures may have
different environments. Unless those are taken into consideration, it is not possible to come to a
conclusion regarding how the environment contributes to digital-library use.

It should also be noted that this study was designed to complement the studies based on
usage/download data. This study did not attempt to provide any link between such usage data
and the findings of the research. However, a future study linking these two aspects should be
meaningful.

The study also did not attempt to develop to any meaningful measure that could be exploited to
measure the actual usefulness of the digital libraries. Developing such measures was out of the
scope of the current research.

8.8 Future study
Some of the issues to which future research can be directed are:
(i)

Developing an indicator that can capture the successful integration of digital libraries
within their social environment – such indicators may complement the findings that
are available from studies based on download/usage statistics;

(ii)

There seemed to be certain shortcomings in the information literacy training that is
offered to users. Mostly such literacy training is limited to how various features of a
system can be used. The study findings obviously show that despite such training,
users are not interested in most of those features. It may be worth examining whether

315
the information literacy training programs should orient themselves towards the value
of information-gathering practices. It may not be sufficient to train users on how to
identify the reliable sources of information. Training on how reliable information can
be successfully used may sensitize future generation of users greatly.

(iii)

The new digital environment, in most cases, is packaging content and citation
together. How such a feature contributes to the meaningful use of digital libraries and
what the indicators for such meaningful use can be could make up another fruitful
study area.

In other words, the findings of this research open up the possibilities of future investigations in at
least three areas. These are: developing new measures of use which can complement the existing
measure of use through download statistics, exploring new ways of conducting training for
information literacy, and developing an understanding of the meaning of “use” of digital libraries
as technology.

8.9 Chapter summary
The findings of this case study, conducted within the paradigm of qualitative and naturalistic
research, are limited to the selected cases only. This concluding chapter described the findings in
the light of existing literature and highlighted the areas of concurrence with and deviations from
earlier studies. The chapter, at the end, brought to the attention of the readers some of the areas
of future studies.

316
The point of departure of the study was a search for an explanation of digital-library use. Digital
libraries make up an expensive ICT-enabled information infrastructure in an organization.
Predominantly the use of digital libraries has been measured in terms of the number of contacts
between users and the infrastructure. Such measures, however, cannot explain what happens
before and after such contacts. The study focused on the context to better understand the
phenomenon of digital-library use.

The context was further narrowed down to the organizational environments of two Indian
academic and research organizations. There were two reasons for this choice. The choice of
using the organizational environment as the context for studying digital libraries in the first place
was made because it is the organization that arranges for the infrastructure to be used to meet the
goals of the organization. The choice of India – a country where the abundance of digital
libraries took place only in this millennium – was made because an organization is always
governed by various policies of a country. Those policies – technological, economic, and
political and others – of a country accentuate the organizational environment, that is, context in
this study.

The study borrowed two constructs, namely social actor and technology-in-practice, from the
area of organizational sociology to capture the components of organizational context. The
findings of the study showed that often the use of digital libraries can be related to organizational
factors at various levels. At the same time, some of the contextual factors can outweigh the
technical capabilities of digital libraries and thus can lead to a pattern of its use by the
organizational members. In that process, the study also showed that context of information
practices can be described in terms of specific components.

APPENDIX 1: Questionnaire for the verification study
Study Background
As part of your scientific work, you probably consult journals, books, patents and many other
resources. A substantial amount of such resources are now available electronically and your
institute subscribes to those electronic resources. You may have access to some such electronic
resources through other organizations when you visit those organizations. There are also many
resources/archives available free on the Internet. Keeping in mind your own use or non-use of
such electronic resources, please go through each of the following statements and give your own
views as requested against each statement. It would be really helpful if you can give some
examples from your own experiences wherever requested. To help me understand your
perspective, I’d also appreciate a reason/example from your own experiences whenever you
disagree, partly/wholly with a statement.

Statement-1
With the aim of attracting research funds from industrial firms, scientists realize that earning the
trust, regarding the merit of the research for which fund is required, from such prospective
research collaborators is most important. Naturally industries are interested in a good return on
their investment in the long term and convincing industries about such benefits is a big
challenge. It cannot be accomplished by simply stating the case. Scientists have to prepare a
strong case and back up their arguments about the merit of the case by delving into published
literature and/or proven data/information. If the research is about a process, scientists attempt to
find reports on how industrial firms can benefit from such a process. If it is about a product,
scientists look for data on the demand of such product so that funding industry can be assured
about the market prospect of the product. Scientists must prepare comprehensive information and
have it at hand and present such information aptly and appropriately during the process of
negotiation with industries. Alternately, scientists are also required to prepare a report from such
literature/data /information and give the report to prospective research collaborators.
Electronic resources and the Web together form a very helpful tool in this process of
making strong information based case and subsequently in developing partnership with
various companies/industrial firms who might potentially fund research conducted by you
as a scientist of your organization.

325
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree can you tell us a real story in which you were involved in
preparing such information package and presenting them to industries and how did you
value that work?)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)
Statement-2
An important outcome of a research is a knowledge claim. Previous knowledge serves as the
foundation of such a claim. Hence establishing the link between current research and previous
knowledge is important. It is very important that funding agencies, who would invest in a
research, are able to see this link. When funding agencies see the link, they become assured on
the issue that there is continuity between previous knowledge and the knowledge claim that the
proposed research would be producing. In that way, it helps to earn the confidence of the funding
agency. Citations to previous works establish such links.
Electronic resources are extremely important as those are often consulted by scientists to
search for previous works and to establish links between current/proposed research and
existing knowledge.to such works. These resources are thus powerful tools in gaining
confidence of funding agencies.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us a real story from your experience and then
tell us how it was helpful?)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

Statement-3
Scientists run into their peers quite often – at a project review meeting in which peers come as
reviewers, for example, or in a meeting of experts in which peers come to exchange ideas. Some
peers may have great reputations in their subject areas. Discussions with such peers in meetings
quite often cross the scope of any one specific research problem. Scientists wish to be seen
themselves before others, at least as knowledgeable as those peers are.

326
You as a scientist, before going to such meetings, routinely consult electronic resources to have
some knowledge on current relevant topics so that you can actively participate in such
discussions with peers and other presents in such meeting also find you knowledgeable and at
least at par with them. To this end, electronic resources are very helpful tool.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree can you tell us a real story in which you were involved in
preparing with such current information and how did you value that work?)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)
Statement-4
Scientists communicate their findings through scholarly papers in journals. The selection review
process for those journals can be very rigorous. Editors of such journals command great respect
from scientists/authors. When such editors raise doubts about claims made in a paper, scientists
become very careful. It becomes an extremely challenging task to defend the claims made in
their papers. Scientists consult electronic resources, identify previously done related work, and
develop their argument to support the claims made.
Electronic resources are thus important tools to meet these challenging tasks.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us some incidents in which you faced such
challenges and could overcome the same)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

Statement-5
In order to get fund for a research, scientists must submit research proposals to possible sources
for funding. Producing a research proposal is not merely paper work. It is the process of
initiating a discourse with the research community. In everyday life, when we start a discourse
on an issue, we must have some ground knowledge and opinions about the issue. Similarly, in
order to write a research proposal acceptable to the research community one must have sufficient
ground knowledge in the respective areas.

327
Electronic resources help in developing such ground knowledge. One must not attempt to
submit a research proposal without consulting such resources.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us any experience of yours in this regard and
your own evaluation of the experience)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

Statement-6
Each government funding agency has a format through which application for funding must be
made. According to those formats, it is mandatory to submit a literature review. Scientists
consult electronic resources in order to prepare such literature reviews. However, one need not
work very hard for making those literature review comprehensive because reviewers
generally do not read those reviews very thoroughly.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us any experience of yours in this regard and
your own evaluation of the experience)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

Statement-7
While selecting an electronic resource for consultation, you will always prefer those that are
simple to use. You avoid those resources that are not straightforward and that demand time for
learning how to use them.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us any experience of yours in this regard and
your own evaluation of the experience)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?

328
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)
Statement-8
Using electronic resources is quite different from using a conventional library stuffed with
printed books and journals though many of the electronic resources used to be available only in
print format even just a few years back. Ideally, now there is no need to go to the library as these
electronic resources can be access from the scientist’s desk. This saves both the energy and time
of scientists which can then be directed to more direct searching and use of information. Now
laboratory work and library work can be done simultaneously.
This has become possible because organization has provided adequate facility so that
scientists can connect to the Internet as well as to these resources from their table.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us any experience of yours in this regard and
your own evaluation of the experience)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

Statement-9
Scientists who have already reached senior positions within an organization get involved in jobs
related to research administration. The time demand of such jobs is too high to allow for regular
consultation of electronic resources. At the same time, it is most important for any scientists to
remain up to date. Senior scientists thus delegate the task of consulting electronic resources to
junior assistants.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us any experience of yours in this regard and
your own evaluation of the experience)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

329
Statement-10
Scientists are now aware that peers in their respective fields also have access to electronic
resources and also have information at their fingertips. This awareness makes them very attentive
to being as exhaustive as possible in their search for information using electronic resources.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us any experience of yours in this regard and
your own evaluation of the experience)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

Statement-11
Electronic resources are not the only source for information. Scientists require many types of
information related to their jobs at hand for which they have to consult other types of sources,
even non-electronic resources.
Options:
1. Fully agree (if you fully agree, can you tell us any experience of yours in this regard and
your own evaluation of the experience)
2. Partly agree (if you partly agree, can you please indicate the areas where you disagree. Is
there any other aspect which has been omitted in the above statement?
3. Completely disagree (will you please explain with your own experience)
4. Any other view on this statement (will you please explain with your own experience?)

Question-1:
When you want to search for some information, related to your work as scientist, where do you
start searching for most of the time and why?
Question-2:
Within your organization,
1. Where do you use computers and Internet when you are in your organization?
2. Is there any other arrangement for other scientists?
3. Do you have to share computer with other scientists?

330
4. Do you have to go to library or computer center to access computer and Internet?
5. How helpful the current computer and Internet facilities are within your organization?
Can you compare it with the same facilities within the organization a few years back?
Can you compare the facilities you have seen elsewhere, outside the organization?
Question-3:
By the term “digital library” what do you understand? Can you name a few things, which in your
opinion are digital library?

initially we were much more concerned about publications .. that trend went for a very
long period .. now publications we have to do .. being a scientist we have to do
publications ..
.. now it is more on how our research can be acceptable to the industry .. marketing and
more on like that
we went to different (??) industries and using a presentation .. what is the utility of this
material.. if India you go back five years .. there were five or six companies who were
using this material … now the situation is that 23 companies are making transformers
using this material .. bringing the material from abroad .. slowly there is a demand and the
demand will increase in the days to come … so we are rather educating the industries on
what is the use of the material
Q: how does it put you in advantageous position? A: see if I sit on the opposite side .. I am
the person who will approve the project .. I will always give preference to those who know
the present status, who knows the capability and what I have to do .. most of the time I
favor those things .. and if a person presents saying everything as “my capability” .. I try
to give less point to them .. as a reviewer of that I always feel that he should know what is
currently going on and what is capability also .. if everything he says that “I have done” ..
that means there is something wrong .. I give him less marks than the person who says this
is the status, this is my capability and I want to do these things
Q: so you still keep tab on information and require when you present orally (he concurs)
A: yes this information we are giving when we are giving presentation but when the
proposal is going it is hardly one or two pages
Q: (referring to his stint in abroad ) how much stress is given by large research
foundations like NSF ;A: always but that type of stress is given here if you go for GAP
project .. but if you go for industrial project when it is coming from industry .. you require
some information but not that state of the art type .. for GAP project it is there .. their
format is also telling .. it is binding ..but the format if you see for NSF and our DST… the
information based format is almost the same .. means I am telling about subject
information … even if you say about European Commission’s project .. they are more
structured .. as with information .. but NSF and DST .. more or same
and I think from ORG1’s point of view that was one major networked project –
networking was done not only within <group’s name> but outside <group> with <names
academic institutions> and of course industries and they are involved (insts) besides .
.<name large industries> organizations and . . . . (plants)
They are customers in a sense…they are very selfless customers….apart from the report
they do not take anything….The IPR remains with us…to a large extent.. so what they get
out of it is something you have to ask them…. But we get a lot of things
you develop a state of the art with reference to the technology of your proposal.. for any
proposal you have to provide a literature search < ”have to” indicates that it is
unavoidable” >

Q: there is something called as top of the information .. have you felt any pressure ever to
be on top of the information? And also to show that you are at the top of information; A:
yes sometimes it is required .. we had that project in trial .. before that we had to compete

Q: people do this information search not only to know information but also to know who
are the competitors <he confirms>; A: absolutely .. like we know that <refers to some

or if they publish I have to cite their paper .. so that is a pressure .. but another way it is

: it is not risky – actually as I told you earlier when we submit a proposal to the funding
agency, they distribute it to different reviewers – so it is just a preamble of a thing – why
this particular point came to your mind – why not others – <describes the importance of
the problem>
sometimes we -- these days the impact factor of the journal is very important – so
sometimes if I have to go somewhere and apply for some fellowship or something I have
to mention in which journal I have published in last three years and how the impact of
those journals so looking at impact factor quickly and enter and I find out the impact
factor
not only project stage – suppose I am writing a paper and I am giving a hypothesis . . . my
finding is this and this can be interpreted in that way and when I send it to some journal,
journal also they are getting reviewed by the reviewers and one of the reviewers raised a
point -- no that cannot happen – it is not this but it could be that -- so I have to check
whether he or she is right or I am right – so I have to go thru all the other references
related to this topic what are others are thinking -- the persons who are working in this
area what approach they have taken -- so they have taken this experiment – so they have
got this data – I have done this experiment and so I have got this data – so can it be
linked? so or somewhat – so I consult with – it always happens
sure – actually in my . . . web science . . . there are some literatures some reports and I am
– I just want to take advantage of that and get my knowledge more and . . how can I say –
I want to be more knowledgeable with the help of those thing – whatever I doing on my
own I want to take the benefit of that also and I want to improve my doings and my
science and my experiment – so in that
"Q: how does it help you over the competitors – to show that you are knowledge

yes"
yes because I also – I am also thinking about something – somebody has done it there is
no point of doing then I have to switch
I know a person who has done some experiment for ten years and give this information
and if I did not mention it in my thing it is not giving him or her the due respect … so I
think … I try to always cite that – that person has this so in that way it is I am not
overlooking or overlooking his thing – I am giving due respect to his finding
Q: another related question – about activism in your area – people are not fond of this
research; A; to convince them; Q: so does information – these kind of resource help in
anyway when you prepare to convince them; A: when I say something about promoting
this kind of research – I not only say my achievements – but I also give the supporting
data from other scientists also who are very reputed and not necessarily from India from
abroad – with that supporting evidence I enrich my presentation that way I
but right now.. we have to be very thorough about our information ..so we find out in that
particular area….while submitting a project or starting a project...make sure that there is
no unnecessary overlap

so that have an idea of the quality of research going on in that particular area.. whether I
will get some enough publicity .. who will appreciate my work…and then keep on

A: if you are working in a new line, it is very common to come across such problem .. you
may not get anything .. so you have to read allied topics .. because you have to conclude
something .. interpret something
in the paper .. there are reviewers of the paper .. they may raise questions .. why you have
written so .. then I have to give my explanation again to satisfy them
I do not think here I could get any help [referring to her unique research concept] .. there
is no such document, no such publications, no such reports.. so how can I get any help
from the Internet.. under such circumstances, I never got any help from the Internet
Q: how does it enrich .. after investing so much of your valuable time, what kind of return
do you get; A: if you read more, then you learn more, if you learn more you can give a
better explanation for your work .. and if you write the better explanation.. it shows that
your judgment is correct .. so whatever offer I got from elsewhere also .. offer means
editorial offer reviewing offer .. everyday I get at least 5 papers for review .. mostly I
decline .. that depends on your eligibility .. I am part of it .. I am not fully responsible for
it .. but in a journal I became an associate editor from January 2011 and from January
2011, the impact factor of the journal came to 3.09 which was earlier
that’s true but why we are arguing ... because now a days you cannot suppress any data ..

(Recognition)

if there is any controversial data from another lab .. you cannot suppress that .. if they find
that paper they will ask you why you have not shown that data .. you have not explained
your data .. so Internet does it
in the area that I am working .. there are many researchers, but those who are working in
your area is low .. and another advantage that my group has .. the fundamental problem
(names specific species), I am the pioneer in that field and nobody claimed that .. because
if somebody publishes, she or he has to refer to my work
actually in the beginning you have to do it largely, because you have to know the
background, how you can justify that your work is essential .. to funding agency .. because
why you will be given the money .. whether it is at all necessary .. so you have to do lots
of Internet searching
you have to write a paper or write a report .. monitoring also goes on ..by those who are
funding .. at that time you have to make a report ..and you have to read a lot .. because you
have to justify
they may say no you have not done enough work .. have you seen that work? .. so you
have to interact that time also ..so that time (1:13:15) you have to be conversant with the
current literature

I am not talking of top of the information, I am saying I am not at the top of the
information .. but the information searching was thorough .. but it was not found so we
can now claim that whatever we developed is very unique, innovative
, when you get a paper for reviewing, I myself search the literature .. most of the
reviewers they do not read even.. but it is my habit to read it thoroughly whatever
publications are there .. may be the journal is not very high impact factor .. even though ..
I search a lot .. if there is any information,.. why they are working .. whatever they are
claiming
you cannot say that I am ignorant ..about this work I do not know .. in the Internet era ..
the risk is tremendous suppose I am a reviewer .. you have not seen my work .. and you
have written a passage .. you will do this work .. I will review .. I am a human being .. I
may be very angry .. can’t you read the literature in the Internet days? If you put the
keywords you will get the work .. so risk is tremendous
Q: under which situation you go for those information (impact factor, h-factor) .. how
does that help; A: in promotional applications .. like I am reemployed now .. so I got this
offer only after adjudicating these papers ..reviewing my papers .. when I applied I had to
submit what are my achievements last year

Community

Scientific community of specific
knowledge domain

Example
“the GAP are my perception of the problem .. put
up the proposal, if I can convince the board,
reviewer .. they ask .. in that meeting if I can
convince them .. because there more or less it is the
basic understanding .. that is why DST sponsors a
project .. what innovativeness you can do … it is
not big amount of money … but we can do some
work “ (ORG1-SCT4-09)
“one major networked project – networking was
done not only within <group’s name> but outside
<group> with <names academic institutions> and
of course industries and they are involved (insts)
besides . .<name large industries> organizations
and . . . . (plants) “ (ORG1-SCT3-07)
“…industry wants some sorts of testing … we are
now flooded with testing type of activities ..
particularly our division” (ORG1-SCT2-06)
“particularly for last two years, there is large
deviation in the goal of xxx… we are emphasizing
more on industry research where the industry is
directly funding” (ORG1-SCT7-01)
“.. monitoring also goes on ..by those who are
funding .. at that time you have to make a report
..and you have to read a lot .. because you have to
justify” (ORG2-SCT3-48/49).
“because a journal will accept your work only
when it is novel .. you may do a lot of research
work .. unless something novel comes out, it is not
going to be accepted” (ORG2-SCT2-38)
“.. there are reviewers of the paper .. they may
raise questions .. why you have written so .. then I
have to give my explanation again to satisfy them”
(ORG2-SCT3-14)
“but when you say it to a large audience of very
knowledgeable people .... they are not bothered if
your paper is published or not .. if you cannot
answer...even if your data is published and
accepted all over .. the audience can make a mess
for you” (ORG2-SCT2-39)
“ in the project meeting it was initially thought
that they are with us .. but they were on the other
side of the table .. they are also metallurgist .. at
that time, convincing them, it was required that
you should be on the top of information .. whatever

APPENDIX 5: Codebook – Digital Library Use Meaning

The following table lists the themes on the meaning of digital library use as viewed by the
informants.

339
Theme
Alliance formation

Description
Refers to the value of DL use in the
attempt to develop research
collaboration with industries.

Community acceptance

Refers to DL use’ role of avoiding
duplicate work and thus remain active
within community.
Refers to DL use’ contribution in
identifying scientists working in similar
areas.

Community - connect

Example
“.. we need a partner .. we are going for a particular steel .. so if I give a proposal without
proper knowledge .. they know what is going on across the globe .. will say already someone
has done it or they themselves might have done that .. no point .. why do I fund your
research” (ORG1-SCT5-79)
“it is a major risk <proposing duplicate work> ... you are totally out of business ... only
thing you will have your job and salary .. and you will be totally out of business .. because it
is a government job, I will not loose it ... otherwise that is the end” -(ORG2-SCT2-33)
“Any one refers that paper – higher citation that paper – here is a group in India. . they know
ORG1 is a place where somebody called xxx who are working in this field – through
publication only you are known to the people so that is one . . likewise citation is very
critical. . once a person cites your paper that paper has some meaning – other wise if none is
citing” (ORG1-SCT3-23)
“you cannot describe how important it is … without that <information> you cannot do – you
have to be up-to-date – one cannot stand in the market – that is – information is very critical
nowadays” (ORG1-SCT3-16)
“you develop a state of the art with reference to the technology of your proposal.. for any
proposal you have to provide a literature search < ”have to” indicates that it is unavoidable”
>” (ORG1-SCT4-34)
“list of references .. I want to hypothesize some new formula or some new findings … so I
have to give some support .. my thinking is not absurd … … supporting evidence –
reference is our supporting evidence” (ORG2-SCT1-26 & 27)
“the risk < of not being able to present information> will be loss of face….as a
representative of this laboratory, I am not aware of this … it will cause loss of face” (ORG1SCT4-57)

Community Competition

DL use helps to be up to date and being
competitive within community.

Compliance

Refers to DL use’ role in meeting
compliances.

Confidence building

DL use helps getting evidences
resulting into confidence building.

Identity - collective

Up to date knowledge of scientists
raises the prestige of organization.

Identity - credibility

DL use provides information that can
be manipulated to show the novelty of
a research.

“ you do not want to duplicate what already has been done.. …... how you are adding… you
have to show novelty in your research… that novelty has to be vis-à-vis other researchers’
works .. <novelty is shown by backing up through literature>” (ORG1-SCT4-75 & 76)

Identity - ego

Up to date information awareness help
to acknowledge other’s work – such
acknowledgement appeases the ego of
senior researchers.

Identity knowledgeable self

Up to date information helps to
establish one as knowledgeable as
others present in an interaction.

“you cannot say that I am ignorant ..about this work I do not know .. in the Internet era .. the
risk is tremendous suppose I am a reviewer .. you have not seen my work .. and you have
written a passage .. you will do this work .. I will review .. I am a human being .. I may be
very angry .. can’t you read the literature in the Internet days? If you put the keywords you
will get the work .. so risk is tremendous” (ORG2-SCT3-70)
“these are the people who are in the state of the art…for example we have a project from X
development fund and the monitoring committee is composed of many people who are
<stressed> in the XX industry….top brasses in the XX industry.. some are academicians..
they are aware <academicians and top brasses of industry> of the state of the art… so I have
to be in touch with the state of the art < way to match the knowledge of others>. And I have

to respond to their question.<forced to do this>.” (ORG1-SCT4-55)
“in promotional applications .. like I am reemployed now .. so I got this offer only after
adjudicating these papers ..reviewing my papers .. when I applied I had to submit what are
my achievements last year” (ORG2-SCT3-82)

Load shifting

DLs help in providing data that are
required by others.

Performance
evaluation

DLs are used to establish performance.

Recognition

DLs are a media through which other’s
contributions can be recognized.

Scientific inquiry challenge

DL is used to establish the claim made
and thus meet the challenge of research

Scientific inquiry continuity

DL provides the information base that
can be used to establish that the current
research has a continuity from the past.

“for the sponsors they know that <through the tech report> what I am doing is incremental…
additional to what is available..,. in the market or in the literature …that gives the
accountability … they can judge with regards to that < he provides a yardstick, through lit
search, to the sponsors for judgment>” (ORG1-SCT4-40)

Scientific inquiry merit

DL is used to provide background and
establish merit of a proposal.

“actually in the beginning you have to do it largely <literature search> because you have to
know the background, how you can justify that your work is essential .. to funding agency ..
because why you will be given the money .. whether it is at all necessary .. so you have to do
lots of Internet searching “ (ORG2-SCT3-46)

Scientific inquiry new knowledge

DL provides the information base that
is used to create new meta knowledge.

Scientific inquiry successful
participation

DL use helps framing projects
successfully

“– I have been invited to write the reviews. . I have written four scientific reviews. . and I
took lot of knowledge. . for review in a particular research field you have to know what
others have done. . so that information has gone directly to the. . now it is published and
rated as one of the highest downloaded “ (ORG1-SCT6-13)
“they submitted their projects .. they have not gone thoroughly through the literature .. so
they could not frame the proposal properly” (ORG2-SCT3-69)

“sometimes we -- these days the impact factor of the journal is very important – so
sometimes if I have to go somewhere and apply for some fellowship or something I have to
mention in which journal I have published in last three years and how the impact of those
journals so looking at impact factor quickly and enter and I find out the impact factor”
(ORG2-SCT1-14)
“my publications are archived in electronic resources… look at my publications… read
them…know about the areas that I am researching…it is both ways… I know about other
people and they also know about me…. So recognition wise it is very important” (ORG1SCT4-80)
“suppose I am writing a paper and I am giving a hypothesis . . . one of the reviewers raised
a point -- no that cannot happen … so I have to check whether he or she is right or I am right
– so I have to go thru all the other references related to this topic what are others are thinking
-- so they have got this data – I have done this experiment and so I have got this data – so
can it be linked? so or somewhat – so I consult with – it always happens” (ORG2-SCT1-15)

341

APPENDIX 6: Codebook –factors contributing to DL use/nonuse
Factors contributing/inhibiting the use of digital libraries could be viewed across four
dimensions, namely environmental, technological, organizational and personal. Themes as
emerged are listed under each dimension.

resource

Interfacing
ICT tools

with DLs

Learning load

Technological
complications that
demands learning efforts

Organizational
policy

Organizational policy
leading to the use of
certain type of resource

Example
“no earlier ..there were some CDs but only
abstracts” (ORG1-SCT5-66)
“if you write a paper reviewers are reviewing for
sciencedirect .. they give free 60 days access, ..put
some keywords and then you can check whether
the author has cited all these papers .. so
immediately my publication will be checked .. if I
do not cite .. they will say oh you cited some old
journals” (ORG1-SCT4-70)
“so it will be tremendous work .. but we do not
have a supporting data from which we can derive
something .. nothing is available .. in that case you
do not get any help” (ORG2-SCT3-20)
“previously we had to spend more time in library. .
from home only we used to think that in the first
half we will work and in the second half we will
work in the library. . now because of the facility of
Internet . . we do not have to bother. . we can do
simultaneously . . we can put some work and then
do lit search” (ORG1-SCT6-15)
“one is that these days you get what is called
citation libraries .. previously we had to type out
the references .. in a format .. now with reference
manager, as soon as you click on that particular
reference and give journal name .. it immediately
puts it in the right format .. that is a major
advantage” (ORG2-SCT2-37)
“I am not sure but if it is very user friendly, of
course I will go for it .. but if it is too complicated
system, I do not know if at this age whether my
energy will allow that” (ORG2-SCT3-60)
“no.. I am going for a project .. … now BDM
division has to do that .. whether it is at all
available in the world or not … if it is available in
the world who are the companies .. there are many
companies in <mentions areas> … so they do that

compared to print age

Example
research … for the last two years we are doing
that research .. and if it is coming up then they are
saying .. how I am differing” (ORG1-SCT4-41)
“accessibility was a problem .<explains the
problem> .. like we had 3-4 scientists sitting in that
room and there were only two computers … we
had to share .. it was slow also .. now I think
everybody has computer .. wifi is there” (ORG1SCT4-69)
“not really <keeping tab on information
regularly>.. regular practice would have been the
best.. but it does not happen.. I have certain other
commitments..<does not keep tab regularly
himself>” (ORG1-SCT3-51
“for example this patent search, it is beyond my …
they have the software and they know the tricks ..
so there my job is to give only the keywords .. and
it is refined .. again give some keyword … if I am
not happy I give another set of keywords .. I say
please do this way” (ORG1-SCT4-49)
“what I practice. . whatever area I am working on,
I keep searching on regular basis. . twice or thrice
a week. . may be sometime daily also.” (ORG1SCT5-27)
“the sources that our laboratory subscribes, I use
those… those are always available on our library
website… I use all of them…. ScienceDirect
happens to be the one which has largest
collection..” (ORG1-SCT3-65)
“. there are some literatures some reports – I just
want to take advantage of that and get my
knowledge more and . . whatever I doing on my
own I want to take the benefit of that also and I
want to improve my doings and my science and
my experiment” (ORG2-SCT1-17)
“compared to now means there were Biological
Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts .. and since I was in
Calcutta University, ... I used to visit this library
very often and there was a floor .. you have to
climb stairs .. there is advantage and disadvantage
.. tremendous time taken .. very laborious work ..
every week you can get one Biological abstract and
one Chemical Abstract and our Professor used to
say that you have to go back at least 10 years .. so
from that dust you have to search all these journals
.. it was a herculean task .. .. so now it is a
pleasure” (ORG2-SCT3-66)
