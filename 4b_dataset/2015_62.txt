ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Help Seeking in Action: Managing Interaction and
Mental Health on a Crisis Help Line
By STEPHEN MICHAEL DIDOMENICO
Dissertation Director:
Dr. Galina Bolden

The primary purpose of this study is to better understand the communication
processes of telephone help lines dedicated to crisis intervention and suicide
prevention. Whereas prior research primarily considers these issues in terms of
psychological predispositions and call outcomes, this study shows how many of
the core considerations of crisis and suicide prevention are interactionally
negotiated and managed. Callers and call takers are shown to utilize a range of
interactional practices and actions in order to jointly construct and negotiate
institutionally-relevant identities, stages of the call (e.g., opening, problem
presentation, questioning), and larger institutional missions.

The study uses the methodology of Conversation Analysis to examine audiorecorded naturally-occurring calls made to a mid-size crisis call center, HelpNow
(pseudonym), located in the northeastern United States. Several findings
emerged from the study. First, in call openings, a set of institutionally-significant

ii

identity categories (first-time caller, repeat caller, and regular caller) were
revealed to be established and managed through particular interactional
practices. Second, a range of sequential environments and interactional
practices through which callers present their focal problem on the crisis help line
were documented. Third, call takers’ uptake of callers’ problem presentations via
rising-intoned repetitions were analyzed and shown to fall short of their
institutional job to pursue elaboration. Overall, the dissertation contributes to
scholarship related to crisis intervention and suicide prevention, communication
studies, and language and social interaction.

Chapter 1: Introduction
In recent years, mental health and mental illness have received greater
attention as important components of overall health and well being. Today
mental-health problems represent one of the leading causes of disability and illhealth globally (World Health Organization, 2001). In 2014, the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released data suggesting
that 42.5 million American adults (or approximately 1 out of every 4) are living
with mental illness (SAMHSA, 2014). Meanwhile, 9.3 million (roughly 5% of
American adults) experience symptoms that are severe enough to interfere with
school, work, or other aspects of daily life. Even the “vicissitudes of social life” (p.
Horwitz, 2002, p. 157) may naturally lead to mental-health consequences such
as distress, anxiety, and depression.1 Recent years have also featured increased
media attention to a “suicide epidemic” (Dokoupil, 2013; cf. Goldsmith, Pellmar,
Kleinman, & Bunney, 2002) and statistics that suggest suicide rates among
middle-aged adults have increased substantially (Baker, Hu, Wilcox, & Baker,
2013).
A body of empirical research suggests that many of the people who are in
need of mental-health treatment may never even obtain help (e.g., Mojtaba et al.,

1

The current dissertation does not engage with the larger theoretical and clinical issue of
what distinguishes mental-health symptoms or problems from mental illness
(“disorders”). However, Horwitz (2002) offers helpful insights into this issue that will
suffice for now: “…[H]eavy drinking, drug use, and criminal behavior that are not
products of internal dysfunctions are symptomatically no different from mental disorders
of alcohol abuse, drug dependence, or antisocial personality disorder. Symptoms alone
can never distinguish ‘normal’ unhappiness, anxiety, and deviance from mental
disorders. Only symptoms that reflect a disorder ‘in the person’ and not those that are
expectable responses to social environments are mental disorders” (p. 157)

2
2011; Olson et al. 2009; Wang et al., 2007). There are a variety of reasons that
these patterns occur: the lack of availability of treatment resources (World Health
Organization, 2001), a low perceived need for treatment (Andrade, Alonso,
Mneimneh, Wells, Al-Hamzawi, Borges, & Kessler, 2014; Mojtabai, Olfson,
Sampson, Jin, Druss, Wang, Wells, Pincus, Kessler, 2011), and the stigma of
dealing with mental illness (Schomerus & Angermeyer, 2008), just to name
several. Given this reality, it has become critical to examine what alternative
sources of help (if any) these individuals may turn to (i.e., resources that do not
involve a mental health professional). Furthermore, the role of communication
must be considered in terms of how these types of resources are sought.
In recent decades mental-health researchers have begun conducting
research on mental health “help seeking”, or the “process of translating the very
personal domain of psychological distress to the interpersonal domain of seeking
help” (Rickwood, Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005, p. 1). This notion has raised
a number of key questions about populations who are in need of mental-health
resources: What kinds of help do these individuals pursue for their mental-health
issues and from whom? How do these individuals go about pursuing and
communicating their need for help? (e.g., O'Connor, Martin, Weeks, & Ong,
2014; Yap, Reavley, & Jorm, 2013).
One way to gain new insight into how people seek help for mental-health
problems is to investigate the specific institutional resources that these
individuals may turn to for mental-health information or care. Telephone help
lines are one such locus of service and can simply be defined as “telephone-

3
based services that offer callers help, advice or support in a wide range of areas”
(Firth, Emmison, & Baker, 2005, p.1). Different types of help lines, often broadly
referred to under the umbrella category “crisis lines”, have existed for the
purpose of assisting individuals who may be in a state of crisis, in danger of
harming themselves (e.g., suicide, self-injury), or simply feel lonely and need
someone to talk to. Many of these help lines are often embedded within a
broader movement (or “institution”) commonly referred to as Crisis Intervention
and Suicide Prevention (Gould, Harrismunfakh, Kleinman, & Lake, 2012; Lester,
2001; Lester & Rogers, 2012) that serves to assist individuals who are in a state
of crisis and possibly in danger of harming themselves or others.
Past research regarding crisis and suicide-related help lines has typically
focused on the outcomes of institutional and communicative processes (e.g.,
Coveney, Pollock, Armstrong, Moore, 2012; Gould, Kalafat, & Harrismunfakh,
2007). However, little scholarship exists on how these services are actually
experienced in the ebb-and-flow of social interaction. With this in mind, the
current study adopts a communication-centered perspective towards mental
health issues by examining particular interactional practices that are used by
callers and call takers during actual, naturally-occurring calls. This emphasis on
the communicative dynamics of crisis help lines represents the central focus of
the dissertation as well as the growing trend of interaction-centered research
regarding mental-health services (e.g., Angell & Bolden, 2015; Mikesell, Bromley,
Young, Vona, & Zima, in press; cf. Hassan, McCabe, & Priebe, 2007).

4
In this study, I examine the interactional practices of callers and call takers
in a collection of 115 previously-collected audio recordings of calls that were
made to a crisis call center. By adopting conversation analysis as my primary
method, I analyze the specific communicative details of these interactions to
understand how the participants jointly accomplish social actions, manage
identities and deal with larger institutional missions. Detailed examination of
these materials led to the discovery of a range of practices through which
participants manage the different components of the call, how they establish and
manage institutionally-relevant identities and relationships, as well as how
specific institutional techniques that work well in theory actually prove ineffective
in practice.
Whereas existent research primarily considers these issues in terms of
psychological predispositions and call outcomes, I utilize a communicative and
empirically-grounded perspective to show how many of the core considerations
of crisis and suicide prevention are interactionally negotiated and managed.
Thus, the findings presented in this dissertation contribute to several areas of
scholarly knowledge. This includes the body of literature in Crisis Intervention
and Suicide Prevention, Language and Social Interaction, and the broader
discipline of Communication Studies.

Preview of chapters
Both Chapters 2 and 3 detail a theoretical and methodological foundation
to frame the central objectives of the current study. In Chapter 2, I present a

5
review of prior literature that ties in with the current study’s focus on the
interactional dynamics of crisis help lines. Broadly speaking, this includes
literature related to crisis intervention and suicide prevention, mental-health
services, and social interaction in institutional settings. In reviewing these
literatures, I further develop the rationale behind the communication-centered
perspective adopted in the current study. Furthermore, I establish how the
current study contributes to each of these areas of scholarly knowledge. In
Chapter 3, I provide an overview of the data and methods of the dissertation.
This includes discussion of ethnographic background regarding the crisis help
line (HelpNow, a pseudonym), core epistemological principles of conversation
analysis, and the methodological procedures I followed in conducting the study.
In the first analytic chapter, Chapter 4, I analyze a set of institutionallysignificant identity categories as they are constructed in the calls. These identity
categories include first-time callers, who present themselves as calling for the
first time; regular callers, who present themselves as calling on a regular basis;
and repeat callers, who have called the crisis line in the past yet may not present
themselves as “regulars”. As I show, each identity category is jointly negotiated
through particular interactional practices and may also contribute to the
inferential work call takers must perform with regard to what type of call is being
begun.
In the second analytic chapter, Chapter 5, I analyze the communicative
processes through which callers present their focal crisis or problem. To do so, I
examine multiple possible sequential environments and a set of interactional

6
practices (single unit vs. multi-unit formats) through which callers and call takers
accomplish this important stage of the call. Additionally, I discuss how these
environments are a further site for accomplishing identity work. As I show, callers
may frame their issue(s) in ways that either presume institutional memory on part
of their call taker or display an orientation to including greater background in
order to facilitate their understanding.
In the third analytic chapter, Chapter 6, I explore the use of repetition as
an institutionally-backed interactional practice used by call takers in responding
to callers’ problem presentations. Although in theory this technique is intended to
demonstrate call takers’ “active listening” and encourage the caller to continue,
close analysis reveals little support for its success in practice. As I show, callers’
responses to repetition-based turns regularly follow a gap, designed to do
minimal elaboration, and thus resist the call taker’s course of action of soliciting
elaboration. In Chapter 7, I conclude the dissertation by presenting a summary of
the findings of the study, address its limitations, and pose directions for future
research.

Chapter 2: Review of Previous Literature
Over the past five decades, telephone help lines have become a staple of
modern society (Firth, Emmison & Baker, 2005; Gould, Kalafat, & Harrismunfakh,
2007; Lester, 1977). The number of existing help lines in the world has seen
dramatic growth over the last several decades (Fleischmann, Bertolote,
Wasserman, De Leo, Bolhari, Botega, & Thanhk, 2008; Miller, Coombs, Leeper,
& Barton, 1984).1 For instance, in the UK, there are currently over 1,700 different
help lines in existence, while in the United States over five million help-line
positions have been created since 19902 (Firth, Emmison, & Baker, 2005). !
Today, help lines span a variety of industries and areas of concern (Firth,
Emmison, & Baker, 2005). Researchers have examined help lines that are
dedicated to the specific needs of children (King, Nurcombe, Bickman, Hides, &
Reid, 2003) and parents (Brody, Smith, & Simon, 2004). Other help lines in
existence are dedicated to specific health concerns such as gambling (Potenza,
Steinberg, McLaughlin, Wu, Rounsville, & O’Malley, 2001), smoking cessation
(Prout, Martinez, Ballas, Geller, Lash, Brooks, & Heeren, 2002), and crisis
intervention and suicide prevention (Lester 1977; Lester & Rogers, 2012). It is
this latter type of help line that lies at the heart of the current study.
The goal of this chapter is to review prior research related the interactional
dynamics of crisis help lines. While a growing body of literature has explored the
outcomes, effectiveness, and training methods of crisis help lines dedicated to

Firth, Emmison, and Baker (2005) attribute the rapid proliferation of help lines across
these different areas to their relatively low cost, accessibility, and people’s preference for
speaking with an “anonymous expert”.

8
crisis and suicide (see Lester & Rogers, 2012), less is known about the specific
communication processes that underlie these services. Each of the areas of
literature reviewed in this chapter – including research on crisis intervention and
suicide prevention, mental-health services, and social interaction in institutional
settings – further frame the current study’s focus and lay out how it aims to
contribute to scholarly knowledge in each area.
The structure of the current chapter is as follows. First, I provide an
overview of two mental health issues that motivate the primary mission of crisis
help lnes: crisis and suicide. Second, I describe the complex and intersecting
histories of crisis intervention, suicide prevention, and a number of key changes
that occurred in the U.S. during the 1960s. Third, I explain broader therapeutic
influences on how crisis lines are operated including models of crisis intervention;
and parallels with psychotherapeutic practice. Fourth, I present a brief overview
of trends in the outcomes-centered research on crisis and suicide lines, describe
the core assumptions of the communication-centered approach proposed for the
current project, and review past research that has adopted this perspective in the
context of help lines. Finally, I give a brief overview of the definitive features of
talk-in interaction as well as talk-in institutions more specifically.

Defining crisis and suicide
I begin by reviewing general definitions and distinctions regarding crisis
and suicide. While the focus of this dissertation will not be on suicide per se, the
topic serves as an essential conceptual backdrop for understanding the broader

9
origin and evolution of crisis lines as they exist today. Taken together, the notions
of crisis and suicide form the core of the institutional mission of the help line to be
investigated in the current study.

Conceptualizing crisis
The current study’s primary focus on crisis help lines makes relevant the
following question: How is “crisis” defined in this particular context? In the
mental-health professions, the term crisis can be a difficult concept to define as it
has often been used to label a wide spectrum of mental-health situations in prior
literature (Callahan, 2009). For instance, the term has been used to be
synonymous with the word ‘emergency’, typically when features such as an
individual’s need for psychiatric admission or possible harm to self or others are
made salient (e.g., Johnson, Nolan, Hoult, White, Bebbington, Sandor,
McKenzie, Patel, & Pilling, 2005). Others have used the term as a broader label
for chronic mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety disorders
(e.g., Castro-Blanco, 2005).
While a review of crisis-related research suggests a broader disagreement
about the boundaries of “what constitutes a behavioral emergency and a what
constitutes a mental health crisis” (Callahan, 2009, p. 14), a consensus has
emerged surrounding the definitions used in the earliest scholarship on crisis
intervention (i.e., the larger approach that grounds this dissertation, which I will
return to later in this chapter) from the 1960s and 1970s. Most simply, Caplan’s
(1961) classic definition describes crisis as “an upset in the steady state of the

10
individual” (p. 18). More elaborate versions of this classic definition have since
been proposed such as Slaikeu’s (1990) definition of the term:
“a temporary state of upset and disorganization, characterized chiefly by an
inability to cope with a particular situation using customary methods of
problem solving, and by the potential for positive or negative outcome” (p.
15).
A more recent definition by Kanel (2003) proposes a tripartite orientation:
“The three parts of a crisis are these: (1) a precipitating event; (2) a
perception of the event that causes distress, and (3) the failure of a
person’s usual coping methods” (p. 2)
As Kanel explains, each of these three components is what the crisis worker or
call taker should work to identify and assist the client to overcome during their
encounter. Each of these definitions exhibits important similarities, such as an
emphasis on feelings of distress and disorganization and the individual’s inability
to cope with these feelings. Crises may be precipitated by a wide range of life
events such as losing a job, the death of a family member, or a range of
traumatic events stemming from rape, domestic violence, or natural disasters,
among many other examples3 (Callahan, 2009). With any of these events, it is
important to point out that each of the aforementioned definitions stresses that
crisis is not the precipitating event itself but an individual’s perception and/or
physiological reaction to the event (Kanel, 2003).
With regard to help lines, an emphasis on crisis intervention reflects an
institutional approach to supporting a spectrum of emotional and mental health

3

Callahan (2009, p. 20) is critical of the focus of recent crisis intervention literature on
traumatic stress, mass violence, and natural disasters: “Although this development is
understandable given the events of the past decade, the field of crisis intervention must
not ignore the impact of normative stress on people’s lives” (p. 20)

11
issues as opposed to only assisting individuals who are assessed as “high risk”
(e.g., exhibiting intent or behavior related to self-harm). Thus, when a help line is
deemed a “crisis line”, the term ‘crisis’ serves as an umbrella term for a variety of
emotional and behavioral issues (including but not limited to psychiatric
emergencies). This range of issues may also include individuals living with
serious mental illness and/or other chronic health issues. The broader focus of
crisis lines represents a large part of the preventative work that is reflected in the
crisis intervention and suicide prevention movement. In short, it is to provide
telephone-based intervention and support to individuals struggling with mentalhealth symptoms with the hope of preventing further episodes (and in some
cases, to prevent psychiatric hospitalization).
In sum, it is this broader orientation towards intervention and prevention
that characterizes crisis help lines today. In the next section, I define the notion of
suicide. While the analysis portion of this study will not deal directly with any
cases of suicidal intent or behavior, it represents a set of possible caller
circumstances that crisis line call takers must always be prepared for and
continuously attentive to during actual calls.

Conceptualizing suicide
The notion of suicide is important for understanding the full range of
mental-health behaviors that may be dealt with at crisis help lines. In this context,
call takers are trained to treat suicide as one of their chief concerns when
listening to and helping a caller with their crisis or problem. Although there is little

12
agreement on many aspects of suicide terminology and systems of classification,
below I draw upon a leading nomenclature for suicide-related terminology
(O’Connel et al, 1996) to define several labels that are often used for suiciderelated phenomena.4
To begin, suicidal ideation refers to thoughts related to ending one’s life,
ranging from casual thoughts to more serious and persistent thoughts. In
contrast, suicidal behavior is used to classify a broad range of behaviors related
to self-harm. These include suicide threat, where the individual’s behavior
suggests some kind of threat to harm themselves (ranging from passive to more
active behaviors) and suicide acts, which refer to behaviors related to attempting
to end one’s life. Finally, suicidality may be used as a more global term to
describe a person’s likelihood of attempting suicide (cf. Marusic, 2004). Many of
these basic terms and definitions must be learned by new call takers to prepare
them for their role at the crisis line (see Chapter 3 for a further discussion of
training related to the specific crisis line investigated for the purposes of the
current study).
A vast body of prior literature exists regarding many of the aforementioned
(and other) suicide-related phenomena. Much of this research has been
proposed to fit within two main theoretical traditions: The psychiatric tradition and

4

A number of scholars have criticized the lack of agreement about core terminology
within suicidology (Rogers & Lester, 2010; O’ Carroll, Berman, Maris, Moscicki, Tanney,
& Silverman, 1996). They argue that this issue (which includes the very definition of
suicide) has slowed advances of research on suicide assessment and prevention. For a
more comprehensive discussion of the points of contention regarding suicidal
terminology and theoretical frameworks, see Joiner (2005, p. 25 – 25) or Rodger &
Lester (2010, p. 7 – 26).

13
the sociological tradition (Mokros, 1995; cf. Joiner, 2005; Rogers & Lester, 2010).
The psychiatric tradition of suicide research views suicide as being based on acts
of individuals and thus best explained via individual-level factors.5 In contrast, the
sociological tradition limits appeals to individual psychology and instead focuses
on the ways in which suicide is a phenomenon that is both socially constructed
and conditioned. This tradition is grounded in the seminal work of Durkheim
(1897/1951) who examined suicide from a comparative perspective by
comparing suicide rates within as well as across group boundaries.
Although each of these traditions has developed sound approaches to
theorizing about suicidality, it is difficult to locate scholarship that understands
suicide as situated in the dynamics of mundane interaction. Mokros (1995) has
proposed that one of the main obstacles to understanding suicide is scholars’
inability to synthesize the psychological and socicological levels of interaction in
order to “register an ‘experience near’ sensitivity to the voices and actions of
people in interaction” (p. 1092). What is needed, Mokros argues, is research that
documents “the ‘look’ and ‘place’ of the individual – in social bonds – exercising
individuality” (p. 1093) while under the demands of what Goffman (1983) called
the interaction order. Such a perspective emphasizes seeing how the individual
and social dimensions of suicidality get worked out and negotiated in the turn-byturn, normative dynamics of social interaction.

5

Examples of such trends include changes in suicide rates among adolescents over
time (Clark & Mokros, 1993; Gould, Greenberg, Velting, Shaffer, 2003) and trends within
LGBTQ populations more specifically (Mustanski, Garofalo, & Emerson, 2010; cf. SavinWilliams, 2001).

14
Mokros’ work is in line with other scholarship (e.g., Antaki & Widdicombe,
1998; Mokros, 2003; Schegloff, 1986) that suggests that even taken-for-granted
social phenomena (e.g., social action, identity) can be viewed as practical
achievements that interactants accomplish in and through their own
communicative conduct. To elaborate further on Mokros’ focus on suicide,
investigating suicide-related phenomena then becomes an issue of how to best
examine interactants in interaction as they themselves collaboratively achieve an
understanding of suicide (i.e., intent, behavior, suicidality) within their immediate
interactional event. Since the notions of suicide and crisis are closely linked
concepts within the domain of crisis help lines, it is also useful to extend this
argument to the notion of crisis as well. Hence, it is possible (and productive) to
conceive of crisis and suicidality as practical, situated accomplishments made
manifest in and through the contingencies of social interaction.
In summary, most of the prior research on suicide has been grounded in
psychological and sociological approaches to suicide-related phenomena.
However, little extant research that focuses on understanding suicide as it is
relevant to the dynamics of ordinary interaction. Taken together with the notion of
crisis, this pair of issues represents further areas of scholarship to which
communication-centered research can make unique contributions. In the next
section, I discuss the historical origins of each of these concepts including how
crisis intervention was first developed for face-to-face settings, the earliest
suicide-prevention lines, and a number of key political and social changes with
regard to mental-health care policies, professions, and practice.

15

Historical origins: Crisis intervention, suicide prevention, and mental
health reform
Different trajectories of historical events led to the parallel development of
the first crisis-centered services and suicide-centered services. However, the
historical lineage of each type of these services, part of the broader suicide
prevention and crisis-intervention movements, eventually intersect as
revolutionary changes occurred in the domain of mental-health care. Building on
the prior discussion of the concepts of crisis and suicide, I use this section to
review the historical origins of each of these concepts to further frame our
understanding of the institutional landscape of crisis help lines today as well as
the focus of the current study.

The Emergence of suicide prevention & crisis intervention
By most accounts, the suicide-prevention movement is understood as
having begun in the 1950s with the founding of the world’s first suicide lines.6 In
1953, Samaritans, Inc. was the first suicide line in the United Kingdom and led to
the proliferation of similar lines as part of the “Samaritan movement” (DassBrailsford, 2007; Pollock, Moore, Coveney, & Armstrong, 2013; Farberow &
Shneidman, 1961). In the United States, it was the Los Angeles Suicide

6

Other historical sources describe this movement as starting even earlier. For instance,
James and Gilliland (2013) point to the 1906 founding of the National Safe-a-Life League
in New York by the Baptist minister, Henry Warren. Others may identify the start of the
movement as being the founding of a suicide prevention center in Vienna, Austria by
Norman Fareberow and Erwin Ringel in 1955 (see Farberow, & Simon, 1969).

16
Prevention Center that was founded by Norman Farberow and Edwin Shneidman
in 1958 using funding from a National Institute of Mental Health grant (Kalafat,
2012; Lester, 1977).7 Ellis (2001) acknowledges the founding of the center as
“the beginning of the Modern Era of understanding and treating individuals at risk
of suicide” (p. 132). Over the next ten years, the number of suicide prevention
centers in the US soared to over 100 by 1968 (McGee, 1971).
In contrast to the beginning of suicide prevention and suicide help lines,
the crisis intervention movement initially began with the development of
techniques and frameworks for brief face-to-face counseling. Most scholars cite
the start of crisis intervention as taking place in the wake of the Coconut Grove
Fire in Boston in 1942 (Gilliland & James, 2013; Karnel, 2013). Over 500 people
were killed overnight in the disaster. Two psychiatrists from Harvard University,
Gerald Caplan and Eric Lindemann, worked to establish a specialized site where
the survivors of the incident (as well as their loved ones) could be treated. Since
only long-term therapeutic approaches were practiced in psychiatry at the time
(i.e., brief therapy or trauma models had not yet been developed), they worked
alongside individuals who were not trained as mental health professionals
(including teachers, clergy, and housewives).
Following a brief training, these volunteers worked to help the survivors.
Afterwards, Caplan and Lindemann studied the survivors’ functioning and coping
behaviors. From these findings, the psychiatrists created “preventative
psychiatry” as a set of resources for working with victims of trauma in order to

Wallace (2001).

17
prevent future psychiatric symptoms. These findings and experiences later
informed Caplan and Lindemann’s early theories and models that eventually
evolved into what is now known as crisis intervention (Caplan, 1961; Lindemann,
1944; 1956). I discuss how these types of models are typically applied in crisis
line calls later on in this chapter.
Eventually, help lines were established that adopted a broader focus that
was grounded in these principles of crisis intervention (as opposed to a strict
emphasis on suicidal callers). In some cases, such crisis-oriented help lines were
an institutional response to the changing mental-health needs of different
communities. Lester (1977) describes a period after suicide lines had been
established where the need for services addressing a wider array of mental
health needs had surfaced:
“Many suicide prevention centers soon found they were being asked to help in
all kinds of crises, so some centers changed their orientations toward more
general crisis intervention.” (1977, p. 455)
As this quote indicates, some crisis lines came about in reaction to changes in
caller trends at suicide lines. Baizerman (1975) provides further support for this
idea in explaining how services that are designed with a particular set of crises in
mind may end up changing with the community’s evolving needs. In the case of a
teen crisis line, for instance, he describes how the concerns that callers had once
called with (e.g., drug highs, running away, or military draft counseling) had
changed drastically over the course of a decade to new concerns such as drug
use, romantic relationship issues, and family conflict.

18
Thus, over time a more diverse array of crisis-related help lines became
available. These included crisis lines with more generic purposes, such as crisis
intervention generally, and more specialized purposes (Lester, 2012c). For
instance, specialized lines now exist for individuals dealing with domestic abuse,
substance abuse, and LGBTQ issues, among many others (see Lester 2012c or
the introduction to this chapter for further examples of help lines in existence
today).
As these more general, crisis-oriented lines became more common, some
suicide prevention organizations also began changing the way they advertised
their organizations and services to the public. Berman (1998) notes that “Suicide
Prevention Center” has become much more rare in the names of new and
existing call centers (cf. Lester, 2012c). While this type of language used to be
more crucial for the purposes of fund raising and stimulating community support,
other methods for achieving these goals have become available making such
language less essential.8 Further, Berman describes an increasing fear among
centers that using the word ‘suicide’ may discourage non-suicidal callers from
using the service.
To summarize, suicide and crisis-related services got their start
independently from one another. For suicide prevention, the formative event was
the establishment of the first suicide prevention lines in the U.S. and U.K., while

8

Lester (2015, personal communication) notes that, in his experience as a crisis line
administrator in the 1970s, the words “suicide prevention” were primarily used to
galvanize funding to “keep the lights on”, while the words “crisis prevention” refer to what
was widely understood as being “what we really do” with the callers who dialed the help
lines.

19
for crisis intervention it started with the development of a brief intervention
technique by psychiatrists Caplan and Lindemann. While different historical
events led to the start of the first crisis help lines and suicide help lines, the
development of both movements – crisis intervention and suicide prevention –
was also facilitated by key social and political changes occurring in the U.S.
during the 1960s. I describe each of these key political and social changes in the
next section.

Evolving needs for mental health services
The historical beginnings of these two movements (suicide prevention and
crisis intervention) also coincided with a period of immense change in
understandings of mental health and mental-health services. In the U.S. during
the 1960s, several critical social and political changes occurred that enhanced
the conditions through which crisis lines could be established. More generally,
the changes restructured institutional resources and disciplinary perspectives in
order to emphasize prevention as being as equally important as treatment.
Wallace (2001) describes several key political and social developments
that led to these changes. One important political development was the passage
of the Community Mental Health Centers Act in 1963 by Congress and President
John F. Kennedy.9 This piece of legislation provided federal funding for the

9

There were two important precursors to this event. First was the release of the 1961
report of the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health (Kanel, 2012). This report
included recommendations such as mental health treatment changing its focus to strive
to enable patients to live independently in their community and avoid hospitalization.
Further, it commended that the federal government take responsibility for funding the

20
establishment of community mental health centers and “completely changed the
way mental health care was delivered in the United States” (James & Gilliland,
2013, p. 3). These centers were in turn required (among many other
requirements in the legislation) to offer 24-hour emergency and outpatient
services (Perry, 1976). This particular requirement is believed to have been a
critical step towards developing what eventually became the first suicide help
lines in the United States (Wallace, 2001).
A second political change of this period was the Lanterman Petris Short
Act of 1968 that created further restrictions for how community mental health
care was delivered (Kanel, 2012). In particular, it sought to establish guidelines
for short-term intervention or therapy for those without chronic mental illness. A
third key political (and economic change) of this period was the Veterans
Administration allocating funding for new mental health facilities to be built for the
purpose of providing treatment and training of mental-health professionals. Each
of these resources was primarily directed at caring for war veterans who were
dealing with psychiatric issues (James & Gilliland, 2013; Wallace, 2001). This
focus called for a type of training that was uncommon in clinical psychology at
the time: training that emphasized intervention and short-term treatment as
opposed to formal assessment and long-term care10 (Wallace, 2001). Taken

majority of costs for such community-oriented changes and services. A second
precursor was the passage of the Short-Doyle Act in 1957 that led to the
deinstitutionalization of mental health care (Kanel, 2012). Broadly speaking, this involved
patients in federally-supported mental hospitals being transferred to newly opened
mental health clinics in each county.
10
Callahan (2009) discusses some of the obstacles during this period when only longterm therapeutic treatments were available: “Months-long waiting lists were not

21
together, these different political changes played a significant role in shaping the
mental-health landscape going forward (including, as I discuss later, crisis and
suicide help lines).
A number of social forces were also at work during this period that
furthered these important changes (Wallace, 2001). First, the discipline of
psychology was faced with the issue of reorienting itself towards more social
reform and community-oriented issues. Around this time, community psychology
(as this perspective came to be known) was created to emphasize less traditional
clinical and psychiatric issues and more social reform issues and the promotion
of healthy living and adaptation (Jones & Levine, 1963). This also occurred along
side increasing doubts about the effectiveness of psychotherapy as a tool for
treatment and recovery (see Eysenck, 1952), as well as whether it was a
practical solution for the large scale mental health issues that were facing the
country at the time (Zax & Specter, 1974).
A final source of social change during this time, according to Wallace
(2001), was the “volunteer movement”. At the time when the Los Angeles Suicide
Prevention Center was created in 1958, adequate funding to hire a full staff of
trained psychiatrists was unavailable. Facing a similar staffing dilemma, the
Samaritans suicide line in the U.K. managed to rely on a force of 150 volunteers
(along with a smaller staff of psychiatrists and social workers, see Farberow &
Schneidman, 1961; cf. Varah, 1965). While the Communication Mental Health

uncommon; therefore, immediate attention was not to be taken literally” (p. 24). As a
result, some of the early writings regarding crisis intervention from this period emphasize
the importance of immediately responding to individuals in crisis.

22
Center Act of 1963 greatly enhanced funding for these centers, the legislation did
not allocate dedicated funds for staffing (Levine, 1981). Even today, this heavy
reliance on volunteers for staffing crisis and suicide lines is an institutional trend
that is still common today.11
Each of these important political and social changes, along with other key
developments (see Wallace, 2001), marked an era of increased focus on mental
health issues. These changes also contributed to a broader shift to focusing on
the preventative function of mental health services (in addition to allocating
resources for treatment). It is this prevention-centered approach that largely
defines the crisis intervention approach that is typically taken on crisis help
lines.12 In the next section, I focus on describing the larger therapeutic principles
and protocols that have influenced the way crisis help line services are typically
designed and managed.

11

The fact that volunteers – or paraprofessionals – do not have any professional training
beyond a 30 – 40 hour training has been controversial since its initial adoption as a
policy at the early help lines. A great deal of research has emerged surrounding the
effectiveness of volunteers at suicide and crisis centers (e.g., Cyr & Dowrick, 1991; Gilat
& Rosenau, 2011; Kinzel & Nanson, 2000; cf. McGee & Jennings, 2012). I return to this
trend in a later section on clinical foundations of crisis help lines.
12
Both of these movements played a part in influencing the types of help line that exist
today. However, the distinction between crisis vs. suicide line is one that is not as crucial
as it once was in the early days of these movements. For this reason, many services
now dedicate themselves to both crisis and suicide-related orientations. For this reason,
I henceforth use the name “crisis line” as short hand to refer to both types of help lines in
the remainder of the dissertation, thereby avoiding the similar or different purposes
implied by the use of “crisis” or “suicide” in a help line’s name.

23
Therapeutic foundations of crisis help lines
The type of communication that takes placed on crisis lines has
sometimes loosely been referred to as “telephone counseling” (Rosenfield,
1997). Yet there are important differences between what occurs over crisis lines
and other, more intensive forms of mental-health treatment (e.g., psychotherapy).
In this section I lay out broader therapeutic orientations that influence this type of
mental-health service: First, a brief overview of the key differences and
similarities between traditional forms of mental-health treatment and crisis help
lines; and second, models of both crisis intervention and risk assessment. Both
of these general influences demonstrate the distinctive qualities of this type of
mental health service.

Differences between crisis line work and traditional treatment
A number of differences exist between crisis line work and traditional
approaches to mental-health treatment (e.g., psychotherapy). Perhaps the
biggest is the fact that crisis lines are primarily conducted through a
technologically-mediated modality: the telephone. Scholars have often framed
this and other forms of mediated interaction in terms of the absence of specific
communicative cues available through the specific mediated channel (e.g.,
Hopper, 1992; Ling, 2012). This highlights the lack of any visual of the recipient
as well as the various related visual resources that speakers may depend on to
coordinate their interaction together.

24
According to Hopper (1992), telephone conversation typically revolves
around two speakers.13 Furthermore, participants’ reliance on mainly aural
resources requires that they conduct the opening of the conversation in a fairly
routine manner to accomplish a set of regular interactional jobs. For instance, at
the start of a call, each speaker must navigate the basic tasks of exchanging
greetings, identifying one another (or alternatively self-identifying, see Schegloff,
1979) and jointly determine a first topic for conversation, among other basic tasks
(see Chapter 4 for a more comprehensive discussion of how openings in
telephone conversation typically unfold and, more specifically, in the calls
analyzed later in this study).
Using the telephone as a primary communication modality also poses a
number of challenges when specifically dealing with individuals who are
distressed or struggling with serious mental health issues. As Williams and
Douds (2012) argue, clients often hold more control in the interaction than the
help provider (call taker). Unlike a face-to-face session where the clients would
have to make an appointment with a therapist in advance, the telephone allows
them to choose whenever it would be more convenient for them to interact with
the help provider. Moreover, without having to physically inhabit a therapist’s
office, a client on the telephone can opt to effortlessly end the interaction at any
point by hanging up the phone. Finally, the caller may also maintain their

However, there are exceptions in light of more recent technological innovations such
as speaker-phone functionality and video-based phone calls (see Licoppe & Moral,
2012), among other examples.

25
anonymity in a telephone call, potentially contributing to their level of comfort
about the encounter, sharing their feelings, etc., thus aiding the helping process.
Another difference with crisis line work comes from the individuals who are
responsible for providing the institutional service. Unlike mental-health
professionals (e.g., licensed counselors or therapists), call takers on crisis lines
are typically volunteers with no formal mental-health training (Williams & Douds,
2012). This has significant consequences for the types of therapeutic work that
these call takers are capable of performing during calls.14 In light of this fact, a
great deal of prior research exists dedicated to effective training and assessment
strategies for working with volunteers at crisis lines (Cyr & Dowrick, 1991; Kinzel
& Nanson, 2000; Gilat & Rosenau, 2011; cf. McGee & Jennings, 2012). With
these key differences in mind, I now turn to identifying several similarities that
exist between crisis lines and traditional modes of therapy.

Therapeutic aspects of crisis line work
While crisis lines are widely considered to be distinct from psychotherapy
and counseling15, the type of work call takers engage in remains influenced by a
number of therapeutic principles and techniques. In fact, some crisis centers may
emphasize a therapeutic orientation while others emphasize more of an

14

It is also important to point out that most crisis centers have 24 individuals with formal
mental-health training on back up (Lester, 1977). These individuals are often called from
the call center when a crisis call taker may feel overwhelmed with a recently completed
call or wants to check their judgment on a high-risk caller they have on a different line.
15
As noted by Perakyla (1995, p. 4), there is a lack of agreement on what constitutes the
difference between counseling and psychotherapy. For the purposes of this chapter, I
will resort to using these terms interchangeably.

26
intervention orientation (Brockopp, 2012a). Yet regardless of the emphasis of a
particular crisis line, the core therapeutic resemblances are essential to
understanding what constitutes the institutional “work” that takes place over the
crisis line.
One of the leading approaches to mental health treatment is
psychotherapy. Ferrara (1994) describes its primary objective as “to provide an
accepting atmosphere in which to facilitate and effect change in behavior,
emotions, and attitudes” (p. 45). As a long-term intervention, it is commonly used
in a variety of settings such as community mental health clinics, hospitals, and
private offices, among others (Ferrara, 1994). In contrast, the type of work
conducted on crisis help lines is often limited, brief in length, and revolves closely
around crisis-intervention models and protocols (Mishara & Daigle, 2001). Since I
will focus on crisis-intervention models in a later section, I will use the remainder
of this sub-section to explore several other therapeutic aspects of crisis line work.
Although different clinical and theoretical orientations to therapy each
present their own range of guiding principles and tools (e.g., cognitive behavioral
therapy, psychoanalysis, etc.), like crisis lines, they often rely closely on the help
provider (i.e., call taker) asking questions to solicit extended responses and to
display that they are doing “active listening” (i.e., actively demonstrating they are
being attentive, see Danby, Butler, & Emmison, 2009; Lester 2012a). For the
latter issue, call takers may use a variety of techniques for responding to callers
in ways that highlight their attentiveness to callers’ circumstances such as asking
questions, giving minimal responses to encourage them to continue (“Mm hm”,

27
“Uh huh”) and paraphrasing, to name a few (see Chapter 6 for a more
comprehensive discussion of communication techniques that HelpNow’s call
takers are trained to use). Each of these techniques is grounded in the principle
that call takers must continually demonstrate and affirm to callers their interest in
listening to and providing the help they are seeking.
Interactions with particular types of callers can also highlight some of the
similarities between crisis lines and traditional therapy. As part of their work, call
takers often must deal with individuals who call on a frequent basis, suffer from
serious mental illness, or may not call with any clear crisis or problem (Lester,
2012b; Lester, Brockopp, & Blum, 2012). In these cases, teams of call takers and
supervisors may need to work with one another across different shifts to
coordinate a clear action plan intended to lead to some type of improvement in
the caller’s overall functioning. I return to this issue of “chronic callers” (Lester,
Brockopp, & Blum, 2012) later on in this chapter.
These elements (being short-term oriented, techniques grounded in active
listening, and the management of chronic callers) are just a few examples of the
professional and practical parallels that exist between crisis lines and more
traditional modes of therapy. In the next and final portion of this section focused
on therapeutic influences, I discuss models of crisis intervention and risk
assessment. These two topics represent what are arguably the most important
clinically-oriented components that influence crisis line work.

28
Models of crisis Intervention and risk assessment
For most crisis lines, crisis intervention and risk assessment represent
some of the most important considerations in crisis line work. Crisis intervention
is a therapeutic, cognitive-oriented approach to helping people who are in crisis
return to a functioning state (Kanel, 2003). According to Roberts and Everly
(2006), it has “become the most widely used time-limited treatment modality in
the world” (p. 6). While the current project primarily focuses on crisis intervention
conducted over the telephone, it should be noted that this approach is also used
in face-to-face settings, such as hospitals and outpatient clinics (Rogers, 2012).
For the process of crisis intervention, numerous models have been
proposed as a resource to guide the individuals who are conducting it (Callahan,
1998).16 These models aim to break down the larger charge of crisis intervention
into discrete, manageable steps. Additionally, these steps typically come with a
number of general and communication-specific recommendations for how to
manage the encounter. 17 For instance, Kalafat (2012) has proposed the five step
“Helping Model”. This model is a variant of an earlier model that was created by
the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center and has further evolved with the
assistance of other centers (e.g., the Buffalo Suicide Prevention Center, see
Brockopp, 1973) and the five decades of related research that has accumulated
since then.

16

For instance, see models proposed by Gilliland and James (1993), Roberts (1996),
and Caplan (1961). A comprehensive review of a variety of crisis intervention models is
also provided in Gilliland and James (2009, p. 17 – 20).
17
See Chapter 3 for discussion of how this relates to the data analyzed in the current
study.

29
In the first step of the model, Establish a Relationship, the crisis counselor
attempts to create an atmosphere that is encouraging to the caller as they share
and explore their concerns as well as convey a sense of hope to the caller
(Kalafat, 2012). Research based on follow-up, post-call surveys has shown that
call taker characteristics valued by callers include availability, acceptance, and
concern (Lee, 1999), reassurance (Daigle & Mishara, 1995), and being nonjudgmental (Young, 1989). Yet, as Kalafat (2012) notes, similar to research on
psychotherapy, “the relationship [between the client and provider] is a necessary,
but not a sufficient aspect of effective helping” (p. 56).
In the second step of the model, Define the Problem, the call taker works
with the caller to clearly define the main concerns s/he would like to address
(Kalafat, 2012). While this may be a straightforward task in some calls, other
callers’ distressed or depressed states may obfuscate the task and require
significant exploration with the call taker. A caller’s crisis may also be provoked
by a variety of precipitating events and require assistance in “sorting them out
and prioritizing which events to address and which can be postponed” (p. 56).
Research supporting this recommendation comes from post-call feedback
from callers who indicated that call takers had “helped me organize my thoughts”
(Daigle & Mishara, 1995) and “helped me see things more clearly” (Lee, 1999). A
crucial element of this phase of the model is to “understand the problem from the
caller’s perspective: how is this a problem for them?” (p. 57). In short, the call
taker should not “diagnose” them or solve their problem for them during this
portion of the call. More generally, this step highlights the value of providing non-

30
directive and non-judgmental “active listening” that many emotional support
related help lines embrace (e.g., Danby, Butler, & Emmison, 2009; cf. Lester,
2012a).
The third step, Explore Feelings, involves the call taker acknowledging
and conveying acceptance of the caller’s feelings (Kalafat, 2012). Prior research
has supported the exploration of affect in helping encounters (Greenberg &
Safran, 1989; Wiser & Goldfried, 1997). In the fourth step of the model, Exploring
Past Coping, the helper guides the caller in a search for competence and
personal strengths (Kalafat, 2012). The helper may seek to learn more about the
caller’s “internal resources”, such as past accomplishments and motivation, and
“external resources,” such as close relationships (e.g., friends and family),
groups and organizations (e.g., workplace, church), and social activities.
The model’s fifth step, Exploring Alternatives, is dedicated to identifying
new alternatives and then collaborating on a plan of action (Kalafat, 2012). The
call taker may choose to use open questions including “What ways of handling
this can you think of?” or “We have identified a number of things going on for
you, where would you like to begin?” (p. 62). In exploring the consequences of
each alternative that is identified (e.g., the caller’s feelings and concerns for each
option), the helper is also working with the caller to model the problem-solving
skill that it is hoped they would learn and then use when they experience future
crises. After going through each of these five steps in the crisis intervention
model, it is hoped that the caller will feel a sense of immediacy and relief
(Kalafat, 2012).

31
A closely related process, risk assessment, may also be initiated if the
client’s situation indicates a behavioral emergency (also sometimes referred to
as an acute crisis, see Kalafat, 2012, p. 63), which is any time where the client
poses harm to themselves or others. The primary goal of risk assessment is to
“determine the level of risk for suicide in short term” (Rogers, 2012, p. 69). It
consists of guiding the client through a specific series of questions. Typically
these target “suicidal thoughts, estimating the patient’s intent to due, assessing
lethality (i.e., extent of a suicide plan, method of choice and access, and history
of previous behavior)” (p. 69; cf. Roberts & Owens, 2005). The process also can
help to identify the presence of further risk factors related to age, sex, marital
status, drug and alcohol use, and prior psychiatric history, among others18
(Rogers, Lewis, & Subich, 2002).
When conducting crisis intervention and caller’s level of risk suggests the
individual is at “high risk” for suicide (i.e., possibly requiring emergency
intervention), it is suggested that the call taker switch to conducting a full suicide
risk assessment as this then takes precedence over the crisis-intervention
protocol (Rogers, 2012).19 If the level of risk is determined to be low or moderate
(e.g., the lack of presence of lethal means or a specific plan for attempting selfharm), the crisis worker may continue with the crisis intervention objectives of
developing a shared understanding of the crises, exploring feelings and coping
behaviors, etc. Although I do not focus on risk assessment processes in the

18

It must be noted that there is no consensus on any particular group of “necessary and
sufficient risk factors” for assessing an individual’s suicidality (Rogers, 2012, p. 69).
19
However, see Callahan (1998) for an example of a “integrated model” that combines
protocols for crisis intervention and suicide assessment into a single model.

32
analytic portion of the current study, risk assessment and the more general
notion of risk are crucial for understanding how crisis line workers are trained to
monitor and manage the crises that callers present.
While crisis intervention and risk assessment models may afford the tools
for providing assistance to individuals in crisis, they typically do not touch on the
different obstacles that crisis works can encounter. In some cases, callers may
be resistant to any type of task-oriented process (like these five steps) or even
collaborative problem solving. Lester (1977) describes the long-standing problem
faced by both suicide and crisis lines regarding so-called “chronic callers”. Such
callers often struggle with chronic mental illness and may dial the crisis line
simply to get an empathic “set of ears” who will listen to them in a nonjudgmental manner.
In some cases, chronic callers are already in treatment and may feel more
comfortable relying on the call center. Alternatively, chronic callers may seek
support from the crisis center to supplement the days and evenings when they
are not able to see their therapist (Lester, Brockopp, & Blum, 2012). Lester
(1977) highlights the problematic nature of the institutional decision to engage
with chronic callers:
“Centers often justify continued involvement with chronic callers by hoping
that telephone contact reduces the client’s chance of hospitalization in a
psychiatric facility. The center sees itself as helping the client continue to
exist in the community, but there is usually no supporting evidence for this”
(p. 467)
Chronic callers continue to be a problem that many crisis centers struggle with
today, especially during busy late-night shifts (Hall & Schlosar, 1995; Kinzel &

33
Nanson, 2000). On the other hand, some call takers can develop concern for
chronic callers and even develop a strong connection with some of them (Lester,
Lester, Brockopp, & Blum, 2012; also see Chapter 4). While much research has
attempted to advance dialogue about how to best manage chronic callers while
minimizing their impact on the resources available for other callers (e.g.,
Barmanm, 1980; Hall & Schlosar, 1995; Lester & Brockopp, 1970; Middleton,
Gunn, Bassilios, & Pirkis, 2014; Sicafuse, Evans, & Davidson, 2012; Spittal,
Fedyszyn, Middleton, Bassilios, Gunn, Woodward, & Pirkis, 2015), the issue
remains a significant tension for crisis lines today (Lester, Brockopp, & Blum,
2012).
Models of crisis intervention play an important part in how crisis help line
services are administered and call takers are trained. On the one hand, crisis
intervention represents how call takers guide callers through the presentation of
their crisis or problem, to then reviewing possible coping resources, to finally
making a plan for the future. On the other hand, risk assessment represents an
ad-hoc protocol during calls when a caller appears to pose some harm to
themselves (or others). The call taker then guides the caller through an
assessment of whether or not more specific risk factors apply to their present
circumstances.
Between both types of models, call takers are given broad
recommendations in the form of institutional frameworks for understanding how
to work with each caller. Nonetheless, these frameworks tell us little about how
such crisis work is actually realized and co-constructed in the dynamics of social

34
interaction. The current study’s focus on actual interactions that take place on
crisis lines aims to contribute to this literature.
To conclude this larger section, the immediate objective has been to
review some of the therapeutic influences on crisis line work. Although a number
of major differences exist between traditional therapy and crisis lines (e.g., based
on short-term intervention, conducted primarily over the telephone, anonymous),
a number of important parallels can also be drawn to highlight the therapeutic
aspects of the work undertaken on these types of help lines. Call takers may
perform “active listening” using a number of techniques drawn from different
approaches to therapy. Additionally, working with chronic callers may require the
help line’s staff to develop a long-term plan of care. Finally, crisis intervention
and risk assessment also form a critical component of the work of crisis lines as
well as how call takers are trained (i.e., to implement each within the particulars
of a given call). I next review the body of outcomes-centered literature regarding
crisis line services.

Assessing the effectiveness of crisis lines
Prior research on crisis telephone services has tended to focus on the
program assessment of call centers and regional or national efficacy of the
services. Broadly speaking, five general approaches have been used in this type
of help line research (Neimeyer & Pfeiffer, 1994; cf. Gould et al., 2007). The first
approach stresses the efficacy of help line services by comparing national,
regional, and local suicide rates (e.g., the comparison of community-level suicide

35
rates in communities with and without suicide prevention centers, see Miller et
al., 1984). Second, the quality of help line services may be assessed by
measuring call takers’ development of core counseling skills (e.g., empathy,
warmth, genuineness) after participating in simulated calls or role plays (e.g.,
Knickerboker & McGee, 1973; cf. Mishara, Chagnon, Daigle, Balan, Raymond,
Marcoux, Bardon, Campbell, & Berman, 2007).
Written examinations intended to measure call takers’ knowledge of core
skills and protocols are a third approach to this type of research (e.g., Gray, Nida,
& Coonfield, 1976). A fourth approach involves research that examines callers’
satisfaction with the service by conducting follow-up telephone surveys at a later
time (sometimes days, weeks, or months later) to assess callers’ satisfaction with
the service (e.g., Stein & Lambert, 1984; cf. Coveney, Pollock, Armstrong,
Moore, 2012; Gould et al., 2007). An evaluation of the reach of the services
represents a fifth approach to assessment of these programs, with data derived
from call center log reports that document callers’ reasons for calling and basic
demographics (if provided) such as gender and age (e.g., Watson, McDonald, &
Pearce, 2006).
While each of these approaches to crisis line research provides important
insights into the services in question (e.g., how individuals perceive the services,
the problems they call with, etc.), the data utilized are often limited to macro-level
correlational data, ratings of simulated interactions, or reactions from callers long
after they have utilized the crisis services. Consequently, the literature lacks
attention to how crisis line protocols and risk-assessment models are

36
implemented, managed, or contested in the course of actual, naturally-occurring
crisis line calls. The current study aims to address this gap in the literature by
examining social interactions as they occur between callers and call takers on
crisis help lines. In the next section, I describe a different approach to
investigating crisis lines that positions the interactional dynamics of crisis line
calls at the center of the research process.

Taking a communication perspective: Communication-centered research
on help lines
Despite decades of prior research related to the effectiveness of crisis
help line services, scholarship that examines micro-level details of the
interactional processes that are central in this type of work is difficult to locate.
Language and social interaction (LSI) research on help lines seeks to “develop
an understanding of how, through language and social interaction, helping,
assisting, and supporting are made manifest, situationally defined, contextually
configured, and socially accomplished” (Firth, Emmison, & Baker, 2005, p. 2). In
short, an LSI research approach to help lines provides a window into observing
how help is sought and provided through actual communication practices.
This approach to help line research has spanned a variety of discoursecentered analytic traditions (Cameron, 2000; Sacks, 1966; Tracy, 1997) but has
its origins in the early work of Harvey Sacks in the 1960s. Sacks’ (1966, 1992)
early lectures and publications began to shed light on the interactional practices
through which interactants “index” their membership in the category “suicidal

37
caller” as well as the delicate nature of interactional openings in these types of
calls. In one of his published lectures, Sacks (1992) describes how the callers’
tendency to not disclose their names occasioned his journey into the sequential
analysis of conversation:
“The hospital’s concern was, can anything be done about it? One question
I wanted to address was, where in the course of the conversation could
you tell that somebody would not give their name? So I began to look at
the materials. It was in fact on the basis of that question that I began to try
to deal in detail with conversations.” (Vol. 1, p. 3)
Some of the initial observations Sacks raised about communication on help lines
would eventually be developed in the work of Whalen and Zimmerman on 911
emergency lines (1987, 1998). Also, although Sacks never used the term ‘help
line’, his early work paved way for future research that adopts a communication
perspective towards help line-related actions, identities, and institutional issues.
In the sub-sections below, I present some of the main topics regarding the
communicative dynamics of help lines that LSI scholars have discussed.

Institutional missions and communication processes
A wide variety of help lines have been examined in the time since Sacks’
early research. Many of these lines are defined by unique institutional missions
and procedures. Unsurprisingly then, research examining help line
communication processes has revealed that what actually constitutes “help” may
be quite variable.
Numerous studies have demonstrated the relationship between a help
line’s institutional mission and the communication processes used to facilitate the

38
help line service offered. For instance, Baker, Emmison and Firth’s (2007) work
on computer software support help lines has shown how these calls typically
center around providing step-by-step instructions related to solving a computer
problem. Thus, the service revolves around the process of “trouble shooting” a
technical device (cf. Houtkoup, Jansen, & Walstock, 2005).
In contrast, Danby, Baker and Emmison’s (2005) research investigating a
children’s counseling line in Australia held a different position towards what
constitutes “help”. Typical calls at this line do not follow a clear problem –
solution orientation but instead start from the caller’s wish to simply have
someone to talk to about something going on in their life. In this way, the callers
and call takers must always jointly negotiate the terms of what is considered
“help” for their particular encounter (Firth, Emmison, & Baker, 2005).

Differences compared to ordinary conversation
Prior LSI research has found that the overall structure of help line
interactions tends to differ from that of ordinary conversation in systematic and
institution-specific ways. Seminal research by Whalen and Zimmerman (Whalen
& Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1992; cf. Drew & Walker, 2010) examined
how the openings of 911 calls show a specialization and reduction of ordinary
conversational practices. According to their analysis, the greetings and how are
you sequences that are typical of ordinary telephone calls are absent in light of
the task-focused nature of 911 calls. This feature demonstrates participants’
orientations to the impersonal nature of the institution. Furthermore, the absence

39
of these sequences shows participants’ orientations to immediately getting to
address the reason for calling (i.e., the emergency). In the case of HelpNow,
calls also exhibit a number of core features that make it distinct from ordinary
conversation (see Chapter 4).

Negotiating institutionally-relevant identities
Prior help line scholarship has also highlighted ways in which institutional
roles are established and negotiated through talk (Emmison & Firth, 2012).
During help line calls, callers routinely present themselves (and are treated) as
help seekers while call takers establish their identities as help providers (Danby,
Harris, & Butler, 2015). Feo and Le Couteur (2013) examined a men’s
relationship counseling help line to find that the institutional framing and norms of
the service (a “solution-focused counseling” approach) shaped how call takers
positioned themselves as advice givers. Thus, despite callers’ interests in
primarily telling stories about their relationship troubles, call takers continued to
embody an institutional identity to primarily being advice givers on the line.
Shaw and Kitzinger (2007) investigated how personal and institutional
memory both shaped and reflected participants’ identities on a home birth line.
They documented how call takers recognize and display memories of callers they
have spoken to in the past through memory recognition – solicitation sequences.
Additionally, they found that callers may present themselves as repeat callers
(i.e., returning help seekers) by displaying the presumption of some institutional
memory on part of the call taker (e.g., “This is Matt” or “It’s Matt”, both designed

40
to presume recognition) while new callers (new help seekers) claimed no
institutional memory on the part of the call taker (e.g., “My name’s Dennis”, a
form that does not presume recognition). At any help line (including HelpNow,
see Chapter 4), the institutionally-relevant identities that participants enact may
play a further role in shaping how calls unfold.

Practices of advice giving
A further topic that has been investigated in this research is the
communication processes through which advice is implicated, given, or resisted.
Like other institutional contexts (e.g., Heritage & Sefi, 1992), advice on help line
can be an institutionally problematic activity. This may stem from what some
scholars (e.g., Danby, Butler, & Emmison, 2009) have identified as two core
characteristics of advice giving as a type of activity: First, advice giving is
normative in nature, which is to say it goes beyond simply presenting information
to prescribing future actions as necessary or moral; and second, advice giving is
asymmetrical in that the advice giver is positioned as being more knowledgeable
than the advice recipient, which makes salient any existing asymmetry between
institutional and non-institutional parties (Heritage & Sefi, 1992). Each of these
dimensions of advice giving shapes how recipients may go about receipting,
accepting, or resisting advice on a help line.
For example, Hepburn and Potter (2011) examine a set of practices used
on a UK child protection help line when callers are resistant to the call taker’s
advice. Under these circumstances, call takers may, for instance, repackage their

41
advice using a particular idiomatic or commonplace form. This adjustment is
thought to frame further resistance to the advice as counter to the sociallynormative character conveyed by idiomatic expressions. A further practice they
described was pairing the reformulated advice with a tag question. This device,
as Hepburn and Potter show, effectively puts callers in the position of then
confirming the repackaged advice.
In another study, Butler, Potter, Danby, Emmison, and Hepburn (2010)
investigated communication on a child protection help line that instructed call
takers to provide social support to callers while also resisting giving any explicit
advice (cf. Hepburn, 2005; Hepburn & Potter, 2010, 2011; Potter & Hepburn,
2004). To manage these issues (see the discussion of normativity and
asymmetry above), call takers use a practice which the authors call adviceimplicative interrogatives. These questions are designed in a way that frames a
possible course of action as simply an inquiry (e.g., “Have you talked with a
teacher yet?”, see Danby, Bulter & Emmison, 2011, p. 34).
In using this approach, call takers abide by the institutional mandate to
avoid giving advice while also respecting the caller’s autonomy to ultimately
devise what is best for their circumstances. Thus, this particular communication
practice enables call takers to achieve the client-centered support that is valued
by the help line (cf. Hepburn, 2005; Hepburn & Potter, 2010, 2011; Potter &
Hepburn, 2004). While advice giving will not be analyzed in the current study
(generally, it is also discouraged at HelpNow), prior work regarding how

42
institutional policies are managed in interaction supports a later discussion of call
takers’ practices for how to respond to caller’s problems (see Chapter 6).

Co-managing emotion and its display
Callers may display great anxiety, fear, or grief when they contact a help
line. This may make it difficult for call takers to get the critical information they
need in order to accomplish the institution’s mission. Whalen and Zimmerman
(1998) analyzed a range of techniques call takers utilize in order to realign the
caller towards the interactional project of obtaining necessary information for the
deployment of emergency services. Their findings showed how call takers
contribute to the interactional management of emotion by attending to the precise
details of the talk. For instance, for a caller who is severely distressed and
shouting, the call taker may summon the caller’s attention with an address term
(“Sir”) and provide reassurance that help is on the way (“We’re getting an
ambulance there”). This then reinstates the chain of interrogatives intended to
solicit further information about the emergency situation (Whalen & Zimmerman,
1998). Thus, 911 call takers’ efforts to counsel their interlocutors demonstrate
how the co-management of emotional states may be crucial to meeting the
relevant goals of a help-line institution.
Related work on affect has focused on the interactional practices call
takers use to enact activities such as empathy or sympathy. Hepburn and Potter
(2011), for instance, examine how call takers respond to crying on a child
protection help line. One practice they described is the call takers’ empathic

43
receipts. This practice involves call takers responding to callers’ crying with two
main components. First, a formulation of the caller’s mental state (e.g., “angry”,
“very down”) derived from locally prior elements such as sobbing, sniffing, and
silence; and second, presenting the formulation as contingent, such as by
marking it as being heard (e.g., “It sounds like you are feeling angry”) or ending
the unit with a tag question (“…right?”).
In another study, Pudlinski (2005) discovered further practices that call
takers at “warm lines” deployed to convey empathy. For instance, when a caller
is engaged in a troubles telling (Jefferson, 1988; Jefferson & Lee, 1992), the call
taker may produce an emotive reaction token (e.g., “Oh no”), a negative
assessment (“That is awful”), or formulate the gist of the caller’s telling.
Regarding the current study, HelpNow call takers are trained in methods for
displaying empathy and managing caller’s emotional displays (see Chapter 3 and
Chapter 6.
To wrap up, this section has reviewed the basis for adopting an LSI
perspective to conduct help line research (including the current study). Utilizing
this perspective allows researchers to closely examine how participants use
specific communicative practices and actions to accomplish social realities (such
as help-line services). Prior literature that has utilized this perspective has
uncovered how institutional missions, emotional displays, advice, and institutional
identities (among other topics) are made manifest and situationally defined in and
through talk. However, little work in these areas has addressed the
communication processes of crisis help lines in particular (with the closest being

44
Sacks’ early lectures and papers regarding suicide lines). Thus, the current study
aims to extend this body of literature by addressing several of these topics with
regard to crisis lines as an institutional context. In the next section, I describe
some of the basic findings related to talk-in-interaction which forms a further
basis for the communication-centered perspective on help lines.

Practices of talk-in interaction: Overview of concepts from conversation
analysis relevant to this study
For nearly five decades, Conversation Analysis has proven to be an
important analytic framework and set of methodological tools for studying the
micro-level details of talk-in interaction (Atkinson & Heritage, 1984; Sidnell &
Stivers, 2013). This research aims to document the orderliness of human
communication by observing participants’ methods (or practices) that are used to
both produce actions and systematically organize them within the course of
social interaction. Prior research has led to the discovery of different generic
organizations, each referring to systematic organizations through which
participants organize their interactions. I describe three of these basic domains of
organization (sequence organization, turn-taking organization, and overall
structural organization) below.20

20

See Stivers and Sidnell 2013.

45
Sequence organization
Sequence organization refers to the systematic organization of action in
interaction. This includes how interactants produce social actions, respond to
social actions, and how such actions are organized to form larger sequences of
action (Schegloff, 2007). According to Heritage and Clayman (2010), “it is the
engine room of interaction” (p. 43) and the primary means through which social
phenomena (e.g. actions, identities, relationships, etc.) are routinely realized.
The most basic form of sequence organization is the adjacency pair, or a pair of
type-matched actions: an initiating action (or “first pair part”) and a responding
action (“second pair part”). These basic sequence types also serve as the basis
upon which other actions and sequences are built (e.g. pre-expansions, insert
expansions, post-expansions) and serve as the means by which the sequential
implicativeness of actions may play out over the course of several turns
(Schegloff, 2007).
Preference organization
Preference organization refers to systematic differences in the design of
alternative actions, such as the design of alternative (agreeing vs. disagreeing)
responses (Pomerantz & Heritage, 2013). A set of interactional features regularly
distinguishes preferred actions from dispreferred actions. For instance, in the
context of responses to actions, such as requests and invitations, dispreferred
responses (such as, rejections and disagreements) are regularly delayed,
qualified (with uncertainty markers, hedging, conditions), and accountable (i.e.,
accompanied by explanations, excuses, or justifications)(Pomerantz & Heritage,

46
2013). In contrast, preferred responses (e.g., acceptances and agreements) are
produced immediately following the initiating action (i.e., with no gaps before
responding), unqualified, and non-accountable.
Interlocutors orient to markers of dispreference in interaction. For
instance, a speaker who has produced a request may hear subsequent silence
(i.e., a gap) as projecting a dispreferred response and, as a result, may do
interactional work to prevent a dispreferred response from actually being
produced by the recipient (Sacks, 1987, 1992). For instance, the speaker of the
initiating action may reverse the valence of their original action (e.g., from a
positive to a negative assessment) or make the initiating action more appealing
to the recipient (Pomerantz, 1988; Pomerantz & Heritage, 2013).

Turn-taking organization
This domain of organization refers to the systematic organization of
speaking turns, including how they are constructed and distributed (Sacks,
Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974). Two related processes enable speakers’
management of turn taking. First, turn construction refers to how interactants
build their turns at talk through turn-constructional units (TCUs). Second, turn
allocation refers to the process through which interactants distribute these turns
at talk.
Generally speaking, interactants observe the rule that speakers only get
one TCU per turn. However, exceptions occur when, for instance, speakers show
that they require an extended, multi-unit turn to complete their course of action

47
(e.g., a storytelling). Speakers may then use practices to produce an extended
turn, including using a story preface (e.g., “You’ll never believe the kind of day I
had today”, see Sacks, 1992) or list constructions (e.g., “I have three things to tell
you right now”. First…”; see Jefferson, 1991; Lerner, 1994). Later in the current
study (Chapter 5), I examine how callers and call takers co-manage multi-unit
tellings as a vehicle for their presentation of their crisis or problem.

Overall structural organization
The overall structural organization of interaction refers to how different
action sequences are positioned within the larger social activity interactants are
engaged in (Robinson, 2013). A great deal of research has been done on
openings in ordinary conversation, both face-to-face and over the telephone
(e.g., Hopper, 1992; Mondada, 2009; Pillet-Shore, 2012; Schegloff, 1986). For
instance, research by Schegloff (1968, 1979, 1986) has described a series of
four action sequences that participants routinely accomplish when beginning a
conversation (summons/answer sequences, identification/recognition sequence,
greetings sequences, and how-are-you sequences). This body of research
demonstrates how participants understand and treat openings as distinctly
preliminary to subsequent phases of an activity. Later in the dissertation (Chapter
4), I analyze how HelpNow callers and call takers accomplish the coordinated
entry into their interaction on the telephone.
In summary, conversation analysts have developed a body of literature
regarding the actions and practices interactants use to produce and

48
systematically organize their interactions together. Each of the areas described
above (i.e., regarding generic practices of talk-in interaction) also informs the
current study’s focus on interaction on crisis help lines. To further link processes
of talk-in interaction with help line settings, the next section gives an overview of
key principles regarding interaction in institutional settings.

Talk in institutional settings
Conversation analysis has also been used to examine forms of talk-in
interaction that are “professional, task focused, or ‘institutional’” in nature
(Heritage & Clayman, 2010, p. 2). “Institutional interaction,” as it has come to be
referred to by scholars, is characterized by a more restricted set of available (and
appropriate) lexical forms, social actions, and sequences (Heritage, 1984, 1997).
However, providing a clear definition of the boundaries of institutional talk and
ordinary conversation is challenging (Drew & Heritage. 1992; Schegloff, 1987a,
1991, 1992). For this reason, it is important to view this distinction as a
participant’s distinction, warranted in the way that they display an orientation to
the activities they are engaged in together (cf. Drew & Sorjonen, 1997).
Participants in institutional settings may organize their communication in
distinct ways sensitive to the broader institutional purpose for which the
interaction is taking place. Drew and Heritage (1992) proposed three general
criteria to help distinguish between institutional interaction and ordinary
conversation. These include the following (as presented by Heritage, 1997):

49
•

•
•

“Institutional interaction normally involves the participants in specific goal
orientations which are tied to their institutions relevant identities: doctor
and patient, teacher and pupil, and so on;
Institutional interaction involves specific constraints on what will be treated
as allowable contributions to the business at hand;
Institutional talk is associated with inferential frameworks and procedures
that are particular to specific institutional contexts.”
(p. 163 – 164).

Goal orientations
In institutional settings, both institutional representatives (e.g., physicians,
call takers, talk show hosts) and lay participants (e.g., patients, callers, talk show
guests) display an orientation towards specific goals or objectives that are unique
to each institution (Clayman & Heritage, 2002; Drew & Heritage, 1992; Heritage
& Greatbatch, 1991). For instance, in 911 calls, the manner in which the call
taker swiftly moves to assess the caller’s reason for calling and obtain key
information (and, if deemed necessary, dispatch emergency personnel)
demonstrates an orientation towards the unique mission of the institution of 911
emergency: dispatching emergency assistance with callers’ emergencies
(Zimmerman, 1992). Accordingly, participants orient to organizing their conduct
around these goal orientations. For instance, in 911 emergency calls participants
organize their talk by reference to the goal of requesting and dispatching
emergency help (Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1992) while in acute
care doctor-patient interactions the interaction is organized with respect to the
goals of diagnosing and treating the patient (Robinson & Heritage, 2005). In the
current study, callers and call takers on a crisis line embody an orientation to
organizing their call around talking about a crisis or problem and obtaining some
type of help for that issue.

50

Constraints on allowable contributions
The second criterion is related to the sets of normative institutional
constraints that shape (and constrain) what is considered an allowable
contribution in that institutional setting (Drew & Heritage, 1992). Such constraints
may restrict the range of actions (and the individuals who enact them) relative to
achieving the goal of the institutional encounter. In the case of 911 calls,
allowable contributions constrain the types of actions that are permissible to
establish, progress, and terminate the call as well as who is able to dispatch help
in general. In acute care doctor – patient visits, allowable contributions restrict
who is able to conduct a patient’s diagnosis and provide treatment. These
constraints amount to normative structures that shape how institutional
participants infer what it is their interlocutor is accomplishing to advance the
primary goal of their institutional encounter (Kevoe-Feldman, 2009).

Inferential frameworks
A third criterion related to institutional talk is related to the types of
inferential frameworks that institutional representatives and lay participants
display sensitivity towards during interaction (Drew & Heritage, 1992; cf.
Levinson, 1992). For instance, in the first few seconds of 911 emergency calls,
call takers are trained to make inferences about whatever they are hearing (e.g.,
callers’ problem presentations, background noises) and what can be deemed
worthy of dispatching emergency resources. In the context of the crisis help line
examined in the current study, call takers may make institution-specific

51
inferences when callers describe having nothing to live for or report giving their
prized possessions away.
In summary, investigating talk in institutional settings makes it possible to
explicate the distinctive methods through which institutional and lay participants
“talk the institution into being” (Heritage, 1984a, p. 290). The three criteria
described above (goal orientations, constraints on allowable contributions,
inferential frameworks) point to some of the regular ways with which participants
may organize and orient to their conduct as institutional in nature. The current
study pursues each of these three themes of institutional interaction in the
specific context of crisis help lines.

Conclusion
This chapter has reviewed several areas of research literature to frame
the current study’s focus on communication processes of crisis help lines. Crisis
and suicide are both notions relevant to this institutional domain and shape a
broader set of institutional concerns towards the mental health of its callers.
While prior research in this area has predominately focused on psychological or
sociological variables, research analyzing the dynamics of social interaction is
rare. A communication-centered perspective on these issues (i.e., crisis and
suicide) thus emphasizes seeing individual and social dimensions of both crisis
and how suicidality may get worked out in and through the dynamics of social
interaction.

52
The earliest telephone help lines dedicated to crisis and suicide in the
United States came after a number of pivotal social and political changes related
to mental-health treatment occurred in the 1960s. The broader shift that resulted
from these changes both led to a greater focus on the preventative function of
mental-health services and proliferation of suicide-related help line services.
Eventually, the need emerged for help lines dedicated to a broader assortment of
issues such as crisis and distress.
Generally speaking, crisis-help lines can be described in terms of a
number of core or therapeutic influences. This includes being short-term
oriented, emphasizing techniques grounded in active listening, and managing
callers who call on a more frequent basis. In addition, call takers are trained in
models related to crisis intervention and risk assessment. These models shape
specific protocols they must follow and hence guide them in how to work with
callers. The little research on how these models are put into action in actual
interaction also motivates the current study’s focus on communication processes.
Most empirical research on crisis help lines to date has focused on macrolevel correlational data, ratings of simulated interactions, or reactions from callers
long after they have utilized the crisis services. While this type of research
provides important insight into the services in question (e.g., how individuals
perceive the services, the problems they call with, etc.), it lacks attention to the
concrete interactional practices that participants use to implement, manage, or
contest crisis line protocols in the course of actual calls. In contrast, LSI research
on help lines emphasizes these very issues by examining the micro-level details

53
of naturally-occurring help line interactions. Prior work adopting this perspective
has led to key findings about communication processes on help lines. However,
more work remains to be done on crisis lines in particular.
The majority of communication-centered research is heavily informed by
empirical findings regarding talk-in-interaction. This area of scholarship focuses
on the regular practices for how people go about producing and systematically
organizing social interactions (e.g., sequences of action, the exchange of turns at
talk, etc.). These findings have also been used to illuminate the methods through
which institutional and lay participants construct institutions through their
communication. These types of interactions that occur in institutional settings
have typically been distinguished from ordinary conversation by reference to
issues such as institutional goal orientations, constraints on allowable
contributions to interaction, and institution-specific inferential frameworks. This
area (talk in institutional settings) represents a further way in which the current
study extends prior scholarship.

Chapter 3: Data and methods
This chapter presents the data and methods that were used in the current
study. First, I provide ethnographic background about the crisis help line
organization that provided the data for the research. Second, I present an
overview of the data set that forms the basis for the analysis presented in later
chapters (see Chapters 4, 5, 6). Finally, I provide an overview of several
epistemological principles from Conversation Analysis as well as the basic
methodological procedures that guided the current study.

Ethnographic background about the crisis help line
The organization that contributed to this research study, HelpNow
(pseudonym), is a non-profit crisis intervention and suicide prevention
organization founded in the 1970s and located in the Northeastern United States.
It offers a range of programs and services dedicated to crisis intervention, suicide
prevention, and community mental health. As a “generic” crisis organization,21
HelpNow’s primary mission revolves around answering and managing help lines
dedicated to providing confidential, compassionate listening and referral services
to people experiencing crisis or distress. In 2013, HelpNow answered around
9,800 calls.
Several paid staff operate the organization along with a pool of over 100
trained volunteers. The volunteers (or “para professionals”) who answer the

21

See Chapter 2 for a discussion of “generic” versus “specialized” crisis-related help
lines.

55
phones in HelpNow’s call center are required to complete a 40-hour training prior
to beginning their work and subsequently complete continuing education
workshops each year.22 This initial training explores issues such as active
listening, mental illness, and protocols related to crisis intervention and suicide
risk assessment.23 These topics are taught through a combination of lecture, role
play, and call-center observation (“apprentice shifts”).

Distinguishing HelpNow’s institutional mission from “warm lines”
While HelpNow is primarily dedicated to offering help to individuals in
crisis or distress, its mission must also be distinguished from what have recently
become known as peer (or “consumer”) run “warm lines” 24. In contrast to crisis
help lines, warm lines are typically considered a “pre-crisis” service (i.e., primarily
intended for individuals not in a state of crisis). This type of service emerged from
a larger movement based on community focused mental health perspective that
views supportive peer networks as essential for individuals with mental illness
and who seek an alternative to the bureaucracies of the mental-health system
(Solomon, 2004).
HelpNow’s help line services can be distinguished from warm lines with
regard to several key characteristics. First, while warm lines are typically

22

See Chapter 3 for further discussion of the use of volunteers in crisis intervention and
suicide prevention work.
23
As I explain in the “Data” section later in this chapter, my knowledge of some of this
background information (including the call taker training) is informed by my extensive
experience serving as a call taker at HelpNow.
24
Doughty and Tse (2005) have also described this form of mental health services as
“service-user run”.

56
answered by individuals who are also living with mental illness and/or are
currently in treatment 25 (Pudlinski, 2001), there is no such requirement for
HelpNow’s call takers.26 Second, many warm lines are housed within halfway
houses or social clubhouses with the individuals who call the help line. In
contrast, the HelpNow call center is not associated with any type of walk-in
recovery and social space. The exact location of HelpNow’s call center is kept
confidential and never disclosed outside of interactions among administrators or
call takers.27
Third, the peer/consumer call takers at warm lines often have relationships
with callers independent of their role in operating the line (Pudlinski, 2001).
HelpNow callers, on the other hand, do not hold personal (non-help line related)
relationships with callers. Such relationships (i.e., independent of the help line)
are strongly discouraged by HelpNow administrators in light of their mission to
preserve the anonymity promised to both callers and the volunteers who answer
the calls. Thus, each of these differences positions HelpNow as being quite
distinct from warm line organizations.

25

It is thought that these individuals are best suited for this purpose because of having
“been through it”, and thus better preparing them to be able to “empower” those who are
seeking support (Pudlinski, 2001; Solomon, 2004).
26
Based on informal conversations with HelpNow administrators, they seems to think
that the majority of their call takers would not qualify as “peers” or “consumers” at all
(i.e., being a current or past client of mental-health treatment services).
27
HelpNow’s administrative offices are housed in a different location than the call center.

57

Individuals who utilize HelpNow’s help line services
When one goes through the training to become a HelpNow call taker,
he/she quickly learns about two of the most common types of callers who utilize
their help line services: individuals who are calling for the line for the first time
and individuals who call the line on a regular basis (among many others that are
learned later on).28 The first type of caller typically describes the crisis that led
them to calling the line at that time (see Chapter 4 for a related analysis of what I
refer to as “first-time callers” for the current study). In doing so, they may make
no mention of serious mental illness or other chronic health conditions. Call
takers primarily manage these types of calls by drawing upon their training
related to active listening and models of crisis intervention (see Chapter 2).
Other types of HelpNow callers (some of whom may present as “regular
callers”, see Chapter 4) may volunteer information that they have been
diagnosed with some form of serious mental illness (e.g., major depressive
disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc.) and are
currently in treatment (i.e., taking psychiatric medication(s) and/or participating in
regular appointments with one or several types of mental health professionals) or
have received treatment in the past.29 Thus, despite the previously discussed

28

Also, see the later discussion in this chapter related to the range of caller categories
that call takers must select from when they are using HelpNow’s call intake software
29
It is also worth noting that it is often impossible for call takers to infer whether any
caller’s troubles are directly related to (i.e., symptoms of) their known health issues nor
are they allowed to provide diagnostic assessments (see Chapter 2 for a discussion of
the use of volunteers vs. mental-health professionals in crisis line settings).

58
differences between its services and warm lines, HelpNow does indeed receive
calls from individuals living with chronic mental illness.30 Furthermore, my
observations as a HelpNow call taker suggest that such callers can pose
significant challenges to HelpNow’s institutional mission of helping individuals in
crisis or distress.31

How HelpNow’s different help lines are managed
In addition to answering a primary crisis line, HelpNow is also one of over
100 crisis centers in the United States that take calls from a federally funded
national suicide prevention line launched in 2007.32 Although this secondary
telephone line tends to receive more calls from individuals who present with
suicidal ideation or behavior, the line also regularly receives calls from individuals
who are non-suicidal and sometimes even individuals who call more frequently
(see Chapter 4).

30

At HelpNow, this population closely overlaps that of individuals who call on a regular
basis, or “chronic callers”. According to Pudlinski (personal communication), one of the
reasons warm lines maybe be established in a given community is to alleviate the stress
that these individuals may put on the local or regional crisis help line. See Chapter 2 for
a review of how each of these issues have been discussed in prior literature on crisis
help lines.
31
Such tensions regarding regular or “chronic” callers have and continued to receive a
moderate amount attention by researchers in crisis intervention and suicide prevention
(e.g., Lester & Brockopp, 1970; Lester, Brockopp, & Blum, 2012; MacKinnon, 1998;
Mishara & Daigle, 1997; Sicafuse, Evans, & Davidson, 2012). See Chapter 2 for a more
thorough review of this issue.
32
In 2007, the United States government provided funding to establish the National
Suicide Prevention Hotline (Lester 2012b). Now those seeking crisis or suicide support
can call a toll free number in order to receive assistance. However, this has created
further obstacles for regional crisis lines as less state and federal funding is made
available to support their long-standing crisis services (Lester, 2012b).

59
The phone numbers for both HelpNow’s help lines (i.e., the primary crisis
line and the second line which is linked to the national suicide network) are
typically featured in state-circulated posters and information guides. These
posters often include tag lines such as “If you are in crisis and need someone to
listen“, “Just need to talk?” or “Thinking of suicide?” (see Appendix B, Appendix
C, and Appendix D for examples of advertisements used by other crisis-related
help lines). Both phone numbers may appear along with either or both of the
terms ‘suicide’ and ‘crisis’. At the time of this study, HelpNow does not collect any
information about how callers may have learned of the service.
Once either of these lines is answered, call takers are required to
manually log information about the call (e.g., caller’s name, reason for calling,
presenting issues, resources provided, etc.) into call intake software either during
the call or after it is completed (see Figures 3-A, 3-B, & 3-C later in this chapter).
Information that is recorded for a call can include name (if provided)33, phone
number, location (based on caller-ID information), the help line dialed, and any of
a range of categories applicable to the caller’s circumstances (e.g., mental
health, physical health, interpersonal issues, etc.).
The software also includes scales that call takers can use to conduct a full
risk assessment of the caller’s suicidality if necessary (see Figure 3-C). The
information stored in this database can later be accessed and referenced if
someone from that phone number calls again (the reason why the call taker

33

If a name is provided by the caller, it is typically only a first name. In some cases, the
caller ID system will also display a last name that the call taker will enter into the log
system.

60
typically enters the phone number the caller dialed from into the software near
the beginning of the call). While this software represents a significant institutional
resource for call takers as they manage incoming calls, call takers’ use of the
software has not been video recorded and thus is not considered in the analysis
portion of the current study (Chapters 4, 5, 6).

Data
Data for this study include 115 audio-recorded telephone calls created
internally by HelpNow and subsequently shared with the researcher. These calls
were made to HelpNow’s primary help line dedicated to helping individuals in
crisis or distress in several counties in the state in which it is based (though there
are exceptions). In total, the data represent 15.7 hours worth of telephone calls.
The calls provided to the researcher were recorded between March and June
2013. Prior to when the recordings were shared with the researcher, all
identifying information (e.g., names, places) was deleted from each recording. No
information about the number of unique callers and call takers was provided.
Beyond the close analysis of call recordings, the current study is also
informed by my extensive participant observation of HelpNow while serving as a
member of their volunteer staff. For approximately 2.5 years, I participated in the
organization’s activities in a variety of ways. This included completing their new
call taker training course, sitting in on administrative meetings, and working shifts
answering calls in the HelpNow call center. Thus, the observations I made in as a
part of this role inevitably shaped the analysis of particular calls in the collection.
My analyses are also informed by the various competencies I have
developed as a volunteer call taker at two additional crisis help line organizations
in the northeastern United States: a crisis line primarily funded by state
government and a more specialized crisis line dedicated to LGBTQ communities.
From my involvement in the three crisis lines, I developed an in-depth

63
understanding of day-to-day crisis line management, the larger domain of crisis
intervention and suicide prevention and, of course, how to manage the calls to
the crisis lines.

Method
The current study employs the methods of Conversation Analysis
(Atkinson & Heritage, 1984; Sidnell & Stivers, 2013), a naturalistic, inductive
method for examining field recordings of naturally-occurring interactions. The
following excerpt from Atkinson and Heritage (1984) explicates the central goal of
the Conversation Analysis (henceforth referred to as CA):
“The central goal of conversation analytic research is the description and
explication of the competencies that ordinary speakers use and rely on in
participating in intelligible, socially organized interaction. At its most basic,
this objective is one of describing the procedures by which conversationalists
produce their own behavior and understand and deal with the behavior of
others.” (1984, p. 1)
In short, the central goal of CA is to describe the orderly practices of talk-in
interaction through which interactants routinely construct their social worlds.34 CA
was first developed in the early collaborations of Harvey Sacks, Emanuel
Schegloff, and Gail Jefferson (see Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974). The
method is heavily influenced by two key theoretical propositions from Sociology:
First, the CA enterprise is deeply shaped by Harold Garfinkel’s (1967) notion of
ethnomethodology and how individuals create the orderliness of everyday social

34

Pomerantz and Fehr (1997) describe the overall project of CA as investigating “how
people in society produce their activities and make sense of the world about them” (p.
65). A more recent description provided by Heritage and Robinson (2011) is as follows:
“Identifying and delineating fundamental practices involved in the production and
recognition of actions and sequences of actions” (p. 31).

64
life; second, CA is also heavily influenced by Erving Goffman’s (1983) claim that
social interaction is of critical importance to ordinary social life. In the space
below, I describe some of the basic epistemological principles that guide CA
research and the specific methodological procedures that are employed.
While a range of other social scientific methods has been used to study
crisis help lines (e.g., surveys, interviews, participant observation, etc.), CA is
best suited to achieving the objectives of the current study. CA allows the
researcher to examine the micro-level details of the interactions that occur on the
help line in order to see how its institutional goals are realized through talk. Thus,
CA will be the main method used in the current study.

Select epistemological principles of CA
Several core epistemological principles guide the use of Conversation
Analysis throughout the research process. These include participants’ own
methods or practices, conceiving of context as a locally organized phenomenon,
and the dual notions of procedural consequentiality, among many other core
epistemology principles (see Clayman & Gill, 2004; Heritage 1984; or Sidnell,
2013 for a more comprehensive review of CA’s core epistemological
assumptions). I describe each of these principles in more detail in the space
below.

1. Participants’ practices

65
The notion of participants’ practices refers to the generic mechanisms, or
methods, of communicating through which speakers systematically produce and
organize social actions in ways that are understandable to their interlocutors.
These practices serve as an important analytic resource for investigating the
orderliness of interaction. In CA, a primary source of evidence for grounding
analytic claims about interactional phenomena are the very practices that are
observable in the details of the data (Sidnell, 2013). Sacks, Schegloff and
Jefferson (1974) describe this locally-grounded criterion:
“While understandings of others’ turns at talk are displayed to co-participants,
they are available as well to professional analysts, who are thereby afforded a
proof criterion…for the analysis of what a turn’s talk is occupied with. Since it
is the parties’ understandings of prior turns’ talk that is relevant to their
construction of next turns, it is THEIR understandings that are wanted for
analysis. The display of those understandings in the talk of subsequent turns
affords both a resource for the analysis of prior turns and a proof procedure
for professional analyses of prior turns – resources intrinsic to the data
themselves” (p. 729)
As this excerpt emphasizes, CA strives to ground analytic claims within the
details of specific practices employed by participants in interaction.

2. Context as a locally-organized phenomenon
CA epistemology is also grounded in an assumption regarding what
constitutes “context.” Instead of viewing context as something that exogenously
shapes and constrains interaction (i.e., much like how a bucket gives shape to
and encases the water placed in it), CA scholarship presumes context to be
primarily constructed in and through the actions of interlocutors (Heritage &
Clayman, 2010; Raclaw, 2015; Schegloff, 1987c, 1995). CA thus views talk (and

66
more specifically, turns at talk) as being both “context-shaped” and “context
renewing” (Schegloff, 1972).
The first aspect of this, interaction as context shaped, refers to how turns
at talk are regularly produced with reference to preceding talk (typically, what
occurred immediately prior in the talk)(Sacks, 1987; Schegloff & Sacks, 1973).
Participants often design their talk in ways that exploit this basic principle, such
as by producing actions that build on earlier actions or refer to previous
conversational topics. In doing so, they utilize the basic positioning of talk as an
interactional resource to leverage how to construct their utterances and how they
may be understood by their interlocutors.
The second aspect, interaction as context renewing, refers to how turns at
talk project (or “look forward towards”) the relevance of a particular action (or a
range of possible actions) to occur next as produced by a subsequent speaker
(Schegloff, 1972). For instance, in 911 calls, when a clear emergency has been
presented and received, it occasions the interactional relevance of a question
(and in most cases, a series of investigative questions)(Whalen & Zimmerman,
1987; Zimmerman, 1992). In this way, any particular social action will form a
framework for a next action or a range of actions. In short, the notion of context
utilized in CA presumes that context is never independent of people’s social
conduct (Duranti & Goodwin, 1992).

67
3. Demonstrable relevance & procedural consequentiality
Closely related to the principle of context being locally organized, CA also
resists imposing a priori claims that stem from larger social categories (e.g.,
gender, culture, etc.). Instead, as Schegloff (1987a) describes, the relevance of
such categories must be shown to be clearly demonstrable to the participants in
the data itself (what he refers to as “demonstrable relevance”) or clearly
consequential to the procedures the participants are engaged in coaccomplishing (what he calls “procedural consequentiality”). As a result, facets of
interlocutors’ social identities (such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.)
must remain independent of an analysis of an episode of interaction unless the
researcher can show how interlocutors are “attending to their relevance and
demonstrable impact on the current interaction” (Mandelbaum, 2008, p. 191; cf.
Schegloff, 1987a). In the current study, for instance, this principle informs the
analysis appearing in Chapter 4 regarding the analytic relevance of call takers’
institutional identities and the different types of interactional identities presented
by callers.

4. Key CA terminology: Pauses and gaps
In conversation analysis, a distinction is drawn between gaps and pauses
in an attempt to more precisely describe how speakers organize their talk (Sacks,
Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974; cf. Hepburn & Bolden, 2013). On the one hand, a
gap refers to silence that takes place between turn-constructional units and in
transcripts is placed in on a separate line. On the other hand, a pause refers to

68
silence that occurs within a single turn-constructional unit and in transcripts is
placed on the same line as the prior talk.
While speakers may (and often do) treat even very short gaps (such as, a
micro-pause or 0.1 second) as interactionally significant (Kendrick & Torreira,
2015; Stivers et al., 2009; Torreira, Bögels, & Levinson, 2015), Jefferson (1989)
has proposed the notion of a metric (or “standard maximum tolerance”) of
roughly one second, at which point interlocutors make take active measures to
address whatever problem the silence is indicative of. For example, the speaker
of an initiating action may then re-take the floor to pursue a response.

Basic methodological procedures
In the sub-sections below, I provide a brief overview35 of the basic
methodological procedures that I followed for the current study.

1. Data Collection & Transcription
As discussed earlier in the “Data” section, the data utilized for this study
were pre-collected by HelpNow’s staff. Once shared with the researcher, the
audio recordings were then transcribed using the standard set of conversation
analytic transcription conventions originally developed by Gail Jefferson
(Atikinson & Heritage, 1984; Hepburn & Bolden, 2013). These conventions were
used to create detailed written representations of the recorded conversation by

35

For a more comprehensive discussion of CA’s methodological principles, see Sidnell
(2013), Heritage and Clayman (2010), Clayman and Gill (2004), or Raclaw (2015).

69
capturing production-related features of the recordings (including sound
stretches, speaker overlap, laughter, in breaths and out breaths, etc.).
Pseudonyms were used in place of where any identifying information (e.g.,
names, places) originally appeared in the recordings. A key showing the
transcription conventions can be found in Appendix A.
I transcribed 5 calls in their entirety for the current study. For the
remainder of the calls, each call was only transcribed from the beginning of the
call (Chapter 4) through the caller’s initial presentation of their crisis or problem
(Chapter 5) and up to a point where call takers’ specific techniques for
responding to callers’ crises or problems were observable (Chapter 6).

2. Data Analysis
Following and in parallel with the transcription stage, the data were
analyzed inductively in order to reveal how the participants organize their
interaction on a turn-by-turn, action-by-action basis. This process of analysis
involved the researcher listening closely to the recordings (while using the
transcript as an aid) in order to produce analytic observations about participants’
communicative conduct. Phenomena that could have been identified at this stage
include particular interactional practices related to issues like the organization of
social action, conversational repair, turn taking, or the overall structural
organization of interaction, among many other possible topics (see Chapter 2; cf.
Clayman & Gill, 2004). Once a candidate phenomenon was identified (see
Chapters 4, 5, and 6 for the phenomena that were chosen), I proceeded to

70
develop a detailed account of a single case of the phenomenon. This included
describing core features of the target phenomenon, often regarding dimensions
such as action, composition, and sequential position.
After I developed a detailed analysis of a single case for a particular
phenomenon, I then assembled a larger collection of cases.36 To do this, I
returned to other data in order to build and analyze a collection of similar cases
of the target phenomenon. I utilized a spreadsheet software to create subcollections for each of the core phenomena explored in the dissertation (see
Chapters 4, 5, and 6). This allowed me to systematically document and track the
interactional features of each call as they were related to each sub-collection.
Throughout this highly iterative process, my analytic claims about each
interactional phenomenon were continually refined through repeated examination
of the instances in each sub-collection (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973).

Conclusion
This chapter has given an overview of the data and methods which form
the basis of the dissertation. First, I presented ethnographic background about
the help line organization that provided the calls for the study. Second, I provided
an overview of the data set of previously recorded audio recordings of HelpNow
calls. Third, I described some of the basic epistemological principles and
Conversation Analysis as well as the basic methodological procedures I followed
in conducting the current study.

analyses, see Schegloff (1984) or Whalen, Zimmerman, and Whalen (1988).

Chapter 4: Negotiating identities and relationships in
call openings
The openings of interactions have long been a source of great interest for
scholars of language and social interaction. Research on this topic has spanned
ordinary face-to-face conversation (Pillet-Shore, 2012), technologically-mediated
interactions (Hopper, 1992; Luke & Pavildou, 2002; Schegloff, 1968, 1986),
interaction in public spaces (Mondada, 2009) as well as in institutional settings
(Coupland, Coupland, & Robinson, 1992; Mortensen & Hanzel, 2014; Robinson,
1998). Schegloff (1979) describes this particular phase of interaction as follows:
“The opening is a place where the type of conversation being opened can
be proffered, displayed, accepted, rejected, modified – in short, incipiently
constituted by the parties in it” (p. 25)
In the case of crisis help lines, openings provide a rich site for examining how
both parties come together (via the telephone) and jointly coordinate “what kind
of call this is.” The central aim of this chapter is to investigate the organization of
call openings and the interactional practices through which callers and call takers
jointly accomplish identities and relationships.
Investigating the openings of crisis line calls is important for several
reasons. First, it provides insight into how callers and call takers jointly establish
an understanding of the callers’ presenting concern (“reason for calling”) that will
shape the core interactional business of the call. Second, in a more practical
sense, this research can shed light on effective practices for how call takers can
facilitate a smooth transition from the opening of the call into where they address
the callers’ crisis or problem. Taken together, these key reasons for studying

72
crisis call openings further contribute to our understanding of the communication
processes involved when call takers first answer the phone and begin helping
someone in distress.
The structure of this chapter is as follows. First, I provide an overview of
prior literature related to openings in ordinary conversation and institutional
interaction, including telephone help lines. Next, I examine interactional practices
associated with three different caller identities: first-time caller identities, regularcaller identities, and return-caller identities. To conclude, I summarize the
findings discussed in the chapter and suggest some implications of this work.

Openings in ordinary conversation
Seminal research by Schegloff (1968, 1979, 1986) has described a series
of routine tasks that participants display orientations to accomplishing while
getting an interaction started. The key action sequences through which
participants jointly coordinate this series of tasks include:
•

summons – answer sequence: deals with the interactional availability of
interactants with one party producing a “summons” (e.g., “Hey Tony?”)
and the other an answer (“Yeah?”)(Schegloff, 1979). It is through this
mechanism that participants begin to jointly coordinate entry into a
sustained interaction. On the telephone, the summons takes the form of
the telephone ringing (since it summons the answerer to begin an
interaction) and the answer is constituted by the answerer’s first turn upon
picking up the phone (e.g., “Hello?”)(Schegloff, 1979);

73
•

identification/recognition sequence: involves participants managing
individual or categorical identities via displays of recognition and/or selfidentification. Among intimates, recognition is preferred over identification
(Schegloff, 1979);

•

greeting-greeting sequence: consists of participants each producing
greetings and may not necessarily be produced as distinct from the
identification/recognition sequence (Schegloff, 1979);

•

general-state inquiry (“how are you”) sequence: deals with participants
checking in with one another’s general well being and provides an
opportunity to make it “a matter of joint priority concern" (Schegloff, 1986,
p. 118). These sequences are often reciprocated and thus occur over the
course of two rounds of the sequence.

It is through the conversational mechanisms described above that participants
confirm that they will enter into a sustained interaction, (re)constitute a
relationship, and eventually move into addressing the primary business of the call
(often introduced in the “anchor position”, i.e., immediately following the
openings; see Schegloff, 1986, p. 116). While openings have been found to hold
important differences across institutional settings (e.g., Whalen & Zimmerman,
1987; Robinson, 1999), the core mechanisms of ordinary conversation represent
a foundation upon which institutional interaction is communicatively realized and
managed (Schegloff, 1986). In the case of HelpNow, as I discuss later, it is
through these same conversational mechanisms that callers and call takers
display their expectations about being recognized.

74
In telephone conversation, participants’ lack of visual access means they
must closely rely on specific interactional resources to deal with
identification/recognition issues in the openings (Schegloff, 1979). The third turn
of these openings – the caller’s first speaking turn - has been found to be a key
sequential location for identification/recognition work. This turn occurs after the
called party has already delivered a response to the summons (i.e., the phone
ring) and thus provided a voice sample for the caller to inspect for recognition. As
a result, the caller’s first turn is often the first opportunity for him/her to embody a
claim to have recognized the called party simply based on their response to the
summons. Some of the turn components that may occupy this sequential position
to claim recognition include a greeting (e.g., “Hi”) or a greeting and address term
with terminal intonation (“Hi Tim.”). These actions then invite a reciprocal display
of recognition from the recipient.
Displays of recognition at these earliest opportunities in the opening
demonstrate how the interactional work of exchanging greetings and
identification/recognition can be accomplished in the course of a single sequence
(i.e., without the need for a distinct sequence to be produced for the latter task).
In the following extracts taken from telephone conversations, the participants
jointly work through several opening sequences. Of particular significance for the
current chapter is the way in which the calling and answering parties manage the
work of identification/recognition:

Hello Charles.

Yolk:

06

Charles:

Oh hello Yolk

In both of these cases, through the basic machinery of openings, the participants
display their expectations for other recognition over self identification. Both
instances include a summons – answer sequence (lines 01 – 02), with the phone
ringing being answered by the call recipient with “Hello?”. Then,
recognition/identification matters get dealt with quite differently in each case.
In Extract 4.1, Hyla (the caller) produces the first greeting in line 03, which
is met with a reciprocated greeting characterized with downward intonation from
Nancy (the called party) in line 04. In this brief sequence, both participants use
the basic conversational mechanisms of greeting sequences to display
embedded recognition of one another’s identities (with no names presented) and

76
a type of familiarity that comes with having a prior relationship. Following this in
line 05, Hyla initiates a general-state inquiry sequence (“Hwaryuhh=”), which is
met with a corresponding responding action from Nancy in line 06 (“Fine”) and
then the reciprocation of the inquiry, now addressed to Hyla (lines 06 – 08). On
the whole, this case demonstrates how participants can achieve embedded
mutual displays of recognition through some of the routine practices of
conversational openings.
Extract 4.2 depicts an opening that unfolds quite differently in terms of
identification/recognition work. After Charles has produced an answer to the
summons (thus providing a voice sample for his recipient) in line 02, Yolk
produces a greeting and Charles’ first name. This turn simultaneously displays
his recognition of the called party and, in doing so, provides a voice sample for
Charles to provide reciprocal recognition. However, a gap (0.2) indicates a
possible problem with Charles reciprocating such a display and is followed by
self-identification from Yolk (line 05). In short, this case shows how, using the
practices of conversational openings, one party can display recognition of their
recipient while simultaneously conveying an expectation for them to do the same
(which in this case, proves to be unsuccessful on Yolk’s part).
These two cases both depict some of the core conversational
mechanisms through which participants co-construct the beginning of a
conversation. The routine tasks of identification/recognition may depend on
specific interactional resources (address terms, voice samples) and prior
familiarity with one another’s voices. In turn, the way in which such sequences

77
unfold may have consequences for the encounter that ensues (Schegloff, 1979).
In HelpNow calls, as I discuss in the remainder of the chapter, it is these same
conversational mechanisms that form the basis through which, if it is relevant, a
prior institutional relationship may be renewed and renegotiated between callers
and call takers.

Institutional openings on help lines
Several key studies on help lines have discussed the relationship between
the institutional agenda of a help line and the communication that occurs
between its callers and call takers. More specifically, these studies have
documented how a help line’s institutional goals can shape the way in which the
call openings may unfold. This includes some of the routine tasks that
institutional members may need to accomplish early on in the call, such as
providing a space for the caller to introduce their reason for calling, displaying
what they already know about a caller after they were transferred, displaying
what they remember about prior interactions with a caller, or preserving callers’
anonymity. In each case, the institutional character of the help line can shape
how callers and call takers coordinate the first few moments of their call together.
Classic work by Whalen and Zimmerman (1987) investigated the
specialization and reduction of ordinary conversational practices during openings
on 911 help lines. In light of the task-oriented and impersonal character of these
calls, the greeting and how are you sequences typical of ordinary telephone calls
were found to be absent generally. These omissions, they argue, indicate call

78
takers’ (as well as callers’) orientations to the instrumental character of the
interaction. This early help line research was innovative in that it systematically
documented how the basic mechanisms of conversation openings could be
adapted to fit particular institutional roles and needs (such as for 911
emergencies).
Research on cancer help lines by Leydon, Ekberg, and Drew (2013)
examined the role of institutional goals in the ways callers and call takers
negotiate alignment during call openings. More specifically, they focused on
openings where front line call takers must answer calls and then transfer them to
a specialist nurse. In the cases where the specialist nurse began their interaction
by displaying what he/she already knew about the caller’s health (via the front
line call taker), they found that callers would straightforwardly proceed to engage
in a telling regarding their reason for calling. However, in cases where the
specialist nurse did not present what he/she were already told (by the front line
call takers) in the opening of their interaction (i.e., after being transferred), the
callers struggled with how to proceed with their telling while also managing the
normative pressure not to tell the nurse what s/he already knew (cf. Sacks, 1992:
Vol. 2, p. 438). In short, this study highlights some of the ways in which
institutional goals and protocols may shape how call takers go about negotiating
an effective call opening to facilitate the call’s smooth progression towards help
provision.
Another help line study by Shaw and Kitzinger (2007) examined how
institutional goals can shape how personal memory becomes an institutionally-

79
relevant and interactionally-managed resource. In focusing on call openings
involving a single call taker at a home birth line, they describe several
conversational methods through which both callers and call taker managed a
recognition-solicit sequence. These sequences involve the caller prompting the
call taker to remember their previous interaction(s). One set of practices they
analyze is related to the turn formats callers use when disclosing their first
names. The turn formats used by some callers (e.g., “My name’s Dennis”) claim
little in terms of prior history with the call taker or institution, while turn formats
used by those who have called before (e.g., “This is Galina” or “It’s Galina”) enact
a claim to recognizeability. These authors’ findings regarding the interactional
management of memory are also pertinent to the current study of crisis help
lines. Callers and call takers may talk on more than one occasion (i.e., phone
call), thus leading to a range of interactional considerations that may include
displaying recognition of their recipient and/or remembering specific details of
prior interactions.
A final study regarding openings and institutional goals is Danby, Baker,
and Emmison’s (2005) work regarding identification and anonymity. Drawing
upon calls to an Australian children’s help line, they found the format of call
takers’ initial turns to include both a response to a summons and standard
institutional identification (“Hi there Kids Helpline”). In not including any type of
personal identification (e.g., “My name is Kelly”) or direct problem solicitation
(e.g., “how can I help you?”), this format enacts a less constraining type of
“sequential implicativeness” (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973) for the recipient. Thus,

80
the design of this element of the opening upholds a sense of anonymity (i.e., with
there being no implied obligation for the caller to reciprocate with their own name,
cf. Sacks 1992: Vol 1, p. 4) and does not presume the caller is in need of “help”.
While this and other help lines (including HelpNow) may share a similar policy of
preserving anonymity, it must be pointed out that even in such circumstances
callers may choose to conduct themselves in ways that either follow this policy
(e.g., by providing a nick-name or a fake name) or reject it altogether (i.e.,
providing their full legal name to the call taker). This will have important
consequences for the later analysis of how callers and call takers go about
exchanging names in the opening of the call.
To summarize, the studies reviewed here provide insight into how
openings may unfold on a variety of different help lines. More specifically, their
findings show how a help line’s institutional goals can shape (and be shaped by)
the way in which the beginning of the call unfolds. Most of the themes spanning
these studies will emerge again in the analysis portion of this chapter. In the next
section, I lay out some components of callers’ and call takers’ first turns.

Call openings at HelpNow
The openings of calls made to HelpNow are a useful place to begin to see
how the conduct of callers and call takers shapes (and is shaped by) the
institutional context starting in the first moments of the call. While the call taker’s
first speaking turn typically follows a uniform format, the caller’s initial speaking
turn may include turn-design elements that pre-characterize the urgency of the

81
call, provide his/her name (or preserve his/her strict anonymity), and more
generally, present him/herself as someone who has called HelpNow before or
who is calling for the first time. In what follows, I describe the components of call
takers’ and callers’ first speaking turns.

Call takers’ first turn
Like many other help lines (e.g., Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987), the
institutional member who answers the phone displays their institutional affiliation
in their very first turn. Extract 4.3 illustrates the structure of the call taker’s initial
turn of the call opening:
Extract 4.3: Crisis_#059_0354
001

CT:

003

Hello.

[Response to Summons37]

(.)
CT:

This is HelpNow

[Institutional Identification]

This extract depicts the typical two-component design of the call takers’ initial
turn. In line 001, the call taker produces an “answer” to the summons constituted
by the telephone’s ring (Schegloff 1968, 1986). After a gap (line 002), the call
taker provides an institutional identification, “This is HelpNow”, stating the name
of the institution the caller has reached, which makes it possible for the caller to
ascertain whether s/he had dialed the right place.

37

As discussed in Chapter 2, HelpNow administrators employed a system for recording
that consisted of an automated audio message that played after the call taker answered
the phone and before the call taker produces a response to the summons. In light of this,
there is roughly ten-second gap (i.e., while the automated message is playing) between
when the phone ringing ceases and when the call taker produces their initial speaking
turn (in this case, line 001).

82
Although rare, a portion of the calls that were examined for this study
included a variation of this initial turn format. In addition to the response to the
summons and institutional identification, this alternative turn design includes a
solicitation question, ”Can I help you?”, which more explicitly frames the
interaction as one between a help provider and a help seeker:
Extract 4.4: #042_0274
001
002

CT:

Hello: this is HelpNow.
Can I help you?

In line 001, the call taker produces a greeting and institutional identification as a
compound turn. This is followed by a problem/request solicitation in line 002
(“Can I help you?”). Research on consumer-oriented help lines has documented
a similar practice in a call taker’s opening turn. For instance, Baker, Emmison,
and Firth’s (2001) research on computer support help lines documented
practices such as “How can I help you?” or “What can I do for you this morning?”,
which presume that the caller is in need of some type of assistance. It is
important to note the difference in sequential implicativeness in this design as
compared to the aforementioned, more typical format (simply “Hello this is
HelpNow”, without any problem solicitation).
Here the action format creates a constraint for what can be produced as
the conditionally relevant next action (a reason for calling). A possible
interactional consequence of such a turn could be truncated openings since the
caller’s problem is solicited prior to the occurrence of other possibly canonical
opening sequences (e.g. greeting sequence, “how are you” sequence). While the
presumption of “needing help” might indeed hold for many of HelpNow’s callers,

83
the use of this practice is generally discouraged in an effort to allow the callers
themselves to define the terms of the call (also known as a “non-directive”
approach, see Chapter 3).

Callers’ first turn
While the call taker’s initial turn design (and its underlying institutional
logic) is important, it is perhaps more interesting analytically to examine how
callers respond to this opening move. For even if a practice is implemented
across all calls to HelpNow, its callers may still opt to either produce an aligning
course of action or initiate a different, divergent course of action (though the latter
would be highly marked and not constitute an “equal” alternative). This sequential
position, the caller’s initial turn, is a crucial one for both callers and call takers as
they begin to jointly construct the type of call that is being entered into. It is
possible that, from this initial turn, the call taker may get a sense of whether the
call will consist of, for instance, a situation requiring emergency intervention, a
conversation with an emotionally distraught caller, or an interaction with a caller
who “just wants to talk””.
The following pair of cases (Extract 4.5 and Extract 4.6) illustrates some of
the mundane ways in which callers may present themselves as different types of
callers. Each case begins in a similar fashion with the call taker producing an
answer to the summons (phone ring) and then an institutional identification (“This
is HelpNow”). It is after this point, however, where the callers take their first turns,
that the two calls begin to diverge from one another:

006

CT: Hi Samantha. This is Gina.

007

CL:

008

yo:u.(...)

In Extract 4.5, in line 03, the caller produces a turn that includes a formulation of
a projected activity (“I would like to talk”) along with the minimization ‘just’ prior to
“a little while” and “like to talk”. This construction works to present the caller’s
business as non-urgent (i.e., not suggesting one is at imminent risk for selfharm). Additionally, the caller’s turn in lines 003 and 004 makes available a precharacterization of the caller’s reason for calling (see Chapter 5). In line 005, the
call taker responds by granting the caller’s request to proceed with the call.
Extract 4.6, in contrast, depicts a caller who presents herself quite
differently. In line 004, the caller uses her initial turn to first identity herself by

85
name (“This is Samantha”) and immediately moves to inquire about her
interlocutor’s identity (“Who’s this”), indicating she does not recognize the call
taker. In line 006, the call taker then produces a greeting (incorporating the
caller’s name) and then provides a reciprocal identification (and fitted-next action
with regard to her prior inquiry) with “This is Gina”. The caller suggests she may
have initially recognized the call taker’s voice (“I had a feeling it was you”),
thereby demonstrating her knowledge of particular call takers, such as Gina.
In the subsequent sections of the analysis, I focus on three types of
interactional identities that emerge through the opening phase of the calls in the
collection: First-time callers, regular callers, and return callers. I do not consider
the factual veracity of these categories (i.e., determining whether or not a given
first-time caller has in fact never called before by examining call records) but
instead focus on the interactional practices through which each party constructs
a “presentation of self” (Goffman, 1959) that is either taken up or challenged by
their interlocutor.
It is important to mention that each of these identity categories is important
from an institutional point of view in addition to a scholarly one. My observations
as a HelpNow call taker indicate that these identity categories are commonly
invoked during crisis-center trainings as a way of socializing new call takers into
procedures for dealing with different types of callers (and the possible risk-related
implications of each). A further way these identities are made meaningful for the
institutional members is via regular center management meetings. At these

86
meetings, it is common for administrators to discuss details of notable recent
calls - including their status as new or regular callers.
Lastly, equivalent labels for each of these three identity categories are
encoded within a drop-down menu in the call-report software that call takers must
complete after each call (see Chapter 3). What this amounts to for a call taker
when they go to complete the call report is that they must (among many other onscreen fields) categorize the caller as being one of several different types of
callers who tend to use the service. These labels include “hang up” (when the
caller hangs up upon the call being answered), “silent caller” (when the caller is
on the line but does not say anything), and three labels that roughly align with the
categories to be presented in the subsequent analyses (first-time caller, return
caller, and regular caller).38 In the sections that follow, I give an overview of the
sets of practices callers used to present themselves as particular types of callers
as well as their interactional consequences for how call takers go about
managing the call.

Presenting oneself as a first-time caller
Some callers may be dialing up HelpNow for the very first time. Although it
is almost impossible to know on a “factual” level whether or not any caller had
truly never called before (at least, without looking at actual call records), we can
look at how callers display an orientation towards the institution in the very first
moments of the call for insight into this issue. The caller practices discussed here
38

See the Figures in Chapter 3 for screen shots of select portions of the call report
interface.

87
also provide call takers with an initial sense of the type of call both parties have
just entered into (e.g., the degree of urgency). Two practices will be presented
from a sub-collection of 25 calls where callers present themselves as first-time
callers39: First, a practice for disclosing one’s name that displays no assumption
of recognition; and second, a pre-characterization turn that makes available to
the call taker an initial characterization of the caller’s reason for calling.

Practice #1 – Formulation of caller-initiated personal identification
A cornerstone of the HelpNow help line, like many other crisis lines
(Lester, 1977), is the expectation of caller anonymity. In light of this, it is rare for
call takers to ask for a caller’s name (there are exceptions which I discuss later
on). At the same time, callers themselves may choose to initiate a disclosure of
names in the opening through a name-disclosure formulation. When callers do
provide names, typically only a first name is given (thus preserving some veil of
anonymity).40 Aside from these general considerations, the particular practice
examined here involves callers disclosing their name using a particular type of
formulation (e.g., My name is X) that presumes no recognition from the call taker
(Shaw & Kitzinger, 2007).

39

Note: The total cases from each of the three identity-related sub-collections analyzed
in this chapter does not equal 115 (the total number of calls in the data set) because
some calls did not neatly fit into one of the categories.
40
Although crisis services are typically advertised as being anonymous, it is common
practice for caller ID technology to be available in most call centers. Whether or not
callers have any awareness that their phone number (and often the head of household’s
name) is accessible to the call taker is difficult to discern.

88
Extract 4.7 below illustrates how (and where) a caller may initiate this
action within the opening phase of the call:

Oka:y,

This excerpt shows how a caller begins a call by offering his name (unsolicited by
the call taker) in a way that presents him as a first-time caller. Starting in line 004,
latched onto the call taker’s institutional identification, caller begins and
abandons a turn (“Ye-“) before producing a greeting (“Hi”). After a gap in 005
(where the caller may also produce identification, begin the reason for calling, or
defer to the call taker’s possible solicitation of a reason for calling), the caller
proceeds to provide his first name (“My name’s Dennis”) using a format which
suggests he presumes no recognizability on part of the call taker and may be
calling the line for the first time (Shaw & Kitzinger, 2007). Thus, in using this
personal identification form, the caller enacts an interactional identity as a firsttime caller.

89
In the next instance, Extract 4.8, a caller’s personal identification
occasions a similar self-identification from the call taker:

007

CT:  Hi Andrew. Okay:h. My name is Kate.

008
009

(0.4)
CL:

Hi Kate.

In line 005, the caller produces a greeting (after a self-repair) and, in the same
unit, produces his personal identification that does not claim recognizeability (“my
name is Andrew”). He also adds a formulation that characterizes his reason for
calling (“I just wanted to talk for a lil’ bit”). Later, in the final unit of the call taker’s
turn (line 007), the call taker treats the caller’s self-identification as making a
reciprocal move relevant by disclosing her own name (“My name is Kate”). This
case provides an illustration of how a proffer of a name by a caller can engender
a reciprocal proffer by the call taker. In this way, both parties move to the next
portion of the call having constructed a more “personalized” climate through the
exchange of first names.
The next instance, Extract 4.9, illustrates a similar sequential environment
in which personal names are reciprocated:

007

CT:

Hi Matt this is Gina.

This extract shows another case of personal names being reciprocally
exchanged. After exchanging greetings (lines 005 and 007), the caller produces
a personal identification that does not claim recognizeability (“My name’s Ma:tt”).
This format thus constructs the caller as a first-time caller. After a gap (line 010),
the call taker again redoes her greeting, though this time incorporating the
caller’s name (“Hi Matt”) and incorporating her own name (“this is Gina”). Here
the caller is shown to provide her name in a post-greeting position.
Other calls in the collection feature callers who do not volunteer their
names. While securing the caller’s first name is not a required task for call takers,
call takers may display an orientation towards pursuing it for a variety of reasons.
For instance, securing a name allows the call taker to use it to address the caller
more explicitly throughout the call (e.g., “That sounds really difficult to deal with,

91
Jim”41), to create a more personalized call environment for the caller, as well as
to enter further information into HelpNow’s call log software. In any case, this
particular practice through which some callers disclose their name can be linked
to the first-time caller identity category.

Practice #2: Pre-characterizing a reason for calling
A second practice used to enact a first-time caller identity in openings is a
pre-characterization of the caller’s reason for calling HelpNow (which I analyze in
Chapter 5). A pre-characterization projects a larger multi-unit telling and makes
relevant a go-ahead response from the call taker (e.g., “Sure”) to forward the
larger multi-unit telling that is projected (Schegloff, 2007). In addition, as I show
below, the action enacts the caller’s uncertainty as to whether their reason for
calling fits within the scope of HelpNow’s institutional mission. As a result, the
caller’s use of this practice enacts the identity of someone who has never called
before and does not possess adequate knowledge of the institution.
In Extract 4.10 below, the caller utilizes a pre-characterization that makes
available minimal information about his projected reason for calling:

interviews as a way of doing “speaking from the heart” (p. 173 – 179).

92
005

CT:

Alright,

While I will return to this case to discuss how callers present their crises or
problems (see Chapter 5), the pre-characterization is analyzed here strictly in
terms of what it accomplishes the call opening. In lines 003 – 004, the caller’s
pre-characterization is designed with the minimization ‘just’ and the temporal
construction ‘a little while’, alluding to a certain type of reason for dialing the line
that is non-urgent in nature (e.g., not suggesting one is at imminent risk for selfharm).
In addition, the caller’s use of the verb ‘to talk’ explicitly identifies a type of
activity that they are requesting to proceed with. Raymond (2013) has described
this type of action format as explicit action formulation since the very composition
of the action includes a word that is typically used to refer to that class of action
(e.g. “I would like to request something”). In his analysis, this type of action
format displays the speaker’s lack of entitlement to do the projected action.
Callers who utilize this format, then, may be enacting a lack of entitlement to
what may become the focal activity of the call. By enacting a lack of entitlement
via this explicit action formulation format, the caller displays a lack of institutional
knowledge as to whether the projected matters are appropriately fitted to the
institutional mission of the help line.
As a part of this particular caller’s broader pre-characterization, no specific
troubles or topics have been nominated to serve as the focus of the interaction
that will constitute the basis for the call. In line 005, in response to the precharacterization, the call taker’s granting (“Alright”) affords the caller the
opportunity to continue with the projected activity (“to talk”).

93
In short, Extract 4.10 shows how the work of presenting one’s reason for
calling may be initially launched as part of a larger course of action that projects
an expanded sequence. The caller first launches a pre-characterization
(including an explicit action formulation) that makes available minimal information
about why he called the line (in terms of a larger desired activity, “to talk”). In
treating this action as making relevant a go-ahead response (“Alright”), the call
taker invites the caller to proceed with the more specific troubles he wishes to
present in the call.
Callers’ use of an explicit action formulation may also vary in terms of how
they display an orientation to various known or anticipated contingencies. Curl
and Drew (2008) examine how request formats may indicate attentiveness to two
core assumptions: first, the degree to which the speaker finds themselves to be
entitled to produce the request (or to the thing being requested); and second, the
contingencies associated with the recipient’s ability to fulfill the request.
Extract 4.11 shows another instance of a caller’s pre-characterization that
incorporates an explicit action formulation with low-entitlement design features:

(0.2)
CT:

Okay. What’s going on,

In line 005, the caller redoes her greeting and (after a gap) produces an explicit
action formulation (“I was hopin’ to talk with someone”). This action articulates
the type of activity that is projected to follow (“talk”) and a non-specific reference
to the desired recipient (“someone”).
While the caller’s explicit action formulation (“talk”) suggests a
characterization of the call as more informal and non-urgent, the use of the
construction “I was hoping” suggests a lack of entitlement to the action. Next,
after a gap (line 009), the call taker gives a go ahead (“Okay”) and issues a topic
proffer (“What’s going on”) that demonstrates some orientation to what the caller
projected to follow (“talk with someone”). In short, this case shows a how the
design of a caller’s pre-characterization can display an orientation to the possible
contingencies involved in the call taker’s ability to take the call. Furthermore, it
provides further evidence for how callers may display uncertainty about the
institution and thus enact a first-time caller identity.
Yet callers may also produce pre-characterizations in ways that are more
entitled. In Extract 4.12, the caller deploys a pre-characterization with highentitlement design (yet without proceeding directly to their focal problem
presentation):
Extract 4.12 - [108_0582]

009

CL:

Yeah:. My life is (

). And I-

everything I’ve done to fix it isn’t

This case shows a caller initiating a pre-characterization in a high-entitlement
format. In line 04, the caller begins with a greeting (“Hi”) and then produces a
pre-characterization (“I wanna talk to somebody”). The latter action is designed
with an explicit action formulation (“talk”), a display of high entitlement (the form ‘I
want to’), and specifies a general recipient (“somebody”). While it is possible to
view this pre-characterization less indicative of a caller with no knowledge of the
institution, it might still suggest a first-time caller identity given that the caller
chose to pre-announce their reason for calling this way rather than introduce it
right away.
After a gap (line 005), the call taker produces a reciprocal greeting and
then a granting response designed with declarative syntax (“You can talk…”).
This latter action identifies the call taker as a recipient capable of assisting the
caller. In lines 006-007, the call taker also produces a personal identification

96
(“This is Sarah”)42. It is possible that this action orients to the uncertainty (and
perhaps impersonal character) that is reflected in the caller’s nomination of
“somebody” as a possible recipient. In this way, the call taker works to construct
a more personable and comfortable call atmosphere for the caller early on in the
call.
These two practices, caller-initiated personal identifications (in the “My
name is X” format) and pre-characterizations of their reason for calling), were
found to be regular ways in which callers enact the first-time caller identity
category. With the first practice, caller-initiated personal identification, the caller
discloses their name in a way that displays no assumption of recognizability. The
second practice, pre-characterizations, involves the caller presenting an initial
characterization of their reason for the call and thus the kind of call that is about
to be entered into. The deisgn of their pre-characterization displays callers are
displaying uncertainty about whether they can proceed with their desired activity.
In the next section, I shift the focus to practices for enacting a regular-caller
identity.

Presenting oneself as a regular caller
HelpNow’s call takers go through a comprehensive help line training to be
prepared for a variety of different callers, crises, and risk-related circumstances.
Although these individuals must be prepared for callers who may be highly
distressed (and possibly require intervention by police and psychiatric
42

It is also possible that this turn suggests possible recognition (i.e., the call taker
displaying recognition of the caller).

97
professionals), they are also trained to deal with many moderate and low risk
circumstances. In particular, a subset of low-risk calls come from individuals who
call the line on a regular basis. Many of these callers suffer from serious mental
illness or other chronic health problems. As new call takers are taught during the
training, HelpNow (and possibly other help lines) serve as their “anchor” in a life
where much is uncertain (see further discussion in Chapters 2 and 3 regarding
what scholars have termed as “chronic callers”).
While the prior section focused primarily on the practices used by callers,
this section will focus on broader practices that require callers and call takers to
jointly construct (and validate) a regular caller identity. Two discursive practices
have been observed across a collection of 46 calls43 involving callers who
present themselves as regular callers. These practices are as follows: First,
regular calls may utilize a particular format where they provide their first name in
a way that embodies a claim to their identity being a recognizable one (e.g., This
is X); second, call takers may initiate “how are you” sequences in a manner that
claims recognition of regular callers. These two practices demonstrate how both
callers and call takers incrementally negotiate who they are to one another and, if
appropriate, potentially arrive at a more “personalized” help line experience.

Note: The total cases from each of the three identity-related sub-collections analyzed
in this chapter does not equal 115 (the total number of calls in the data set) because
some calls did not neatly fit into one of the categories,

98
Practice #1 – Format of personal introduction (and inviting recognition displays)
One of the first ways in which callers may present themselves as regular
callers is the manner in which they announce their identities at the earliest point
in the call opening. While callers who present themselves as first-time callers
may also offer their name in this position (the caller’s initial turn), those who
present themselves as regular callers utilize a particular name-disclosure
formulation which presumes recognizability (Shaw & Kitzinger, 2007). This type
of action format implicates both the memory of the call taker on the call as well as
the larger institutional memory of HelpNow (in some cases, regardless of which
call taker ends up answering the call). In using this format, the caller makes
relevant a display of recognition by the call taker in the next position (Baker,
Emmison, & Firth, 2001; Schegloff, 1979, 1986). For example, in Extract 4.13,
the caller uses her first turn to establish a regular-caller identity using this type of
name-disclosure formulation:
Extract 4.13 - [015_0169]

CT:

Oh sorry this is Gina.

This instance features a caller who formulates her personal identification in a way
that presumes her recipient should recognize her simply based on her first name.
In line 004, the caller produces a personal identification (in terminal overlap with
the call taker’s turn) with “it’s Jessica”, an utterance format that presumes
recognizability and thus presents herself as someone who has called before (and
who call taker may recognize by name).
Next, the call taker produces a greeting (“Hi:”) which is characterized with
prosodic stress and hearable as embodying a claim of recognition. After a halfsecond gap in line 007 (where a reciprocal greeting is relevant from the caller),
both parties simultaneously take the floor in lines 008 and 009. As the call taker
begins (and then abandons) a reciprocal personal identification (line 008), the
caller launches what could be the beginning of her reason for calling (line 009).
Later on in line 15, the caller asks “Yeah who is this” suggesting that even
though she presents herself as a regular caller (and the call taker would seem to
recognize the caller), she does not recognize the identity of her call taker. This
provides some support for how the epistemic asymmetry may play out in call
openings. In this case, the call taker recognizes the caller (and the caller having
presumed that to be possible), yet the converse is not reciprocated as the caller

100
shows they do not recognize their interlocutor in the same way. More generally
though, this case shows that caller can use the name-disclosure format,
proposing a regular-caller identity, and the call taker then validates this identity
by claiming recognition of the caller.
In the next case, Extract 4.14, the call taker does extra interactional work
to treat the caller’s name-disclosure formulation (and identity) as a familiar one:
Extract 4.14 - [089_0475]

(0.2)

CL:

012

013

day today an (.)

After the call taker’s initial turn, the caller responds with her own greeting (“Hi::.”).
In the same turn, the caller produces a self-identification that features tri-marked
intonation (“This is Samantha?,”), exhibiting some expectation to be recognized
by the call taker. The call taker’s uptake (line 004) is produced immediately after
the caller’s turn and also incorporates the caller’s name (“Samantha”). This turn

101
by the call taker enacts a strong claim of recognition of the caller’s identity, thus
aligning with the caller’s presumption of her own identity being a recognizable
one. Both Extract 4.13 and Extract 4.14 feature a formulation of the caller’s selfidentification that presumes some recognition; yet the latter case exhibits the call
taker as performing further interactional work (i.e., using the caller’s name) in
claiming alignment with the caller’s embedded presumption (i.e., that their
identity, as a “regular”, is a recognizable one).
Some regular callers may produce a personal identification in a way that
downplays its status as a focal action. In Extract 4.15, the call taker orients to a
unit of talk other than the personal identification as a more actionable move
(Note: unfortunately, the first few seconds of this call are missing):
Extract 4.15 - [019_0191]
001

((the CT’s initial turn is missing from the recording))

002

CL: (Yeah) it’s Jessica. I’m not

003

goin to the therapist no more.

004

(0.2)

005
006

CT:  You’re not going to the therapist
anymore?

In line 002, after the call taker presumably produces an answer to the summons
and an institutional identification (positioned here as line 001), the caller
acknowledges the prior move (“Yeah”), presumably to confirm HelpNow to be the
institution she intended to contact. In the same turn, she produces a personal
identification formulated to presume recognizability (“it’s Jessica”) and then
continues with a report regarding her therapist.

102
After a gap (line 004), the call taker treats the caller’s report as the
actionable component of her turn (presumably her reason for calling) and attends
to it by producing a full repetition of the report in lines 005 – 006 (“You’re not
going to the therapist anymore?”, cf. Chapter 6 on repetition-based turns). This
case illustrates a different sequential environment in which the caller can
implement a personal identification (in this case, one in which it is adjacent to a
presenting problem). This also has consequences for call takers as they need not
treat the caller’s personal identification as a bid for recognition but as secondary
to another more actionable unit within their initial turn.

Practice #2 – ‘How are you’ inquiries and displays of recognition
The prior section focused on a practice that callers may use to disclose
their names and indicate that they take themselves to be recognizable to the call
taker, thereby presenting themselves as a “regular”. A further way in which a
more personalized call can be constructed in call openings is through the
deployment of “how are you” sequences (e.g., Schegloff, 1979, 1986). For
regular callers and call takers alike, this practice is utilized to (re)establish a
relationship (i.e. following earlier interactions) and, more generally, renew a
sense of rapport with the caller leading into the body of the call. In this way, “how
are you” sequences are a resource for constructing a more personalized call with
regular callers despite the more impersonal, institutional circumstances of their
interaction.

103
In Extract 4.16, the call taker deploys a “how are you” to further enact her
recognition of the caller:
Extract 4.16 - [041_0273]
001

CT:

Hello: this is HelpNow.=Can

002

I help you?

003

004

CL: Yeah it’s Jessica.

005

CT: OH HI: Jessica.=How ya doin. This

006

is Karen.

007

(0.4)

008

CT:

(Heh) lousy.

In line 004, the caller produces an acknowledgement token (possibly orienting to
the call taker’s problem solicitation or confirming the institutional identification
before it) as well as a name disclosure formulation that presumes (“It’s Jessica”).
Next, in line 005, the call taker uses an “Oh” preface, suggesting a sudden
realization (Heritage, 1984b), and then a greeting, both of which are produced
with increased volume. The call taker then addresses the caller by name at the
end of the unit before rushing through to initiate a “how are you” sequence (with
the informal construction “How ya doin”) and a reciprocal personal identification
(“This is Karen”). Each of these turn-design features bolsters the call taker’s
claim to recognize who the caller is (as well as strong affiliation by initiating an
immediate “how are you” sequence after redoing their greeting incorporating the
caller’s name). All in all, this case demonstrates how the “how are you” sequence
may accomplish a more “personalized” opening to the interaction.

104
In Extract 4.17, the call taker utilizes a “how are you” to enact their claim
of the caller being a regular:
Extract 4.17 - [003_0090]
001

CT:

002
003

Hello.
(.)

CT:

004

This is HelpNow.
(0.4)

005

CL: Hi::. This is Ta:sha.

006

CT: Hi. Good morning Tasha. How are
 you today,

007
008

CL:

Okay. (...)

In line 005, the caller produces her own greeting (with stretched production) and
a personal identification (formulated to presume recognition). In lines 006 - 007,
the call taker redoes her greeting (“Good morning”) in a more personalized
fashion that incorporates the caller’s first name. The final unit of the call taker’s
turn consists of a “how are you” query and is formulated to include the indexical
formulation “today”. This “how are you” formulation targets the caller’s state on
this particular day (as opposed to a longer period of time) and as a result,
conveys a sense of having access to some of the caller’s past circumstances
from earlier interactions. In this way, the inclusion of “today” implicates the
recipient as someone the call taker has spoken to before (potentially even on a
regular basis) and invites the caller to produce an “update” (regarding their well
being, ongoing problems, etc. – see further discussion of updating in Chapter 5).
In sum, this call taker presents herself as someone who, regardless of whether
the caller shows they remember, has spoken to her in earlier calls to HelpNow.

105
The issue of displaying recognition may at times pose certain challenges
for call takers. While a regular caller may remember his/her interactions with a
call taker (and, possibly, only that call taker, cf. Shaw & Kitzinger, 2007), call
takers may struggle with remembering the personal circumstances (and voices)
of hundreds of callers. This suggests a type of what Drew & Heritage (1992) refer
to as “institutional asymmetry” in that the two parties (the professional and the lay
person) have differential access to particular domains of knowledge. This issue is
especially relevant in Extract 4.18, where the call taker struggles to place the
voice of an individual who presents herself as a regular caller:
Extract 4.18 - [009_0119]

CL:

[(

In line 001, call taker produces an answer to the summons and institutional
identification. After a 1.5 second gap (line 002) that projects a problem on the
caller’s end, the call taker redoes her summons answer with final rising intonation
(line 3), presumably to check to see if anyone is on the other end of the line. Just
after she begins this utterance, the caller produces a greeting along with a first
name that displays her recognition of the call taker (“Hi Dina:.”, with falling
intonation that conveys greater epistemic certainty).
This turn by the caller suggests that she has spoken with the call taker
before and, moreover, that they have spoken enough for the caller to recognize
her simply based on the sound of her voice. After a gap (line 005), the call taker
issues a reciprocal greeting with prosodic stress, thereby enacting a claim of
recognition yet without displaying it (e.g. the call taker saying the caller’s name).
The absence of such a display may suggest that the call taker has encountered
some trouble in identifying the caller’s identity (and/or remembering her name)

107
based on the sound of her voice alone (and the conversational evidence that
they have spoken previously).
After a gap in line 007 (where self-identification by the caller is relevant),
the call taker takes the floor and apologizes for her transgression (“I’m sorry”).
Continuing in lines 008 - 009, she begins to ask for the caller’s identity (which
she then abandons) and then produces an account. This action begins with “I
don’t” which is then restarted and reformulated with “I sort of don’t”, with the latter
formulation making her claim more tentative.
In lines 010 – 011, she goes on to account for failing to recognize the
caller by citing technical difficulties with the telephone line.44 The call taker begins
to produce “That’s alright” in terminal overlap with CL’s turn, accepting her
apology. The call taker then initiates repair (“Pardon”), presumably targeting the
caller’s (uninterpretable) utterance from line 012. Simultaneous with this repair
initiation, the caller goes on to emphasize the extent of their relationship (“we go
back”) before providing her first name (“This is Carrie”). It is worth noting that this
name disclosure is formulated in a way that presumes recognizability (and thus
something the call taker should remember).
The call taker immediately provides a strong, affective response: An “Oh”
preface (Heritage, 1984b) suggesting a sudden realization, a prosodicallymarked greeting (formulated with her name, Carrie), and a final TCU that initiates
a “how are you” sequence. This latter action is characterized with a notable

44

Based on my participant observations as a call taker in the crisis center during this
particular call, it later became clear there in fact was no issue with the phone technology
at all.

108
prosodic emphasis on “are” that may be hearable as further displaying that she
recognizes the voice that goes with the provided name. A gap occurs in the next
position where a type-fitted response is relevant from the caller, thereby
projecting a problem.
In line 017, the call taker redoes her inquiry, this time with another strongly
affiliative stance (with stress on “doing”). Although the caller comes in in line 018
in terminal overlap with the last beat of the call taker’s production of “doing”, the
first discernable portion of the turn is not until 019 (after a gap) when she
provides a response to the “how are you” query (“I am good. Overall I’m good”).
In 021, the call taker takes the floor to receipt this response (in overlap with
caller’s repeat of “I am good”) with a series of sequence-closing assessments
(“I’m glad” and “I’m so glad”). Interactionally, in redoing her response with the
second assessment, the call taker can be heard as stressing her satisfaction in
hearing the caller’s positive report. Additionally, these actions work to embody
her affiliative stance towards the caller and the history they have shared together
(possibly in light of the recognitional troubles displayed earlier in the opening). In
other words, by producing an empathic positive assessment, the call taker shows
the caller that she does in fact remember her and thus can show greater affect in
response to her report that she is doing “good”.
This case offers additional insight into how “how are you” sequences may
be deployed and managed to invoke institutional identities and caller/call taker
relationships. This call taker demonstrated a difficulty in displaying her
recognition of the caller and subsequently accounted for it (i.e., blaming the

109
telephone line). Upon eventually being told the name of her recipient, the use of
a prosodically-marked greeting and “how are you” initiation worked to accomplish
relational work by renewing a more personalized relationship with the caller.
While “how are you” sequences may not be a regular feature in calls to HelpNow,
they are a key resource for how callers and call takers may construct (and
validate) a regular-caller identity and (re)establish a more personalized
institutional relationship at the beginning of the call.

Presenting oneself as a return caller
The two identity categories that have been discussed thus far are not the
only identity categories that emerged during analysis of HelpNow calls. As I have
shown so far, while first-time caller identities may be instantiated by displaying
minimal knowledge about the institution (e.g., how it typically operates, the
identities of its call takers, etc.), regular-caller identities may be enacted by
incorporating specific presumptions in their talk about what a call taker ought to
remember (i.e., the ability to identify the caller). A third identity category, the
return-caller identity, involve important differences from these two previously
discussed categories (first time and regular caller identities).
Callers may present themselves as return callers by incorporating
particular epistemic claims into their talk. Thus, based on the distinctive features
of each, these three identity categories can be positioned on an epistemic
gradient that depicts callers’ epistemic status with regard to the institution. More
specifically, this includes their knowledge about the institution’s mission,

110
protocols, and members (including familiarity with specific call takers and
presumptions about them holding personalized knowledge about the caller’s
circumstances). In broad terms, based on the prior analyses, the first-time caller
identity can be positioned as being low in these terms while the regular-caller
identity would be positioned as being high (see Figure A).

111

Figure A – Three identity categories as mapped on an epistemic gradient ranging from
low epistemic status with regard to the institution (first-time callers, left) to high epistemic
status with regard to the institution (regular callers, right).

The core practices that enact return caller identities convey that these
callers possess institutional knowledge regarding HelpNow, yet do not presume
personalized knowledge on part of its call takers (i.e., that call takers will
remember details about them and/or their personal circumstances). Callers who
present themselves as return-callers would seem to occupy a type of epistemic
middle ground between the (relatively) opposite epistemic poles of first-time
caller and regular-caller identities. Based on a third subset of calls, the analysis
suggests that those who present themselves as repeat callers can do so by
explicitly reporting having called HelpNow previously. However, at the same time,
these callers do not design their actions in call openings as presuming any
recognizeability on the part of call takers. Moreover, they do not display
recognition of the specific call takers who answer their calls. The return-caller
identity is a transitional category that, in terms of the epistemic gradient shown
above, lies somewhere between first time callers and regular callers. Thus,

112
callers who initially may present themselves as first-time callers in their first calls
to HelpNow may eventually adopt practices analyzed here as being associated
with the repeat caller identity or regular caller identity.
Two practices will be examined from a larger collection of 8 calls45 where
callers present themselves as return callers. The first practice involves callers
reporting that they have called the line before. Although this practice appears to
be primarily designed to account for the current call, it can also be shown to
accomplish the further interactional job of presenting the caller as a return caller.
The second practice related to the return caller identity consists of callers
referring to other call takers (i.e., not the one they are on the phone with) in a
way that does not presume the current call taker will recognize them. This
thereby suggests some uncertainty on the caller’s part about how the institution
operates.

Practice #1: Reporting having called previously
The first practice involves callers using the opening to explicitly report that
they have called HelpNow previously. At this point in the opening, some callers
may make available a possible account for the current call. In doing so, they
present themselves as someone who may hold greater epistemic access to the
institutional mission and procedures of the help line than those who may be

45

in this chapter does not equal 115 (the total number of calls in the data set) because
some calls did not neatly fit into one of the categories.

an orientation towards their status as someone who is not calling HelpNow for
the first time (i.e., not a first-time caller but a repeat caller). In line 003, the caller
produces a greeting and, after a gap in line 004, continues to produce a general
acknowledgement token (“yeah”) and a second greeting (“hi”).
In lines 005 and 006, the caller reports that he “called earlier”, presumably
to indicate he had dialed the help line earlier that day. In performing this action at
this location in the opening, the caller makes available a possible account for the
current call (e.g., it makes inferable that the current call may be following up after
the earlier call, or they were disconnected, etc.) and presents his problem as an
ongoing one. In addition to accomplishing this accounting work, the action makes
it available to the call taker that he is someone who has called the line before (a
return caller). With regard to epistemics, the caller’s use of this practice

114
embodies some institutional knowledge (i.e., in claiming to have called before)
while also not presuming personalized knowledge (i.e., no presumption that the
caller is recognizable to the call taker). Further examples of this practice will also
be shown in the analysis of the second practice below.

Practice #2: Using non-recognitional person reference forms to refer to other call
takers
A second practice callers may use to enact a return caller identity involves
specific lexical choices with regard to person reference. In particular, callers can
use non-recognitional reference forms when referring to another call taker they
had previously spoken to. Schegloff and Sacks (2007 [1979]) propose two
preferences in formulating person reference in English: recognition and
minimization. With regard to recognition, there is a preference that the form of
reference chosen by a speaker is one that will be recognized by the addressee.
An example of recognitional reference forms, or formulations that are designed
for recognition, are personal names (e.g., “James”) and specific descriptors (“the
woman from the store”). With regard to minimization, there is a preference for
choosing the most minimal form (e.g., the first name “Stephen” being preferred to
the lengthier “Stephen who teaches my night class“). Another way of describing
these two preferences is (a) do not give too little information than would be
required for understanding (“don’t under tell”) and (b) do not give too much
information than would be required for understanding (“don’t over tell”)(Enfield,
2013, p. 439; cf. Schegloff, 2007a).

115
In contrast to recognitionals, formulations that are not designed for
recognition (non-recognitionals) can take a variety of forms such as general
expressions (e.g., “a woman” or “someone”) or specific descriptors (“a woman
who lives around here”). In the English language, a default format informed by
these two preferences is ‘first name only’ (Enfield, 2013; cf. Stivers, 2007). This
typically leads to the use of personal names upon initial reference to a person in
interaction. However, this earlier research also suggests that any formulations
that depart from the most minimal form available are for “cause” and thus “doing
something special” (Schegloff & Sacks (2007 [1979).
In the HelpNow calls, these types of person-reference practices emerge in
the ways that callers presenting themselves as return callers refer to a call taker
they have spoken to in an earlier call (e.g., “A woman named Jan”). In using a
non-recognitional reference and non-minimal descriptor, the caller departs from
the preference for minimization to convey the presumption that the caller may not
know the referenced person (thus requiring a more complex description as part
of the reference). In terms of epistemics, this practice embodies some
institutional knowledge (i.e., in demonstrating to have called before and knowing
of another call taker) while also not presuming personalized knowledge (i.e.,
there is no presumption that the call taker will recognize the caller or the other
call taker).
Extract 4.20 shows this practice in action when a caller refers to another
call taker he had spoken to previously by means of a non-recognitional reference
formulation:

This extract shows how a reference form can embody an epistemic claim that
establishes a return-caller identity. In line 004, the caller takes their first turn to
produce a greeting followed by a report that does key identity work for this part of
the call. Several characteristics of this report construction warrant close attention.
In indicating she “called earlier”, the caller makes it clear she has been in touch
with HelpNow prior to this call.
Continuing in lines 005 – 006, the caller adds that she spoke to a
particular female call taker (“a woman”). She then produces a non-recognitional
reference form with “a woman named” as a preface to a personal name
(“Su:san::”). This particular reference form (as opposed to a recognitional and
minimal form like “Susan”), suggests that the call taker being referred to may not
be known by the addressee. Additionally, it embodies a claim to holding some
institutional knowledge (i.e., with having called before and knowing the name of

117
another call taker) while also potentially claiming to know more than their
recipient (i.e., “I know this call taker but you might not”).
In line 007 there is a half-second gap where the call taker could produce
uptake (for example, to claim recognition of the referenced call taker). In lines
008 – 010, the caller expands her account to include several more specific
details that link the prior call to the current one. In line 009, she references
having had a “bad day” and then indirectly quotes the prior call taker (Susan) as
having told her she could call back again later on. This case shows how the use
of a non-recognitional reference formulation (along with reporting one has called
in the past) can work to establish a caller as a return-caller, or someone who has
called the line before but not to the extent that they are a “regular” (which would
involve the display of greater institutional knowledge and the expectation of
personalized knowledge about their circumstances).
A second instantiation of this practice can be seen in extract 4.21 below.
Similar to prior case (extract 4.20), the caller uses a non-recognitional reference
formulation to present himself as someone who has called HelpNow in the past:

Here the caller uses a non-recognitional reference formulation on the way to
doing accounting work regarding her current call to the help line. In line 010, the
caller produces a greeting and, in the next TCU, requests a specific call taker by
using a recognitional reference form (“Ja:n”). In comparison to the rest of the
data (and my own observations as a help line practitioner), it appears to be
extremely rare for a caller to immediately request a call taker by name this early
in the opening. In using this format, it is ambiguous as to whether the caller
actually meant to call the help line (given the difficulties displayed in the first few
seconds of the call) or actually dialed the help line to specifically talk to a call
taker he had spoken with before. If the latter is the case, the caller would be
presenting himself as someone who has knowledge of other call takers at the
help line and thus has used the service before.

119
In line 011, the call taker produces the dispreferred type-conforming
response “no” (Raymond, 2003) and repeats the institutional identification she
initially presented earlier in the call (line 003). Based on this response (and the
insight that callers requesting particular call takers is a rare occurrence), the call
taker displays an understanding of the caller’s action as indicating a mismatch
with the institution (and thus not possessing knowledge about how the institution
typically works). This treats the caller as possibly having called the wrong
number (i.e., attempting to reach someone personally as opposed to an
institution like HelpNow). Following a gap (line 012), the caller’s produces a
repair initiator (“Pardon me?”). These two lines suggest the caller has
experienced some trouble in hearing or understanding the institutional
identification provided just prior (line 011). In the case of problems with
understanding, it would suggest the caller does not recognize the institution and
thus has dialed the wrong number. In line 014, the call taker once again redoes
an institutional identification (“This is HelpNow”).
Next, in lines 016 - 019, the caller initiates a multi-unit turn that further
accounts for his earlier request for another call taker while also backing down
from his earlier presumption about his recipient. In line 016 – 017, the caller
redoes his reference to the other call taker by using a non-recognitional
reference form as a preface to a personal name (“someone by the name of Jan”).
In doing so in this particular sequential environment, the caller displays that
HelpNow was indeed the location he intended to call. Additionally, it displays a
downgraded expectation that the call taker would recognize the referenced call

120
taker by name. By “backing off” his earlier presumption that the call taker would
recognize the name, the caller could also be displaying some uncertainty about
how the institution operates.
The caller goes on to account for his current call by disclosing his sexual
orientation (“I’m gay”) and specifies that, presumably because of this personal
characteristic, he was very comfortable talking with Jan (lines 017 – 018).
Subsequently, the caller produces a negatively-formatted declarative statement
with interrogative intonation, inviting confirmation that Jan is not currently
available at the HelpNow call center. For this case, then, the caller’s actions
related to referring to another call taker and reporting that he has called before
each contribute to the larger accounting work he performs to justify his current
request.
To summarize, this section has focused on return caller identities and how
two main interactional practices (and the epistemic claims they embody) are
used to constitute these identities in talk. As a type of epistemic middle ground
between the first time and regular caller identities, return callers display having
access to some institutional knowledge while not presuming the recipient’s
access to personalized knowledge. One practice for accomplishing this is, as part
of accounting for the in-progress call, reporting having spoken with HelpNow call
takers in the past. A second, related practice consists of callers using nonrecognitional reference forms to show they do not presume the referenced
person will be known by the call taker. In doing so, these callers display some
uncertainty about how the institution operates (i.e., whether or not call takers

121
know each other). With both of these practices, callers enacting return-caller
identities can be seen as doing different identity work than callers who present
themselves as regular callers or first time callers.

Conclusion
In this chapter, I considered how callers and call takers co-construct a
number of interactional identities in the very first few moments of the call. First, I
examined several interactional practices through which callers may present
themselves as first-time callers to HelpNow. Two specific practices were
discussed in this section: first, using a particular format for caller-initiated
personal identifications (“My name is X”), and, second, pre-characterizing their
reason for calling. On a broader level, each of these practices – alone or in
combination - may also contribute to call takers’ inferential work regarding the
kind of call it is likely to amount to (i.e. urgent or non-urgent).
Second, practices for enacting regular caller identities were also
examined. Two specific practices utilized by both callers and call takers were
discussed in this section: First, callers using a particular format for disclosing
their names that conveys an expectation of being recognized by call takers (This
is X); and second, call takers launching “how are you” sequences to claim
recognition of callers presenting themselves as regular callers. Each of these
practices shows how callers and call takers must negotiate whether a more
personalized help line call is possible to achieve.

122
Third, I examined a set of practices that callers may use to present
themselves as return callers. First, I analyzed a practice that callers may use to
indicate that they have called the line before (e.g., “I called earlier”). Second, I
analyzed callers’ use of non-recognitional reference forms to demonstrate that
they do not presume the referenced call taker will be recognized by the call taker
they are currently speaking to. As a type of epistemic middle ground between
first time caller identities and regular caller identities, callers presenting
themselves as return callers display some uncertainty about how the institution
works.
Openings in interaction – whether conducted face-to-face or via mediated
technologies - remain a key juncture in which interactants negotiate the relevant
identities and relationships for the interaction they are entering into. As other help
line researchers have repeatedly established (e.g., Potter & Hepburn, 2003,
2004), the call openings of an organization like HelpNow are critical for assessing
the needs of the caller and providing appropriate assistance. Consequently, the
use of the different interactional practices discussed in this chapter play an
important role in shaping (and reflecting) identities and relationships relevant to
the institutional circumstances of the call.

123

Chapter 5: Presenting the crisis or problem in the call
Call takers at crisis lines must be prepared to manage a wide variety of
crises. Callers may be calling with situations involving relationship problems,
bereavement, substance abuse, suicide, or other mental health issues (Lester,
1977; Gould, Kalafat, Munfakh, Kleinman, 2007; Kalafat, Gould, Munfakh,
Kleinman, 2007; cf. Chapters 2 and Chapter 3). On the other hand, callers must
face the interactional task of how to go about presenting their reason for calling
to the call taker. For many callers, especially those who have never called a
crisis line before, exactly how to proceed with this part of the call may be a
source of uncertainty. Should they initially provide a concise description of their
current psychological state or proceed with a more extensive telling that explains
what led to their current situation? Will they need to give more background for the
call taker or can they presume some institutional memory of their personal
circumstances? This chapter focuses on the interactional practices through which
these types of issues are dealt with and conveyed to call takers following the
opening of the call (i.e., where they account for why they have called this help
line at this particular time).
Investigating problem presentation practices of crisis lines is important for
two key reasons. First, it provides insight into how callers and call takers jointly
establish an understanding of the callers’ crisis or problem (“troubles”) that will
shape the interactional business of the call. For call takers, this is an especially
important interactional problem since they need to quickly get a sense of the

124
severity of the caller’s circumstances.46 Second, how callers present their
troubles demonstrates their orientation to the perceived boundaries of the
institution and its mission, i.e., what the help line is there for. Arriving at a deeper
understanding of these issues has the potential to enhance research and
practice regarding crisis intervention as well as other types of help lines or
mental-health services where these issues may be dealt with.
This chapter will proceed as follows. First, I give an overview of prior
literature on problem presentation practices on various types of telephone help
lines. Second, I examine three primary sequential positions in which callers
launch their problem presentation, including in the environment of precharacterizations, “how are you” inquiries, and the anchor position (“first topic
slot”). Third, I describe a set of discursive practices that callers (and call takers)
use to jointly negotiate the problem-presentation stage, including troublescentered “headlines” and more extended, multi-unit tellings. Next, I relate these
practices to underlying epistemic issues (related to “doing updating” and “doing
informing”) and how callers design their talk for particular kinds of recipients. To
conclude, I summarize the findings discussed in the chapter and suggest some
implications of this work.

46

Additionally, this initial impression of the caller’s crisis or problem can inform how
multiple, simultaneous call-taking demands are handled. Call takers may need to
prioritize any individual call with respect to other on hold or incoming calls.

125
Prior literature: Legitimizing the call for help
Prior literature has discussed callers’ methods for presenting their reason
for calling across a variety of help lines. Some of the earliest research on this
topic is Whalen and Zimmerman’s (e.g., 1987, 1991) study of 911 lines. For this
institution, “help” is primarily conceived of as dispatching some type of third party
(police, ambulance, fire dept., etc.) to aid citizens with some type of emergency.
The overall structural organization of 911 calls consists of the call taker beginning
with a solicitation of a problem (e.g., “What’s your emergency?”) followed by the
caller utilizing one of three turn formats to present their request for emergency
support (Zimmerman, 1992). First, callers may produce direct requests for
service (e.g. “Would you send the police to…” or “I need the paramedics
please”), while not specifying the specific type of “policeable” trouble or medical
emergency that is involved to warrant their request. Second, callers may utilize a
report format in which a specific trouble or problem is named, often using types
of inferably policeable categories, such as “house break in” or “vehicle accident.”
Examples of this format include “I’d like to report an accident” or “Someone just
vandalized my car.” A third turn format involves an extended description or
narrative format where a series of events is recounted that culminates in a
possibly policeable trouble. While this research is insightful for understanding the
dynamics of 911 emergency work, it relies upon a limited notion of “help” specific to 911 contexts - that may not hold for other institution-specific services,
resources, and agendas.
Recently, scholars have investigated a more diverse range of telephone

126
help lines to reveal how callers’ problem-presentation practices may both shape
and reflect the larger institutional mission of the help line. For instance, Emmison
and Danby (2007) examined a children’s counseling help line in Australia. Their
analysis revealed that callers’ problem presentations are regularly composed of
two distinct actions. The first action component consists of an announcement of a
trouble or problem that the caller has encountered (e.g., “My friend just got
kicked out of home…“) while the second component involves the specific reason
for why the call was made (“And we don’t know what to do”). Similarly, Shaw and
Kitzinger (2007) examined interaction on a child birth help line and found a twopronged structure of problem presentations: first, a unit that foreshadows a
problem (e.g., “I’m interested in having a baby…”) and second, a unit that
provides a more succinct statement of the problem either via an overt complaint
(“I’ve now got to the stage where I’m reaching stumbling blocks”) or a
complainable (“I have been trying to work with a midwife for a few months now”).
Across each of these help lines, these multi-part formats constitute an
interactional practice that call takers must closely attend to as they work at
understanding the caller’s reason for calling.
In a related study, Feo and LeCouteur (2013) examined the relationship
between broader institutional policies and callers’ problem-presentation activities
in the context of a counseling-centered help line in Australia. This help line,
specifically catered to men’s counseling needs, is grounded in an institutional
philosophy emphasizing solution-centered counseling. In practice, this means
that counselors primarily treat their institutional role as providers of advice or

127
information. However, the male callers were found to typically resist this
orientation by avoiding overtly requesting advice and instead elaborating on their
problems through extended, multi-unit tellings.
Each of these studies (Emmison & Danby, 2007; Feo & LeCouteur, 2013;
Shaw & Kitzinger, 2007) reveals the relationship between a help line’s
institutional mission and the nature of callers’ problem presentations. While the
early research on 911 calls set the stage for research on help line interaction, the
boundaries of what constitutes “help” on such lines must be broadened to better
consider how callers’ problem-presentation practices may both shape and reflect
each institution’s unique services, resources, and agendas. The current study
aims to extend the literature on help line problem presentations by examining
how this part of the call is worked out in light of the institution-specific
opportunities and constraints of HelpNow. The remainder of this chapter will
consist of three analytic sections that will document the findings related to these
issues, including the sequential positions, interactional practices, and epistemic
considerations. I begin with an analysis of the sequential environments in which
callers regularly launch their problem presentations.

Where: Launching the problem presentation
An analysis of the HelpNow calls has revealed three sequential positions
in which callers typically initiate their problem presentations (i.e., “reason for
calling”). First, callers may produce a pre-characterization of their crisis or
problem in the early moments of the call opening. In this position, the caller’s

128
conduct may give the call taker an initial sense of the type of call they are
entering into. A second sequential position is in the environment of “how are you”
(henceforth HRU) inquiries. In these cases, callers may provide a non-normative
response to the HRU that makes available a possible troubles telling that is
typically forwarded by the call taker (Jefferson, 1980; Schegloff, 1968).
Alternatively, callers may provide a normative, troubles-resistant response
(Jefferson, 1980) and immediately pivot into a problem-presentation. A third
sequential position in which the problem presentation is launched is in the anchor
position or “first topic slot”. Each of these positions will be explicated in this
section.

First environment: In anchor position following pre-characterization
sequences
The first sequential position in which callers may begin their problem
presentations is during the sequences that constitute the call opening. Here
callers may initiate a pre-characterization sequence. These sequences have
three core features: First, they project a subsequent problem presentation;
second, they make a go-ahead response relevant in next position (e.g., “Sure”);
and third, they convey an initial characterization of the type of trouble the caller is
experiencing (and thus has called the line to request assistance with). These precharacterizations are typically forwarded by call takers (i.e., via a go-ahead
response) prior to the caller proceeding to present their crisis or problem. In

129
Extract 5.1 below, a caller initiates a problem presentation immediately following
the completion of a pre-characterization sequence:

While I will not provide a full analysis of the pre-characterization sequence in this
case (see the analysis in Chapter 4), its overall import for understanding the
caller’s reason for calling merits further discussion. In lines 003 – 004, the caller’s
pre-characterization is designed with the minimization ‘just’, the full infinitive ‘to
talk,’ and the temporal construction ‘a little while’ – all alluding to a certain type of
reason for dialing the line that is non-urgent in nature (e.g., not suggesting one is
at imminent risk for self-harm). Up to this point, no specific troubles or topics
have been nominated to serve as the focus of the interaction.
In line 005, in response to the pre-characterization, the call taker’s
granting (“Alright”) affords the caller the opportunity to continue with the telling of
the personal circumstances that will be the focus of the permitted “talk” (line 003).
In line 007, the caller goes on to provide a next component of the course of
action by beginning to detail the problem he wishes to present to the call taker.

130
His formulation ambiguously frames his troubles as “a situation”. Furthermore,
with “most of my life”, a variant of an extreme case formulation (Pomerantz,
1986), he indicates his problem is both chronic and serious in nature. Towards
the end of this TCU, he reveals his “situation” to be one related to feelings about
going out in public (“I feel like I just can’t go out”).
This case shows how the work of presenting one’s reason for calling may
be initiated as a larger course of action achieved via an expanded sequence.
Here the caller first launches a pre-characterization that makes available minimal
information about why he called the line (in terms of a larger desired activity, “to
talk”). After a “go ahead” from the call taker, the caller elaborates on the more
specific troubles he wishes to discuss (troubles which, by presenting them in this
sequential position, he presumes as being legitimate for this particular help line).
In Extract 5.2, a caller produces a problem presentation following another
instance of a pre-characterization:

011
012
013

(1.0)
CL:

Ah: just (0.8) just always feel
like I’m struggling all the time.

In line 005, the caller redoes her greeting and, after a gap (line 006), produces a
pre-characterization (“I was hopin’ to talk with someone”). The design of this
action specifies “talk” as the projected activity, suggesting a characterization of
his reason for calling as more informal and non-urgent. After a slight gap in line
009, the call taker gives a go ahead (“Okay”) and produces a topic solicitation
(Button & Casey, 1984; 1988/1989), “What’s going on”, that demonstrates some
orientation to what the caller characterized to follow (“talk with someone”).
In line 011 there is a gap where the caller could produce a response to the
topic solicitation, projecting a problem on the part of the caller. In lines 012 – 013,
the caller produces a problem presentation that consists of (after a self repair) a
minimization marker (‘just’) and time related extreme-case formulations
(“always”, “all the time”) indicating the severity of his problem, i.e., ”struggling”.
At this point, it is possible to step back and highlight the larger sequential
trajectory that spans the caller’s line of action in this extract (specifically, the precharacterization from lines 007 – 008 and the later problem presentation in lines
012 - 013). By virtue of producing a pre-characterization that is granted by the
call taker, the relevance of a focal problem presentation is renewed and
projected. This case provides further evidence for call openings (and the position
immediately following their completion) as being a recurrent sequential
environment for callers presenting (minimal) details about their crisis or problem.

132
Extract 5.3 is another instance of this phenomenon with a caller precharacterizing their problem in this same sequential position:

Here a caller uses their first turn to produce a pre-characterization that makes
projectable their reason for calling to follow next. In line 003, the caller produces
a greeting (“Hi”) and continues with a pre-characterization that takes the form of
a direct request to speak with someone (“I wanna talk to somebody”). In line 006,
after a brief gap (line 005), the call taker produces a reciprocal greeting (“Hi”) and
identifies herself as someone who can provide the requested service (“you can
talk with me”). In line 007, the call taker adds another TCU that provides her first
name (“This is Sarah”), presumably to redo her identification with her own name
and make her offer of assistance more personal. By doing so, similar to the prior

133
two extracts, the call taker treats the prior action as preliminary to a focal
presentation of help-related matters.
Next, after a gap (line 008), the caller proceeds with producing a problem
presentation. Beginning in line 009, the caller acknowledges the call taker’s prior
turn (presumably immediately prior personal identification) with a minimal
agreement token (“Yeah”) and then produces an extreme case formulation (“My
life is in hell”) that negatively assesses the state of her life as a whole. After a
gap, the caller continues in lines 011 – 12 (beginning with an and-preface). She
further reports that all of her abilities for solving or coping with this problem have
been unsuccessful (with “everything” indicating an extreme-case formulation).
Stepping back, it is possible to see the larger sequential trajectory spanning the
caller’s pre-characterization (line 004) and the later problem presentation (lines
009 & 011-012). Like the prior cases, the production and forwarding of the precharacterization action project the relevance of a focal problem presentation
next.
In summary, call takers may be given an initial sense of the nature of a
caller’s reason for calling by virtue of the information made available through a
pre-characterization turn. While the position of these pre-characterizations lies in
the call openings, they serve as a bridge into the problem presentation. This
position makes it projectable that what will follow will be an extended turn
regarding the caller’s crisis or problem. This then renews the call taker’s routine
task of assessing whether or not the specific troubles are fitted to the purview of

134
HelpNow.47 In the next section, I discuss general-state (“how are you”) inquiries
as a further environment in which a caller’s reason for calling may be introduced.

Second environment: Anchor position (including response to a reason-for
calling solicitation)
A second environment in which callers may produce their reason for
calling is what is typically referred to as the “anchor position” (i.e., first-topic slot)
in the canonical literature on telephone openings (Schegloff, 1986). Throughout
most of these instances, general state inquiries are omitted and callers quickly
move into the presentation of their crisis or problem. As discussed in Chapter 4,
HelpNow assumes an institutional ethos that resists pre-mediating how a call
may unfold through the use of general problem solicitations (e.g., “How can I help
you?”) and instead leaves it up to callers to frame the type of “help” that may be
needed (also see the ethnographic background about HelpNow discussed in
Chapter 3). Despite this policy, it is not uncommon for callers to display some
hesitation and uncertainty as to how to best advance to the primary business of
the call (i.e., the reason for the call).
Extract 5.4 shows how a caller may initiate a problem presentation
immediately following the institutional identification in the call taker’s opening
turn:

47

While I do not include any in this dissertation, there are some cases within the
collection where call takers turn away the caller based on this issue. However, most of
these cases do appear to be related to so-called “nuisance” or “prank” callers (Brockopp,
2012b; cf. Danby, Harris, & Butler, 2015).

As this case shows, a caller swiftly moves into their reason for calling. In line 04,
after a gap, the caller produces a greeting (“Hi”), which both acknowledges the
call taker’s prior institutional identification (lines 02) and makes relevant a return
greeting from the call taker in the subsequent position. In line 05, where a return
greeting is relevant from the call taker, the caller produces a turn-holding device
(“um”)48 and then proceeds to initiate her problem presentation (“I feel
miserable”). It is also important to point out the gap in line 08 where the call taker
could produce uptake, possibly occasioning the caller’s launching of her problem
presentation.49

48

In ordinary conversation on the telephone, “uhm” has been found to be a common
component in the reason for calling (RFC) turn (see Schegloff, 2007).
49
It is possible that the whisper-like intonation of the caller’s talk here may lead to
hearing troubles for the call taker but the absence of repair initiation (and later turns that
display understanding of the caller’s initial conduct) make this a difficult claim to ground.

136
Extract 5.5 features another instance of a caller producing their problem
presentation in anchor position:

Here the caller and call taker exchange greetings prior to the caller producing the
beginning of her reason for calling. In lines 04 and 05, the caller produces an
acknowledgement (“YES”) of the institutional identification from the call taker (line

137
003) and then (after clearing her throat) moves to produce a greeting using a
form more unconventional for HelpNow calls (“Good afternoon”). There is a gap
in line 009 where a next turn from the caller could be produced. In line 013 she
begins and then abandons her telling to check whether the call taker is
concurrently engaged in another call, which is presumably occasioned by the gap
in line 009 following the call taker’s reciprocal greeting (where it is possible the
caller expected her to produce a further action such as a problem solicitation).
After the call taker confirms she is not on another call (line 013), the caller
restarts her previously abandoned construction (“I work for th-“) and continues on
with her problem presentation regarding her state government job. In sum, this
case offers a further illustration for understanding how problem presentations can
come about in this (post-greeting) position.
Extract 5.6 is a third instance that shows how problem-presentations occur
in this sequential environment. However, in contrast to the last two cases, this
one involves the call taker using a formal problem solicitation form (“Can I help
you?”) as a part of their first turn:
Extract 5.6 – [068-0413]

CL:

008

father:, (.) uh::,

Despite this case beginning with a non-typical first turn from the call taker (with
the more service-oriented solicitation question, “Can I help you?”), the problem
presentation on the part of the caller comes off in a manner consistent with other
“anchor position” instances. After a gap suggesting some type of trouble (line
003), the caller enacts a sudden realization with the change of state token “Oh”
(Heritage, 1984), presumably related to realizing the prior turn was in fact the
proper start of the call (i.e., not part of the consent-related recording that
preceded the call). After this “Oh”-preface, the caller produces a greeting token
with some verbal stress (“Hi:.”). Next there is a series of spates of silence (line
005 and 006) and turn-holding devices (“Um” in line 006) before the caller
launches her reason for calling with what Potter and Hepburn (2003) termed a
concern construction (lines 006 – 008).
To summarize, the description of the caller’s reason for calling HelpNow
may be initiated in the anchor position. Each of the cases examined for this
environment have focused on the transition from the first moments of the call to
presenting the main crisis or problem that caller is calling about. I next look to the
third environment, those surrounding HRU inquiries, where callers often present
themselves as repeat or regular callers.

Third environment: Second position in HRU sequences
In addition to the prior two environments, callers and call takers may work
through a number of other routine sequences that may also serve as
opportunities to present details regarding their troubles. General-state inquiries

139
(i.e., “how are you” sequences or simply HRUs) are one of four “canonical”
sequences that are typically accomplished in the openings of ordinary telephone
calls (Schegloff 1968, 1979, 1986; cf. Sacks, 1975). In HelpNow calls, these
HRU sequences represent a sequential opportunity through which problem
presentations may be projected, launched or pivoted into (see Chapter 4 for a
more in-depth discussion of the placement of these sequences within the larger
opening phase of the calls).
Prior research on HRU sequences in medical settings holds important
insights for understanding how HRUs are dealt with during HelpNow calls.
Primary-care physicians may design HRU questions as a way to solicit general,
non-institutional evaluations of their patients’ well being as opposed to problem
presentations specific to the medical visit (Heritage & Robinson, 2006; Robinson,
1999). This type of format may resemble how HRUs are composed in ordinary
conversation in that they consist of open-ended questions that target a general
evaluation of the recipient, e.g., “How are you?”, “How are you doing?”, or “How
are you feeling” (Heritage & Robinson, 2006, p. 96).
However, the import of the physician’s HRU question may also depend on
where it is produced within the visit relative to the opening of the visit. On the one
hand, a HRU inquiry launched during the opening phase makes relevant a
conventional HRU response (e.g., “Fine”; cf. Sacks, 1975). In contrast, a HRU
occurring after the completion of the opening invites a recipient response that is
more related to their reason for seeking medical care. Yet in addition to the
design features and sequential placement of these questions, there may still be a

140
potential for ambiguity in how patients take doctors to “mean” them (i.e., as
solicitations of medical business or general evaluations, see Heritage &
Robinson, 2006).
Another important feature of HRU inquiries in ordinary conversation – the
most mundane variety of this sequence – is that they typically invite general, nonexpansive, and non-problem focused responses. This further, non-institutional,
normative component of HRUs may thus contribute to the ambiguity that
recipients (patients) experience when they must respond to them in medical
settings. In the following extract from Heritage and Robinson (2003, p. 97), a
patient produces a conventionally neutral response to the doctor’s HRU inquiry:

H(h)i(h).

141

In this case, a HRU inquiry is produced as the doctor is beginning to sit down
after he has brought the opening to completion. In line 12, in response to the
doctor’s inquiry, the patient produces “Okay”, which conveys a “no problem”
response. This pragmatically complete response thus displays an orientation to
the question as unrelated to medical business and returns the speaking floor to
the doctor. In line 13, the doctor further pursues a problem presentation by
undercutting the patient’s “no problem” response. Next, in line 14, the patient
moves to produce a medically-relevant response (“…my throat hurts”).
On the other hand, patients may also treat HRU questions in terms of both
sets of possible relevancies (i.e., general evaluation of state of being and
medical-related problem presentation). This is accomplished by producing a
general, “troubles-resistant” response immediately followed by more expansive
units that present their medical business. This is shown in Extract 5.8 below
(taken from Heritage & Robinson, 2003, p. 97):
Extract 5.8 - [N:12:04]

This extract demonstrates how a patient may respond to a doctor’s HRU inquiry
in a way that displays their orientation to the dilemmatic nature of HRU questions
in this particular institutional context. By initially responding to the doctor’s
question with a grammatically complete unit of talk (“Well, pretty good.”), the

142
patient displays an (initial) orientation to the question as a non-institutional
question response. However, in lines 02 – 03, the patient proceeds to continue
with an additional unit of talk that constructs the beginning of a problem
presentation. To summarize, the analysis of HRU inquiries in medical settings
shows the possibly dilemmatic nature of this action in institutional settings
compared to its canonical, non-problem soliciting usage in ordinary conversation.
Two HRU-response trajectories have emerged in the HelpNow calls. In
the first trajectory, callers respond to the HRU inquiry first with a general
formulation of state (e.g., “I’m alright”) and in the second trajectory, with a more
specific report related to their troubles. In the first trajectory, call takers often
display recognition of a caller’s identity as a regular caller early in the call
opening (and, in some cases, immediately following the use of such displays for
enacting a more personal caller-call taker institutional relationship, see Chapter
4). This action is then met with a general formulation of state (e.g., “I’m Alright”,
etc.) and followed by an immediate expansion that begins to unpack the caller’s
troubles (i.e., what prompted their call). No cases featuring more conventional
HRU responses (e.g., “Fine”, “Good”) have been observed in the collection.
Therefore, callers would appear to treat the HRU inquiry as unavoidably invoking
the institutional agenda of the call (i.e., describing problems and getting help).
In Extract 5.9 below, a caller produces this type of general formulation of
state and subsequently pivots into her problem presentation:

(1.4)
CL:

In this case, the caller and call taker jointly construct the general state inquiry
sequence as an entry point into the problem presentation. In line 006, the call
taker initiates a HRU sequence immediately after she has displayed her
recognition of the caller’s identity with an Oh-prefaced repeat of the caller’s name
(“OH HI Julianne”). Said differently, the call taker uses the HRU as a way of
enacting that they know one another.
Next, in line 008, there is a gap that projects a problem on the part of the
caller. It is possible the caller is uncertain about which action to respond to (the
call taker’s greeting, self-identification, or HRU) or whether the call taker’s HRU is
to be treated as a conventional HRU inquiry or a solicitation of her reason for
calling. In line 009, the caller begins her responding turn with a fairly
unconventional response form (“I’m doing alright”), thus displaying an orientation
to avoiding giving a conventional, no-problem presentation (e.g., “Fine”). Next,
the caller produces the initial TCU of her reason for calling (“um I went to my
doctor yesterday”…). In doing so, the caller treats the HRU inquiry as making

144
relevant a general state formulation as a distinct action before pivoting into a
troubles-related report.
Callers may also use this sequential position to launch problem
presentations by means of less conventional HRU responses, such as, troublescentered responses or the beginning of a full troubles telling. In doing so, callers
may either project a subsequent troubles telling or use the response position to
pivot into a focal presentation of their crisis or problem. Extract 5.10 includes a
caller who, in responding to the call taker’s HRU inquiry, produces a turn
consisting of a non-normative HRU response that is immediately followed by a
troubles-related report:

This case provides further evidence of how callers may treat HRU sequences as
an opportunity to pivot into a presentation of their crisis or problem. In line 004,
the caller produces a personal identification as her first turn, which prompts an
immediate display of recognition by the call taker in line 005 (“OH:=HI Jessica”).
The call taker then continues her turn to reciprocate the personal identification
(“It’s Karen”, a format typically used to index prior relations – see Chapter 4) and
launch a general-state inquiry (line 006) in a way that displays her recognition of
the caller as someone she has spoken with in the past.
In line 008, after a gap, the caller gives the unconventional response “Not
very well::” (produced with continuing intonation). This is followed by an account
(“I’ve had a bad week”), which makes inferable the reason that she is in her
current psychological state. Immediately following this, in lines 010 and 012, the
call taker produces an expression of sympathy (Pudlinski, 2005), responsive to
either the latter assessment in the caller’s prior turn or the general, negatively
valenced formulation of her well being conveyed by the turn as a whole. This
sympathetic move from the call taker occurs in turn-initial overlap (Hayashi,
2013) with the caller’s deployment of the turn-holding device “um” (in 011). In line
014, after a brief gap, the caller reclaims the floor to continue her account related
to her bad week. In sum, this caller treats the HRU inquiry as doing the
institutional work of both eliciting a report of her current state as well as her

146
reason for calling. Doing so allows her to present herself as having troubles early
on in the call and thus quickly establish that she has legitimate grounds for
calling HelpNow.
In a second type of HRU-response trajectory, callers may omit a
normative response to the HRU inquiry altogether and proceed straight into
producing a troubles-related report. In doing so, callers treat the HRU inquiry as
a direct and immediate solicitation of their troubles. Extract 5.11 shows how a
caller may utilize the HRU as this type of opportunity as her response swiftly
moves into a description of her problem:

This extract shows how a caller may withhold a conventional response to the call
taker’s HRU inquiry by instead proceeding to give a report. In line 005, the caller
identifies herself by first name with the format “It’s Samantha”, displaying a

147
presumption that she will be recognized as a regular caller (see Chapter 4). After
a gap (line 006), the call taker produces a greeting token (“Hi::”) followed by the
initiation of a variation of a general-state inquiry that specifically targets her
current state or circumstances (“how are you doin today”). In lines 011 - 012, the
caller produces a response that resists the general format of the call taker’s
question (i.e., soliciting a current mood or psychological status) and instead
issues a well-prefaced turn (projecting a non-straightforward response, see
Schegloff & Lerner, 2009) announcing she is no longer seeing her therapist
anymore. This case, unlike the previous one, shows that the HRU sequence may
not always be treated as a distinct, opening-related action in its own right.
Instead, the caller may forego providing a conventionalized response to a HRU
question and instead proceed to reporting the troubles that occasioned the call.
Three sequential environments have been examined closely: First,
following a pre-characterization of the caller’s crisis or problem in the early
moments of the call opening; second, the anchor position or “first topic slot”; and
third, in the environment of HRU inquiries. In the next section, I shift from a focus
on sequential location to compositional details of the specific communicative
practices callers use to characterize their problematic circumstances.

How: Practices for the problem presentation
The presentation of personal troubles is a central component in how
callers account for calling the crisis line. Regardless of whether the caller has
already provided a pre-characterization in the opening phase, the problem

148
presentation constitutes a key juncture for the caller to contribute details
regarding the specific personal troubles they (or a third party) may be
experiencing. Analysis has revealed two types of turn formats that callers may
use for problem presentation, each with different consequences for how the call
taker may enact their recipiency. These formats include first, troubles-centered
“headlines”, produced as single-unit turns; and second, extended, narrative
tellings that may or may not culminate in a formulation of a clear crisis or
problem.

First practice: Troubles-centered headlines
One format which callers may use to present their troubles is by leading
with a troubles-centered headline. Most instances of this practice are caller
initiated and not prompted by the call taker’s use of a general-state inquiry (e.g.,
“How are things going”) or any institutionally-endorsed prompt (e.g., “How can I
help you”).50 Several distinctive features of this practice have been observed.
Most centrally, this practice consists of a straightforward formulation of the
caller’s psychological state and/or the larger precipitating event(s). Callers take a
stance towards the described state or event as something they are currently
struggling with. More specifically, these headlines consist of variations of the
general format “I am X”, with X being a reportable psychological state or
symptoms of distress (other variations include “I am feeling X”, “I’m having a X
day”, etc.).

50

Exceptions to this generalization will be discussed later in this chapter.

149
This practice can be seen in Extract 5.12, just after both parties have
exchanged greetings and first names:

011

Hi Tina:,
(3.0)

CL:

012

013

(0.2)

In this case, a caller uses a troubles-centered headline to make available his
reason for calling. In line 009, the caller redoes his initial greeting while also
incorporating the call taker’s name that they had disclosed earlier (“Hi Tina”).
Next, in line 010, there is a 3.0 second gap where the call taker could advance
the current activity (e.g., by producing problem-solicitation question or a generalstate inquiry). In line 011, the caller produces a headline-formatted TCU (“I’m
anxious today Tina”) along with a latched adverbial construction (“really bad.”).
While the first component of the caller’s turn follows the aforementioned general
turn design (“I am X”), the caller does further interactional work to extend the

150
headline with this increment and modify the intensity of his reported anxiety.
The caller also adds the temporal marker (“today”) that foregrounds the
status of his feelings or symptoms as currently affecting him. He also
incorporates the call taker’s first name at the end of the unit, extending the turn at
a point of grammatical completion. Clayman (2012) has examined the related
phenomenon of continuative address terms. He notes certain regularities in
prosodic design. According to his account, the address term is typically produced
with level or slightly-rising intonation (of which the latter applies here). In the
current extract (5.12), an intonational pattern (similar to that analyzed by
Clayman) can be observed when the caller produces the call taker’s name and
hence extends his speaking turn beyond its initial TCU.
After this juncture (i.e., where the address term is produced), the caller
latches on the increment “really bad” (line 012). While this increment is
characterized by prosodic stress on the first lexical item (thereby accentuating his
distress to the call taker), the final terminal intonation suggests his turn may be
projectably complete. For this call, then, the caller presents his reason for calling
by using a minimal telling similar to an announcement format.
In the next case, Extract 5.13, the caller’s talk includes this headline
practice as well as further syntactic resources to chain together several
psychologically-oriented components:

011

CT:

This instance shows how a caller may present their problem or crisis in a
headline-based format while also making use of compound-TCU resources. In
line 007, the caller begins her headline with the construction “I feel all”. This
projects a feeling-related assessment that represents a more global
characterization of her current state. After a beat of silence and audible inhale,
the caller continues the assessment with “gross and ugly and stuff an-”. From the
call taker’s perspective, the caller’s three-part list provides further details
regarding the caller current state. The list is completed with the generalized-list
completer “and stuff” (Jefferson, 1991; Lerner, 1994), leaving it up to the call
taker to infer what could follow logically from also feeling “gross” and “ugly”.
Next, the caller produces the conjunction "and” (transcribed as “an’“)
thereby projecting more for the current turn and indicating her presentation is
incomplete. Continuing in line 08, after a gap and sniffle (further contributing to
the caller’s fragile and emotionally-unsteady intonational quality), the caller adds
a more global, ‘and’-prefaced summative characterization with “I just don’t feel
good”. At a general level, this extract demonstrates how, even in using a single

152
TCU format, callers may present their troubles in a manner that is less
straightforward (and potentially more acute) than the basic “I am X” format. To do
so, callers may utilize grammatical and prosodic resources to produce their
presentation of the crisis or problem (e.g., the increment “really bad” in Extract
5.13).
The prior extracts have demonstrated that callers may utilize a headline
format to immediately present a characterization of their current psychological
state. However, some callers may also deploy this practice in a less
straightforward fashion by using idiomatic expressions and avoiding emotionspecific language. In the case appearing below, Extract 5.14, a caller produces a
troubles-centered headline that formulates his hardship more vaguely as related
to his “havin’ a hard time”:

[Havi]n’ a hard time?

This case shows a caller’s use of this practice in a way that deviates slightly from
the earlier extracts that resembled the format “I am X”. In line 014, the caller
makes available the headline-based TCU “I’m just (.) kinda having a hard time”
(also built on the stem “I am”). Beyond the minimization tokens ‘just’ and ‘kinda’,
the construction “having a hard time” suggests the caller is personally
experiencing difficulty and that this struggle is a current one (with the verb ‘have’
in the present-progressive tense). Thus, troubles-centered headlines are
constructed in a way that emphasizes the caller’s distress and projects further
unpacking in subsequent turns.
In this section, we have analyzed the troubles-centered “headline” format
that may be used by callers when presenting their crises or problems. As the
chosen extracts have shown, callers may use this practice to make available
their current psychological state. In each instance, the headline projects further
unpacking regarding the specific circumstances (e.g., the precipitating event) of
their current psychological state. In the next section, I proceed to examine
extended, multi-unit tellings as another format through which callers may present
their crises or problems.

154
Second practice: Extended, multi-unit tellings
Another recurrent practice that callers use for problem presentations is
extended, multi-unit turns such as extended telling sequences (Schegloff, 2007,
p. 37 – 42). In some cases, callers’ problem presentations are treated by call
takers as projecting a more extensive unpacking of the circumstances
surrounding their decision to call. Furthermore, callers’ use of multi-unit tellings
creates unique opportunities to assess the extent of the background knowledge
that may be necessary for understanding callers’ troubles.
Multi-unit tellings may be particularly well suited for callers in light of call
takers having little to no background knowledge about the caller’s troubles or life
circumstances. If positioned on an epistemic gradient (Heritage, 2012), call
takers occupy a ‘K-‘ position in relation to the caller’s own life world while callers
themselves occupy ‘K+’ position. The extract below shows how one caller (who
has initially presented himself as a first-time caller up to this point of the call51)
initiates his problem presentation by first undertaking a larger “overview” telling:

As this case shows, a caller may do extra interactional work to show they are
engaged in producing an extended-turn format problem-presentation. In lines 006
– 009, the caller produces a first name formulation and a pre-characterization (“I
just wanted to talk for a while?”). After a go ahead from the call taker (“Okay”),
the caller produces the confirmation token “Alright” and a subsequent TCU
designed in a way that makes a multi-unit turn projectable next (“give you an
overview real quick”).
In lines 018 – 019, he comes to the end of a description of his ex girlfriend
(including where she lived in relation to his condo) and designs the end of his
utterance as part of an ongoing turn with final-rising intonation. By characterizing
his action as an “overview”, he makes his turn hearable as background and
therefore preliminary to some other reportable crisis or problem. Further, by
qualifying his projected action as “real quick”, he orients to the time-sensitive
nature of the service he is calling by moving quickly from the background to his
institution-specific crisis or problem.

157
As uptake in line 020, the call taker produces a continuer (Schegloff,
1982), demonstrating her understanding of the current talk as incomplete and
ongoing. Next, in line 21, the caller continues by constructing his turn as a
continuation of the prior unit (“and um:”) and presents further details regarding
his prior relationship with the ex-girlfriend. As the caller continues with his multiunit telling related to this woman, the call taker gives further uptake in the form of
continuers (024, 030, 037) to indicate her understanding of the current status of
talk.

In the opening moments of this call (lines 001 – 007), the caller presents herself
(and is recognized as) a regular caller. In line 009, the caller produces a
response to the call taker’s initiated general state inquiry with “I’m doing alright”
and then goes on to produce a further TCU related to her recent doctor’s visit
with slightly rising intonation. In designing her talk with this intonational contour, it
is possible that she is inviting confirmation from the call taker (i.e., in that she
might remember something about prior conversations related to her doctorrelated circumstances). After a gap (line 011), the call taker produces uptake with
the token “Okay” which, at the minimum, acknowledges the caller’s initial

159
reporting regarding her doctor and displays her recipiency to a projected
unpacking of the initial report.52
Next, in line 014, the caller continues her turn with an and-prefaced TCU
that constructs her talk as a continuation of her earlier turn. In lines 014 – 15, the
caller reports what she said to her doctor and, after a gap where there is no
uptake from the call taker (line 016), redoes this turn again with a slight
reformulation (e.g., use of the second-person pronoun ‘you’, replacing “damn
you” with “for me”). This second formulation also features stress on ‘me’, placing
greater emphasis on the as yet unspecified medical business related to the
caller’s visit to her doctor.
In line 019, the call taker again produces the general acknowledgement
token “Okay”. This is followed in line 020 with the caller latching on a continuation
of her multi-unit turn that presents further details regarding her visit. As the caller
goes on to elaborate, she mentions being dissatisfied with her doctor’s
availability. There is also a larger action trajectory through which this issue is
presented by the caller. Similar to the previous case, this instance shows how
callers may opt to use a multi-unit telling format (versus a troubles-centered
headline) that interactionally positions the call taker as a recipient of an extended
telling.
In the third extract showing this practice in action, Extract 5.17, a caller
begins to utilize a troubles-centered headline but abandons it before any specific

52

It is possible that her response also confirms her access to some of the caller’s
previously shared life circumstances and thus invites the projected “update” that is to
follow. I will return to the subject of “updating” later in this chapter.

psychological state or symptoms are presented. The caller then continues with a
multi-unit telling which eventually culminates in a reattempt at articulating her
current state in relation to her upcoming social plans:

=Mm hm,

In lines 006 – 010, the caller produces a greeting incorporating the call taker’s
name and then, through a number of restarts and within-turn pauses, begins to
produce a troubles-centered headline. In lines 007 – 009, the caller starts to
formulate her state with what is projectable to be the idiomatic expression
“caught between a rock and a hard place”. Yet after two false starts, she
abandons it and produces the epistemic hedge “I d’know”. Prior research by
Weatherall (2011) has documented how “I don’t know” can function as a prepositioned epistemic hedge that shows the speaker is not fully committed to the
epistemic status of what comes next (cf. Beach & Metzger, 1997). In this
particular case, this practice further contributes to the caller’s displayed
uncertainty as to how to describe her current mental state. After several

162
abandoned attempts at an evaluation of self, it is also hearable as conveying that
she is confused or disoriented mentally.
In line 11, the call taker does not provide any immediate uptake and thus
does not treat it as a possibly complete characterization of her current state.
Next, after a gap (line 011), the caller begins describing her upcoming social
commitments with several friends. In lines 012, she begins her TCU with “I
mean”, projecting the talk that follows to be a self-repair that sequentially deletes
the prior (abandoned) headline. In lines 13 – 19, she goes on to explain her prior
commitment to “come for bingo” and mentions the names of several individuals in
describing where the bingo was to be held. In line 21, after the caller’s turn has
come to a possible point of completion, the call taker produces a minimal
acknowledgement token “Okay”. In doing so at this point (i.e., when there is not
yet a presented problem or crisis), the call taker has again renewed a type of turn
taking that is typical of multi-unit tellings.
The next section of the extract features the caller moving closer to a
clearly articulating a help line relevant problem. In lines 23 – 24, the caller
produces a further TCU introducing the detail that her friends will be picking her
up and places stress on the timing of this scheduled pick up (“they’re gonna pick
me up early”). While this unit is delivered with a final terminal intonation, it still
does not present an institutionally-relevant crisis or problem. After another gap
(line 025), the caller again produces an ‘and’-prefaced TCU that further extends
her telling regarding her social plans (lines 26 – 28).

163
In line 29, there is a further gap where the call taker produces no uptake
followed by the caller extending her turn again to provide a more explicit report of
her psychological state (lines 30 – 32). In providing the account “I guess it’s
going out of my comfort zone”, the caller offers a formulation of the type of
psychological distress the caller is currently dealing with. In line 33, immediately
after the caller’s prior turn, the call taker produces a change-of-state token to
enact a sudden realization. This move is presumably related to the critical
information provided by the caller just prior and claims she now understands the
problem. In lines 34 - 35 the caller completes her TCU and the call taker
responds with a latched on minimal agreement token (“Mm hm”) that treats the
telling as not yet complete.
To sum up, this extract demonstrates how the use of extended-turn
formats for the problem presentation phase of the call is something that call
takers must monitor closely. As callers gradually construct their tellings unit-byunit (with intermittent recipient displays of alignment from call takers), the issue of
determining what relates to their crisis or problem can remain an ongoing task for
call takers. At some point during the production of the telling, call takers may be
able to infer, based on the presented circumstances, what it is that led the caller
to call at the current moment. In this way, the collaborative enactment of multiunit turns may also be deeply related to how call takers apply the inferential
frameworks specific to this institution. During the course of a caller’s multi-unit
telling, call takers may generate inferences about how a caller’s multi-unit telling

164
is appropriately fitted to HelpNow’s institutional mission (i.e., to assist those
facing distress or mental-health crises).
As the earlier work on 911 calls has shown (e.g., Whalen & Zimmerman,
1990; Zimmerman, 1984), these extended presentation practices are an
important resource through which callers can explain, for instance, how they
came to know of their problem or how it came to impact their psychological well
being. Extended tellings can also be useful for presenting personal
circumstances that are more ambiguous or complicated in nature, as well as for
explicating why a personal situation is relevant to the specific institution the caller
has contacted (cf. Emmison & Danby; Feo & LeCouteur, 2013). Callers to
HelpNow may design their problem presentations as multi-unit tellings rather
than a troubles-centered headline to deal with similar interactional pressures.

Epistemics & identity: Updating versus informing
Callers and call takers may display orientations towards specific domains
of knowledge during their interaction on the help line. A related area of research,
social epistemics, refers to how interactants display and manage their rights and
obligations to specific domains of knowledge in social interaction (Heritage,
2013). Epistemic status, a key notion that has emerged in this research, refers to
what interactants assume each other to know (and not know), given who they are
and who they are to each other (Heritage, 2013). In help line interactions, callers
and call takers may display a recurrent orientation to these epistemic
considerations, specifically to what (if anything) is remembered from prior calls

165
(Shaw & Kitzinger, 2007). As a result, this sense of institutional memory can be
seen as a critical resource for participants and potentially consequential for how
the call unfolds.
In the HelpNow calls, callers may enact a particular epistemic status
through what I refer to as “updating”, or the practice of giving updates on one’s
crisis or problem, daily accomplishments, or general life circumstances.53 In
doing so, callers implicitly convey call takers’ general familiarity (i.e., epistemic
status) with these aspects of their life (cf. Drew & Chilton, 2000). This, as I later
show, is in contrast to the interactional accomplishment of “informing”, the action
of reporting a problem or reason for calling in a way that does not incorporate
any such presumptions.
“Doing updating” involves callers producing a report that presumes call
takers’ familiarity with their life circumstances. In his early lectures, Sacks (1992:
Vol. 2, p. 438) discussed a general preference in interaction for not telling
recipients what they already know. This notion, typically discussed under the
broader notion of recipient design, highlights participants’ orientations to
designing their talk for particular recipients (especially their epistemic status).
Thus, in framing their problem presentations as doing updating, callers may show
they are oriented to issues of recipient design and that some call takers may not
need full explication of background related to their personal circumstances.
As discussed in Chapter 4, the identification/recognition sequence
represents one opportunity for callers and call takers to display their epistemic

53

For a related discussion of relationship “tracking”, see Morrison (1997).

166
(and relationship) status within the opening of the call. Additionally, callers’
problem presentations may be designed to accomplish these identities. For this
reason, I reference the earlier distinction between regular caller identities and
first time caller identities54 to demonstrate how epistemic considerations can work
to further embody these identities. Thus, the central focus of this section is the
practices callers utilize to display their orientation to the call taker’s epistemic
status as they work together to negotiate what each person is assumed to know.
In the sub-sections below, I analyze two previously examined interactional
practices (troubles-centered headline & multi-unit turn formats), as well as call
takers’ responses to them, to further show how these identities may be
constructed (and renewed) in the environment of problem presentations. The
following general features of these practices will be discussed: First, headline
formats and second, multi-unit formats, both of which enact updating via the
incorporation of less background detail to presume call takers’ prior epistemic
access; and third, headline formats, and fourth, multi-unit formats, both of which
enact informing via a greater background detail to convey an orientation to giving
greater background (i.e., presuming no epistemic access) for call takers.

54

In Chapter 4, I defined first time caller identities as referring to callers who present
themselves as individuals who are new to calling HelpNow. On the other hand, regular
caller identities referred to callers who presented themselves as individuals who call on a
regular basis and thus display a presumption to be recognized by staff.

167
1. “Doing updating” via headline format
Callers may design troubles-centered headlines to frame their problem
presentation as an updating (versus an informing). To do so, callers design their
presentation in a way that incorporates little background detail. This is a way of
presenting their headline (and possible topic) that includes a presumption that
the recipient holds prior knowledge regarding the caller’s personal
circumstances. Most often, this involves the headline incorporating personal
information in a manner that presupposes prior epistemic access. For instance,
Extract 5.18 shows how the caller’s announcement of a particular detail
presupposes prior knowledge on the part of the call taker:

(1.5)

This case shows how callers and call takers collaborate to create a sequential
environment where the caller can proceed to “do updating” (i.e., produce an
update-oriented reason for calling). From lines 006 – 007, the call taker displays
her recognition of the caller’s disclosed identity and then initiates a HRU
sequence. In line 009 - 010, the caller produces a normative response (“Alright”)
and then continues with a troubles-centered headline.
The latter action here announces the caller’s choice to cease seeing her
gynecologist and includes little background details. This turn design conveys the
caller’s presumption that the call taker already has epistemic access to the fact
that she has been seeing a gynecologist (and potentially that there have been
prior problems with him/her).
In line 012, the call taker produces an affectively marked “Oh” receipt,
which embodies a claim of understanding and treats the caller’s report as news.
Next, after a gap in line 013, the call taker displays her recollection of the
relevant circumstances by inviting the caller to elaborate with “That’s new this
week” and inviting confirmation (“isn’t it?”). This response (lines 014 – 015) treats
the caller’s current report as hearable in relation to other, prior reports and
possibly suggests that they speak on a weekly basis. As a result, this headlinedesigned problem presentation works to further enact – and validate – the caller
as a regular caller. In sum, this instance shows how callers can design troubles-

169
centered headlines that presume prior epistemic access in order to provide, as a
regular caller, an update on previously-known circumstances.

2. “Doing informing” via headline formats
Callers may also design troubles-centered headlines in a way that frames
the problem presentation as an informing (versus an updating). To accomplish
this, these headlines incorporate greater background details in a way that
presents the crisis or problem in a more general fashion. This type of turn design
displays the callers’ orientation to not presuming any prior epistemic access to
the caller’s personal circumstances. In other words, these headlines feature an
orientation towards presenting personal information as new as opposed to
presuming personal information as part of institutional memory. In Extract 5.19,
the caller’s use of the headline format displays the caller’s orientation to the call
taker having no prior epistemic access by presenting their crisis or problem as
new information:

(0.8)

This case shows how informing as a course of action can be implemented using
the headline-formatted problem presentation. In line 014, following a gap where
the call taker passes the opportunity to take a turn, the caller produces the
beginning of a problem presentation using a headline format (“I’m just kinda
havin’ a hard time:.”). However, unlike the prior updating headline, the caller
presents their reason for calling as a single TCU informing. The design of the
action incorporates a greater background detail in a way that does not presume
the call taker to know something about him or the problem he is about to present.
By presenting his problem presentation in this way, as an informing, the caller
constructs himself a first time or repeat caller.55 In brief, this extract depicts a
headline that is designed to not presume any prior epistemic access on part of
the call taker. Next, I move on to examine the multi-unit turn format as a further

It is difficult to determine which of these two interactional identities would specifically
be relevant here. However, the use of this practice makes it clear that they are not a
regular caller (i.e., that presumes institutional/personalized memory).

171
way in which problem presentations may do informing or updating and moreover,
further manage a caller’s interactional identity.

3. “Doing updating” via multi-unit turn formats
In addition to a headline format, callers may utilize a multi-unit turn format
in order to frame their problem presentation as an updating. As with headline
formats, this involves the caller incorporating particular grammatical resources
into their problem presentation. To do updating, callers incorporate more less
specific details or background (“I quit my doctor yesterday”) to convey the
presumption that their recipient has prior knowledge regarding their personal
circumstances. Thus, some degree of epistemic access is taken for granted.
Nonetheless, prior to proceeding with their extended telling, callers can
display some hesitancy about whether such institutional and personalized
memory can be presumed at all. This task may be accomplished via yes/no
interrogatives that target the call taker’s epistemic status regarding the caller and
their personal circumstances. Such a question may be occasioned in a call when
a call taker has not provided clear interactional evidence to suggest they
recognize their recipient as someone who has called before (i.e., a return caller
or regular caller). It is these questions that confirm to the caller what kinds of
presumptions they may be able to form as they produce their multi-unit formatted
update.

172
In Extract 5.20 below, this type of question is deployed after each party
has exchanged first names, yet prior to the caller presenting anything specifically
related to her problem presentation:

In line 18, the caller produces a yes/no interrogative to invite the call taker to
display whether or not she remembers speaking with the caller in the past. Based
on this turn, the caller has not heard any compelling evidence that the call taker
recognizes her as a regular caller (an identity invoked with the caller’s “This is
Mary” name-disclosure format in line 015, see Chapter 4). In response in line 19,
the call taker produces a non-type conforming response “I believe so”, which
hesitantly confirms she remembers the caller. While this response tentatively
confirms the call taker’s memory, it does reserve some deniability in case it is
later revealed she does not actually remember a particular detail from a prior call.
In line 20, the caller begins her multi-unit format problem presentation. Her
initial unit in this telling (“I still have problems with my…”) includes the lexical item
“still,” invoking prior interactions with the call taker in which the ongoing
“problems” were presumably discussed. This indicates that the problems she

174
goes on to describe are occurring at the present time, just as they have in the
past. The design of this element presumes the call taker’s understanding that the
problems had already been going on. In this way, the design of the caller’s telling
incorporates less background details (lines 020 – 021).56 Additionally, the caller’s
problem presentation further enacts her regular caller identity. All in all, this case
demonstrates how callers may frame the multi-unit problem presentations with
high granularity and relatedly premised upon call takers already having epistemic
access to the caller’s personal circumstances.
!
4. “Doing informing” via multi-unit turn formats
Lastly, callers can utilize the multi-unit turn format to frame their problem
presentation as informing (rather than updating). In contrast to its use for doing
updating, this variation involves incorporating a degree of generality to the
(potential) topics conveyed via their problem presentation. This presents their
crisis or problem in a broader manner that presumes no or little background (i.e.,
about its history, possible causes, etc.). In the extract below (shown earlier in this
chapter as Extract 5.15), a caller performs extra interactional work to frame their
problem presentation as an informing (i.e., for this recipient):
Extract 5.21 – [043-0298]

Interestingly, the caller goes on to incorporate greater background into the subsequent
TCUs in her turn (lines 22 – 25, 27 – 29). Although I will go intro great detail to speculate
why this might be, it is worth pointing out since the initial TCU seemed to presume prior
background about her grandchildren.

This case provides evidence for the case that multi-unit turns may be used as a
vehicle for informing (as opposed to updating). After the caller and call taker work
through a pre-characterization (see Chapter 4) in lines 006 – 011, the caller
moves to produce his subsequent TCU as the beginning of a projectably multiunit turn (“give you an overview real quick”). Put differently, by characterizing his

176
action as an “overview”, he frames his current unit of talk as background
information that is unknown to the call taker and necessary for understanding the
projectable telling of his current crisis or problem. In doing so, the design of his
problem presentation incorporates greater background details and displays his
orientation to not making any presumptions about the call taker’s prior knowledge
on the issue and thus enacts an interactional identity as a regular caller. Thus,
this instance shows how callers may design their multi-unit formatted problem
presentations in a way that displays an orientation to their recipient not having
any previous knowledge of what they are about to communicate.
To summarize, this section has examined how HelpNow callers and call
takers display their orientation towards specific domains of knowledge during the
problem presentation stage of the call. Concepts related to social epistemics
were applied in an effort to illuminate specific features of problem presentations
that contribute to the interactional accomplishment of updating or informing.
When callers do updating, using either a headline or a multi-unit turn format, the
problem presentation includes very little background details (e.g., “I quit my
doctor yesterday”), thereby presupposing that the call taker has previously
encountered and remembers the caller’s relevant personal circumstances. In
these types of calls, both participants are oriented to issues of memory,
specifically what issues (if any) can be remembered from any earlier help line
telephone encounters. In this way, updating is most often linked to calls where
callers enact a regular caller or repeat caller identity.

177
On the other hand, callers who design their problem presentations to do
informing - also via either headline or multi-unit formats – include a different
design feature. Instead, callers compose their problem presentation in a way that
displays an orientation to the call taker holding no prior epistemic access to their
personal circumstances. To accomplish this, callers incorporate greater
background detail (“Let me give you an overview”) into troubles-centered
headline formats or multi-unit turn formats. Overall, this section has shown how
the epistemic differences regarding problem presentations revolve around
presumptions made of call takers’ personal memory.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we considered various dimensions of the problem
presentation portion of HelpNow calls. First, we have examined several different
sequential environments in which problem presentations are regularly launched.
Analysis revealed several environments where this is done including surrounding
pre-characterizations, HRU inquiries, and the anchor position. Each of these
sequential contexts affords different opportunities for callers to begin presenting
their reason for calling the help line.
Second, we have looked at two practices that are used to accomplish the
presentation of the caller’s problem or crisis. These included troubles-centered
headlines (e.g., “I feel really down”) and extended, multi-unit tellings. These
practices create different interactional possibilities for the call taker as they
monitor whether the crisis or problem is within the purview of the institution’s

178
larger mission. While the headline format typically foregrounded a type of
psychological state or precipitating event, multi-unit telling configurations
interactionally position call takers as recipients in a larger, narrative-oriented
course of action that may only feature a clear crisis or problem at its culmination.
Third, we examined how some of the aforementioned problempresentation practices relate to underlying epistemic issues including “doing
updating” and “doing informing”. In the case of updating, callers design their
problem presentations in a way that presupposes the call taker’s knowledge of
their personal circumstances. In the case of informing, however, callers orient to
the call taker holding no prior epistemic access to their personal circumstances.
Callers and call takers must work together to coordinate whether they are
engaged in an informing or updating in relation to the caller’s crisis or problem.
All in all, the problem presentation is a critical site for understanding calls
made to HelpNow. In it callers must present their current crisis or problem so that
the call taker can assess whether it is within the purview of the institution’s
mission and the type of help that is most appropriate. This chapter provides a
clearer picture of how these issues are navigated at HelpNow.

179
Chapter 6: Rising-intoned repetition as an institutional
practice for inviting elaboration from callers

This chapter explores call takers’ use of repetition, or the practice of
repeating – either partially or in full - what the caller has said when they are
responding to callers’ problem presentations. The task of getting callers to talk
about their issues and negotiate the type of help they need is of fundamental
importance to the call takers’ work and HelpNow’s larger institutional mission
(see Chapter 3 & Chapter 5). Callers typically begin with callers disclosing their
crisis or problem; however, a more challenging step is often getting the caller to
elaborate on these oftentimes very personal and emotionally delicate issues.
Much of the institutional work of HelpNow’s call takers emphasizes the
enactment of “active listening” (which I explain in more detail below) and
identifying elements of the caller’s talk that hold therapeutic relevance. Yet when
callers are not very forthcoming with details about their crises or problems, the
call taker may struggle to accomplish this institutional work and, relatedly, assess
the severity of the caller’s situation. My observations as a HelpNow call taker
revealed that repeating a caller’s prior words is a commonly taught technique for
inviting further talk from callers. Nonetheless, an analysis of this interactional
device in practice has shown that call takers’ deployment of this repetition does
not typically achieve the intended institutional ends.
In contrast to prior scholarship that has examined repetition in ordinary
conversation (e.g, Schegloff, 1996, 1997; Stivers, 2005), the repetition practices
observed in calls made to HelpNow are characterized by unique compositional

180
features, action trajectories, and broader institutional agendas at work. Two types
of forms of repetition are important to distinguish. On one hand, full-form
repetition consists of a full repetition of the target unit in the caller’s prior turn. On
the other hand, partial-form repetition consists of only a portion of the target
utterance being repeated. Both of these types of repetition constitute the target
practices that will be the focus of analysis in this chapter.
As an institutional backdrop to HelpNow, three broader features must be
reviewed to setup the analysis of repetition during calls (also see Chapter 2).
First, call takers at HelpNow are trained to recognize the role of active listening in
their work. This notion, which is also heavily emphasized in other mental health
and counseling related professions, refers to how the “listener” in an interaction
(i.e., call taker or mental-health professional) continually demonstrates to the
current speaker that they are actively attending to the speaker’s talk and, in doing
so, make them feel comfortable enough to continue if they wish. While I will not
provide a comprehensive review of the ways active listening can be
accomplished in the dynamics of social interaction (see Chapter 2), the link
between this concept and the current chapter’s focus on repetition will be an
important theme that cuts across the analyzed empirical cases.
A second issue to highlight here, closely linked to HelpNow’s broader
emphasis on active listening, is how repetition practices fit within call takers’
broader repertoires of techniques for communicating with callers. Like other help
lines (Butler, Potter, Danby, & Emmison, & Hepburn, 2010; Feo & Le Couteur,
2013; Pudlinski, 2005), HelpNow discourages call takers from providing explicit

181
assessments of the caller’s personal circumstances or the delivery of any
advice.57 HelpNow’s institutional policy, generally speaking, is to facilitate an
interaction that privileges callers’ own personal autonomy to highlight existing
social support or coping resources and further develop their own problem solving
skills. In this sense, call takers are required to conduct themselves in a way that
exhibits a sense of professional cautiousness (Drew & Heritage, 1992). Thus, call
takers are trained to communicate with callers in a way that maintains a distinct
neutral position with respect to the caller’s personal concerns or opinions.
Instead of evaluations or advice, call takers are thus encouraged to draw from
techniques that display active listening, such as using “encouragers” (i.e.,
continuers), asking questions, paraphrasing, and repeating the caller’s prior
words, to name a few.
The latter two of these techniques bear resemblance to what is discussed
in the prior literature on formulations in therapeutic settings. Generally, these
involve the practice of proposing a version of what a client has described in a
prior turn in order to make relevant the client’s confirmation or disconfirmation
(Antaki, 2008; Antaki, Barnes, & Leudar, 2005).58 A number of different variations
of this action have been proposed (see Antaki, 2008), yet it is most important to
highlight how call takers’ repetition practices in HelpNow calls are different from

57

While this rule applies to most circumstances that may arise, exceptions to this
general rule are typically made in cases where someone may pose harm to themselves
or others (cf. Callahan, 2009). In these cases, call takers may adopt a firm and more
authoritative stance.
58
While a number of different scholarly definitions of formulations exist (e.g., Davis,
1986; Heritage & Watson, 1979; Garfinkel & Sacks, 1970), for the sake of brevity I focus
exclusively on how the term has been used in discourse-centered literature on
psychotherapy.

182
formulations. Most simply, this contrast rests upon call takers’ repetition practices
primarily consisting of a virtually precise reproduction of the caller’s prior talk
(either a portion of a turn or in full).
A third notion important to setting up this chapter’s focus is therapeutic
relevance (Antaki, 2010; Antaki, Barnes, & Leudar, 2005; Hutchby, 2002). This
has been used as an analyst’s term to refer to what a client (caller) has described
about their emotions, specific precipitating events, or anything else the mentalhealth specialist (call taker) deems relevant to their broader therapeutic agenda
(Buttny, 1996; Davis, 1986; Vehviläinen, 2003; cf. Roter & McKneils, 2003) or
institutional mission. In prior literature (e.g., Hutchby, 2002), this term has been
used to describe counselor’s professional orientations to advancing therapeutic
goals for a given client (i.e., in that specific session or across different sessions).
This principle represents an additional consideration in terms of the institutional
logic call takers may apply when repetition practices are used during HelpNow
calls.
The structure of this chapter will proceed as follows. First, I review prior
literature on repetition across different sequential environments. Next, I focus on
the sequential and compositional features of full-form repetition, non-contiguously
placed full-form repetition, and partial-form repetition, highlighting callers’
resistant responses with regard to each. Third, I discuss larger institutional
implications of these findings for HelpNow’s call takers and training procedures.
Finally, I conclude by summarizing the key findings and implications of the
chapter.

183

Establishing criteria for the analysis of repeats
Firm criteria are necessary for delineating repeat-related actions from
other forms of repetition in interaction. There is extensive research focused on
repetition drawing from a wide range of analytic perspectives (see Kim, 2002 or
Norrick, 1987 for a review). However, for the purposes of the current chapter, I
will only focus on a subset of repetition practices in ordinary conversation. Since
this analytic focus is similar to Schegloff’s (1996a) paper, I adopt the same
inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to differentiate between the phenomenon in
my data and other forms of repetition practices. My focus in this chapter is solely
on the use of repetition in initiating actions (first-pair parts). I explicate Schegloff’s
criteria below to further frame the analysis that follows later in the chapter.
First, broadly speaking, repetition can be defined as produced “by
someone other than the initial speaker of the repeated utterance” (p. 177, my
emphasis). This places clear analytic focus on repetition as produced in others’
talk (i.e., those other than the initial speaker of the utterance). Second, repetition
typically occurs in one of three sequential positions: first position, second
position, or third position. In second position, this includes repetition that is
responsive to an initiating action (e.g., an answer to a question). In third position,
repetition-related turns may register or otherwise be responsive to a prior,
second-position action following a sequence-initiating action; and in first position
as an initiating action itself. My focus in this chapter is on first position use of
repetition. Schegloff’s third criterion is that repetition shall only be considered

184
when it is not followed by further talk from the same speaker. This excludes, for
instance, the repetition practice of “targeting a next action” (Schegloff, 1996a),
where the speaker of the repeat is repeating the target utterance as a preliminary
to further turn-constructional units within the same speaking turn.
A fourth criterion is related to what Schegloff (1996a) calls “virtually
identical” repetition, which will also be considered in the current study. This type
of repetition consists of instances when some portion of the target utterance’s
composition is reproduced in the repetition. This, as Schegloff argues, need not
require a strict sense of what is or is not being repeated, thus allowing the
inclusion of “transformations geared to deixis, tense shift, speaker change, etc.,
as well as changes or prosody” (p. 525). Paraphrases or substantial
reformulations, however, are excluded from this analysis for two reasons: First,
because the repetition-based actions relevant to this chapter are fairly distinct
from reformulation-related phenomena; and second, to further differentiate the
current study from earlier research where these forms have been discussed
(e.g., Tannen, 1987a; 1987b; 1989). In sum, each of these four criteria informed
the types of repetition-related phenomena to be examined in the current chapter.

Prior literature on repetition in interaction
In this section, I review earlier literature related to repetition as a practice
for doing action (and in turn, make relevant certain kinds of responding actions).
As a phenomenon, rising-intoned repetition may be ambiguous in terms of what
recipient response is conditionally relevant. Questioning repeats are polar

185
(yes/no) interrogatives (Raymond, 2003), which minimally require confirmation or
disconfirmation as a relevant response. However, participants may also orient to
them as requiring more, such as elaboration (e.g., confirmation plus elaboration
or simply elaboration alone) (Raymond, 2013). In the end, the action import of
any given repetition-based interrogative will depend on the sequential
environment in which it occurs and, ultimately, must be worked out interactionally
among the participants.
Prior research indicates that there are two general sequential
environments in which this practice is used. First, the practice has been
documented in the environment following an initiating action, such as questions.
Second, the practice has been observed in the environment of informings, such
as news announcements or other types of tellings. Across each of these
environments, the following actions may constitute relevant responses:
“Confirmation,” “elaboration,” or “confirmation + elaboration.” I begin by giving an
overview of prior literature that has addressed the first of these two
environments, i.e., rising-intoned repetition following sequent-initiating actions.

Rising-intoned repetition in the environment of sequence-initiating actions
The first environment scholars have examined repetition to occur in is
following sequence-initiating actions. This may include repetition used by a
recipient following such actions as questions, requests, invitations, and others
that initiate a course of action. Much of what is known about repetition in this
environment comes from research about how interactants carry out repair in

186
ordinary conversation. Repair, according to Schegloff, Sacks, and Jefferson
(1977), refers to sets of interactional practices for managing troubles or problems
related to speaking, hearing, or understanding in talk (cf. Kitzinger, 2013). More
specifically, other-initiated repair refers to a recipient initiating a repair sequence
by targeting something in the prior talk (typically in the immediately-prior turn) as
being problematic in terms of speaking, hearing, or understanding. The speaker
initiating the repair often leaves the task of providing a solution for the repair to
the speaker who produced the trouble-source turn (“other-initiated self-repair”).
Following a sequence-initiating action (e.g., a question), rising-intoned
repetition may be used as a practice for accomplishing other-initiated repair.
When the recipient repeats (part of) a trouble source, they display greater access
to what was previously said when compared to some other repair initiation forms
(e.g., open class repair initiators such as “What?”). In Extract 6.1 below, the
practice of rising-intoned repetition is used to target a prior utterance as
problematic:
Extract 6.1 – [from Robinson 2013: 261-262]
01

Bob:

02

How’s your heater been working
these last few w:eeks.

03

Moe: My heater?

04

Bob: Yeah=in your car.

05

Moe:

Thuh bu:s?

06

Bob:

Yeah=or do you use it that (m[ich.)

07

Moe:

08

Bea:

[Oh: yeah
Was last night the first time you met

187
In line 03, Moe produces a phrasal TCU that repeats a portion of Bob’s prior turn
with final rising intonation (along with a shift from “your” to “my”). By only
repeating a single word from Bob’s prior turn (“heater”), Moe targets it as
problematic in terms of his understanding. As an action, it minimally makes
relevant confirmation (e.g., “Yeah”) yet it could also be responded to with
elaboration and/or clarification related to the targeted referent. In line 04, Bob
produces a confirmation (“Yeah”) and then elaborates by producing more specific
details regarding the location of the target referent (“in your car”).
In ordinary conversation, the type of response that is due following risingintoned repetition in this and other sequential environments may not always be a
straightforward matter (Robinson, 2014). In this particular case, Moe’s repetition
could potentially make two different actions relevant next: confirmation or
confirmation and elaboration/clarification on the topic (Bob eventually chooses
the latter). Hence, this case shows how the rising-intoned repetition practice (i.e.,
a polar interrogative form) can be used following a sequence-initiating action as a
practice for doing repair and thus responded to as such.
Robinson & Kevoe-Feldman (2010) have examined how repetition can be
used as a practice to target an action as a whole as problematic. For instance,
Extract 6.2 below (taken from Robinson & Kevoe-Feldman, 2010) shows the
recipient of a sequence-initiating action using a rising-intoned repetition to
reproduce the target turn in full form. Just prior to the extract, Ida has mentioned
to Vic that she had seen a mutual friend of theirs from college:
Extract 6.2 - [CH:5352]

22

23
24

VIC:

[(I always thought she was in=an awkward stage)]
she’d grow out of but maybe not heh heh heh

In contrast to Extract 1, this case shows how rising-intoned repetition can be
used as a practice for targeting an entire action as opposed to a smaller
component of the target turn. In line 17, Ida produces a full-form repetition

189
targeting Vic’s prior question (“Is She pretty?”) in line 15. This repetition
reproduces the entirety of the prior TCU with a final-rising intonation, thereby
displaying strong access to what was said and targeting the action as a whole as
a source of trouble (as opposed to a single word in the TCU). It is possible that
Ida’s repetition may be targeting the “out of the blue” nature of Vic’s prior
question. In line 19, Vic responds by providing a repair solution via a reformatted
version of his question reflecting Ida’s problem with understanding the prior
formulation.
In sum, this instance provides insight into how repetition practices in
ordinary conversation can be treated as having targeted the entire prior action as
being problematic (versus, say, only a particular word) and may lead the speaker
to produce a reformulation of the trouble source. In this way, full repetition may
indicate that the prior action (i.e., that which is targeted by the repetition) is
inapposite or “off” in some way. Additionally, this particular instance shows how,
in post-question position, a repetition initiates a repair sequences and thus leads
to delaying the recipient’s subsequent response.
In each of these two extracts, rising-intoned repetition is used as a
practice for implementing repair following a sequence-initiating action. However,
it is important to point out that the particular mechanisms at work in each case –
including repetition of prior talk and rising-pitch contours – are not exclusive to
the environment of repair alone. As I discuss more below, such repetition
practices may also be used as vehicles for implementing actions (potentially nonrepair related) in the sequential environment of informings.

190

Repetition in the environment of informings
The second environment in which repetition occurs (and the one most
relevant to the concerns of the current chapter) is following informing-related
actions, such as news announcements (cf. Terasaki, 1976). In ordinary
conversation, when information is produced by a speaker, its status as new
information (“news”) may be reflected in the manner in which recipients design
their initial responses to the action. These responses, what Jefferson (1981)
referred to as “news marks”, display an understanding of some component of the
prior turn as containing previously unknown information. Additionally, these
responses display an orientation to the target turn as worthy of further topicrelated talk. Similar to the prior sequential environment (i.e., sequence-initiating
actions), repetition-based actions deployed here may make relevant confirmation
(as the minimally required response), elaboration, or confirmation plus
elaboration.
One way to mark the prior turn as news is to receipt it with a “pro-repeat”
(Heritage, 1984; Jefferson, 1981; Schegoff, 1996a), a form that anaphorically
refers to some of the earlier talk.59 In the instance below, a pro-repeat form (“do
they,” with slightly-rising final intonation) is used to receipt the prior turn as news
as well as invite confirmation from the news deliverer:
Extract 6.3 - (NB:IV:3:1)

59

L:

I’m gonna take them up to Anthony’s and dye them

See Stivers (2005) for an analysis of pro-term repetition in response to questions.

because they dye uhb, the- perfect ma:tch.

3

E: →Do they,

4

L: → Yeah

5

E:

Ah hah,

6

L:

I mean sometimes you buy them at these places….

Here a pro-repeat design is treated as inviting confirmation of L’s prior
announcement. After L produces an announcement in lines 01 – 02, E initiates
repair using a pro-repeat in the form of an interrogative and rising intonation.
Given these features, E’s action makes relevant confirmation (and possibly
elaboration) from L next. In line 04, L delivers a minimal agreement token
(“Yeah”), confirming the import of his earlier action (from lines 01 – 02) and
displaying an understanding of the pro-repeat as making relevant a confirmation.
Next, in line 05, E’s production of a variant of a continuer (“Ah hah”) is
characterized by slightly rising intonation. This move treats L’s prior turn as
having been incomplete and thus conveys E’s recipiency to further elaboration
that is due on the topic. Put in a different way, E treats “Yeah” as not being a
sufficient response. Following this in line 06, L goes on to elaborate further on the
topic. On the whole, this instance provides insight into how the use of pro-repeat
forms can resemble the types of interactional practices that are used to initiate
repair (e.g., repetition, rising intonation). Furthermore, this case shows how, like
other repetition-related phenomena, pro-repeat practices may be treated as
making relevant confirmation or elaboration next (here both occur, though the
latter presumably only because the former was treated as being an insufficient
response).

192
Relatedly, Wilkinson & Kitzinger (2006) examined pro-repeats and other
repetition practices as a means of displaying surprise in the environment of
informings. In Extract 6.4 below, a caller on a UK home birth help line uses
repetition and prosody to register the presented information as unexpected or
astonishing (note: they are discussing breast feeding):
Extract 6.4 - [RT:471 Kitzinger BCC483

In this example, the call taker informs the caller about an activity being performed
by a category of people not typically associated with doing that activity (lines 01 –
02). The call taker further marks the information as surprising with the use of the
intensifier “even” (line 01). In response, the caller produces what Wilkinson and
Kitzinger term a display of “ritualized disbelief” (line 04), initiating an insertion
sequence to confirm the accuracy of the information imparted before displaying
alignment towards the surprise with a surprise token. The call taker confirms the
information with an affirmative “Yup”, thereby allowing the caller to then produce
a full surprise display in the next turn (“My goodness!” in line 06). In this case, a

193
repetition is used as a practice for constructing an intervening turn occurring
between an informing (i.e., the source of surprise, lines 01 – 02) and a turn
including a surprise token (line 06). Thus, repetition-related practices can also be
used in a post-informing environment to make relevant confirmation of something
surprising to a recipient.
Some scholars have also discussed the possibility of other specific turndesign practices that may contribute to repetition-based turns as being heard as
inviting confirmation or elaboration in next position. For instance, Jefferson
(1981) distinguished between “Oh”-plus-partial repeats, where the repetition is
preceded by an Oh token, and free-standing partial repeats, which do not include
such a preface. In the case shown below, the former is produced and then met
with confirmation:
Extract 6.5 (NB:I:1:17)
01

E:

They charge too much Guy.

02

G: Oh do they?

03

E:

Yeh I think so,

04

G:

What do they cha:rge.

This case shows how rising-intoned repetition may be used as a practice to invite
confirmation or elaboration from the recipient. In line 02, the recipient receipts the
prior turn with an Oh-prefaced, pro-form repetition (“Oh do they?”).60 This

60

In contrast to what happens in this case, Heritage (1985) has suggested an “Oh”preface may serve to modify the trajectory of these types of actions in different ways
(see Heritage, 1985, p. 339 – 441; cf. Schegloff, 2007, p. 155). More specifically, he
suggests that “Oh”-plus-partial repeat “more strongly projects recipient commitment to
further talk by reference to the ‘news’ “ (p. 341) when compared to either an “Oh” or
partial repeat that are free standing. While there is no clear consensus on these issues

194
instance of repetition is also produced with final-rising intonation, inviting further
talk on the topic from the recipients. In line 03, E backs down from his prior
epistemic stance in line 01 by emphasizing it as simply a matter of his personal
opinion (“Yeah I think so,”). Furthermore, E treats G’s repetition as making
relevant a confirmation (“Yeh”).
In the environment of informings, then, there are a common set of
possibilities for relevant responses from recipients: First, for confirmation or
disconfirmation; and second, for elaboration or confirmation and elaboration.
However, since the repetition practices for each of these environments and
actions are practically identical, participants may struggle with the ambiguity
about which action is being implemented (and as a result, what is relevant in
response). As Schegloff (1997) has noted, independent of the analyst’s point of
view, interactants themselves may also have trouble recognizing the action
import of a speaker’s use of repetition. Relatedly, Robinson (2013) has examined
repetition in ordinary conversation, specifically partial-questioning repetition,
while also considering its relationship to social epistemics and the problem of
action formation.61 The latter issue refers to how interactants utilize a range of
interactional resources (e.g., sequential position, interactional environment,
bodily resources, etc.) to design conduct that is “recognizable by recipients as
particular actions” (Schegloff, 2007, p. xiv).

in the literature, it underscores just how critical the resources of syntax and prosody may
be in understanding how repetition practices may be recognized as implementing certain
types of courses of action.
61
Although I do not engage directly with social epistemics in this chapter, I do address
several epistemic dimensions of these calls in Chapters 4 and 5.

195
For the current study, this problem emerges as an interactional ambiguity
between whether a call taker’s repetition makes relevant, on the one hand,
confirmation or rejection of a candidate hearing/understanding, or on the other
hand, elaboration. While elements like unit composition and sequential position
are all crucial for this larger (interactional) problem, as Robinson discusses, “they
are not (always) sufficient resources for the production of recognizable social
action” (p. 264). This suggests a type of duality of action that participants must
deal with when responding to these types of repetition practices in interaction.
To summarize this review, repetition has been documented to be an
interactional practice for accomplishing a range of social actions. Additionally,
recipients of repetition may encounter ambiguity in terms of the specific type of
action an instance of repetition is meant to accomplish. For these reasons, my
analysis of repetition in HelpNow calls will focus less so on attempting to simply
label each instance of repetition as implementing a particular action. Instead I will
analyze each instance in terms of the responding action it is treated as making
relevant next (i.e., how the caller displays an understanding of the repetitionbased action in their responding turn). In the end, as call takers use these
particular repetition practices, callers themselves must determine, based on the
sequential environment and other possible factors, what action is being
implemented and made relevant next: confirmation/disconfirmation, elaboration
on the topic-nominated matters, or confirmation + elaboration. In the next section,
I proceed to analyze the main repetition practices used at HelpNow.

196
Call takers’ use of rising-intoned repetition practices
Two broad types of repetition practices, full-form repetition and partialform repetition, have been observed in a larger collection of 26 instances of
repetition. In this section, I examine the compositional features of the different
repetition practices, the actions they are treated as doing by their recipients in the
interaction (primarily, soliciting confirmation or elaboration), and callers’ regular
resistance to the interactional (and institutional) job the repetition practices are
intended to implement. The repetition practices to be analyzed can be
understood as falling on a continuum that includes full-form repetition on one
end, which includes exact lexical repetition of the target turn (aside from
adjustments due to deixis, tense shift, speaker change, etc.), to partial-form
repetition, which involves reproducing anywhere from one to several words from
a turn-constructional unit or TCU (Robinson, 2013; Schegloff, 1997; Stivers,
2005)62.
1. Full-form repetition
This subsection focuses on call taker’s uses of full-form repetition, i.e.,
repeating the target turn in its entirety (aside from adjustments due to deixis,
tense shift, speaker change, etc.). I examine the relationship of this type of
repetition to the caller’s immediately prior action, its sequential location within the
call, and its lexical and prosodic features. The analyses that follow support two

62

TCUs are the building blocks of social action and the turns they inhabit. Several
different types of TCUs are possible: single-word TCUs (e.g., “No”), phrasal (e.g., “Over
there”), clausal (e.g., “But he didn’t”), and sentential (e.g., “I’m going to the store”). See
Schegloff (2007b) or Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (1974).

197
central claims about how full-form repetition is produced and responded to in
HelpNow calls: First, call takers regularly use full-form repetition as a practice for
eliciting elaboration from the caller regarding their crisis or problem; and second,
callers regularly resist this course of action by instead responding with a minimal
confirmation. However, before proceeding to these analyses, I provide a brief
overview of prior research that has specifically examined full-form varieties of
repetition.
Full repetition in ordinary conversation has received some attention in
prior literature (Bolden, 2009; Schegloff, 1997; Robinson & Kevoe-Feldman,
2010). As discussed earlier in this chapter, Robinson & Kevoe-Feldman (2010)
examined repetition as a sequence-initiating action. Their findings illustrated how
repetition can be used in response to questions to target that action as a whole
as problematic. While this phenomenon is specific to one type of sequential
environment (second position of question-answer sequences), it provides some
empirical support for how, in ordinary conversation, repetition of the entirety of a
participant’s prior utterance may be recognized as initiating repair and thus delay
a response to the question.
More generally, it must be pointed out that the use of this particular form of
repetition has been found to be relatively rare in ordinary conversation. In their
analysis of full form repetition following sequence-initiating actions, Robinson and
Kevoe-Feldman (2010) found only 20 instances across 80 hours of data from

198
ordinary conversation among friends and family.63 This is compared to the
current collection of 26 instances found across 15.7 hours of HelpNow calls
(though the entirety of this data have yet to be examined systematically). Thus, it
is notable how many cases were found in these crisis line calls.
Extract 6 includes an example of this practice as it typically occurs in the
collection. The full repetition occurs following the initial problem presentation and
is then met with a minimal response from the caller that resists the call taker’s
larger course of action:

Did something happen?

In lines 012 – 014, the caller produces a problem presentation that makes
available a somewhat ambiguous negative characterization of his current state (“I
don’t feel very good”), possibly referring to an aspect of his physical or mental
health. This is then replaced with an upgraded and headline-formatted report of
his psycho-emotional state (“I feel very down”).
In line 015 there is a considerable gap where the call taker could produce
some uptake of the caller’s turn or the caller could continue with their telling. In
016, the call taker, presumably orienting to the opportunity to probe the caller and
encourage elaboration, produces a repetition-based polar interrogative (“You’re
very down?”). In terms of composition, this turn is designed with basic
adjustments related to deixis (shift from first-person subject to second-person
“you” and from the verb “feel” to “are”), prosodic stress on the word “down” that
mimics the caller’s own intonational contour for the word, and final rising
intonation. As an action, it targets the caller’s prior turn as being expansion
relevant and invites the caller to say more on the topic.

200
In line 17, there is a 1.0 second gap, making a dispreferred response from
the caller projectable. Next, in line 018, the caller responds with a quicklyproduced confirmation with a minimal response token (“>Yeah<”). While this is
technically an agreeing (i.e., preferred) response, the gap that precedes it (along
with the choice of the minimal form and abrupt prosodic quality of “yeah”)
conveys only a weak, and perhaps reluctant, agreement.
Next, there is a 3.2 second gap where the caller could elaborate on his
reported circumstances. This response from the caller treats the call taker’s
repetition as having initiated repair in that it confirms the prior repetition as only a
candidate hearing. Moreover, this confirmation shows the caller’s orientation to
the form of the call taker’s action, while withholding the action it is arguably
designed to implement. Put differently, it is produced in a manner that projects no
further elaboration. Each of these elements (rushed production, following a gap,
only attending to its grammatical form) can be seen as contributing to the caller’s
(possible) enactment of tacit resistance in response to the call taker’s repetition.
The next segment of the extract provides additional evidence for this
analysis of the caller as being resistant to treating the prior repetition as soliciting
elaboration. In line 20, after a 3.2 second gap (line 19), the call taker again
pursues elaboration related to the caller’s earlier turn, yet this time does so more
explicitly by producing a yes/no interrogative (“Did something happen?”). This
action thus explicitly displays the call taker’s orientation to obtaining further
details from the caller regarding their crisis or problem. This pursuit by the call
taker provides further support for understanding the call taker’s earlier course of

201
action in using repetition to invite elaboration from the caller. By utilizing a
different interactional form, the call taker further demonstrates her orientation to
pursuing elaboration from the caller. Once faced with the caller’s tacit resistance
in response, the call taker proceeds to use a less ambiguous form to pursue
further talk on the issue. All in all, this case shows some of the key compositional
features of full-form repetition responses, how they can be positioned within the
course of the call and how it may be met with callers’ tacit resistance through
responses that are delayed and that disattend call takers’ larger course of action
of soliciting elaboration or confirmation and elaboration.
Extract 6.7 includes another instance of full repetition. Here the caller uses
her very first turn to launch a problem presentation right away:
Extract 6.7 – [019-0191]

This case shows a full-form repetition in response to a more densely packaged
initial turn from the caller. In lines 002 - 003, after the call taker’s initial turn

202
identifying the institution, the caller presents herself as a regular caller (“Yeah it’s
Jessica”) before swiftly moving to produce a second turn-constructional unit. She
initiates her problem presentation by reporting she has ceased seeing her
therapist. After a gap (line 004), the call taker receipts the prior turn with a
repetition-based turn (lines 005 – 006). This action is composed of a full
repetition with slight adjustments related to deixis and grammar (e.g., shift to the
pronoun ‘You’, grammatical adjustments with “anymore”), as well as final rising
intonation.
In line 007, there is a 0.2 gap that projects a dispreferred response from
the caller. Next, in line 008, the caller responds by confirming the assumption
conveyed in the call taker’s negatively-formatted interrogative. By responding
with “nope”, the caller is utilizing what Raymond calls a “no elaboration”-type
response. Such responses, according to Raymond (2013, p. 192), project turn
completion and the closing down of the possibility of elaboration. In examining
interaction in at-home medical care visits, Raymond found that the medical
visitors responded to such “no elaboration” responses from patients by displaying
an orientation to further talk as having been due. In this particular case, the caller
uses the no-elaboration format to respond to the general form utilized by the call
taker (rising-intoned interrogative) while withholding the response fitted to its
action (inviting elaboration). Thus, the caller responds to the form while
dissattending the larger course of action.
Similar to the prior case, the call taker then continues pursuing elaboration
by following up with an alternate turn format. In line 09, the call taker reclaims the

203
floor to solicit an account via Wh-questions (“Why not. What happened.”). In
doing so immediately after the caller’s prior response (line 008, with no gap
between both turns), the call taker displays an orientation to her course of action
as having been effectively resisted and redoes her solicitation (this time, without
repetition). This case provides further evidence for how full repetition, used by
call takers to solicit elaboration of problem presentations, can be met with tacit
resistance from callers.
Taken together, extracts 7 and 8 show two sequential environments in
which full-form repetition practices may be deployed. Call takers may deploy the
practice early on during callers’ problem presentations as a method for both
displaying their attentiveness (i.e., “active listening”) and inviting callers to
continue talking about their personal circumstances. In these cases and others
throughout the collection, full repetition is met with tacit resistance: callers’
responses are delayed, produced in a manner that project turn completion, and
disattend the course of action by withholding further talk on the topic. In some
cases, call takers’ subsequent questioning (i.e., post repetition resistance) further
demonstrate their orientation to their prior use of full repetition as an institutional
technique that seeks to pursue elaboration regarding callers’ problem
presentations.
While some full-repetition practices include minimal adjustments to their
target turn (i.e. deixis, tense, etc.), others may feature more overt types of
modifications in the design of the target turn. These changes may involve lexical
choice, syntax, or prosody. Depending on the extent of their modifications to the

204
target turn, they may or may not be treated as accurately repeating what the
caller had attempted to convey. In this sense, despite resembling the original
form, these repetitions can be taken to indicate disalignment with the caller’s
current course of action.
In the first case below, Extract 6.8, a full-form repetition is produced at
lines 065 - 066 and built off of the lexical content of the caller’s prior turn in 061 –
063. Just prior to this excerpt, the caller has presented her reason for calling by
announcing she will no longer be seeing her therapist. Following this report, the
call taker inquires about why she has made this decision. In line 33, the caller is
beginning to respond to this inquiry:

In lines 033 – 35 and 036 - 037, the caller produces an account in response to
the call taker’s earlier question as a way of justifying her decision to stop seeing
her therapist. The call taker produces a minimal response (line 039) followed by
a negative assessment (line 041). This leads to some confusion regarding the
import of the call taker’s assessment (lines 044 – 054). In line 055, the caller
continues with her account by adding that her decision was also influenced by
the wishes of the individuals who are close to her (her boyfriend and family
members).
In line 60, the call taker produces a minimal response token followed by
the caller moving on to a further problem she wishes to report: “And I don’t
wanna see nobody no more”. This unit includes an and-preface, suggesting it is a
continuation of the caller’s problem presentation begun at the beginning of the
call. Moreover, it qualifies as an extreme-case formulation (Pomerantz, 1986) by
emphasizing the caller’s desire to not see anyone anymore.
After a gap (line 064), the call taker produces a full-form repetition that
features some modifications to the lexical content and syntax of its target turn.
The construction is adjusted to “You don’t wanna see anybody anymore?”, with
modifications to deictic markers (‘I’ to ‘you’) and lexical content (with substitution
of the non-standard double negation from “nobody” with the more
conventionalized “anybody”). This action also features a marked prosodic
contour with stress on the initial phoneme of “anybody”, emphasizing its negative
polarity dimension, as well as final-rising intonation. It is possible that these
modifications (especially the substitution of “anybody”) serve to mitigate the

207
target assertion.
In line 67, there is a gap, projecting a dispreferred response from the
caller. In line 68, the caller produces the minimal agreeing response “Nope.” This
particular response form projects there to be no further elaboration to come and
that her turn is complete. As an action, the response fulfills the minimal response
required of a repetition-based polar interrogative form. However, it disregards the
larger course of action that it may seek to implement: soliciting expansion (e.g.,
an account for her assertion). The delayed and minimal nature of the response
(including disregard for the action) contributes to the caller’s enactment of tacit
resistance. While it is not clear that the call taker’s modifications to the caller’s
prior talk made any discernable change in the larger course of action (or its
resistance), these design features of repetition nevertheless provide insight into
further ways the practice may be put into action at HelpNow.
While the last case exhibited subtle modifications to full-form repetition
(which may not modify the action to any noticeable extent), more overt changes
may also occur such as subtle additions to the lexical content of the target turn.
Extract 6.9 below shows a full repetition turn design that includes a modification
that a caller treats as having introduced unwelcome changes to the action import
of his prior turn:

This case depicts how a call taker may produce a response turn with a risingintoned, full-form repetition in a way that incorporates modifications to the target
turn (in this case, additional lexical items). In lines 18 – 19, the caller produces a

209
problem presentation that incorporates the call taker’s name from the earlier
exchange of names. After a gap (line 20), the call taker reproduces the prior talk
in a virtually-identical fashion – with the exception of an added temporal
component (“today”), which was previously unstated (though possibly inferable).
Like the previous cases of full repetition, this instance occurs early on in the call
and thus displays the call taker’s orientation to the practice as a technique for
advancing the call through inviting further talk about the problem presentation.
As an action, the call taker’s response incorporates a candidate
understanding of the caller’s prior report. The lexical item “today” represents an
addition to the original composition of the target turn and imposes a temporal
duration for the caller’s reported state that is more explicitly short term in nature.
Thus, this formulation attributes “having a hard time” to his current and inprogress psycho-emotional state. In contrast, the caller’s original formulation
utilized the present continuous tense which may not be limited to such a narrow
span of time and instead index a longer period (e.g., a week, a semester, a year).
In line 22, there is a gap that projects a dispreferred response from the
caller. In line 23, the caller produces a confirmation via a minimal agreement
token, “Yeah:.”. This response fulfills the minimal response requirement of the
form of the call taker’s turn (i.e., polar interrogative) while its unit-final intonation
suggests no further talk to be forthcoming. As a result, the caller comes across
as attending to the form of the call taker’s turn while possibly disattending the
larger course of action of inviting expansion and elaboration. This treats the call

210
taker’s action as only making relevant confirmation and thus enacts passive
resistance to the larger course of action being pursued by the call taker.
What happens next, however, provides clearer evidence that the caller
was attending more closely to the repair-related features of the call taker’s polar
interrogative. After a gap in line 24 where the caller could have elaborated on his
problem, the caller continues in lines 25 – 26 by taking the floor again to produce
a correction (“For a long time not just today”). This move rejects the inferred
temporal component of the call taker’s candidate understanding that was added
in his full repetition. Thus, while the caller initially resists the call taker’s larger
course of action by producing a delayed, minimal confirmation, he later reclaims
the floor to redo his response to reject the additional component included in the
prior talk. All in all, this case shows how call takers may introduce more overt
changes via the full repetition practice. Furthermore, it demonstrates how callers
may attend to these types of modifications as being incongruent with what was
conveyed in their original turn.
To summarize this section, each of the four extracts analyzed in this
section have shown how full-form repetition is used by call takers as a practice
for responding to callers’ presentations of their crises or problems (as well as
“active listening”). Callers’ responses to this practice are typically delayed, may
be produced in a manner suggesting no further elaboration (e.g., “Nope”), and
display that they are disattending to the course of action these repetitions
implement.

211
Other cases have also depicted variations of the practice that incorporate
modifications to the target turn, such as its lexical content, syntax, and prosody.
While some modifications may not change the action import of the practice, other
changes (e.g., overt changes in lexical content) may be oriented to by callers as
being incongruent with the target turn. In other words, it is possible that more
overt modifications may impede the action of the headline (i.e., projecting further
talk about a crisis or problem). I next turn to examining how such repetition
practices may be positioned in a fashion that goes against the normative
structures of ordinary conversation.

2. Full-form repetition that targets non-contiguous TCUs
Callers’ problem presentations that unpack their current crises or
problems may extend into compound turns composed of multiple TCUs. During
these tellings, call takers may choose to produce forms of uptake that
demonstrate (and renew) their local interactional identity as telling recipients.
Several of the extracts discussed earlier have shown how call takers may use
repetition in this sequential environment, namely via repetition that targets the
immediately prior turn-constructional unit. Extract 6.10 (previously shown as
Extract 6.6) demonstrates this type of sequential relationship between a call
taker’s full-form repetition and the caller’s immediately prior TCU:

In this case, the call taker produces the full repetition “You’re very down” in line
16. This repeat targets the latter of two turn-constructional units in the caller’s
prior turn. Therefore, this case illustrates a repetition that targets a unit that is
contiguously positioned (aside from the gap in line 15) and prior to further talk
being produced by the caller.
However, in 4 cases in my collection, similar repetitions actually target a
non-contiguous unit in the prior turn. These cases go against what Sacks (1987)
proposed as the “preference for contiguity” in conversation, which describes how

213
turns at talk within adjacency pairs are typically responsive to the immediately
contiguous unit in a prior multi-unit turn. Therefore, by using repetition on a unit
other than the immediately contiguous one, the speaker displays their
disattention to subsequent TCUs. With respect to ordinary conversation, this
phenomenon is unusual. Even if the call taker in each instance could be
presumed to be targeting what is therapeutically relevant (i.e., reported emotions
or other details that they deem relevant to the broader therapeutic agenda of the
call), callers in most instances still respond by treating these as disaligning
moves by their enactment of tacit resistance in response.
Robinson (2013), in discussing the sequential machinery of repair, has
proposed the idea of the repair-opportunity space. As he argues, at each
transition-relevance place in interaction, there are socially-organized
opportunities – the repair-opportunity space – provided for repairing the prior talk.
It is in this next-turn space where recipients may proceed with either initiating
repair (Schegloff, Jefferson, & Sacks, 1977) or displaying their understanding of
the prior conduct through producing some form of talk (e.g., a responding action,
another initiating action, etc.). In this way, the next turn at talk “facilitates
participants’ assessments of the need for repairing troubles with speaking,
hearing, or understanding” (Robinson, 2014, p. 110). Furthermore, there is
substantial research (e.g., Heritage, 1984b; Schegloff, 1992) documenting next
turn talk to be a significant source of interactional evidence that interactants rely
upon in order to accomplish and sustain intersubjectivity. That is, once this nextturn slot has passed, so has the conventional opportunity to initiate repair on

214
anything problematic (i.e., in terms of speaking, hearing, or understanding) in the
prior talk.
Robinson’s work holds key insights for the cases to be examined in this
section. One of the central analytic claims of this chapter so far has been that
callers respond to call takers’ repetition with tacit resistance in only attending to
the form used (polar interrogative) and only producing confirmation as a
response. In the cases of non-contiguously placed repetition analyzed below, the
call taker’s full-form repetition is produced as delayed (i.e., in terms of timing) and
non-contiguously positioned relative to the target TCU (i.e., targeting a TCU that
is not the immediately prior TCU). Using Robinson’s terminology, these instances
of repetition are thus produced after the repair-opportunity space. Thus, the noncontiguous placement of repetition may further contribute to callers’ resistant
responses.
In extract 6.11 this type of full repetition occurs just after the call opening
as the caller is beginning their initial problem presentation:

Here the call taker produces a full-repetition turn in a sequential position that is
non-contiguous with the TCU that it targets. In line 015, the call taker solicits the
caller’s reason for calling with a more conversational practice, “What’s goin on”
(compared to a more conventionally-institutional solicitation, such as “What can I
help you with?”, see Baker, Emmison, & Firth, 2001). In 017, the caller produces

216
an initial characterization of their problem using a headline-type format (see Ch.
5) that features unit-final intonation (“I just feel down.”). In line 018, there is a one
second gap where uptake from the call taker is relevant. This projects a problem
on the part of the call taker.
In lines 019 - 023, the caller reclaims the floor and produces an
elaboration of his initial problem presentation. In line 019, the caller begins with a
sentential unit (“I just feel uncomfortable with myself”) and, after its completion, is
followed by compressed transition-relevance place before the onset of caller’s
next unit (“I just don’t know…”). In terms of turn allocation, this “rush through”
(Schegloff, 1982; 1987b; cf. Clayman, 2013) circumvents the possibility of turn
transition by condensing the space in which the call taker might ordinarily launch
a turn (i.e., in the possible transition-relevance place following the caller’s first
TCU). Thus, the call taker is unable to take the floor to respond to the caller’s
initial TCU without producing overlapping talk (Hayashi, 2013). After producing
several further TCUs, in line 023, the caller produces the device “you know,”
possibly to solicit uptake and/or agreement from the call taker. Following this in
line 24, there is a gap projecting some trouble on the part of the call taker.
Next, in lines 25 – 26, the call taker takes the floor to produce a repetition
(“You feel uncomfortable with yourself?”). In terms of composition, the turn is a
rising-intoned polar interrogative that consists of full-form repetition, replicating
an earlier unit from the caller’s larger multi-unit turn (lines 019-023). As an action,
the repetition treats the caller’s discomfort with himself as therapeutically
relevant, or as including specific emotions or precipitating events the call taker

217
deems relevant to a larger therapeutic agenda. In doing so, the call taker selects
these elements as worthy of further topic talk.
The sequential position of the call taker’s action is especially important to
highlight here. The interrogative is not positioned in a sequential location
contiguous to the target TCU (i.e., the target of the repetition is not the
immediately prior TCU). Moreover, the subsequent TCUs produced after the
targeted TCU (i.e., after “I just feel uncomfortable with myself”) are, in a sense,
sequentially deleted in light of the interrogative targeting the talk that occurred at
an earlier (non-contiguous) point (i.e., prior to the immediately prior TCU). Thus,
while the call taker targets something in the caller’s prior talk that she deems to
be most therapeutically relevant, she does so at the cost of displaying a
disattention to more sequentially-local matters.
In line 27, there is a gap where a response is relevant from the caller, and
which projects a dispreferred response. In line 28, the caller produces
confirmation in response through a minimal agreement token (“Yeah.”). While
this response fulfills the minimum response requirements of a polar interrogative,
the interactional form (“Yeah”) and unit-final falling intonation project turn
completion and no further elaboration on the matter. In doing so, this response
displays attentiveness to the form of the call taker’s move while downplaying the
action it aims to accomplish. Thus, by only providing a delayed, minimal
response next, the caller comes across as withholding elaboration and tacitly
resisting the larger course of action pursued by the call taker.

218
In line 29, there is a 2.0 gap where the caller could further elaborate on his
problem. Following this gap, in line 30, the call taker produces a follow-up probe
(“Tell me more”) formatted as a directive. This is a more institutional or
therapeutic-style probe than is typically used to invite elaboration in ordinary
conversation (e.g., “Oh really?”, see Jefferson, 1981). By designing her turn in
this way, the call taker implements a course of action that follows up on the
caller’s initial problem presentation (lines 17 and 19 – 23) and further solicits
elaboration that was initially attempted in lines 25 – 26. This move by the call
taker supports the analysis of her earlier repetition as attempting to solicit
elaboration. In sum, this case demonstrates how the non-contiguous placement
of repetition (after the repair opportunity space) may further contribute to issues
of disalignment related to the call taker’s larger course of action of soliciting
expansion. Consequently, this type of sequential placement may further
contribute to the tacit resistance enacted by callers in response.
Examining full repetition in non-contiguous positions shows how repetition
may be used in ways that go against the normative structures of interaction (e.g.,
preference for contiguity). This usage, when compared to repetition practices in
ordinary conversation, is highly unconventional. Call takers may very well be
attempting to target what is therapeutically relevant in the caller’s telling, thereby
nominating a therapeutically-relevant matter to be due for further focus and
elaboration. However, this may come at the cost of the actions being produced
non-contiguously and after the repair-opportunity space. In turn, it may be met
with disalignment from callers as reflected in their resistant responses.

219
In summary, this section has explored an alternate sequential placement
for full-form repetition practices. In being placed non-contiguously, full repetition
goes against conventional structures of interaction (i.e., preference for
contiguity). Next, I examine partial-form repetition, a variation of the phenomenon
that only reproduces a select portion of the target turn.

3. Partial repeats
Partial repetition, or repetition that only re-uses a portion of the target
turn’s lexical composition, represents a further way in which call takers may
respond to callers’ problem presentations. This set of repetition practices may
include from one to several elements of a prior turn-constructional unit (Heritage,
2014; Stivers, 2010). Participants need not reproduce the entirety of a turn or unit
to be heard as doing repetition. Schegloff (1996a) underscores this point by
emphasizing the mutability of any type of repetition-based turns:
“In this regard it should be noted that some turns are hearably and analyzably
produced as ‘repeats,’ even if in one or more respects they actually fail to
reproduce (either in whole or in part) their apparent, nonetheless retrievable,
target. That is, exact matching to some prior utterance or utterance part is not
a sole or strict criterion for recognizing these repeats as repeats (…)
Recipients can hear that such turns were designed to be repeats even if, and
for repair purposes especially if, they misrepresent their target in some
important respect.” (p. 525)
As Schegloff emphasizes here, the portion of the utterance being repeated may
be modified yet still be recognizable as retrieving something prior for the
purposes of performing a particular action. While Schegloff may not have been
focusing specifically on partial repetition here, his larger argument about

220
repetition as a phenomena is helpful for understanding the link between
repetition practices and the recognizeability of action.
The partial-repetition practices found in the HelpNow collection more
closely resemble how repetition is typically used in ordinary conversation (see
the earlier review of past literature), unlike their full-repetition counterparts.
Several core features of partial-repetition practices will be examined here
drawing from a sub-collection consisting of 8 instances. These features are as
follows: First, the practice only targets a portion of the target turn (e.g., one to
several lexical items); second, the instances in the collection represent early
uptake, when the call taker is responding to (and encouraging elaboration
regarding) the caller’s initial presentation of their crisis or problem; third, the
larger course of action pursued by call takers through this practice is often tacitly
resisted when callers produce responses that attend to the interactional form
(polar interrogative) rather than the action (soliciting elaboration).
In the first case, Extract 6.12, we see an instance that shows a partial
repetition positioned early on in the call following the caller’s initial problem
presentation:

Here the call taker uses the practice of partial repetition to nominate a topic for
further elaboration in response to the caller’s problem presentation. After the call
opening, the caller presents his initial problem with “I’m anxious today Gina” (line
011) which is then upgraded via the through-produced increment “really bad”
(line 012). In line 13, there is a gap where the caller could elaborate with further
details about their prior report. In line 14, possibly orienting to the opportunity to
probe the caller for further details, the call taker produces a rising-intoned polar
interrogative. This construction incorporates partial repetition of the caller’s
reported state from line 011. As an action, the interrogative targets the topic of
the caller’s reported anxiety for further elaboration.
In line 15, there is a gap where an uptake is due from the caller, which
thereby projects a problem. In line 16, the caller responds by repeating himself

222
(specifically “I’m anxious” from line 11). This unit is characterized with final-rising
intonation and is also followed by the minimal agreement token, “Yeah”
(produced in a whisper voice). In building a response like this, including an exact
redoing of the turn that was targeted by the call taker (“I’m anxious. Yeah.”), the
caller responds to the prior turn’s interrogative form by twice producing
confirmation (i.e., first, via repetition of the target turn; and second, with the
agreement token “Yeah”). This effectively withholds any further details about the
problem.
Moving on, the call taker then pursues the line of action using an alternate,
non-repetition based practice. In line 17, there is a gap where the call taker could
further pursue elaboration or initiate a new course of action. Then, in line 18, the
call taker deploys a general topic solicitation device (“What’s going on”). As an
action, this accomplishes a more explicit route to pursuing elaboration from the
caller and thus treats the caller’s prior response as resistant to this course of
action.
This initial case of partial-form repetition shows several features of the
practice, in addition to targeting only a portion of the target turn. First, it is used
early on in the call as a method for responding to the caller’s initial problem
presentation and encouraging them to elaborate on those matters. Second, after
a gap, the caller tacitly resists the larger course of action by only responding to
the minimal response requirements of the interactional form (a polar
interrogative).

223
Instances of partial repetition may also occur at later points in the call and
exhibit similar interactional features. Extract 6.14 includes a second case of
partial repetition, which occurs nearly two minutes into the call. Up to this point,
the caller has struggled with articulating a possible source or precipitating event
that may have led to his distressed mental state (which he initially reports with
“my mind is so overwhelmed I can hardly deal with it”). Immediately prior to the
segment below, the caller has attempted to offer an analogous description of the
types of emotions he is feeling (“Like kinda spinning around?”). The call taker
then produces a minimal agreement token to align with this characterization
(“Yeah::”). The start of the excerpt below features the caller again attempting to
describe the feelings he is dealing with in a more concrete fashion:

Here the call taker uses partial repetition as a way of targeting a specific portion
of the caller’s problem formulation, presumably for its therapeutic relevance and
to further direct the telling to a more concrete understanding of the caller’s mental
state. The caller is engaged in elaborating on his problems in lines 01 – 03 and
09 – 10 while the call taker treats both as part of an ongoing course of action with
minimal responses in lines 05 (“Mm”) and 12 (“Yeah”). The call taker produces a
formulation in lines 14 - 17 (based on the caller’s characterization of his “head
spinning” earlier in the call) which the caller rejects and then moves to offer his
own formulation in lines 021 – 023.
In line 24, the call taker produces a minimal agreement token (“Yeah”)
followed by another formulation produced with final-rising intonation to invite a
display of alignment or disalignment from her recipient. In line 26, there is a gap
that projects a dispreferred response. Next, in line 27, the caller produces
confirmation with a minimal agreement token, “Yeah”. The call taker then
responds to the caller with a continuer, “Mm”, in line 028. This displays the call
taker’s orientation to the caller’s response as incomplete and renews his own
recipiency to further elaboration. This is followed by a gap in line 29, where the
caller could continue by providing further details regarding his feelings or the call
taker could deploy a different probing technique to elicit further talk.
Next, in line 30, the caller reclaims the floor and produces a further
characterization of his current state by describing himself as “desperate” (line 31)

226
(which is later upgraded to “really desperate” in line 32). Next, presumably
orienting to the therapeutic relevance (and possible risk-related implications) of
this characterization, the call taker targets the prior turn through partial repetition
with “Desperate?”. This repeat is a single-word TCU, selecting only the word
“desperate” and producing it with final-rising intonation. In terms of action, this
repetition invites further elaboration on how the caller feels “desperate”.
In line 35, there is a gap where uptake is due from the caller, suggesting a
problem on his part. The caller then produces a response that attends to the
minimal response relevance of the form of the call taker’s prior action (a polar
interrogative) in just producing the minimal agreement token, “yeah” (line 36).
This unit is produced with unit-final intonation, projecting possible turn completion
and possibly that no further elaboration is forthcoming (this usage may be similar
to Raymond’s aforementioned analysis of “nope” as part of “no elaboration”
responses). In any case, the caller’s action as a whole chiefly attends to
interactional form as opposed to the call taker’s larger course of action. In this
sense, the caller can be seen as withholding elaboration and tacitly resisting the
action at hand.
Next, in line 037, there is a 6.2 second gap where the caller could provide
additional details about his problems. In lines 038 – 039, the call taker again
pursues elaboration on the topic but frames her action more explicitly as a yes/no
interrogative question (“Is that something you’d like to talk about more”). This
question further demonstrates the call taker’s earlier repetition-related course of
action as an attempt to invite elaboration (which proved to be unsuccessful).

227
In a third case, Extract 6.14, we again see how partial repetition can be
deployed as a practice for responding to the caller’s initial problem presentation.
However, unlike the prior two cases, this case includes a caller who responds to
the repetition with elaboration about the targeted topical matters. Like the first
case, this partial repeat occurs near the beginning of the call:

This extract includes an instance of partial repetition being used effectively to
invite further topic talk. In lines 14 – 15, the caller builds a response to the howare-you inquiry initiated as part of the call taker’s earlier turn (lines 06 – 07)
where she displayed recognition of the caller’s identity. The caller begins with a
“well” preface and then begins to produce “I’m okay” before abandoning it. The
caller then restarts his unit by reporting that he has had a “long day” (a
euphemistic expression for having a difficult or stressful day), possibly projecting
elaboration.
This report represents the first point at which the caller’s problem(s) are
presented (or at least inferable). In line 016, there is a gap where the caller could
provider further details regarding his day (e.g., what happened to make it a “long
day”). In line 017, the call taker orients to the caller’s prior report as
therapeutically relevant through the partial-repetition practice. The design of this
turn selects and reproduces the caller’s prior talk as a phrasal turn-constructional
unit with slightly rising intonation (“Long day,”). As an action, it solicits expansion
regarding the caller’s matters and makes relevant either confirmation, elaboration
or confirmation followed by elaboration.
Next, in line 18, the caller takes the floor and continues with further details
about his day. This response displays the caller’s orientation to the call taker’s
repetition-based action as encouraging him to continue (perhaps similar to a
continuer, see Schegloff, 1982). All in all, this case includes an instance of
repetition that is successful in inviting the caller to talk further about their initial
problem presentation.

229
To sum up, similar to full repetition, partial repetition practices are routinely
used in the HelpNow collection to probe callers and invite further elaboration
about a particular, possibly therapeutically-relevant facet of their initial problem
presentation. Generally, this interactional practice consists of repeating a select
portion of the caller’s prior turn at talk (ranging from a single word to a sentential
TCU). While partial repetition is more analogous to the repetition practices that
are conventionally used in ordinary conversation (compared to full repetition),
callers tend to respond with tacit resistance by withholding elaboration in favor of
minimal confirmation.

Institutional Implications
The prior analysis has implications for the types of practices call takers are
trained to use during HelpNow’s call taker training. As discussed at the beginning
of this chapter, the practice of repeating the caller’s prior words is currently
recommended as a technique for displaying that the call taker is actively
attending to caller’s talk (“active listening”) as well as to encourage the caller to
continue (elaborate). Additionally, the practice represents an institutionally
permissible and sanctioned way of responding to callers’ concerns instead of, for
instance, providing advice, opinions, or assessments of the caller’s situation. My
findings suggest, however, that repetition practices may not be effective in
accomplishing the institutional job they are supposed to do. Thus, these findings
may hold recommendations for revising call taker trainings to better accomplish

230
call takers’ immediate interactional tasks and, in turn, HelpNow’s larger
institutional mission.

Conclusion
This chapter has analyzed the practice of repeating – either partially or in
full - what the caller has said when call takers are responding to callers’
presentation of their issues. The practice is institutionally recommended as a
technique for embodying active listening and encouraging the caller to talk further
while withholding overt assessment or advice. In practice, however, callers
respond to repetition-based turns in ways that resist the call taker’s larger course
of action by withholding elaborating in favor of minimal confirmation. Thus, while
both full-form repetition and partial-form repetition practices appear to serve
similar institutional functions, the resistance they are met with from callers seems
to suggest they do not meet the institutional mission of HelpNow.

Chapter 7: Conclusions
The central aim of this dissertation was to apply a communicationcentered perspective in order to examine help seeking processes in the context
of mental health, crisis intervention, and telephone help lines. As mental health
researchers continue to investigate how those in need of mental health care seek
out such resources, examining the role of communication is critical. By
considering how the notions of crisis and suicide may be established and
managed in social interaction, this study has documented some of the concrete
communication practices that participants may deploy for these help-seeking
purposes.
The goal of this chapter is to summarize and conclude the current study.
First, I summarize the core findings of the dissertation. Second, I discuss
implications of these findings for three key domains: crisis intervention and
suicide prevention, language and social interaction, and communication studies
more generally. Third, I go over some limitations of the study. Finally, I propose
several directions for future research investigating communication on crisis lines.

Summary
In this dissertation, through a close examination of a corpus of help line
calls, I described how participants jointly negotiate problems - which are both
institutional and personal in nature - regarding distress and mental health. The
findings of this study contribute to an understanding of communication processes
on telephone crisis help lines. I showed how call takers go about managing

232
different phases of the call, specifically the opening and the problem presentation
(“reason for calling”), as well as a specific techniques call takers use for
responding to callers’ personal circumstances (repetition). Thus, the study
provides an in-depth analysis of how crisis line representatives accomplish their
institutional mission in facilitating the request and provision of help for callers. In
the space below, I briefly summarize the main findings of the dissertation.
One finding of this dissertation is an assortment of communication
practices through which different institutionally-significant identity categories
(first-time caller, repeat caller, and regular caller) are co-constructed in calls. The
following characteristics of these identity categories were discussed: First-time
callers, who present themselves as calling for the first time; regular callers, who
call on a regular basis; and return callers, who present themselves as having
called the crisis line in the past (yet not to the extent of a “regular” by presuming
specific knowledge on part of their call taker). As we have seen, each identity
category is jointly negotiated through callers’ and call takers’ use of particular
interactional practices. Ultimately, these practices propose different ways of
knowing about and relating to HelpNow as a social institution. Furthermore, the
enactment of these interactional identities may contribute to the inferential work
call takers must perform with regard to what type of call is being entered into
(e.g., urgent or non-urgent, someone who is okay with being temporarily placed
on hold, etc.).
The specific communication processes through which callers present their
focal problem on a crisis help line represent a second finding of the dissertation. I

233
examined multiple possible sequential environments and a set of interactional
practices (single unit vs. multi-unit formats) through which callers and call takers
accomplish this important stage of the call. This stage of the call was also shown
to be a possible environment for further identity work as callers may frame their
issue(s) in ways that either presume institutional memory on part of the call taker
or orient to the need to include greater background to facilitate the call taker’s
understanding.
A third finding of the dissertation concerns call takers’ use of repetition as
an institutionally-backed interactional practice used to respond to callers’
presentations of their crisis or problem. While in theory the technique is
supposed to demonstrate call takers’ “active listening” and encourage the caller
to continue, a detailed analysis has shown little evidence that this is effective in
practice. As we have seen, callers’ responses to repetition-based turns are
regularly delayed, designed with a minimal-response format, and as a result,
resist the call taker’s larger course of action of soliciting elaboration.

Implications
Implications for research on crisis help lines
This study contributes to the larger literature on help lines associated with
crisis intervention and suicide prevention. One implication of this research is the
application of conversation analysis as a research method for conducting
research in this area. Instead of relying on macro-level correlational data, ratings
of simulated interactions, or reactions from callers long after they have utilized

234
the crisis services, this methodological approach emphasizes looking at actual
communication in its naturally occurring context of use. This enables the
researcher to analyze the communication processes of crisis help lines as they
actually occurred for the participants, i.e., in real-time, unprovoked by researcher
protocols or artificial settings. In addition, conversation analysis provides an
unparalleled look at the minute details of human interaction while also being
firmly grounded in participants’ own conduct. As a result, the research that
results from CA demonstrates a process-oriented perspective on how callers and
call takers organize their interactions on the crisis line as well as manage the
turn-by-turn contingencies of requesting and providing help. Thus, the
dissertation offers further support (beyond the seminal work of Harvey Sacks) for
utilizing discourse-centered methods in the domain of crisis intervention and
suicide prevention.
A second implication of this research is insight into how crisis line callers’
prior relationships with call takers may be subtly invoked through the routine
mechanisms of interaction, e.g., call openings (Chapter 4). This provides a richer
perspective on what these institutionally-significant categories look like in action
and how they are interactionally negotiated through talk. For example, the
research examining calls with regular callers (i.e., “chronic callers”, see Lester,
Brockopp, & Blum, 2012) offers some insight into communication practices for
managing what are typically long-term relationships with this population.
A third implication of the dissertation is more practical in nature and
relates to how call takers are trained at crisis help lines. While much of crisis line

235
training typically relies on role-play (see Knickerboker & McGee, 1973; Mishara,
Chagnon, Daigle, Balan, Raymond, Marcoux, Bardon, Campbell, & Berman,
2007), the transcripts developed for this study are based on naturally-occurring
interactions and could be incorporated into training materials for crisis help lines.
Similar research on help lines has been used to develop hands-on workshops for
call takers that make use of real-life data in order to simulate new types of
situations or issues they may encounter in the future (Stokoe, 2011).

Implications for research on language and social interaction
The findings presented in this study also contribute to the literature on
language and social interaction (including conversation analysis, i.e., talk-in
interaction). One implication of the study is new insight into how epistemic
asymmetries and institutional memory may be managed in institutional
interaction. Whereas ordinary conversation has presumed a type of “equal
participation” standard, institutional talk has been described as being
“characteristically asymmetrical” (Drew & Heritage, 1992, p. 47). For instance, in
the case of 911 calls, call takers possess greater knowledge related to what
constitutes a legitimate emergency, when emergency resources are dispatched,
and various call taking procedures (Whalen & Zimerman, 1987; Zimmerman,
1992). At HelpNow, in addition to their institution-specific training, knowledge of
protocols, etc., call takers also have computer-aided access to a vast repository
of caller-specific information as well as their own memory of prior interactions

236
with particular callers.64 My own professional competencies as a crisis line call
taker at HelpNow suggest that call takers’ ability to carefully display and manage
what it is they know during calls is essential to preserving the non-clinical and
anonymous-oriented tone of the service. All in all, this has implications for
understanding rights to knowledge and the larger complexities of managing
“institutional memory” in interaction.
A second implication of this research is new insight into role of
relationships on help lines. In prior CA-based help line research, minimal
attention has been given to the phenomenon of subsequent or repeat calls
(Danby, Baker, & Emmison, 2005, p. 149; Murtagh, 2005, p. 292). Shaw and
Kitzinger (2007) in particular offered a more comprehensive look at how this
issue relates to issues of institutional memory, yet the study examined a help line
with a single call taker. The current study examines a more complex institutional
setting with multiple call takers where long-term relationships between callers
and call takers are typical. Little research has addressed this specific type of
long-term institutional relationship and it has the potential to reveal how the
traditionally more cognitive notion of memory is actually something that is
interactionally controlled and negotitated (cf. Mandelbaum, 2010). The

64

It is important to point out how this institutional setup is different from the prior
research relating to memory in help line interaction. In the case of Shaw and Kitzinger’s
(2007) work on home birth lines, the data that were analyzed focused specifically on the
single call taker who was responsible for running the line out of her home. In contrast,
HelpNow has over 100 call takers and thus callers may never get the same call taker if
they call twice. Secondly, Pudlinski’s (2005) research discusses some epistemic issues
related to how many call takers know the callers outside of the help-line context. As
mentioned earlier in the study (see Chapter 3), this type of relationship is strongly
discouraged at HelpNow.

237
dissertation relates issues of epistemic access to the larger management of
institutional relationships with particular callers, often involving several call takers
across different shifts. Thus, the research establishes how important the notion of
relationships may be to other emotional support telephone services and other
types of “personalized” social institutions as well.
A final implication of the dissertation is insight into the highly malleable
boundary between ordinary interaction and institutional interaction. The research
provides further support for what Stokoe (2013) has referred to as a “soft
institution”, or institutional contexts where the types of displayed orientations to
institutional aims, identities, or inferential frameworks, may not be as apparent.
Several of the interactional mechanisms examined in HelpNow calls resemble
practices of ordinary conversation. For instance, we have seen how these calls
may include the presence of how-are-you sequences (see Chapter 4, Chapter 5)
and particular forms of repetition that resemble how repair is typically done in
ordinary conversation (Chapter 6). It is possible that this is a product of calls
being primarily fielded by non-professional volunteers (see Chapter 2) and the
help line’s mission to offer a service that is non-directive, emphasizes active
listening (see Chapter 3), and offers assistance with a wide range of mentalhealth issues and referrals. This is in contrast to crisis lines with more narrow
functions and that are more strict in only budgeting call time for individuals who
present themselves as suicidal. Ultimately, this underscores the constitutive role
of language and interaction in how participants experience and navigate different
social institutions.

238

Implications for communication studies research
This dissertation also holds implications for research in the broader
discipline of Communication Studies. Broadly speaking, this community of
scholars is interested in investigating the role of communication as it relates to a
variety of forms, contexts and outcomes. I focus on implications related to the
disciplinary sub-areas of interpersonal communication, organizational
communication, and health communication.
One implication for interpersonal communication scholarship is that taking
an interaction-centered approach can reveal how identities and relationships are
constructed and worked out within actual situated encounters. The perspective
adopted in the current study is that identities and relationships are dynamic,
social accomplishments that are collaboratively established, managed, and even
contested through participants’ social conduct (Antaki & Widdicombe, 1998;
Mandelbaum, 2003; Mokros, 2003). In this way, instead of presupposing and
imposing the relevance of these categories on participants’ interactions, detailed
analyses revealed the specific communicative practices that were used by callers
and call takers to implicate the relevance of identity and relationship-related
issues. For instance, how-are-you sequences may be conducted in ways that
index a regular-caller identity and shared interactional history (see Chapter 4).
Similar identity and relationship implications can be introduced when callers
frame their problem presentation as an “update”, building upon a presumed
shared background on the issue. Overall, this demonstrates how larger social

239
categories such as identities and relationships can be made observable in the
dynamics of participants’ own communicative activities.
The dissertation also has implications for organizational communication
scholarship in providing new insights into “knowledge management”, or how
organizational members (in this case, on crisis help lines) transmit and manage
organizational knowledge (e.g., Canary & McPhee, 2011; Leonardi & Treem,
2012; Zorn & Taylor, 2004). We have seen that call takers at HelpNow carefully
attend to the details of the interaction in order to manage their right to knowledge
that is both institutional and personal in nature. Particularly in the case of regular
callers, call takers may choose to deploy institutional knowledge about the
caller’s personal circumstances (e.g., a caller’s first name, their chronic
problems, etc.). Thus, the current research shows how issues of organizational
knowledge sharing can be grounded in the details of organizational members’
own communication practices.
A further set of implications comes from the innovative perspective that
has been adopted here for investigating health communication and mental
health. Scholarship in the tradition of health communication typically focuses on
particular communication forms (e.g., social support, Segrin, & Passalacqua,
2010), within specific relational contexts (e.g., romantic couples in Knobloch,
Knobloch-Fedders, & Durbin, 2011; parent/child dyads in Mokros & Poznanski,
1995; physician/patient relationships: Rotger & Hall, 2011), and as delivered
through various organizational structures (Lammer, Duggan, & Barbour, 2003).
The current study has implications for each of these foci in that its findings show

240
how each can be studied through the detailed analysis of crisis help line
interactions. As we have seen, particular communication forms were employed
(see Chapter 4, 5, and 6) to (re)construct both caller – call taker relationships and
the mission and norms of the larger health organization (HelpNow).
Finally, the study holds implications for understanding what constitutes
“doing mental health”. The analyses presented give some insight into how people
co-construct mental health in everyday life, especially in specific institutional
contexts where help for mental-health issues is sought and provided. Callers may
make available a characterization of their current psychological state (e.g., “I feel
down”) which may shape call takers’ sense of whether the issue is a legitimate
one for HelpNow (“helplineable”). Call takers are then instructed to follow up with
specific interactional techniques in order to get the caller to say more about their
state and how (if at all) it relates to a specific crisis or problem. Although call
takers may not be licensed clinicians, this approach indexes a dimension of
clinical (therapeutic) reasoning that shapes how these calls may unfold. In a
sense, call takers are trained to probe for a central cause or precipitating event
that underlies a caller’s focal issue (e.g., feeling “down”).
In this way, crisis help lines such as HelpNow may emphasize a degree of
specificity with regard to how callers ought to construct (“do”) mental health
during calls. However, it is possible that the clinical reasoning that underlies call
takers’ communication practices may not align with how callers themselves (i.e.,
those seeking assistance with mental health issues) understand the nature of
their distress or the manner in which it ought to be communicated in order to

241
receive the help they are seeking. In other words, while a caller may call about
feeling “down”, they may also be unable to articulate the central cause or
precipitating event(s) that led to that state of distress (nor think that either are
even necessary to utilize the service in the first place). At a more conceptual
level, this could suggest that help seekers’ methods of formulating the self (i.e.,
self-presentation) may be at odds with the very outlets (social institutions) where
these mental health services and other resources are at stake. In terms of
understanding communication and help seeking processes, these are critical
issues for crisis line practitioners and researchers.

Limitations
Several limitations exist with the current study. One limitation is that a
small number of calls in the collection (less than 15) consists of callers who
present themselves as being in highly-distressed states (e.g., crying) and/or with
moderate to high levels of risk (e.g., suicidal ideation, talk of other forms of selfharm). It is possible that this was a product of the time of day when most of the
calls provided for this study were recorded by HelpNow’s staff. Information from
the help line’s administrators suggests that the majority of the calls were
recorded in the mornings and afternoons (approximately 8 am to 4 pm) and very
few recordings were made during the early evening and late evening shifts (from
4 pm to 11 pm) when more distressed callers tend to call. This is significant in
that recording calls at different times of day (e.g., evenings) and on particularly
heavy shifts (Friday night, Saturday night) may have yielded a larger collection of

242
calls from highly-distressed callers and thus played a greater role in the current
study of communication on crisis lines. A second limitation of the study is that the
number of examined cases for specific interactional practices (e.g., noncontiguously positioned full repetition) is quite low. Building larger collections of
instances would be helpful for getting a richer sense of the phenomena under
investigation and variations (if any) of a given interactional practice.

Future directions
Future directions for research will be framed in terms of both short-term
goals (using the current data set) and the long-term goals (using different data to
be collected in the future). In the short term, an area that is ripe for future
research is how call takers display an orientation to certain issues as having
greater potential for risk (i.e., for suicide or other forms of self harm). While there
is much research on the outcomes of crisis intervention models (e.g., King et al.,
2003; cf. Chapter 2), scholars have yet to analyze the manner in which these
protocols are conducted in real time in situ. Future research would thus focus on
precisely how help line call takers go about implementing and managing these
types of risk-attentive procedures (e.g., via questions, assessments, and other
actions) in a variety of sequential environments.
A second possibility for future research in the short term would be to
examine how call takers close down calls under ordinary circumstances and how
this may be dealt with differently when additional, competing calls come into the
center at the same time. It is at these moments, when there are multiple calls that

243
may demand call takers’ attention, that the issue of call triage becomes central
(see Leydon, Ekberg, & Drew, 2013 for a discussion of call triaging in the context
of openings to a cancer help line). For crisis lines in particular, one of the most
challenging tasks is to decide when a call should be closed down in order to
make oneself available for other incoming calls. For the purposes of this future
research, it will be important to build collections that involve call takers closing
down calls in ordinary circumstances (i.e., when only a single call is at hand) and
closing down calls when there are competing incoming calls.65
A third possibility for future research with the current data set is to focus
on advancing theory and research on traditionally social-psychological topics
such as “social support” (e.g., MacGeorge, Feng, & Burleson, 2011) and “self
disclosure” (e.g., Derlega, Metts, Petronio, & Margulis, 1993). In working with the
current materials, it is clear that call takers are trained to do interactional work to
show “support” for callers, while callers themselves must work at “disclosing”
personal information. While much of the literature on these topics has relied
primarily on experimental methods, this research would be naturalistic in
analyzing communication practices as they naturally occur in everyday life. In
addition to the literatures on self-disclosure and social support, this research
would also contribute to a growing body of literature regarding empathy

65

Preliminary research on this issue indicates that several dozen recordings in the
collection allow the researcher to hear the ringing of additional phones in the
background. This provides some access to additional “summons” that call takers
routinely attend to. In some cases, it has even been found that it is the callers that first
display an orientation to the background ringing, and may even initiate the closing down
of their own call so that the call taker may attend to it.

244
(Heritage, 2011; Pudlinski, 2005) and affect (Ruusuvuori, 2013) in talk-in
interaction.
In the long term after obtaining new data, I could investigate how crisis call
centers utilize different technologies to support their work on the telephone.
HelpNow call takers are required to use the call-log software to enter details
regarding each call. In many cases, this involves the call taker typing into the
software while they are on the phone with the caller (e.g., to look up if there are
past reports with individuals from that phone number). A great deal of research
has considered how help line call takers may become involved in additional tasks
(i.e., in addition to speaking with the caller), such as filling out call intake forms
(Frankel, 1989), logging information into software programs (Whalen, 1995), or
coordinating with co-present (and non-present) team members (Whalen &
Zimmerman, 2005). This future research would thus extend this body of work by
collecting and examining video data depicting the embodied nature of multiactivity taking place during crisis line calls.
A second area to be explored with new data involves the routine work of
call takers as they answer calls. Without video data of the call taker’s work area
at the call center, little attention was given to the multi-modal aspects of their
work. This includes various types of call management issues (e.g., checking
caller ID) and computer-related activities (e.g., entering the details of a call into
the call-log software) that call takers must engage in during a typical shift at the
center.

245
A third area ripe for study in the longer term would involve examining
video recordings of crisis call taker training sessions. Such materials would
provide additional insights (beyond participant observation) into how new call
takers are trained to manage crisis calls. Systematic observations concerning
how call takers are taught this practice (e.g., through instruction, practice drills,
role plays, etc.) could further enrich analysis of this issue.
