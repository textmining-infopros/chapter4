While physical access to information technology is critical to actively engaging and participating
in an increasingly digital society, having physical access alone is not enough as people need the
skills necessary to use the technology to reap its benefits. Teaching adults how to use
technology is a challenge that public libraries in the United States are currently confronting
through various methods. This paper explores how American public libraries can use an online
starting point to help adult patrons learn and practice basic Internet skills. In the case study
presented in this report, an online starting point called Hello Internet! was created and tested
over the course of three stages at the District of Columbia Public Library.

CHAPTER 1: PROBLEM STATEMENT
1.1. Problem Statement
In the Information Age, knowing how to use information and communication
technologies is critical to engaging as an active citizen in modern American society. In the
United States, much attention has been paid to the digital divide in terms of physical access, but
as more Americans gain access to the Internet, training Americans how to effectively use the
information and communication technologies available to them also requires attention. A 2014
national study assessed that 70 million Americans lacked digital literacy skills1.
Public and private organizations have worked to help Americans gain digital literacy
skills through using a variety of different methods. Of these organizations, American public
libraries play a significant role in digital literacy education. Libraries serve as a starting point in
the journey for many Americans towards becoming digitally literate citizens by offering a variety
of assistance to patrons within the physical walls of the library. In the digital realm, libraries
have begun posting guides and resources for patrons to gain new digital literacy skills as more
patrons access library resources online.
In order for patrons to use these library resources in addition to the multitude of external
online learning resources, patrons first need basic digital literacy skills. A majority of libraries
offer training opportunities at the physical library, and some libraries provide online resources on
basic Internet skills such as using a search engine or navigating a website. However, a vast
majority of these resources are static walkthroughs and guides that explain how to perform a skill
but do not provide guidance or feedback as learners practice the skill themselves. Through
providing an online interactive starting point for digital literacy education, American public
libraries can offer more opportunities to train adult learners without basic digital literacy skills to
become active citizens in modern digital society.

1.2. Research Question
This study aims to the answer the following research question:
How can American public libraries provide an online interactive starting point for
learning and practicing basic Internet skills for adult learners without basic digital literacy
skills?

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1. Digital Literacy
In the United States, public libraries play a significant role in cultivating digital literacy
across diverse populations. Digital literacy describes the knowledge and understanding needed
to operate in an Information Age through using information technology. The American Library
Association’s Digital Literacy Task Force defines digital literacy as “the ability to use
information and communication technologies to find, understand, evaluate, create, and
communicate digital information, an ability that requires both cognitive and technical skills”2.
Modern American society is dependent upon information and communication
technologies. This dependency can be seen in the private sector, the government, and in
education. In the private sector, according to survey of American small businesses in 2012, 87%
of businesses have at least one employee using the Internet as a part of their routine job
responsibilities3. 80% of Fortune 500 companies only accept job applications submitted online4.
The United States government has become increasing dependent upon information and
communication technologies to offer services to citizens. The Internal Revenue Service and
many states allow individuals to file tax returns for free4. As of September 2014, nearly 7.3
million Americans have enrolled in health insurance plans through the online health care
exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act5.
The educational space is also dependent on information and communication technologies.
In K-12 education, 4 million American students participated in at least one online course offered
by platforms such as Khan Academy during 20106. In 2011, the top four universities in the
United States that awarded the most bachelor and graduate degrees were all universities that
operated entirely online7. The increasing popularity of massive open online courses offered
through platforms such as M.I.T. and Harvard’s edX allow people across the globe to take
courses freely from premiere American academic programs8. If Americans lack digital literacy
skills, they will be unable to actively engage in society, thus not only limiting their opportunities
as individuals but also limiting the country’s future.

2.2. American Public Libraries
While digital literacy is closely tied to technology, digital literacy itself is a part of how
literacy has evolved over the past 3,000 years9. Since the days of the American colonies,
libraries have helped inform and educate citizens in the needed literacy skills of the time. In the
21st century, this role has not changed. With over 120,000 libraries serving schools and the
public across the United States, libraries provide their patrons with the access to technology and
necessary training to succeed in the Information Age.

2

In terms of access to technology, a majority of libraries in the United States are the sole
providers of public computer and Internet access in their communities10. In 2013, all American
public libraries provided public access to computers and the Internet. Public libraries averaged
20.2 public access desktops or laptops. Urban libraries averaged Internet download speeds faster
than 100 Mbps while rural public libraries averaged 21 Mbps11.
In terms of training, in 2013, nearly 100% of American public libraries provided digital
literacy training to patrons. These types of training include formal training classes, individual
training appointments, informal support, and online training material. Informal training is more
common for general computing skills like learning how to use the Internet while formal training
is more common for specialized skills like website development. Urban libraries are more likely
to provide formal digital literacy training than suburban, town, or rural libraries. 77.6% of urban
libraries provided formal digital literacy training11.

2.3. Adult Learners
A 2014 national study assessed that 70 million Americans lacked basic digital literacy
skills . To acquire basic digital literacy skills, many adult learners go to the library for
assistance. According to a demographic analysis of library computer users in the United States,
library patrons that use library computers resemble the American public in age, education, and
access to computers and the Internet. The working poor, people of mixed race, men, and people
who do not speak English as a first language accessed the Internet in the library the most
frequently. Even though a majority of patrons had computer and Internet access at home, users
visited the library for their information needs due to the wealth of resources the libraries
provides12.
1

Individual and formal help for digital literacy skills are often provided by libraries to its
patrons. According to a 2010 national library survey, 67% of library computer users received
assistance from a library staff member. These users tended to be older the age of 75, women, did
not speak English as a first language, and earned 300% below the US poverty guidelines. The
most frequent individual help topics included using computer equipment, using library website,
printing or saving files, finding a specific website, using office programs, and connecting to the
library’s wireless network. 14% of library computer users received training in formal classes
held at the library. These users tended to be non-Caucasian, held educational degree below high
school or two year college degree, older than the age of 75, and did not speak English as a first
language13.
Though accessing library resources through the library’s public access computers is still
common, a growing trend is accessing these same resources online and through using mobile
devices. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2012 discovered that 25% of
Americans ages 16 and older have visited a library’s website within the year. 13% of survey
respondents have used a mobile device to access the library’s website or services14. Some
3

libraries are responding to the mobile web’s growth by optimizing the library website for mobile
screens and creating mobile library apps15. Mobile access is becoming a significant part of a
library’s strategy to reach patrons as young adults, Black and Hispanic adults, and low-income
adults are more likely to use their mobile devices as their primary means of accessing the
Internet16.

2.4. Online Resources For Digital Literacy Training
A number of libraries across the United States have posted resources on their websites to
help users gain digital literacy skills. To understand what libraries have already posted, a brief
survey of the offerings from select libraries across the nation has been completed. Two groups
emerged – libraries that offered their own tutorials and libraries that offered repositories of
training documents.

2.4.1. Online Tutorials
2.4.1.1. DigitalLearn.org
DigitalLearn.org is a website created by the Public Library Association as part of an
Institute of Museum and Library Services grant-funded project to create an online repository for
literacy support and training17. For digital literacy learners, DigitalLearn.org offers a series of
classes teaching basic digital literacy skills such as using a computer, using a search engine, how
to email, and how to find jobs online18. Each class is a video tutorial that is divided into smaller
sections. In each section’s video, the narrator guides the user through a real world task applying
the skill. In the case of the basic search class, the task was to learn more information about
Chicago for an upcoming trip using Google’s search engine. Users are tested on their
understanding by clicking on certain areas of the screen, but users do not have the opportunity to
practice the skills realistically. For example, for basic search, one assessment question was to
locate where users can enter search terms when searching Google using Internet Explorer as
shown in the figure below19.

Figure 1. DigitalLearn.org Basic Search Assessment19
2.4.1.2. Libraries Linking Idaho – Online @ Your Library
Libraries Linking Idaho (LiLI) serves the people of Idaho with networked library
services. One of the services provided by LiLI is an online media literacy program called Online
@ Your Library20. This program is an online tutorial that offers four units on gaining media
literacy skills for digital literacy novices, which include digital literacy skills such as searching
the Internet and navigating a web page. Each unit is divided into lessons, and the lessons feature
a YouTube video explaining the skill and an exercise to practice the skill. No feedback is
provided to the user that the practice exercise is completed correctly21. The figure below shows
a representation of the anatomy of a website lesson.

Figure 2. LiLI Online @ Your Library Anatomy of a Website21
2.4.1.3. The Library Network
The Library Network is a public library cooperative in southeast Michigan. Consisting of
65 libraries, the Library Network provides services to all member libraries through collaboration.
The Library Network created an online tutorial to teach new users how to use a computer22. The
tutorial created was based on similar tutorials developed by the Washoe County Nevada Library
System, the Central Kansas Library System, and the Palm Beach County Library System. The
online tutorial has the user complete a series of tasks to learn more about the mouse, the scroll
bars, form input elements, popup windows, and opening applications23. An example screen from
the tutorial is shown in the figure below.

2.4.2. Online Repositories
2.4.2.1. Digital Literacy in New York
The New York Library Association and New York State Office of Cyber Security created
the Digital Literacy in New York website to help create standard curricula for teaching digital
literacy skills. As such, the Digital Literacy in New York website is a repository for students and
trainers to access documents such as lesson plans, presentations, quizzes, and handouts related to
learning and teaching basic computer skills, Internet skills, and Microsoft Word skills. Links are
also provided to the general public for additional external digital literacy resources that can be
used to gain more skills24. The figure below shows the repository of information available to
digital literacy learners.

Figure 4. Digital Literacy in New York Public Home25
2.4.2.2. Washington State Library
The Washington State Library provides a repository of external resources covering topics
such as basic and advanced computing skills and protecting users from online thieves, predators,
and other threats26. A representation of this repository can be found in the figure below.

2.4.2.3. Houston Public Library WeCAN
At the Houston Public Library, a program called the Wireless Empowered Community
Access Network or WeCAN works to provide the people of Houston, Texas with digital literacy
education. One way that WeCAN achieves its objective is by providing a community resource
portal where learners can find out when digital literacy classes are being held and can access
training materials such as presentations and assessments for each class. Classes range from
computer and Internet basics to digital photography and computer security27. A representation of
this resource portal can be seen in the figure below.

Figure 6. WeCAN Community Resource Portal28
2.4.2.4. Maine State Library
The Maine State Library’s website provides a repository of over 50 resources, courses,
and webinars from external sources. The website allows learners to search the resources by
digital literacy topic29. The figure below shows a sample of the resources that the Maine State
Library provides to users.

2.5. Online Interactive Starting Point
While both the online tutorials and online repositories provide valuable information to
users learning digital literacy skills, these approaches lack the ability for learners practice the
skills and receive feedback on their performance. Online learning platforms such as Khan
Academy and Codecademy allow beginner learners to practice skills and receive feedback in a
wide variety of skills with a great degree of success. Khan Academy attracts over 10 million
global users and offers over 5,000 courses30. Khan Academy’s course format is to present small
sections of course material at a time where learners watch a video and then complete an
automatically graded exercise to practice the skill. Learners can complete the course at their own
pace31. Codecademy follows a similar format but specifically targets teaching computer program
languages. In 2013, 24 million unique visitors logged into Codecademy to learn computer
programming languages32.
In June 2013, the American Library Association’s Digital Literacy Task Force recognized
both the responsibility that libraries have as a provider of necessary digital literacy skills and the
need for further research to understand how nontraditional learning approaches can be used to
teach digital literacy skills33. This thesis aims to blend the nontraditional approaches used by
online platforms such as Khan Academy and Codecademy for how American public libraries can
provide online starting points for digital literacy education.

CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
3.1. Methodology Background
This study used case study as the research method to answer the research question stated
above. Using an interactive online starting point for digital literacy has not been widely utilized
by libraries making this study exploratory in nature. The primary investigator used the District
of Columbia Public Library (DCPL) as the critical case in the case study. The primary
investigator has a relationship with the DCPL as a volunteer computer instructor teaching digital
literacy skills to adult patrons for the past three years. The DCPL has 25 branches and serves
over 500,000 people living in Washington, D.C. The DCPL currently has the schedule of
computer classes held at the library every month posted on its website34.
As a part of executing this case study, a prototype for an interactive online starting point
for beginner adult digital literacy learners was created for use at the DCPL. To build the
prototype and answer this study’s research question, this study’s research activities were divided
into three stages. The methodology of these stages and the research activities are provided
below. As the research activities conducted during the study required social interaction, this
study received IRB approval before the research activities are implemented. Please view
Appendix A for a copy of the IRB approval document.

3.2. Stage 1: Stakeholder Requirements
Building an online starting point for digital literacy at the DCPL involved many different
stakeholders. Before the prototype was created, the needs and perspectives of these stakeholders
needed to be understood. The stakeholders deemed relevant to this study were the DCPL library
staff involved with the computer class program, DCPL volunteer computer instructors who have
preferably taught a PC Basics and/or Web I Basics course, and DCPL adult learners who were
taking the PC Basics and Web I Basics courses.
To collect the needs and perspectives of these relevant stakeholders, two research
activities were completed – a semi-structured interview and a survey. Semi-structured
interviews took place with library staff and volunteer computer instructors aimed towards
understanding the requirements of an online starting point and what features they would include
given their experience working with adult learners. The planned basic Internet skills that adult
learners would be able to learn and practice for the initial prototype concept included the
following:


Using a search engine like Google to learn and practice searching for information.



Navigating a website using the DCPL’s website as a guide



Completing an online web form using an online job application as a guide
11

The inclusion of these skills was verified during the interview. Purposive non-probability
sampling was used to obtain interview participants. The semi-structured interview questions are
included in Appendix B.
Surveys were issued to the adult learners participating in the DCPL Web I Basics
computer classes. The goal of the survey questions was to understand the needs and perspectives
of the adult learners for an online starting point. Computer classes were offered several times a
month, and the surveys were issued to class attendees over the span of a month. As a normal
part of the computer classes at the DCPL, students are asked to complete a survey rating the
class. The familiarity of filling out surveys helped to boost the survey's response rate. Purposive
non-probability sampling was used to obtain survey responses. The survey protocol is included
in Appendix B.

3.3. Stage 2: Iterative Prototype Development
After the information in Stage 1 was collected and analyzed, development on the
prototype for the online starting point began. The technology used to implement the prototype
depended on the requirements collected by the stakeholders and required its own analysis of each
technology option’s strengths and weaknesses. The technology needed to support multiple
screen sizes in response to the popularity of mobile web devices. This prototype needed to be
Section 508 compliant so users of all abilities could use the prototype.
Once the technology was selected, the prototype was created using an iterative software
development process. Not all of the collected requirements were implemented at once. Multiple
cycles of analysis, design, implementation, unit testing, and stakeholder feedback were necessary
to ensure that the prototype worked properly and met stakeholder expectations. In this stage, the
primary stakeholders were DCPL staff and volunteer computer instructors. Receiving feedback
iteratively helped to improve the quality of prototype before the next phase. All iterative
feedback sessions were held at the DCPL. The stakeholder iterative feedback protocol is
included in Appendix C.

3.4. Stage 3: Prototype Evaluation
After completing the prototype, user testing was performed the adult learners taking a
class for the online starting point prototype called Hello Internet!. Each class was structured in
the same way. Users were asked to complete a survey at the beginning of the class to assess their
past experience with computers, the Internet, and the DCPL. Then, users explored the online
starting point prototype to learn about the Internet and the World Wide Web. Finally, users were
given a survey to provide their perspectives on the online starting point prototype based on the
USE Questionnaire. The USE Questionnaire was developed by Arnold Lund to measure the
usefulness, satisfaction, and ease of use of a software application35. The user testing surveys are
included in Appendix D.

CHAPTER 4: STAGE 1 RESULTS
4.1. Interview and Survey Execution
To gather the needs and perspectives of this study’s stakeholders in Stage 1, a series of
surveys and interviews were conducted at the Martin Luther King, Jr. branch of the DCPL
starting on July 29, 2014 and ending on August 14, 2014. To identify and help schedule surveys
and interviews with potential stakeholders, the primary investigator worked with the DCPL
Customer Training Coordinator. Interviewed DCPL volunteer computer instructors and library
staff members were first approached over email while surveyed DCPL patrons were approached
during the computer class that they were attending. Stage 1 advertisements sent to these
stakeholders can be viewed in the Appendix B.
Before data collection began using the surveys and interviews, 8 stakeholders were
identified and confirmed to be interviewed and 5 computer classes were identified and confirmed
to be surveyed. Of these confirmations, 7 stakeholders were interviewed as one DCPL volunteer
computer instructor was unable to attend, and all 5 computer classes were surveyed.

4.2. Stage 1 Interview Findings
4.2.1. Stakeholder Backgrounds
The DCPL volunteer computer instructors and the DCPL staff members all had relevant
experiences related to teaching adults to use the Internet. All interviewed DCPL volunteer
computer instructors had experience teaching basic Internet skills to patrons.
Of the DCPL staff members interviewed, four programs and departments were
represented. The DCPL Volunteer Computer Program was represented because this program
runs the computer classes for library patrons to learn basic computer and Internet skills. The
Adaptive Services department was represented to provide insights into how users with
accessibility needs learn how to use the Internet and how the online prototype should be
designed for users of all abilities. The Adult Literacy department was represented due to their
experience with adult literacy education and the recent decision to move the GED test from a
paper and pencil test to an online test. This decision impacts the Adult Literacy department by
having to help patrons learn computer and Internet skills in addition to preparing patrons for the
subjects in the GED test. The Digital Commons was represented because the Digital Commons
is a part of the DCPL that introduces patrons to innovative and new technology through hosting
classes for patrons to learn how to use this technology.
A brief summary of the stakeholders interviewed is provided in the table below.

4.2.2. Interview Results
After conducting 7 interviews with DCPL volunteer computer instructors and DCPL staff
members, analysis was conducted on this interview data to identify unifying themes and potential
new features to add to the prototype. The results of this analysis are summarized in the sections
below. The notes taken during the interviews can be found in Appendix B.

4.2.2.1. Unifying Themes
Over the course of 7 interviews, certain themes emerged. Some themes were expressed
by all stakeholders while other themes were only expressed by DCPL volunteer computer
instructors or DCPL staff members. The themes identified and the stakeholders who expressed
these perspectives are detailed below.
The Need for Basic Computer Skills
DCPL staff members and DCPL volunteer computer instructors both recognized the
importance of having basic computer skills before being able to learn basic Internet skills.
Having basic computer skills was cited as a frequent challenge for adult learners who want to
learn how to use the Internet. The stakeholders interviewed had different strategies for assisting
learners who needed basic skills including one on one help with learners, referring learners to
places where they can learn the skills they need such as the DCPL’s PC Basics computer class,
and providing resources for learners to sharpen their skills such as the mouse games on the
DCPL computers and typing games online.
Repetition As a Key to Success for Learners
All stakeholders interviewed expressed the importance of repetition for adult learners
learning skills. One DCPL staff member encourages adult learners to take computer classes
multiple times to not only learn the skills again but to learn the skills from a different trainer or
volunteer computer instructor.
“Everyone is somebody’s trainer, but a trainer is not everyone’s trainer.”
14

One DCPL volunteer computer instructor emphasized the importance of repetition. Before a
class, the instructor teaches begins to explain why the instructor can do these skills.
The instructor starts each class by "explaining why [the instructor] teaches the class, why
the skills are important, why [the instructor] is good at these skills because [the
instructor] does them every day, and asks the class why they are here" if the class is small
enough.
Another DCPL volunteer computer instructor encourages students during class to keep coming
back if they are at a lower skill level than the rest of the class.
Classes tend to have different skill levels. If a user has basic navigation challenges, the
DCPL instructor asks the student “to just follow along and keep coming back.”
After class, another DCPL volunteer computer instructor makes an effort to expose learners to
resources that can help them continue practicing outside of the classroom. One of the most
important of these resources is Windows Help.
A major point of emphasis is providing opportunities for learners “to continue learning
outside of the classroom.” The F1 key is important to get help with anything in Windows
and to also know to use the suggestions or use key terms to search.
Connecting Skills with Experience
All DCPL volunteer computer instructors described how connecting the skills taught in
the classroom with the experience of the students as helping the skills resonate with students.
According to one DCPL staff member, lacking relatable experiences with computers makes
learning computers more challenging.
“Having no conceptual experience of computers makes learning the skills harder.” The
staff member’s mother had experience creating documents in her federal job, so she was
able to apply her knowledge of documents to her learning the computer and how to create
documents using word processing software.
A DCPL volunteer computer instructor expressed that the instructor likes “to connect
skills with the experience that learners may have.” Another instructor stated that the instructor
often asks the learners why they are taking to class to connect what they want to learn with what
is being taught in the class. Another instructor uses the instructor’s past experience as a student
taking the DCPL computer classes to connect learners with the skills taught.
The Digital Commons connects skills in a different way by providing a new experience
for adult learners to connect with. According to one DCPL staff member,

15

The Digital Commons empowers patrons by showing them what is possible such as 3-D
printing. The 3-D printer and other technologies are powerful advertisements that get
patrons hooked and wanting to know more about computers.
After seeing what is possible, students are often excited to learn more.
Accessibility Concerns
DCPL staff members and DCPL volunteer computer instructors discussed the importance
of accessibility in how all users can get the most out of the technology they are learning. The
following comments were made by DCPL volunteer computer instructors and staff members in
relation to accessibility concerns. Being able to see the screen and using the keyboard and
mouse were the most citied accessibility concerns.
“General accessibility” is an issue where vision and fine motor movements can be a
problem for adult learners. Finding the settings to change font size for example is not
obvious.
Many of the issues adult learners face involve the mechanics of using the hardware. To
avoid the confusion of double clicking, the coordinator tells “the user to click once and
then press Enter.” Eye coordination is often a contributing factor to the mechanics issues.
“A large part of the web is not accessible” which is a large obstacle for new learners to
overcome. Screen accessibility software is dependent on the websites in how well they
conform to the standards.
Defining Terminology
DCPL volunteer computer instructors and staff members mentioned the importance of
adult learners understanding the correct terminology. One DCPL staff member often starts the
computer classes by introducing the terminology so that learners can leave the class and talk
intelligently about computers with others in the community.
The staff member’s basic procedure for teaching classes is to introduce the terminology
first by “touching it, naming it, and defining it.” It is important to call the concepts by
their official name – for example, there are four names for the computer.
While a DCPL volunteer computer instructor was at first skeptical about the importance of
defining terminology for adult learners rather than emphasizing functionality, the instructor
found that defining terminology provided context and allowed learners to ask clearer questions.
Inside the Classroom Obstacles for Adult Learners
DCPL staff members and volunteer computer instructors illustrated the obstacles that
computer and Internet adult learners face inside the classroom. According DCPL staff members,
16

adult learners experience a vicious circle where they were never taught computer and Internet
skills in the first place and then later in life are intimidated by using this technology when they
are forced to such as getting health care or applying for a job. The technology becomes even
more daunting to learn if adult learners have accessibility issues such as trouble viewing the
screen or using the mouse.
Once at the library seeking help, adult learners most frequently need confidence and
focus to learn the skills they need to apply. As described by a DCPL staff member,
When users come to the library to learn a skill, chances are that they are already
“frustrated and understand that there is a barrier.” However, they think that they have to
“climb over the barrier” when all they need to do is “step over the barrier.”
One DCPL volunteer computer instructor echoes the same sentiment as the staff member above
and offers a way to help learners step over the barrier.
Obstacles that adult learners face include “a lack of confidence and lack of understanding
of what you can do using the Internet.” The DCPL Computer Volunteer Instructor has
learners “focus on the task” and one thing at a time. By focusing, learners can “gain
confidence.”
Helping learners gain confidence underscores one DCPL staff member’s challenge in helping
adults prepare for the GED. Like Internet skills, GED skills can be complex and require teachers
to find ways to get concepts across to students that are understandable and also provide them
with the confidence to keep learning.
The largest challenge teaching adult learners new skills is “how to break down advanced
skills” and “how to quickly teach skills that learners need so they feel that they are
achieving something. Retention is hard in adult literacy. More rigorous tests and
computer tests have forced people to stay in school longer. How do you get people to
stay?”
As mentioned by both types of stakeholders, repetition is a key for adult learners to learn new
skills by gaining the confidence and focus necessary through practice.
Outside the Classroom Obstacles for Adult Learners
DCPL staff members and DCPL volunteer computer instructors conveyed the challenges
that computer and Internet adult learners face outside of the classroom. According to the
interviews, many DCPL adult learners do not have a computer at home to practice with that has
an Internet connection. According to a DCPL staff member, this physical component of the
digital divide prevents learners from putting in the time necessary to gain the skills. One DCPL
volunteer computer instructor who was once a past student often “stayed at the library from
9:00am to 9:00pm taking classes.”
17

For the students who have the physical means to access a computer and the Internet, a
different set of challenges are often present. As discussed by one DCPL volunteer computer
instructor, not understanding how to pay for service, service bandwidth limits, virus and safety
protection, and what to do when a computer freezes up other than purchase a new computer can
be costly lessons for new learners.

4.2.2.2. Potential New Features
One of the purposes of the interviews was to elicit ideas for developing and improving
the online prototype. Over the course of the 7 interviews, several features for the online
prototype were collected and stored in a spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet, all features were given
a title, description, estimate of how much effort it would take to create the feature, and how
important the feature is as later determined in Stage 2 with DCPL stakeholders. These features
and the process for adding features in the online prototype is described in greater detail in the
Stage 2 section of this report.
Some of the features identified during the interview phase are listed below. For a
complete listing, please consult Appendix B.


Adding keyboard shortcuts to lesson information (ex. How to open a tab in an Internet
browser)



Adding information about Internet Security



Adding a section in the Online Forms section to describe how drag and drop works



Adding a lesson describing how an email account works

4.3. Stage 1 Surveys
4.3.1. Stakeholder Backgrounds
Of the computer classes surveyed, two types of classes were identified before Stage 1 –
PC Basics and Web I Basics. PC Basics focuses more on basic computer skills such as how to
use a mouse, how to use a keyboard, and how to do basic tasks in Windows but does also include
learning a few Internet skills such as what an Internet browser is. Web I Basics focuses more
exclusively on basic Internet skills. At the Martin Luther King, Jr. Library, more PC Basics
classes are offered than Web I Basics classes. A brief summary of the computer classes
surveyed is provided in the table below:

Table 2. Stage 1 Survey Stakeholder Summary Information

4.3.2. Survey Results
After collecting 52 surveys from adult learners taking PC Basics and Web I Basics,
analysis was conducted on this survey data to better understand DCPL adult learners. As all
survey questions were optional, not all 52 surveys had answers for every question. The analysis
revealed that there are three ways to think of adult learners – by their library activity, by their
computer class activity, and by the Internet activity. The results from these three ways are
summarized in the sections below. A summary of the data collected during the surveys can be
found in the Appendix B.
By Library Activity
The adult patrons surveyed can be categorized into three groups by describing their
library activity as determined by the question how often they visited the DCPL. 63% of all adult
learners frequently visited the library with 47% visiting at least once a week and 16% visiting at
least once every day. 30% of adult learners visited the library less frequently with 16% visiting
at least once every month and 14% visiting a couple of times during the year. For 7% of
respondents, they were visiting the library for the first time when taking the survey.
By Computer Class Activity
To get involved in the DCPL computer class program, adult learners first needed to find
out about the program. Whether if it was their first time at the DCPL or they come to the library
every day, adult learners heard about the computer classes being held at the DCPL the most
frequently from friends at 37% and flyers about computers classes at 27%.
Once they hear about the computer classes, over half of the all surveyed adult learners
who frequently come to the library attend at least one computer class every week. 35% of adult
learners who come to the library less frequently attend a couple of computer classes during the
year. For 42% of these infrequent library visitors, this survey marked the first time they attended
a computer class at the DCPL.
The DCPL offers a wide variety of computer classes covering a range of topics from PC
Basics skills to HTML 5 development skills. Of the classes offered, the surveyed adult learners
gravitated towards the basic level courses. Nearly a quarter of all adult learners had taken PC
19

Basics. Other popular courses included Word I, Web I Basics, PowerPoint, and Mavis Beacon
Typing. The popular courses taken by the surveyed adult learners who visited the library
frequently and infrequently reflected the popular courses taken by all surveyed adult learners.
When asked why they were attending computer classes at the DCPL, a majority of
learners stated that the opportunity to learn how to use the Internet and/or improve the skills that
they already had brought them to the computer class. When asked about which basic Internet
skills they were interested in learning more about, learners expressed interest in a range of skills.
The most commonly selected answers for all surveyed adult learners irrespective of library
activity included:


Distinguishing between the Internet and the World Wide Web



Identifying and talking about the structure of the Internet and how it works



Identifying and engaging the window features of the Internet Explorer (IE) web
browser



Differentiating between a web page and a web site



Copying and pasting text and graphics from the Web to MS WORD

When asked if there were any skills that were not covered during the class that they
wanted to learn more about, adult learners provided different answers to this free response
question. Most common responses included how to find a job online, taking additional basic
computer classes at the library to strengthen skills, how to post pictures on Facebook, and how to
use email.
By Internet Activity
The surveyed adult learners can also be categorized by their Internet activity. Much like
library activity, Internet activity can be categorized by frequency of use. For 6% of surveyed
adult learners, they were using the Internet for the first time while taking the survey. For 14%,
they were using the Internet infrequently at least once a month. Frequent Internet users made up
80% of the surveyed adult learners with 41% of all learners using the Internet at least once a
week and 39% of learners using the Internet at least once a day.
When using the Internet, the most popular computing device for all surveyed adult
learners is the desktop at 58% followed by laptops at 22%. Smartphones and tablets were used
much less frequently to access the Internet.
Half of all surveyed adult learners accessed the Internet from the library. 29% accessed
the Internet at home while 14% accessed the Internet from work. Of the surveyed adult learners
that do not visit the library frequently, a higher percentage of these learners accessed the Internet
20

from home at 66%. For those who visited the library more frequently, a higher percentage of
these learners accessed the Internet from the library at 63%. All surveyed adult learners
responded that they rarely accessed the Internet from school, at a restaurant, or at a friend’s or
family member’s house.

4.3.3. Potential New Features and Priorities
The purpose of collecting survey data from DCPL computer class adult learners was to
develop ideas for new online starting point prototype features and to establish learning priorities
for the prototype. As with the interview data, the potential new features were stored in a
spreadsheet that was used during Stage 2. Some of the new features that emerged from the
survey are:


Copying and pasting text and graphics from the Web to MS WORD



Adding a new lesson on how to use e-mail

The survey results also established priorities that the online starting point prototype
should aim to fulfill. According to the survey results, a majority of the surveyed adult learners
either use a desktop or laptop to access the Internet. Therefore, a priority for the online starting
point prototype was to focus on having the prototype work on desktops and laptops over
spending time and resources focusing exclusively on other computing devices like smartphones
and tablets. Another priority was focusing on the five Internet skills identified by the surveyed
adult learners as being the most important. At a minimum, the prototype should help learners
understand and apply these five basic Internet skills.

21

CHAPTER 5: STAGE 2 RESULTS
5.1. Iterative Feedback Execution
To preliminarily evaluate and improve the online prototype before adult learners used
Hello Internet!, a series of feedback interviews were conducted at the Martin Luther King, Jr.
branch of the DCPL starting on August 23, 2014 and ending on September 27, 2014. To identify
and help schedule interviews with potential stakeholders, the primary investigator worked with
the DCPL Customer Training Coordinator. The stakeholders were invited to participate over
email. Appendix C contains an example of the advertisement sent to stakeholders.
Before data collection began, 5 interview sessions were scheduled with 4 stakeholders.
During Stage 2, two iterative feedback interviews were held with the DCPL Customer Training
Coordinator. One interview was held at the beginning of Stage 2 to collect initial feedback on
the prototype and to review and prioritize feedback that emerged from the Stage 1 data. A
second interview was held at the end of Stage 2 to review the changes made to the prototype as a
result of the feedback received and to review and prioritize any outstanding feedback not
addressed. Of the other three stakeholders, one was a DCPL volunteer computer instructor who
had past experience teaching the Web I Basics and Internet Job Seeking 101 classes, another was
a staff member in the Adult Literacy department, and another was a staff member in the
Adaptive Services department.
The feedback was iterative in nature because the primary investigator was able to
incorporate the feedback into the prototype between stakeholder interviews during Stage 2. For
instance, after the initial interview with the DCPL Customer Training Coordinator, the primary
investigator incorporated as much of the high priority feedback received into the prototype for
the DCPL volunteer computer instructor to review. After interviewing the volunteer computer
instructor, the primary investigator incorporated as much of the high priority feedback received
into the prototype for staff members working in the Adult Literacy and Adaptive Services
departments to review. Finally, before the concluding interview with the DCPL Customer
Training Coordinator, the primary investigator incorporated additional high priority feedback
into the prototype for review. The iterative feedback questions can be found in Appendix C.
During each interview, the stakeholders were asked which features of the prototype they
found the most and least useful. Then, they were asked to prioritize the features that should be
added to the next iteration of the prototype. Each change request made by a stakeholder during
an interview was documented in a feature tracking spreadsheet. The primary investigator made
an estimate of the effort required to make the change. The priority paired with the effort to make
the change helped to guide the primary investigator in deciding which features were added. Not
all features were able to be added before the end of Stage 2 due to limited time and resources.
To view all of the change requests recorded during Stage 2, please view the feature tacking
spreadsheet found in Appendix C.

5.2. Hello Internet! Prototype
The online starting point prototype developed for this study was called Hello Internet!.
The prototype was built in several iterations as results from Stages 1 and 2 became available as
way of requirements for this prototype. The technologies used to build this prototype, the overall
content contained in the prototype, and a brief walkthrough of Web 101, one of the site’s five
modules, are outlined in the sections below. Appendix E contains walkthroughs of Getting
Started, Search Engines, Navigating the Web, and Online Forms modules of the prototype.

5.2.1. Development Technologies
The Hello Internet! prototype was built using a number of web technologies as outlined
in the table below. When selecting technologies, emphasis was placed on using open source
solutions. The solutions needed to support a responsive design that allowed the site to be viewed
in multiple browsers across multiple devices with accessibility in mind.

5.2.2. Hello Internet! Modules
At the end of Stage 2, Hello Internet! had five modules of content for users to explore
and start learning about the Internet and the World Wide Web. Each module was devoted to a
general topic concerning basic Internet skills, and each module was broken down into lessons on
more specific skills. These modules and lessons are described in greater detail in the table
below. These modules were inspired by the Web I Basics and Web II Intermediate class scripts
created by the DC Public Library for its volunteer computer instructors to use for teaching
classes, the Stage 1 requirements, the resources found during the literature review of this study,
and the primary investigator’s previous experience teaching computer classes at the DCPL.

5.2.3. Hello Internet! Module Walkthrough – Web 101
In this section, the Web 101 module is reviewed to provide a more detailed perspective of
the Hello Internet! online starting point prototype. The objective of the Web 101 module was to
learn the basics on how to start using the Internet and the World Wide Web.

5.2.3.1. Web 101 Home Page
Each module had its own home page where the purpose of the module was defined, and
the sections of the module were broken out into separate navigational buttons for each lesson in
the module. The home page for the Web 101 module is shown below.

25

Figure 9. Web 101 Home Page

5.2.3.2. What’s the Web? Lesson
The goal of the What’s the Web? lesson is to understand the differences between the
Internet and World Wide Web. Each lesson begins with an outline of the lesson in bullet point
form. Each bullet point is a hyperlink taking the user to that part of the lesson.

Figure 10. What’s the Web? – Table of Contents

26

Below the bullet point list is a YouTube video demonstrating the skills presented in the lesson in
a real world scenario. These videos are typically under 5 minutes in length and appear for each
lesson in Hello Internet!. As will be demonstrated by the figures below, Hello Internet! relies on
video, text, pictures, and interactive exercises to teach basic Internet skills to accommodate the
different ways that people learn.

Figure 11. What’s the Web? – Video
Below the video is the start of the text and picture content. The text is used to describe a concept
while the picture is used to illustrate the concept. Over the next few figures below, the concepts
of the Internet, World Wide Web, and hyperlinks are explained using text, tables, lists, and
pictures.

To get a better understanding of the concepts presented in each lesson, there are certain sections
of each lesson called Try It Out! that encourage users to practice the skills that they are learning
in the lesson. The figures below show a Try Out It! section for practicing identifying where
hyperlinks on are on the page.

31

5.2.3.3. How to Get on the Web Lesson
The goal of the How To Get on the Web lesson to show three ways that users connect to
the Internet at the DCPL. Like the What’s the Web? lesson, this lesson uses multiple forms of
content to achieve this goal as shown in the figures below.

5.2.3.4. What’s a Browser? Lesson
The goal of the What’s a Browser? lesson is to define what an Internet browser is and its
basic functions. To have users practice using the basic functions of an Internet browser, a fake
Internet browser was built for the Try It Out! sections of this module. In addition, the keyboard
commands for the basic Internet browser functions were also defined in tables.

5.2.3.5. Web 101 Learning Check
After the lessons in each module, users are given an opportunity to test their knowledge
and skills through the Learning Check pages. The Learning Check pages test users on their
knowledge of important concepts and ask users to complete certain tasks. In many cases, these
tasks are similar to the Try It Out! activities found in each lesson. The Web 101 Learning Check
features five questions and can be found in the figures below.

5.2.3.6. Web 101 Learn More
Each Hello Internet! module concludes with a list of online resources where users can
learn more about the module’s topics. The resources are organized into two categories. The DC
Public Library Resources category refers to the services that the DC Public Library offers to
patrons related to the module. The Even More Resources category refers to websites outside of
the DC Public Library where users can learn more.

CHAPTER 6: STAGE 3 RESULTS
6.1. Stage 3 Execution
After receiving and incorporating feedback from the volunteer computer instructors and
DCPL staff members in Stage 2, the online prototype was ready to be used by adult learners. In
Stage 3, the online prototype was used by the adult learners of the DCPL over the course of three
classes scheduled in October 2014 called Hello Internet!. The Hello Internet! class was
scheduled with the DCPL Customer Training Coordinator and advertised through the DCPL
Computer Class Calendar fliers and the DCPL website. The classes were scheduled during the
weekday and weekends to capture a representative adult learner population. In total, 15 adult
learners participated in Stage 3. The Stage 3 advertisements can be viewed in Appendix D.
The Hello Internet! classes were moderated by the primary investigator. The two hour
class was divided into four parts. First, the primary investigator introduced the purpose of the
class, its involvement with the University of Maryland, and signing the consent form. Second,
adult learners took an online survey to collect information related to their past DCPL and
Internet experiences. Then, adult learners were guided by the primary investigator to the online
prototype to begin learning about the Internet and the World Wide Web independently through
watching videos, reading the lesson text, and completing lesson exercises. The primary
investigator served as a resource to answer any questions adult learners had about the online
prototype or the Internet and World Wide Web. At the end of the class, the adult learners
completed an online survey where they were able to provide feedback on the online prototype.
Adult learners were given a handout during the class that explained how to get back to Hello
Internet! from a computer if they were interested in learning more outside of the classroom. This
handout can be found in Appendix D.

6.2. Stage 3 Before Survey Results
Before the adult learners starting using the Internet, the learners completed a brief survey
to identify their past experiences with the DC Public Library and the Internet. All survey
questions were optional, so not all questions received responses. These survey results echoed
similar results collected during the Stage 1 surveys. 73% of participants attended the library
frequently meaning daily or weekly. 27% of participants attended the library infrequently
meaning monthly or yearly. Close to half of the adult learners frequently attended computer
classes at the DCPL on a daily or weekly basis. For two participants, Hello Internet! represented
the first computer class at the DCPL. While the computer classes at the DCPL were taken by at
least one adult learner, the most popular classes were the core computer and Internet basics
classes of PC Basics, Web I Basics, Word I, Word II, and Mavis Beacon.
A majority of the adult learners participating in the Hello Internet! classes identified as
being frequent Internet users with 33% using the Internet at least once a week and 40% using the
Internet daily. 1 adult learner was using the Internet for the first time during the class. The
45

desktop was the most popular way to access the Internet for the participating adult learners with
75% of all learners. 38% of learners used a laptop to access the Internet. Smartphones and
tablets were used by no more than 25% of the learners. The two most popular locations where
adult learners accessed the Internet was at home and at the library with over half of all learners
identifying with either option. Only 13% of learners accessed the Internet from work or at
school. All learners who accessed the Internet at the library identified desktops as an Internet
access device. Learners who specified locations other than the library for Internet access
mentioned laptops, smartphones, and tablets as Internet access devices. For complete results
from the survey, please consult Appendix D.

6.3. Stage 3 After Survey Results
After taking the class, the adult learners were asked to complete a brief survey to assess
the usability of the online starting point prototype. The survey was based on the USE
Questionnaire developed by Arnold M. Lund. The survey provides a way to measure usability
dimensions from a user’s perspective. The survey measures four dimensions using several Likert
scale questions asking if users Strongly Disagree or Strongly Agree with a statement. These
dimensions are usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning, and satisfaction. No open-ended
questions were asked. All survey questions were optional, so not all questions received
responses. The survey questions and responses can be found in Appendix D.

6.3.1. Usefulness
The adult learners were asked a series of statements to assess the usefulness of the online
prototype. For this dimension, all responses were skewed to either agreeing or strongly agreeing
that the online prototype was useful. A majority of adult learners strongly agreed with the
following statements:


It is useful. (73%)



It makes the things I want to accomplish easier to get done. (47%)



It meets my needs. (53%)



It does everything I would expect it to do. (53%)

6.3.2. Ease of Use
For the dimension of ease of use, all responses were skewed to either agreeing or strongly
agreeing that the online prototype was easy to use. A majority of adult learners strongly agreed
with the following statements:


The prototype is easy to use. (53%)



The prototype is simple to use. (40%)
46



The prototype is user friendly. (47%)



Using the prototype is effortless. (47%)



I can recover from mistakes quickly and easily. (60%)



I can use the prototype successfully every time. (53%)

6.3.3. Ease of Learning
For the dimension of ease of learning, all responses were skewed to either agreeing or
strongly agreeing that the online prototype was easy to learn. A majority of adult learners
strongly agreed with the following statements.


I easily remember how to use the prototype. (47%)



It is easy to learn to use the prototype (40%)

A majority of adult learners agreed with the following statement:


I learned to use the prototype quickly. (47%)



I quickly became skillful with the prototype. (47%)

6.3.4. Satisfaction
For the dimension of satisfaction, all responses were skewed to either agreeing or
strongly agreeing that the online prototype was satisfying to learn. A majority of adult learners
strongly agreed with the following statements:


I am satisfied with the prototype. (60%)



I would recommend the prototype to a friend. (53%)



The prototype was fun to use. (47%)



The prototype works the way I want it to work. (40%)



The prototype is wonderful. (53%)



The prototype is pleasant to use. (60%)

Overall from a usability perspective, the reception of the online starting point prototype by the
adult learners was positive across all four usability dimensions. The adult learners found the
online starting point prototype useful, easy to use, easy to learn, and satisfying to use.

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION
7.1. Discussion
This study set out to determine how American public libraries can provide an online
interactive starting point for learning and practicing basic Internet skills for adult learners
without basic digital literacy skills. Through using a case study approach with the DC Public
Library, the creation and testing of Hello Internet! provided insights as to how an online
interactive starting point is possible. Over the course of the three stages of this project, certain
common insights emerged.

7.1.1. Necessity of Library Support
The Hello Internet! prototype would not have been possible without the support of the
DC Public Library. Creating an online starting point requires a significant investment of time
and effort. The DCPL helped communicate and coordinate with the different stakeholders
during each stage. The scope of the DCPL involvement was not limited to only the computer
class staff members as members from other departments were involved in Stages 1 and 2 of the
project. Without the strong support of public library, creating an online starting point would be a
tremendously difficult task.

7.1.2. Frequent Collaboration with Different Stakeholders Throughout the Process
During the Stage 1 interviews, a DCPL staff member stated that “Everyone is
somebody’s trainer, but a trainer is not everyone’s trainer.” When taking computer classes at the
DCPL, the staff member often encourages patrons to take the same class from different volunteer
computer instructors to enforce what they learned before but also learn the material from a
different perspective. Hello Internet! similarly benefited from having multiple perspectives over
the course of collecting requirements for the prototype in Stage 1, developing the prototype in
Stage 2, and testing the prototype in Stage 3. By understanding and integrating the perspectives
of DCPL staff members, volunteer computer instructors, and adult patrons, the Hello Internet!
prototype became representative of more than just the primary investigator’s perspective. This
collaboration helped improve all aspects of the prototype from the overall content of the lessons
to changing the way pictures are labeled on the screen.

7.1.3. Iterative Software Development Methodology
Employing an iterative software development methodology helped make Hello Internet!
a better online starting point. Hello Internet! could have been developed after collecting the data
from Stage 1 and then proceed directly to user testing. However, by doing so, the online starting
point would have lost some key advantages. By developing iteratively, the primary investigator
was able to spend time on the highest value features during each iteration. The primary
investigator worked with DCPL Customer Training Coordinator after the conclusion of Stage 1
to prioritize potential prototype features. The iterative development process allowed the primary
48

investigator to collect, prioritize, and integrate the feedback from stakeholders during Stage 2.
This process resulted in new features not identified during Stage 1 that improved the overall
quality of the prototype such as breaking down the content into shorter easier to understand
sentences for adult learners.
7.1.4. Providing the Proper Context For the Online Starting Point
Hello Internet! is an online starting point intended for adult learners who lack basic
Internet skills. Creating a website for people who may have never used a website before comes
with its own challenges, and one of these challenges is determining where and when users
interact with the online starting point. The prototype’s target users would not likely be able to
find this resource on their own. As shown in the survey results for Stage 1, patrons are more
likely to hear information about DCPL services and programs through friends or the physical
handout copy of the computer class calendar.
Before this study, the DCPL offered SPOT classes or Self-Paced Online Training where
patrons could use the computer lab to practice their Office skills, typing skills through Mavis
Beacon, or go online to learn more about computers own their own where a volunteer computer
instructor is available to answer any questions or comments. By modeling the Hello Internet!
classes off of these SPOT classes, the online starting point was given a context that patrons were
already familiar and comfortable with. Patrons were given a handout during the class with
instructions on how to reach the online starting point after the class is over to continue learning.
If the Hello Internet! prototype continues to be used at the DC Public Library, offering future
Hello Internet! classes and integrating the online starting point as a complementing resource for
patrons to explore during SPOT classes or Web I Basics classes will help to increase the success
of using this online starting point approach.

7.2. Study Limitations
This research study has several limitations in terms of reliability and validity. A
significant limitation of this research study is its external validity. Using one public library when
conducting interviews and testing the prototype to gauge its effectiveness limits the
representativeness of the study’s results and how generalizable the results are to other public
libraries and library patrons. This issue also negatively impacts the ability of other researchers to
repeat the study and reach the same results. Because one researcher conducted the entire study,
this study also faces threats to its internal validity in how the data was analyzed.
All threats to reliability and validity in this study cannot be eliminated. However, by
using different research methods such as interviews, surveys, and user testing, this study aimed
to increase its rigor and provide opportunities to triangulate results. In addition, the case study
approach allowed the research question to be explored in question’s real world context, which
was a key component in understanding how technology in a public library context can help adult
learners learn and practice digital literacy skills.
49

7.3. Future Work
While answering this study’s research question, more research questions and areas
emerged as possibilities for future work. These research questions are listed below:
How can an online starting point help adult learners with accessibility needs learn and
practice basic Internet skills?
During Stage 2, the primary investigator learned that there are technology tools that teach how to
use a screen reader like the TypeAbility software tutorial program for JAWS. However, there is
not an equivalent tutorial program for how to use the Internet. Given that much of the World
Wide Web is inaccessible, knowing how to navigate is a significant challenge that often requires
one on one assistance. An online starting point may help serve as an additional training tool.
How can American public libraries provide an offline starting point for learning and
practicing basic computer skills for adult learners without basic digital literacy skills?
PC Basics classes at the DC Public Library were some of the most popular computer classes that
the library offered to patrons. Basic computer skills are needed to learn other digital literacy
skills such as basic Internet skills. An offline starting point may provide more opportunities for
adult learners to learn and practice PC Basics skills.
Expanding Beyond the Martin Luther King, Jr. Library
This study was performed at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Library of the DC Public Library. To
strengthen the representativeness of this study, more work can be done to test the Hello Internet!
prototype at branch locations within the DC Public Library and at other American urban,
suburban, and rural public libraries. In addition, more work could be done to determine how to
engage adults without basic Internet skills that the public library is not currently reaching.
Stage 4: User Testing and Web Analytics
To continue to improve the Hello Internet! prototype, usability testing techniques and web
analytics should be performed to provide more detailed and quantifiable feedback on how adult
learners use Hello Internet! in addition to the subjective measures such as the USE
Questionnaire.

Stage 1 Interview Notes
Interview 1 July 29, 2014
Q1) DCPL instructor started teaching in 2013. DCPL instructor teaches 1 class per month.
DCPL instructor mostly teaches PC Basics, has taught Web 1 Basics a few times, and has taught
Introduction to HTML 1 once. In the DCPL instructor’s experience, teaching PC Basics was the
most useful because overall computer skills are taught. In Web 1 Basics, “people are already
familiar with websites.”
The DCPL instructor had the ability to add another class, the instructor would add PC Basics II.
Based on his experience with helping his parents, he would add information about how to use
storage, how to use shortcuts, how to install software, viruses, malware, and taskbar utilization.
Q2) DCPL instructor customizes the teaching script based on prior experience. The DCPL
instructor does not see why changing the views on Windows Explorer is important to include, so
he does not include it. The DCPL instructor emphasizes using search in the Windows start
menu, how to use the task bar, and how to take advantage Windows like snapping windows to
the sides of the screen.
The DCPL instructor structures the classes “by watching [the instructor] complete the task first,
then [the instructor] talks through the task, and then [the instructor] asks the class to complete the
task together.”
Classes tend to have different skill levels. If a user has basic navigation challenges, the DCPL
instructor asks the student “to just follow along and keep coming back.” Students often help
other students learn skills who are struggling. Typing tends to be challenging for users taking
some users up to 60 seconds to type the word “mother”. Resizing the window can be difficult
for those who do not have fine motor control. The types of clicks - right click, left click, double
click, and click - are difficult to classes to connect.
Q3) Typically, no Internet skills are taught in the DCPL instructor’s PC Basics class. When
teaching Web 1 Basics, the DCPL instructor likes to focus on tabs and bookmarks, showing the
types of Google searches such as Images, News, and Web, using Wikipedia for hyperlink
demonstrations. The DCPL instructor likes “to connect skills with their experience that users
may have”. The instructor does not spend time providing academic definitions for technology
concepts because “they are useless for the class.”
Q4) The Web 1 Basics class is easier to teach as most of the challenges involve differences in
default settings and browser issues. Typing also can be a challenge. Showing how to play
videos is not demonstrated in Web 1 Basics. The Web 1 Basics class is structured by the
instructor in the same way as the PC Basics class.

57

Q5) “General accessibility” can be an issue as vision and fine motor movements can be a
problem. Finding the settings to change font size for example are not obvious. There is often
confusion around the taskbar in how multiple windows are displayed and how to show and hide
windows. Class members rarely own their own personal computers and usually do not ask
questions about phones or tablets.
Q6) Some useful skills that should be considered to be added to the online starting point are:


“Signing up for an email account”



“Understanding accounts” - using your email address as a user name but using a different
password



Emphasizing “cloud based framework” like Google Docs

58

Interview 2 August 2, 2014
Q1) The coordinator has been running the program for 14 years and has taught every class
offered in the curriculum. PC Basics is the most critical and is needed for future classes. PC
Basics is the coordinator’s favorite class to teach because the coordinator is “interested in seeing
the light go on that they can do this”. “Young people are not intimidated” by new things, but
older people tend to be. The coordinator also enjoys teaching Microsoft Office and web
development classes.
Q2) The coordinator’s basic procedure for teaching classes is to introduce the terminology first
by “touching it, naming it, and defining it.” It is important to call the concepts by their official
name - for example, there are four names for the computer. In PC Basics, after identifying
hardware, the software is then explained. It is important to have time for the students to play
around. The coordinator uses mouse games such as memory games. “Leaving with a fun activity
encourages learning” and for patrons to come back.
The coordinator adjusts the speed of instruction once exercises begin because learners usually do
not have a problem with the terminology. If the coordinator notices that people are struggling,
repetition is key “to not leave people in the dust.” Instructors have to be careful with what they
say. “Put your mouse on the Recycle Bin” caused a patron to physically put their mouse on the
Recycle Bin on the screen. Executable and understandable commands are essential.
When the coordinator mentors other trainers, the coordinator suggests that trainers attend other
trainer’s classes to absorb best practices. “Everyone is somebody’s trainer but a trainer is not
everyone’s trainer.” Trainers are not going to get every student. “There is no need to cover
everything in the curriculum” because 2 hours is a short amount of time. It is always better to go
slower. The curriculum is flexible where trainers are encouraged to answer questions and “free
to add their expertise.” The scripts for classes are meant to be an anchor for the trainers to
follow.
Q3) Adult learners often struggle when navigating online forms because they have to use online
forms due to health, social security, and/or job reasons. Moving between fields is always an
issue where learner’s press the Enter key to move between fields instead of the using the Tab
key.
Launching the browser, how to surf, and how to use links are also important skills.
Understanding how the mouse icon changes from a pointer to a hand is another skill.
Bookmarking helps learners reduce typing and access their favorite sites faster. Understanding
that http:// no longer needs to be typed in, and the differences between http:// and https:// are also
important.
Online forms are critical for applying for jobs in the midst of the library’s important role for “job
recovery.” However, the library’s helpful efforts are often thwarted by the check this box if you
59

received no assistance on job application forms. “Knowing the English language” is
fundamental for navigating and understanding online forms.
The coordinator emphasized the importance of citing sources when copying and pasting
information from the web and into a Word document because plagiarism is felony.
Customers often ask to learn more about how to attach a file to an email. The library’s service is
“to provide public access” to computers, Internet, and email. Some customers have asked for
education in using tablets and smartphones, but customers need to bring their own tablets or use
the tablets in the Digital Commons.
Q4) The biggest challenge for learners using the Internet is knowing English, having keyboard
skills, having mouse skills - if you have a large hand it is difficult to move the mouse. Many of
the issues involve the mechanics of using the hardware. To avoid the confusion of double
clicking, the coordinator tells “the user to click once and then press Enter.” Eye coordination is
often a contributing factor to the mechanics issues. The smallest challenge is the terminology.
Q5) “Having no conceptual experience of computers makes learning the skills harder.” The
coordinator’s mother had experience creating documents in her federal job, so she was able to
apply her knowledge of documents to her learning the computer.
Q6) The coordinator thinks that in terms of the library’s digital readiness strategy, this tool can
help educate learners in “how to construct simple and complex queries” starting with “one word
queries first.” The coordinator provided a library example of a patron asking for a book on
economics to what the patron really wanted was a book on how to balance a checkbook. Using
natural language such as “my cat has diabetes” can provide relevant search results. The filters
used by Google such as Images, News, and Shopping help narrow the search results.
The challenges of this tool are to have learners “acknowledge that they need help to learn skills”
and how/where to advertise the tool to users. The portal should be “self paced” especially when
the portal is not geared towards certification. The site should have an indication of the
“measurement of progress.” The indication should be “qualitative and humane.”

60

Interview 3 August 9, 2014
Q1) The instructor started coming to class in 2004 and found out about the classes at the library
from a neighbor. She attended when there were only 10 computers in the lab and competition for
each computer. She sat in the back and often found herself assisting other students in the class.
After two years, she officially became an assistant and then eventually later on as an instructor.
As a student, she often stayed at the library from 9am to 9pm taking classes. She volunteers
because she does it "out of joy" and she loves to do it thus making it not work at all. She “sees
herself in other learners” and their need to receive help.
As an instructor, she has taught PC Basics, Mavis Beacon, Office Basics, HTML, Word 1 and 2,
and Excel 1 and 2. She has taught web basics outside the library. She likes to teach because of
the variety of classes offered.
Q2) A major point of emphasis is providing opportunities for learners “to continue learning
outside of the classroom.” F1 is important to get help and know to use the suggestions or use
key terms to search. She emphasizes hands on experience as well by having learners practice
skills. She keeps beginner and advanced students on the same page by using keyboard shortcuts.
Q3) The following skills are important for beginners to learn:


Combination keys



Using the address bar - lowercase letters with no spaces, can perform searches



Back and forward buttons



Using the magnifying glass button to search



Accessing the help with F1



Knowing the different parts of a search engine result



Minimizing browser and where it goes



History



Refresh



Stop - then refresh to load page faster





Http vs https not everything is secure



Printing and print preview





Menu bar



Reset IE



Advanced search options

Q4) Paying for service and accessing service outside of the community are obstacles for learners.
The Internet often forgives your misspellings by using didn't you mean or guessing what you are
typing. Safety is an important concern in terms of avoiding viruses and knowing what to do
when your computer freezes up instead of buying a new computer. Having a personal computer
to use is an obstacle. Computer classes in the region often offer free computers after taking
classes for five weeks. Understanding bandwidth limits for wireless Internet is needed to avoid
paying extra fees. Accessibility is a challenge that can sometimes be overcome by using
Windows Ease of Use Center. Typing is challenging where resources such as Mavis
Beacon,powertyping.com and Byte Back offer online tutorials that can be hard for beginners to
download and use. Similarly, the mouse games on the DC public library computers help with
mouse skills.
Q5) She helps new learners face these obstacles by providing access to resources that provide
learners with opportunities to learn.
Q6) see Q3

62

Interview 4 August 12, 2014
Q1) She is a manager for the Adaptive Services department in the DC Public Library for the past
year and was initially an interim manager. She has been with the department for 10 years. She
also serves as the ADA coordinator of the library as well as the Regional Library for Adaptive
Services for the Library of Congress.
She has informal experience teaching patrons computer and Internet skills. Children are
generally savvy with technology but need to know that there are things to learn beyond Google.
Q2) Adaptive Services offers classes lasting 8 to 10 weeks on a Wednesday and Thursday
teaching accessibility tools like JAWS. These classes are usually geared towards traditional
tools aiding in low vision problems. Basic keyboard and computer skills can be an impediment
and is usually a part of learning these tools. A staff member is in charge of teaching these
classes and has a defined curriculum that builds logically and sequentially. Volunteers and staff
members often help out and the classes are typically formatted to provide one on one instruction.
Learners are given a pre-assessment test to understand if the users have basic or advanced skills.
After taking the class, learners are given a certificate of completion to provide a sense of
accomplishment. The classes provide a sense of community and a social component between
people which technology tends to isolate.
The department teaches accessibility software for all kinds of platforms including smartphones,
tablets, and desktops. The department gets any software or hardware that it can get to test the
stuff including Google Glass. The department is a part of the Accessibility DC conference on
October 11.
The DCPL system has 20 concurrent JAWS user licenses at one time but getting support from
the IT department can be challenging.
Q3) A big part of learning the Internet is learning how to use JAWS and other accessibility tools.
JAWS screen commands are a lot to learn.
Q4) “A large part of the web is not accessible” which is a large obstacle for new learners to
overcome. Screen accessibility software is dependent on the websites in how well they conform
to the standards. Knowing how to zoom and other accessibility tricks help make websites easier
to navigate, but some sites like the DC Public Library can crash accessibility software. Even if a
website is 508 compliant, sometimes a part of the website is not compliant such as credit card
forms are often not. For adults with accessibility needs, there is often a vicious circle of not
being taught in the first place and then being intimidated by the technology. Adults with
accessibility needs usually find the DC Public Library’s Accessibility Department when they
sign up for a new library card, through community organizations, and through advertising to
blind advocating organizations.

63

Q5) Some of the largest challenges in teaching adult learners new skills is “finding the audience,
getting participation, and managing expectations” in that the learning will not be instantaneous.
Another large challenge is the economic component of the digital divide where people do not
have technology at home. Another challenge is training the staff to be knowledgeable with
accessibility tools.
Q6) The online starting point should be accessible and easy for users with low vision. Staying
safe on the Internet should be added as a lesson to learn - strong passwords, phishing, and Prince
of Nigeria email scams. In addition, users should learn different accessibility features available
to them in zooming and changing color.

Interview 5 August 12, 2014
Q1) The staff member is a member of the Adult Literacy Resource Center. He has come from a
background of teaching adults to prepare for the GED and currently helps train teachers on how
to teach basic readings skills for the GED. The GED test has changed from a paper and pencil
test to a computer test that is more rigorous and administered by a for profit institution. The
testing center is temporarily offering paper and pencil tests but the future is 100% on the
computer. In the new GED test, common core standards are more emphasized, more algebra
skills are needed whereas before people did not need to know algebra to pass, more reasoning
and language arts sections asking for critical thinking through writing.
Q2) The Adult Literacy Resource Center depends on other organizations and informal one on
one training to teach computer skills needed to complete the test, take advantage of online
resources, or register for the test online. One organization that was Byte Back that offered a
workshop at the DC Public Library that was focused on basic keyboarding and mouse skills.
Through Byte Back, the DC Public Library has access to the online training resource of GED
Academy which DCPL staff members issue accounts to users who want to use the tool. The DC
Public Library also has the Learning Express Library online resource for GED users. In general,
computer skills are often taught in conjunction with GED subject skills. Because the GED is
administered by a for profit institution and the $24 cost per practice test, the DC Public Library
offers online tutoring one on one drop in appointments to help students get prepared before
taking the practice test or before/while taking a preparation course. The GED official test costs
$120. As a part of the online tutoring, students take a test to assess their skill level and what
areas they need to improve. Patrons are typically referred by community based organizations,
organizations who have full GED training classes, and through the 20 year old literacy helpline
that the DC Public Library operates.
Q3) There are several different types of computer skills needed to answer questions on the GED.
For example, drag and drop is used differently in the different subject areas. Drag and drop can
be used to order events in a linear sequence for language arts, drag and drop characteristics of
people in a short story for language arts, create a line by dragging and dropping an algebraic
equation into a chart. Multiple choice, checkboxes, and text areas are used. Hotspots are used
where users click on an area to create a graph point and then later a line. Drop down menus are
used for users to make corrections to the grammar in sentences or to fill in the blank.
Q4) Reaching the online resources for the GED is always a challenge. Registering for the GED
online can be challenging as well but the preparation process usually takes a year. Students may
not be taking the GED in favor of the external diploma program that emphasizes life skills for
people 25 years or older that still has a paper and pencil option for now.
Q5) The largest challenge teaching adult learners new skills is “how to break down advanced
skills” and “how to quickly teach skills that learners need so they feel that they are achieving
65

something.” “Retention is hard in adult literacy. More rigorous tests and computer tests have
forced people to stay in school longer. How do you get people to stay?” Emphasizing guidelines
and different methods that reach different learning channels is essential. Paragraph frames such
as “I agree with this because of this” help learners structure their arguments quickly and
critically. Manipulatives like Math-U-See help learners of all ages understand complex algebraic
expressions.
Q6) Helping users get to online resources and setting up accounts. For example, users often have
problems accessing the Learning Express Library from the DCPL website. Then, users have to
create an account for this resource using an email address that they may or may not have. Then,
users need to remember their username and password. Getting used to this process has a steep
learning curve for adult learners based on prior experience.

66

Interview 6 August 14, 2014
Q1) He was a branch Manager at Tenley with a technology background. When the DC Public
Library cleared the business and technology floor and created the Digital Commons, he became
the manager of the Digital Commons. The Digital Commons is about a year old. As a manager,
he is in charge of the Digital Commons staff, programming, equipment, and public safety.
He has taught classes with 3-D printing and CAD and will teach a class about electronics. The
Digital Commons offers a plethora of classes ranging from Ruby, Adobe Creative Suite,
WordPress, how to make a gif, and raspberry pi programming. The Digital Commons is
expanding to have two new maker spaces - one AV production studio and another fabrication
studio.
The ideas for Digital Commons classes come from staff members and from students alike.
Libraries are not often thought of as “cutting edge”, but libraries can become “bleeding edge.”
“We are reacting to what customers expect, and customers want the next step.” The Digital
Commons also looks to outside organizations to see what they are doing.
Q2) When teaching classes at the Digital Commons, there are some computer skill gaps that have
to be dealt with. The Digital Commons serves everyone - “from the person with no clue to the
person who wants to make a robot.” Staff members often experience frustration serving patrons
with lower skill levels. However, the Digital Commons offers the opportunity for patrons to
schedule one on one tutoring sessions to relax the time constraint worries on staff members. The
Digital Commons has a digital bar where multiple types of devices with all of the operating
systems are showcased and allow people to gain hands on experience with various technologies.
Staff members have access to Lynda.com to learn how to use technology, and soon patrons will
also have access to learn on the site as well. The Harvard Extension School and Universal Class
are other resources used for training by the Digital Commons.
Q3) Adult learners need to understand PC Basics before learning about the Internet. They need
to understand the hardware and the GUI. As far as email specific skills, setting up email
accounts is a basic skill that serves as an introduction as to how online forms work, which help
set learners on a path towards using online forms for more complicated forms such as online job
applications and taxes. Knowing how to use information repositories such as Wikipedia that are
clean and easy to use are also important.
Q4) Having basic PC skills is the largest obstacle for adult learners to begin learning how to use
the Internet.
Q5) The largest challenges that he has encountered teaching adult learners new skills is “time
and patience.” When users come to the library to learn a skill, chances are that they are already
“frustrated and understand that there is a barrier.” However, they think that they have to “climb
over the barrier” when all they need to do is “step over the barrier.” Patrons often need skills for
67

their jobs and do not want to be taught or babied. They want the teacher to do the skill for them.
“Do it for me.” The Digital Commons empowers patrons by showing them what is possible such
as 3-D printing. The 3-D printer and other technologies are powerful advertisements that get
patrons hooked and wanting to know more about computers. The DCPL computer class program
on the third floor is the “elementary school where patrons get the basic skills.” The Digital
Commons is the “middle school” where patrons can start learning how to apply their skills using
software tools. The maker spaces is the “high school” where patrons can take their knowledge
and apply it to real world scenarios to build things. To motivate patrons to continue learning, the
Digital Commons is looking at a “badging and certification system” that combines elements of
gamification of giving motivation and credibility in the certification. The open software
foundation Mozilla has a badging system that he would like to apply to the DCPL. The Digital
Commons would serve as “a breeding ground” for patrons to practice job skills before getting a
job. During the economic downturn, many people lost jobs and the traditional thinking of
getting a degree no matter what did not prove to be a prudent strategy for everyone. Colleges,
trade schools, and other institutions should all be considered. Getting a large partner like Google
would lend credibility to the certifications awarded.
Q6) “Instructional design is hard. We are not teachers, and flow is important. Basic is better.
Keep it simple.” Lynda.com is a great example that shows you step by step what to do and does
it slowly. “Text, audio, and video” are important to include because people learn in different
ways.

Interview 7 August 14, 2014
Q1) She has been a computer instructor volunteer for 1 to 2 years. She was looking for different
volunteer opportunities and wanted to gain experience teaching. The computer class program
was a safe place to volunteer. She has taught Web 1 and Word 1. She has learned how much
she loved teaching people. She has experience tutoring kids for tests and found that like the
computer class program, learners "just need the confidence they need to learn" and apply skills.
"Teaching PC Basics requires the patience of a saint. " In the classes that she teaches, learners
are closer to gaining skills that they can use and more lightbulb moments occur.
Q2) She starts each class by "explaining why she teaches the class, why the skills are important,
why she is good at these skills because she does them every day, and asks the class why they are
here" if the class is small enough. She uses a mix of follow me and exercises to help her students
learn and makes use of the class script. When she has students at different levels, she often
adjusts through providing one on one help to learners.
Q3) While she doesn't want students to worry about terminology over functionality, she has
found that providing background helps provide context to learners. Internet skills like knowing
how to find good information, protection from scams, searching for jobs, and how to use email
are important skills. Understanding what you say can lead to floppy disk saving questions (what
if I don’t have a floppy disk to save my document).
Q4) Obstacles include the volume of information that a search engine returns and losing their
place in the browser. Large obstacles include "a lack of confidence and lack of understanding of
what you can do using the Internet." She has learners "focus" on the task and one thing at a time.
By focusing, learners can gain "confidence."
Q5) "A lack of confidence in abilities and fear of having to know too much - I always have to
ask people for help" -are challenges. For older learners surrounded by family that grew up using
the technology, learning technology can be intimidating. She validates their educational journey
through encouragement.
Q6) Videos are important. The prototype should get across the value of the class, need for
repetition, and confidence in the learner. "Making it personal" will help encourage learners.

The advertisement for the iterative feedback sessions will be conducted via email sent to the
DC Public Library staff members and computer volunteer instructors. The email template
used to advertise for these feedback sessions is provided below:
Hi <insert name>,
My name is Steven Dodge, and I have been a Computer Volunteer Instructor with the DC
Public Library for two years. During that time, I have also been a part time master’s
student at the University of Maryland College Park. As a part of my degree, I am
working on a thesis to understand how libraries can use technology to teach basic Internet
skills to adult patrons.
As a <DC Public Library staff member/Computer Volunteer Instructor>, I would like to
receive your feedback on the prototype that I am creating to teach basic Internet skills to
adult patrons. The feedback session should take no longer than 30 minutes and will take
place at the DC Public Library. I can interview you <during your work day at the DC
Public Library / before or after the computer class you teach> or at a time that works for
you.
If you have any questions or comments about the study and/or the interview, please let
me know.
Thank you for your consideration,

Question 3: These are the features that I will be adding in the next iteration. Will these features
add more value to the prototype?
 Emphasize how the cursor changes when hovering over a hyperlink, video, text field, etc
 Add information about how to share videos
 Add a diagram showing the differences between internal and external hyperlinks
 Highlight or bold free Wi-Fi
 Make some of the web pages larger in the pictures and video - zoom in
 Add information about how to bookmark or favorite web pages
 For the address bar practice, www.dclibrary.org should be an acceptable url to use.
 Differentiate between Google Chrome and Google
 Define keywords when searching for information on the Web.

Question 1: What new features that were added to the prototype did you find the most useful?
 The multiple ways of presenting information and showing instead of telling - text,
pictures, video was useful. Mapping audio literacy to Braille literacy allows blind
students learn how to read Braille.
Question 2: What new features that were added to the prototype did you find the least useful?
 The home page for the site is an interesting case of how you cater to users. By
emphasizing the mouse, you are being precise but excluding the people who use screen
readers. If you are general, you could apply to everyone but lose everyone at the same
time by not being precise. Using the Enter key is a good compromise that doesn’t get
you quite to 100% but gets close.
Question 3: These are the features that I will be adding in the next iteration. Will these features
add more value to the prototype?
 To make the content more cognitively accessible, consider breaking up long sentences
and paragraphs. Use simpler and more clear language.
 Consider using keyboard shortcuts instead of emphasizing the mouse
 Use JAWS to read through the site - for whatever reason Search Engines link is said on
the Home Page. You can catch things like this.
Other Information
 Guide is an interesting software application that obscures the GUI of the operating
system and makes things simple (incorporates Dragon speech technology):
http://www.guide-evas.com/
 In general, there is a basic failure of access for information technology regarding users
who have accessibility needs.
 TypeAbility - a program that takes over your entire computer and teaches you how to use
JAWS and makes jokes about jellycopters (what jiggles when it flies?)
 Very passionate and informative

Question 1: What new features that were added to the prototype did you find the most useful?
 The videos were good.
 This website would be very useful for our customers.
 The large font size was wonderful for adult learners.
 The Learning Checks were great and really did a good job testing learners on the skills
that they learned in the module.
Question 2: What new features that were added to the prototype did you find the least useful?
 The Get Help section was useful, but in order to learn how to scroll down, you need to
scroll down.
 How are you going to get adult learners to read through the content?
Question 3: These are the features that I will be adding in the next iteration. Will these features
add more value to the prototype?
 To improve the videos, make the sound more consistent between the screencast and the in
person. Incorporate the telestrations into the videos.
 Break out the sections into different pages to make the content more manageable and less
daunting. For example, in the Get Help section, introduce how to use buttons first. For
the home page, try to get the page to fit on one screen.
 Add information about how to find and reference this website again in the future.
