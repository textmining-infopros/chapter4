ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
While there are many people to thank, I must first express my deepest appreciation to my
major professor, Dr. Marcia A. Mardis, who is not only a fantastic researcher, but also a wonderful
person. She knew when and how much to push me, and always had an encouragement to offer
whenever I was “all loosey goosey.” I could not have made it to this point without her guidance,
wisdom, and support, and I am forever grateful to her for everything she has done for me.

In addition to Dr. Mardis, I must thank the members of my committee: Dr. Michelle
Kazmer, Dr. Don Latham, and Dr. Juliann Woods. I bonded with Dr. Kazmer after she taught me
the phases of theory development, and her insights and energy have been invaluable to me in
completing my dissertation. I am indebted to Dr. Latham, whose keen eye and masterful phrasing
have helped me put a bright polish on my prose. I truly appreciate Dr. Woods for her adaptability
and genuine interest in my work. I must also thank Dr. Kathy Burnett and Dr. Nancy Everhart for
their time and attention during my tenure as a student, and for helping me achieve my goals.

Without my truly amazing family, I know I could not have come this far: I just love all y’all
and know in my bones you love me back. I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge my
friends who have been so supportive of me throughout this process: Sharon, who has been there for
me since before the beginning; Mitchell, who was possibly even more excited about my impending
“Ph.D.-ness” than I; Sergio and Dennis for loads of laughs and tons of food; Jack and Thomas for
many a spirited Mario Kart race; and The Breakfast Club, whom I will never forget. Special thanks
to Nicole for her amazing proofreading skills and countless conversations over lunch. Extra special
thanks to the one true Jen for providing confirmability, if not reliability. Thanks also to my fellow
doc students who helped me feel a sense of community when I sorely needed it: may all of your
Fridays be fun.

ABSTRACT
School librarians’ essential function of providing access to information, and instruction and
guidance in its evaluation, use, production, and communication has endured over a century of
change in education, technology, and society’s access to and use of information. What has changed
is how school librarians perform their roles. As the rate of technological change has accelerated,
perceptions of school librarians’ roles have not always kept pace. School librarians may base their
role perceptions on documentary sources, including professional standards, job descriptions, and
performance evaluations. School administrators may have different perceptions of school librarians’
roles, based on their past experiences with school librarians. When expected, perceived, and enacted
roles differ, school librarians may experience role ambiguity and conflict. With the number of
school librarians in decline, those who remain may experience job insecurity. Feelings of job
insecurity combined with the pressure on schools to achieve more with fewer resources may cause
school librarians to increase their role performance and experience role overload.
This research was designed to analyze how the roles of school librarians were represented in
the performance expectations in the professional standards found in Empowering Learners: Guidelines
for School Library Programs as compared to the performance expectations found in the job descriptions
of school librarians in Florida, to determine what kinds of role performance were expected of school
librarians in Florida that were not represented in the professional standards, and to determine to
what extent the performance expectations on Florida’s school librarians’ job descriptions compared
to the performance measures on their performance evaluations.
The researcher used qualitative content analysis to compared performance expectations from
school librarians’ professional standards to those in their job descriptions. Performance
expectations on the job description that were not represented in the professional standards were
ix
	  

	  

open coded and categorized. The researcher used qualitative content analysis to compare the
performance expectations on school librarians’ job descriptions and the performance measures on
their performance evaluations.
The researcher found that while performance expectations from all of the roles and
guidelines in the professional standards were represented in Florida’s school librarians’ job
descriptions, the most frequently represented role was that of Instructional Partner, and the most
frequently represented guideline was Collection and Information Access; the former speaks to the
future of the profession, while the latter represents its past. Not all types of role performance
expected of school librarians in Florida were represented in the professional standards. Of the open
coded performance expectations, those related to Library Operations and Services were the most
frequently represented.
The analysis of agreement between school librarians’ job descriptions and performance
evaluations found that many of the evaluations had low rates of agreement with their corresponding
job descriptions. The researcher discovered half of Florida’s school districts are using instruments
designed for instructional personnel or support staff to assess school librarians’ performance,
instead of differentiated evaluations designed specifically for school librarians; nearly all of these
instructional personnel or support staff evaluations had low rates of agreement with their
corresponding job description. The researcher also found that when the performance evaluation
was newer and the job description was older, the evaluations tended to have lower rates of
agreement. A few performance evaluations had a greater number of performance measures than the
job description had performance expectations; these evaluations tended to have lower rates of
agreement.

The researcher proposed that school district officials may wish to implement several
practices regarding job descriptions and performance evaluations, including establishing a revision
cycle, where these documents are periodically reviewed and updated; changing revision practices, so
that when either a job description or performance evaluation is updated, the other document is
reviewed as well; and to ensure that there is a balance between the number of performance
expectations and performance measures on the two documents.
This study fills a gap in the research about school librarians’ roles and performance
evaluation, and creates a foundation for further research.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

1.1 Overview
The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001, which was the reauthorization of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, emphasized student achievement as measured by
standardized test scores. For school administrators, NCLB (and its successors) meant that schools
must continually increase test scores or potentially face dire consequences, like the staff losing their
jobs and the closure of their ‘failing’ school (Ravitch, 2010). In 2008, a variety of troubles plagued
the United States’ economy, the consequences of which began to negatively affect funding for public
schools, especially in Florida (“Funding for Florida’s education still lags,” 2012, “States Continue to
Decrease Education Funding,” 2012; Luhby, 2012). These funding problems exacerbated already
declining numbers of school libraries and librarians: by 2008, only 90% of public schools had a
library, and only 62% of public schools had a school librarian (USDOE & NCES, 2009). Since
school librarians’ area of instruction is not one that generates the student achievement test scores
schools require to demonstrate their success in the modern school accountability era, and since
school districts with limited financial resources must do what they can to ensure the survival of their
schools, more school boards opted to eliminate school librarians in response to their budget
shortfalls (Resmovits, 2011; Russon, 2013; Solochek, 2013).
There is an established body of research that correlates school libraries and librarians to
increased student achievement (Baumbach, 2003; Krashen, Lee, & McQuillan, 2012; Lance &
Hofschire, 2011; Lance, Rodney, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2000) in instructional areas assessed on the

1
	  

standardized tests that have become the measure of school effectiveness. If the primary concern of
school districts is increasing student achievement as measured by standardized tests, and research
demonstrates that school libraries and school librarians positively affect student achievement in
areas assessed on those tests, then it is seemingly counterproductive for school districts to cut school
librarians. While the reasons for the declining numbers of school libraries and school librarians may
be multifarious, this loss may in part be a result of poor understandings of school librarians’ roles.
School librarians who do not understand the importance of fully engaging in their roles to benefit
the educational program of the school may not be making visible contributions to student
achievement, and school administrators who do not understand how school librarians positively
affect student achievement and what the library program has to offer the educational program of the
school may not be disposed to retain them when facing further budget cuts.

1.1.1 School Librarians’ Perceptions of Their Roles
In addition to school administrators’ perceptions of school librarians’ roles, school librarians
have their own perceptions about their roles (O’Neal, 2004). School librarians have been able to
look to professional standards crafted by AASL and other related professional organizations since
the early 20th century (National Education Association, Certain, North Central Association of
Colleges and Secondary Schools, & American Library Association, 1920). New sets of professional
standards have periodically been published in response to changes in the fields of librarianship and
education, with each subsequent iteration of the professional standards presenting its own unique
challenges and opportunities (O’Neal, 2004).
While there is research about how pre-service school librarians use the professional
standards to shape their perceptions of their future roles (Mardis, 2007, 2013; Mardis & Dickinson,
2
	  

2009), there is no apparent research on how the professional standards influence current
practitioners’ perceptions of their roles. School librarians’ perceptions about what their roles should
be may not align with the current professional standards (McCarthy, 1997; McCracken, 2001;
Whelan, 2003). This difference may, in part, be due to the time it takes for new concepts to be
embraced (Pickard, 1993). Craver cited a ten year lag between the introduction of a concept in the
profession and its adoption, though she also admitted this number is “difficult to prove” (1986, p.
185). The difference may also be related, in part, to school librarians’ perceptions of the feasibility
of implementing the standards: McCarthy’s (1997) research showed that nine years after the
publication of Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs (AASL& AECT, 1988),
only 42% of the school librarians surveyed believed that those standards were able to be achieved at
their schools.
Three years after the publication of Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (AASL&
AECT, 1998), McCracken (2001) found that the school librarians surveyed preferred the
information specialist role, and were not expanding into teaching and leadership, facets of the role
that may have a more significant effect on student achievement. This reluctance to expand into
these roles could be related to the declining numbers of school librarians: if they are not
demonstrating a visible effect on student achievement by actively teaching or providing instructional
leadership, then school districts and administrators may begin to question why it is necessary to
retain school librarians, especially in the face of decreased resources and increased accountability.

1.1.2 Administrators’ Perceptions of School Librarians’ Roles
During their administration training programs, future school administrators typically do not
receive instruction about how to best utilize the unique capabilities of school librarians (Kaplan,
3
	  

2007); unless they consciously choose to learn more about how school librarians can effectively
contribute to the educational program of the school, administrators may be operating on outdated
conceptions of what school librarians can contribute to student achievement (Hartzell, 2002).
School administrators may also base their perceptions, both positive and negative, upon their
personal and professional experiences with school librarians (Church, 2008). Some principals are
not supportive of school librarians expanding their roles (Shannon, 2009); a lack of school
administrator support limits what school librarians are capable of achieving with their programs
(Oberg, 2009).
The problem of ambiguous administrator perceptions of school librarians and the influences
these perceptions have on the school library’s ability to positively affect the educational program of
the school is not a new phenomenon (Johnson, 1950). However, there are beginning to be some
signs of change: although Dorrel and Lawson’s survey of school administrators in Missouri found
that many of them held “a traditional view of the school librarian as a person who purchases,
processes, and circulates books” (1995, p. 79), a more recent study (Shannon, 2009) found some
administrators more supportive of school librarians’ roles as envisioned in the professional standards
put forth by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the Association for
Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) in Information Power: Building Partnerships for
Learning (AASL & AECT, 1998).

1.1.3 Evaluating School Librarians’ Performance
A lack of understanding of school librarians’ roles can only further complicate the issue of
performance evaluations focused on measuring teacher effectiveness through student achievement
on standardized test scores (Matula, 2011; Ravitch, 2010) that is concomitant with the school
4
	  

accountability movement; it is difficult to accurately assess that which is poorly understood.
Performance evaluation of school librarians is already a complicated issue: when school librarians are
evaluated at all (Taylor & Bryant, 1996), administrators may lack the training or guidance from the
state (Stronge & Tucker, 1995; Wilson & Wood, 1996) on how to properly use the performance
evaluation instruments. Administrators’ perceptions of what school librarians should be doing may
also influence how they evaluate what their school librarians are actually doing (Bryant, 2002; Dorrell
& Lawson, 1995); administrators who are not supportive of a larger role for school librarians may
not acknowledge that role performance on their school librarians’ performance evaluations when it
occurs.
There is a long-standing problem with school librarians being evaluated using instruments
designed for classroom teachers (Bryant, 2002; Vincelette & Pfister, 1984; Young, Green, & Gross,
1995). This is a problem for school librarians because, while they are a part of a school’s
instructional staff (Stronge & Helm, 1992), an evaluation designed for classroom teachers will
necessarily fail to capture the larger complexities of school librarians’ work that are beyond their
roles as teachers. Ultimately, while school librarians may have a positive impact on student
achievement as measured by standardized tests, they may have a difficult time satisfactorily
demonstrating that on the performance evaluations that have arisen as a result of the modern school
accountability movement.

1.2 Problem Statement
The most recent set of professional standards for school librarians from AASL is Empowering
Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, and it describes the organization’s ideal of the work in
5
	  

which school librarians should be engaged. School librarians have their own visions of what their
work should be (O’Neal, 2004), and those visions may have to be reconciled with their school
administrators’ visions of what school librarians’ roles should be. As an organization, AASL does
not employ school librarians: they are employed by the school districts in which they work. While
the professional standards may represent the aspirations of the professional organization, school
librarians are contractually obligated to fulfill the job descriptions under which they are hired, as well
as to satisfy the requirements of their performance evaluations. If school librarians’ performance
responsibilities from their professional standards are different from school librarians’ performance
responsibilities in their job descriptions, and school librarians’ performance evaluations are
measuring yet something else, then school librarians may have difficulty forming a clear idea of
precisely what they should be doing to contribute to the educational program of their schools.

1.3 Significance of the Research
The researcher explored the relationship between the performance expectations from the
professional standards found in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs and the
performance expectations from the job descriptions of school librarians in Florida. The researcher
found that although performance expectations from all the roles and guidelines in Empowering
Learners were represented in the job descriptions of school librarians in Florida, not all of the
performance expectations from the job descriptions were represented in Empowering Learners; the
majority of those performance expectations from the job descriptions were either related to
explicitly detailing the actions necessary to run a school library, such as circulating materials,
collecting fines, performing interlibrary loans, and providing reference assistance and reading
guidance, or were expectations that spoke to complying with school district policies and
6
	  

demonstrating professionalism. This finding has implications for role overload and role conflict in
school librarians: although the performance expectations from the professional standards and the
job descriptions are not necessarily contradictory, if school librarians accept a conception of their
roles that encompasses more of the performance expectations, it means that they may not be able to
complete all of their performance expectations, leaving them to choose some aspects of their roles
over others.
The researcher found one performance expectation in 42% of the job descriptions that
required role performance outside the domain of school librarianship, where school librarians were
expected to assist with the school testing program. Compliance with standardized testing
regulations is taken very seriously in Florida, and it is often the case that additional personnel are
needed to satisfy the requirements, but the phrasing ‘assist with the school testing program’ is vague:
it could mean any level of assistance, for any type of testing performed in the school. This
performance expectation has the potential to significantly diminish school librarians’ abilities to
perform their roles, depending on the level and frequency of assistance school librarians are
expected to provide.
The researcher also explored how the performance expectations from the school librarians’
job descriptions in Florida compared to the performance measures on their evaluations. Of these 49
comparisons, 37 of the school districts had a rate of agreement between their performance
expectations and performance measures of 50% or less, with 16 of those at less than 10% and 4 of
those at 0%. These low rates of agreement are a serious problem for Florida’s school librarians,
especially as the state passed ‘pay for performance’ legislation in 2011. The low rates of agreement
also have implications for role conflict, as school librarians face the choice of doing what is expected
or what is measured. One reason that there may be such low rates of agreement between the job
7
	  

descriptions and the performance evaluations is that as school districts have revised their evaluations
to prepare for the implementation of the ‘pay for performance’ legislation, they have not necessarily
revised their job descriptions: the median age difference between the performance evaluations and
job descriptions with the rates of agreement under 10% is 12 years.
This research is significant because it represents a unique contribution to the corpus of
existing knowledge, and creates a foundation upon which researchers can further explore issues
related to school librarians’ performance expectations and performance evaluation.

1.4 Research Purpose
The purposes of this research were to 1) compare how the performance expectations from
school librarians’ professional standards compare to the performance expectations from school
librarians’ job descriptions in Florida, 2) determine what types of performance expectations appear
in Florida’s school librarians’ job descriptions that are not represented in their professional
standards, and 3) determine how the performance expectations from Florida’s school librarians’ job
descriptions compare to the performance measures from their performance evaluations to better
understand what types of role performance are expected of school librarians in Florida. The
purpose of this research was not to analyze the role perceptions of school librarians, school
administrators, or other stakeholders.
Research into what school librarians’ performance expectations and performance measures
are can help focus their visions of their roles. Additionally, this research explores previously
uncharted territory: a small body of research has analyzed the contents of job advertisements for

8
	  

academic librarians, but no research has performed this analysis on school librarians’ job
descriptions, especially as compared to their performance evaluations or professional standards.

1.5 Research Questions
The overarching questions for this research aret how the performance expectations for
school librarians described in their professional standards compare with those from their job
descriptions, and how those performance expectations are measured by their performance
evaluations. In order to investigate this topic, the following research questions were developed:
RQ1. Which performance expectations from the professional standards in Empowering
Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs are represented in Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions?
RQ2. What kinds of performance expectations from Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions are not represented in the professional standards from Empowering Learners?
RQ3. How do the performance expectations from Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions compare to the performance measures from Florida school librarians’
performance evaluations?

1.6 Overview of Research Method
This research focused on Florida school districts. Florida is an ideal place to conduct this
research because it a large number of school librarians: nearly every district has school librarian
9
	  

positions. Florida was significantly affected by the foreclosure crisis (Harwell, 2013), which
negatively affected the state’s school funding (Toppo & Gillum, 2009). Further, in 2011, the Florida
Legislature passed SB 736, the Student Success Act, which established a system to provide
‘performance pay’ to teachers based on the achievement of their students on standardized tests,
requiring districts to revamp their performance evaluation practices for all instructional staff.
The current professional standards are found in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School
Library Programs (AASL, 2009). Although some job descriptions and performance evaluations were
publicly available on their respective school districts’ websites, the researcher contacted a human
resources representative from each Florida school district to ensure that the job descriptions and
performance evaluations being analyzed were the ones currently in use by the school districts.
Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data to answer the research questions.
For the first two questions, a code book was developed using the roles and guidelines from the
professional standards found in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (AASL,
2009); performance responsibilities that were not able to be coded using the code book were open
coded and categorized. For the third question, the researcher compared the performance
responsibilities from each school district’s school librarians’ job description to the performance
measures from the school librarians’ performance evaluation from the same district. Since each
performance expectation and performance measure contained an action, or a type of performance,
and an object, or a subject upon which the performance is enacted, the researcher determined that
the most effective way to perform the analysis was to compare the action and object from each
performance expectation in the job descriptions to those from the professional standards. Similarly,
each performance expectation from a school district’s school librarians’ job description was

10
	  

compared to the performance measures from the same district’s school librarians’ performance
evaluation.

1.7 Limitations of the Research
This research is a qualitative content analysis of the professional standards for school
librarians presented in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (American Association
of School Librarians, 2009), and the job descriptions and performance evaluations of public school
librarians in Florida. Data were not collected or analyzed from private, parochial, charter, or
university partnership/lab schools, so the findings of this research may have little or no relevance to
school librarians working in those types of institutions. Qualitative content analysis cannot be used
to demonstrate causal relationships (Berg, 2007), but establishing causal relationships is outside the
scope of this research. The findings of this research are not generalizable to the larger population of
school librarians, but that is also outside the scope of this research.

1.8 Definition of Terms
These terms are frequently used in this research, and their operational definitions were
distilled from the research. The following terms are defined as:
Job description – a school board approved collection of stated performance expectations for
school librarians that may also contain required or recommended qualifications; knowledge, skills,
and abilities; and physical requirements.

11
	  

Performance evaluation – a school board approved instrument that uses performance
measures to assess school librarians’ role performance.
Performance expectation – actions or behaviors required of an individual filling a specific
role or position within an organization.
Performance indicator – a statement that accompanies a performance measure to provide
greater clarity or context for the measure.
Performance measure – a performance expectation that has an associated metric to
determine the quality of the performance
Professional standards – a collection of performance expectations assembled by AASL that
represents its vision of the roles of school librarians.
School librarian – a member of the instructional staff who facilitates the operation of the
school library and fulfills the functions of the school library program.

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
In this chapter, the researcher reviews the development and expansion of school libraries,
the evolution of school librarians’ professional standards, research about role perceptions and
factors that influence them, research about issues affecting school librarians’ performance
evaluation, and research related to library job postings and analyses of the interplay among
professional standards, job descriptions, and performance evaluation.

2.1 A Brief History of School Libraries
American schools have not always had libraries. Poor or non-existent records make it
difficult to know exactly to what extent school libraries existed during the early part of the nation’s
history, but New York was the first state to allocate funds specifically for that purpose in 1838
(Greenman, 1913). During the later 1800s, a variety of models for providing library services in
schools were in place: Books were provided by the public library, the public and school library
shared collections and rotated materials, the public library was housed on the school campus, or
schools simply went without library materials (M. H. Harris, 1995). The history of the development
and expansion of school libraries may provide insights into their ultimate fate, or as eloquently
stated by Confucius, “study the past if you would divine the future.”	  
	  

2.1.1 The Establishment and Expansion of School Libraries
None of the other models for providing library services to schools could offer the efficiency
and level of service of having a dedicated, centralized collection of materials on school grounds,
13
	  

managed by a qualified individual. By 1915, most people considered having a school library to be
critical to advancing the educational mission of the schools (M. H. Harris, 1995). Unfortunately,
creating a new library was an expensive proposition: The cost of the materials budget alone specified
in Elementary School Library Standards (National Education Association, ALA, & Certain, 1925) was
approximately $4000, or at least $53,200 in 2013 dollars (“Measuring Worth,” 2013), making the
initial start-up cost prohibitive to many districts and states. Until that time, the federal government
had not yet begun to play a significant role in the funding and operation of the nation’s schools, but
this changed as the country prepared to enter World War I; in 1917, the Smith-Hughes Act
increased the amount of federal dollars available to education, leading to a transformation of
secondary schools (Rudy, 2003). It was at this time that the school library as an institution began its
slow but steady expansion.
From 1895 to 1912 the number of school libraries in the United States had more than
doubled, from 5290 to 11734 (Greenman, 1913). By 1945, approximately 16 million of the nation’s
25 million students were receiving library services of some quality at their school; about half of those
students lived in rural districts (ALA, Douglas, M. P., & AASL, 1945). Though secondary school
libraries were continuing to grow, elementary school libraries were getting short shrift: The
information needs of elementary students and teachers were filled by classroom libraries, public
libraries, or went unmet (ALA, Douglas, M. P., & AASL, 1945).
By 1953, the percentage of secondary schools receiving library services had jumped from
65% to 95%, though only 36% percent of them were receiving those services from a centralized
library at the school, or what would properly be called a school library USDOE & NCES, 2005b).
Elementary schools continued to lag behind, with only 25% of them having a school library; it was

14
	  

unclear what percentage of elementary schools received library services from either classroom or
public libraries, or had no library services at all (AASL & ALA, 1960).

2.1.2 School Libraries in the Space Age
By the late 1950s, education as a whole was in crisis. The post-war baby boom had stretched
the capacity of the nation’s schools to the brink. Teachers were leaving the field in droves for better
paying jobs. Local governments were faced with the choice of raising property taxes beyond the
point of affordability in order to meet funding demands for schools. The 1957 launch of Sputnik
and the escalation of the Cold War made education a matter of national security (Rudy, 2003). In
1958 the National Defense Education Act passed, and the funds allocated could be spent on minor
renovations and equipment, including print and AV materials (USDOE & NCES, 2005a). However,
these funds were not specifically allocated for developing school libraries; school administrators
were not bound to spend those any of those dollars on the school library, or to house any of the
materials purchased with them in the school library collection. Even if materials were purchased,
the process of selecting those materials was not always optimal (USDOE & NCES, 2005a).
By 1959, the number of schools that had libraries had jumped to 50%, though this was
probably more a function of the closing of over 46,000 schools in the preceding five years than a
sudden surge in commitment to school libraries; it is likely that most of the schools that were closed
were older and did not have libraries. However, the number of school libraries also dropped by
over 5000, so clearly some of the schools that were closed had school libraries (USDOE & NCES,
2005b). The growth of school libraries did not keep pace with the growth of new schools; by 1961
over 20,000 new schools had opened, but only slightly over 6,000 new school libraries had opened
(USDOE & NCES, 2005b). This brought the percentage of schools with libraries down to 46%.
15
	  

Two years later, another 19,000 schools closed, but unlike the period from 1954 to 1959, this time
the number of school libraries increased by over 1600; this brought the percentage of schools with
libraries rocketing up to 59%.
Before becoming president, Lyndon Johnson had been a teacher, and education funding saw
great expansion during his term. The 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act specifically
allocated funds for the development of school library resources through Title II (USDOE & NCES,
2005a). Funds could be spent on print or AV materials, textbooks, and other instructional materials.
This sudden influx of funds allowed school libraries to flourish: By 1978, 85% of schools had a
library media center, and there was an average of 12 books per student (USDOE & NCES, 2005b);
this growth trend continued through 1990.

2.1.3 School Libraries in the Information Age
As school libraries entered the post-Information Power (AASL & AECT, 1988) era, something
strange happened: After reaching a peak in 1993-1994, with 96% of schools having a school library
and 83% of schools having a school librarian, these numbers began to drop. In 1999-2000, only
92% of schools had a library USDOE & NCES, 2005b). After a mild resurgence in 2003-04, the
number of school libraries dropped again in 2007-08, with 90% of schools having a school library
and only 62% of schools having a school librarian (USDOE & NCES, 2009). The development and
expansion of school libraries has also affected the roles of school librarians, and their ultimate fates
are inextricably linked.

2.2 The Development of Professional Standards for School Librarians and The
Evolution of Their Roles
This section includes a discussion of how the professional standards for school librarians
were developed and how their roles evolved in response to changes in society and education.

2.2.1 School Libraries and Librarianship Codified: The First Sets of Professional Standards
In the 1920s, ALA, in cooperation with the National Education Association (NEA), created
Standard Library Organization and Equipment for Secondary Schools of Different Sizes (NEA,
Certain, North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, & ALA, 1920) and
Elementary School Library Standards (NEA et al., 1925), the first two sets of standards to describe
what secondary and elementary school libraries should look like (to the level of detail of acceptable
types of flooring, paint colors, and finishes for woodwork) and the types of services the librarian
should provide. The secondary school standards were published first in 1920, followed by the
elementary school standards in 1925. Both sets of these first standards discuss the types of work the
school librarian could be expected to perform: administrative, technical, and instructional.
Administrative and technical tasks encompassed what one would suppose: collection
development, managing circulations, collecting fines, cataloging books and typing up their cards,
binding and book repairs, organizing materials and so forth. The standards also specified that the
school librarian was to be of equal status as a teacher, in terms of both pay and importance. Of
greater note is that an instructional component has been present in the role since the beginning:
both secondary and elementary school librarians were expected to teach their students in the use of
library materials and to foster a love of reading in their students.
17
	  

Although the types of instruction specified in the elementary standards were prefaced with
“the instruction is not to be formalized” (NEA et al., 1925, p. 17), they provided a breakdown of
specific content that should be taught at each grade level. An interesting bit of phrasing from the
elementary standards states that one of the goals of the library is “To train children to like to read
that which is worth while [sic]” (NEA et al., 1925, p. 4); the implication being that some materials
are not worthwhile. This attitude was perhaps reflective of a desire to enforce cultural or social
norms by discouraging interest in and access to materials that could have led to independent
thinking and challenges to the dominant paradigm. The secondary standards also provided
recommended instructional content, but were not as specific or tightly structured as the elementary
standards.
Both sets of standards also specified that the school librarian should be included in
meetings with teachers that discussed instructional policy (NEA, Certain, North Central Association
of Colleges and Secondary Schools, & ALA, 1920; NEA et al., 1925) in order to facilitate their
collection development; this may have been the original germ of the idea that school librarians and
teachers should collaborate on instruction. Both secondary and elementary school librarians were
also expected to encourage their students in their future use of the public library.

2.2.2 School Librarianship after World War II
By 1945, the United States had been through the Great Depression, and World War II was
drawing to a close. At this time, many of the nation’s schools were in disrepair, but there was little
sentiment for increasing education spending (Rudy, 2003). This is also when the next set of
professional standards for school librarians was published; these standards covered both elementary
and secondary schools, as have all subsequent standards. The administrative and technical roles of
18
	  

the school librarian were present in the 1945 standards, and had remained essentially the same as
those from the 1920s, though the discussion of their function was less detailed and couched in
general terms; for example, the 1945 standards said nothing about how frequently circulation should
occur or the collection of fines. In contrast, the expectations of the instructional role had deepened:
Instead of just fostering a love of reading in their students, school librarians were expected to have
deep knowledge of the books in their collections and to be knowledgeable about their students’
reading abilities, (even to the point of keeping records of their students’ material selections, and
informing the teachers and guidance counselor of their students’ needs and interests).
School librarians were also expected to “provide an opportunity through library experiences
for boys and girls to develop helpful interests, to make satisfactory personal adjustments, and to
acquire desirable social attitudes” (ALA, Douglas, M. P., & AASL, 1945, p. 10); this phrasing
hearkens back to the idea of teaching children to prefer reading “worth while [sic]” materials from
the 1920s standards. In addition, school librarians were expected to “cooperate with other teachers”
(ALA, Douglas, & AASL, 1945, p. 12), the word “other” seeming to indicate that school librarians
should consider themselves as teachers as well. Specific mention is made of collaboration with the
guidance counselor, health and physical education, and home economics teachers to provide “social
and occupational guidance” (ALA, Douglas, M. P., & AASL, 1945, p. 12) to students.
School librarians were also expected to participate in curriculum development by serving on
committees and providing expertise; materials to support the school’s curriculum were also expected
to be provided through the library. School librarians were expected to prepare bibliographies for a
variety of reading levels and interests, and to assist with remedial programs, especially as they related
to reading and study skills. School librarians were still expected to teach students how to use various
reference materials; this was to facilitate independent information seeking on the part of the
19
	  

students, as opposed to the school librarian providing reference services. Interestingly, by 1945, the
expectation that school librarians should encourage the use of public libraries had vanished from the
list of standards.

2.2.3 Expanding the Role of the School Librarian
While the description of the roles in the 1960 professional standards was largely unchanged
from the 1945 standards, there are a few differences worth noting. For the first time, mention is
made of serving parents and the larger community, in addition to students and teachers. Specific
types of instructional activities (book talks, storytelling, reading aloud) were also mentioned for the
first time, as well as how to manage a student assistant program (AASL & ALA, 1960). The idea
that students might also be communicators of information, instead of just receivers of it, was briefly
mentioned. However, the most interesting difference was the discussion of audiovisual (AV)
materials in the schools.
By 1960, there had been a significant expansion of AV materials in the schools but there was
not a clear delineation of AV services: some schools had a separate AV coordinator and collection in
addition to a school librarian and school library, while in other schools the school librarian was
responsible for both. The professional standards recommended that the AV collection and
personnel should fall under the aegis of the library and librarian; they even addressed the (apparently
fierce) discussion about what to call such a place: “A school library does not have to change its name
to embrace new materials and new uses of all types of materials any more than a school has to call
itself by some other name to indicate that it is a continuously growing social institution. Services, not
words, portray the image of the school library.” (AASL & ALA, 1960, p. 13)

20
	  

2.2.4 From School Librarian to Media Specialist and the Beginning of Intellectual Freedom
The steady incursion of media into school libraries necessitated a new set of professional
standards only nine years after the previous ones; Standards for School Library Programs (AASL & ALA,
1960) became Standards for School Media Programs (AASL & Department of Audiovisual Instruction of
the NEA, 1969), and the school library had been rebranded as a “media center”. Accordingly, the
instructional role of the school librarian had further broadened. New duties included assisting
students, teachers, and technicians, in the design and production of media; helping students to
develop listening, viewing, and reading skills; being a resource in the classroom at the teacher’s
request; and providing information about professional development opportunities to the teachers
(AASL & Department of Audiovisual Instruction of the NEA, 1969). In working with students
selecting materials, school librarians were also expected to teach the concepts of evaluating those
materials. The administrative and technical roles were touched upon, though their scant treatment
presaged the waning importance of these roles to the work of school librarians.
The late sixties and early seventies were a time of tremendous upheaval in society: Cultural
norms that had encouraged social conformity began to fall away in favor of an emphasis on
individuality and questioning authority. After the relative largesse of education spending under
President Johnson, President Nixon used a variety of budget strategies to block or impound almost
a billion dollars of federal money for education. However, after President Nixon became embroiled
in the Watergate scandal and resigned, education funding began to flow again under President Ford
(Rudy, 2003). Funding was expanded for programs to serve bilingual education, students with
disabilities, and even to increase desegregation efforts. Perhaps it was the great number of changes
in society and education during such a short period that hastened the publication of a new set of
school library standards; six years after the publication of Standards for School Media Programs (AASL &

21
	  

Department of Audiovisual Instruction of the NEA, 1969) a new set of professional standards for
school librarians was published.
Media Programs: District and School (AASL & AECT, 1975) represented a sea change in the
conceptualization of the school librarian’s instructional role: a greater emphasis was placed on the
communication of ideas through the creation of media, and application of information. The social
programming of teaching students to like books that were “worth while [sic]” (National Education
Association et al., 1925, p. 4) in the furtherance of them developing “desirable social attitudes”
(ALA, Douglas, M. P., & AASL, 1945, p. 10) fell away in favor of encouraging intellectual freedom
and access to information. School librarians were expected to integrate their program within the
context of the larger instructional program of the school, and to evaluate the efficacy of their
programming and instruction. School librarians were still expected to assist teachers with
curriculum, but now at a much deeper level: they were called on to facilitate course development,
instructional design, and the “creation of alternative modes of learning” (AASL, & AECT, 1975, p.
13). For the first time, school librarians were also expected to engage in public relations to “transmit
information about media program objectives and functions to develop public awareness and
support” (AASL, & AECT, 1975, p. 55).

2.2.5 From Media Specialist to Information Specialist
During the 1980s, as computer technology became more affordable and available, computers
began their inexorable march into the schools. In response, the school library professional
standards broadened their focus on media to become Information Power: Guidelines for School Library
Media Programs (AASL & AECT, 1988). These professional standards reconstituted and condensed

22
	  

school librarians’ roles into three primary roles: information specialist, teacher, and instructional
consultant.
The information specialist role was essentially a rebranding of the librarianship role; it
consisted of providing access to materials in adequate numbers and of acceptable quality, and
guiding users in the selection of appropriate resources, and subsumed the formerly distinct
administrative role. The teacher role spoke to the specific content that school librarians should be
teaching like information skills and the use and communication of information. However, the
content area had expanded greatly to include new topics like copyright and privacy, constitutional
rights, critical thinking, encouraging lifelong learning, and educating students on the role of the
school librarian (AASL & AECT, 1988). The teacher role also expanded to include not only
providing professional development to staff, but also to offering instruction to parents about
recognizing the needs of their students and how to enhance their reading, viewing, and listening.
The instructional consultant role added the expectation that school librarians would not only be
involved in the development of instructional activities, but also in their assessment. And for the first
time, it was explicitly stated that school librarians were expected to be leaders in order to build the
credibility of the library program as an “integral part of teaching and learning in the school” (AASL,
& AECT, 1988, p. 43).
By the late 1990’s, computers had almost completely infiltrated the nation’s schools, and
they were networked, allowing users to access information from around the world. This
unprecedented level of access to information necessitated a new set of standards, leading to the 1998
publication of Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (AASL & Association for Educational
Communications and Technology, 1998). This set of standards was unlike any that had preceded it:
for the first time, specific instructional standards with indicators and subject area connections were
23
	  

included. Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (AASL & Association for Educational
Communications and Technology, 1998) described four roles of the school librarian: teacher,
instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator. Though the essence of
these roles was not remarkably different from the previous set of professional standards, the
intervening decade had seen the rise of internet access in schools, and the roles were reframed to
accommodate this new paradigm. It is noteworthy that Information Power: Building Partnerships for
Learning (AASL & Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 1998) placed the
role of teacher and instructional partner ahead of that of information specialist. It is also
noteworthy that for the first time, the standards did not address the facilities aspects of school
librarianship.

2.2.6 School Librarians Today
In 2009, AASL published the most recent set of professional standards, Empowering Learners:
Guidelines for School Library Programs. This comparatively slim volume (it has 64 pages where
Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning has 205 pages) largely served as a reaffirmation of
what had come before (the school librarian’s role is that of an instructional partner, information
specialist, leader, teacher, and program administrator) but condensed and reworded the roles from
their previous description.
Another difference between Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning and Empowering
Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs is in the treatment of the student learning standards.
Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning provided nine information literacy standards, with
indicators, proficiency levels, a narrative description of the “standards in action” (AASL & AECT,
1998, p. 12), and a connection to specific content area standards. Empowering Learners: Guidelines for
24
	  

School Library Programs’ discussion of student learning standards was abbreviated, with the standards
themselves condensed: Instead of the nine information literacy standards presented in the previous
professional standards, Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs mentions four
learning standards. These four learning standards are further discussed under separate cover in
Standards for the 21st Century Learner (AASL, 2007) and in Standards for the 21st Century Learner
in Action (AASL, 2009b).

2.2.7 The Evolution of School Librarianship
Over the past century, the essential function of the school librarian (that of providing access
to information and instruction and guidance in its evaluation, use, production, and communication)
has endured. However, as with organismic evolution, the anatomy of school librarianship has
changed in response to environmental conditions it has faced. One of these conditions has had a
greater influence than all of the others: technology.
Advances in technology have tremendously affected the technical role of school librarianship
as initially envisioned. For fifty years after the publication of the first sets of professional standards,
the technical role was an essential part of school librarianship, because it was inextricably intertwined
with providing access to materials: School librarians had to create and file physical cards in the card
catalog so that their patrons could find the materials they were seeking. Now, technology has made
the technical role almost completely vestigial: not only are there readily available Machine Readable
Cataloging (MARC) records for materials, these records are able to be downloaded into networked
Online Public Access Catalogs (OPAC), making it possible to update the catalog instantaneously.
These technological advances have freed school librarians from the toil of typing and filing catalog
cards (Murphy, 1988), allowing them to spend more time on their other roles.
25
	  

The administrator role as initially envisioned has also been affected by technology. While
the administrator role is still present, the performance of some functions of that role have been
greatly facilitated by automation software, which makes it possible to quickly circulate materials,
create reports, and analyze the collection. In turn, vendors have made it easy to use those collection
analyses to assemble orders, recommending titles in areas that need strengthening, and decreasing
the risk of ordering duplicate titles; it is also possible to order books “shelf ready” so that as soon as
the physical materials arrive in the library, their MARC records can be added to the OPAC and they
can begin circulating.
Technology has transformed the instructional role of school librarians. Technology has not
only revolutionized how school librarians teach, by providing them with a variety of new tools for
designing and delivering instruction, but it has also become something for school librarians to teach:
as media entered the schools, school librarians taught skills in viewing and listening (AASL &
Department of Audiovisual Instruction of the NEA, 1969). Today, students learn communication,
information, and technology literacy skills in their school libraries. Where once students learned
how to use the card catalog, school librarians now teach students how to use the OPAC; instead of
teaching students how to use guide words to find articles in a print encyclopedia, school librarians
now teach students how to search for information on the internet. School librarians still teach
students how to synthesize the information they find and communicate it (AASL & AECT, 1975),
but now those students have access to a global audience instead of just a local one, and are taught
the skills to communicate that information through a variety of digital media.
In addition to technology use, school librarians have expanded instruction into other content
areas as well, such as how to legally and ethically use information, encompassing topics like
copyright, fair use, and privacy. Instead of teaching students “to like to read that which is worth
26
	  

while [sic]” (NEA et al., 1925, p. 4), modern school librarians promote intellectual freedom, and
teach the critical thinking skills that are necessary to enjoy it. As the curricular purview of school
librarians has expanded, so too have the populations they are expected to serve: no longer just
students or teachers, but also parents and even the larger community. With the advances in
technology significantly reducing the amount of work necessary to fulfill the technical and
administrative roles, it is not any wonder that the teaching role has come to be a central focus of the
school librarian’s role.

2.3 School Librarians’ Role Perceptions and Role Performance
School librarians have their own perceptions of their roles (McCracken, 2001; O’Neal, 2004)
but school administrators’ perceptions of school librarians’ roles may differ (Church, 2008, 2010;
Shannon, 2009) from those of school librarians, causing role ambiguity or conflict. As the number
of school librarians has decreased (USDOE & NCES, 2005b, 2009), the remaining school librarians
have likely experienced a sense of job insecurity, which they may try to compensate for by increasing
their role performance. School districts and administrators may also have increased their
performance expectations for school librarians. As performance expectations increase, school
librarians may feel a sense of role overload. School librarians’ role performance is measured on their
evaluations, but these evaluations are not always tailored for school librarians, and their evaluators
are not always trained on how to properly use the instruments. Evaluation of school library
programs is sometimes conflated with the evaluation of school librarians’ role performance;
although related, they are separate. All of these factors have the potential to affect school librarians’
role performance.

27
	  

2.3.1 Formation of Role Perceptions
A role may be defined as behaviors expected of employees filling a specific position in an
organization (Hartenian, Hadaway, & Badovick, 1994). Employees may use sources like assigned
responsibilities, job descriptions, and performance expectations to inform their perceptions of their
roles (Dierdorff & Rubin, 2007; Schuler, Aldag, & Brief, 1977). Employee role perceptions are also
influenced by their organization’s culture, and how employees perceive their roles may differ from
how their organization perceives their roles (Graen, 1976): Organizations have their own ideas about
how a specific role should be fulfilled. Over time, perceptions of employees’ roles may change,
based on their interactions with supervisors and other employees (Yun, Takeuchi, & Liu, 2007).
Employees have their own values and beliefs that shape their perceptions of their roles, and
employees who perform identical job functions fulfill those roles in diverse ways (Dierdorff &
Rubin, 2007; Morgeson, Delaney-Klinger, & Hemingway, 2005). School librarians have had
professional standards to inform their role perceptions since the publication of the first standards in
1920 (NEA et al., 1920), in addition to other sources like job descriptions and organizational culture.

2.3.2 Role Ambiguity
Role ambiguity may arise when employees do not know what is expected of them, or how
best to meet their role performance expectations (Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, & Snoek, 1964).
Employees’ role performance and organizational outcomes are affected by role ambiguity
(Koustelios, Theodorakis, & Goulimaris, 2004). Without clear performance expectations, employees
may struggle with developing their identity, finding a direction, or understanding the importance of
their work, causing the employee to experience stress (Kahn et al., 1964; Koustelios et al., 2004;
Schuler et al., 1977). Role ambiguity is associated with decreased reward probabilities and role
28
	  

performance (Schuler et al., 1977); unclear performance expectations can serve as a justification for
employees to contribute minimal role performance and to not set performance goals for themselves
(Yun et al., 2007). The effects of role ambiguity are not necessarily negative, though: Employees
may use nebulous performance expectations to fulfill their roles according to their own visions (Yun
et al., 2007), and experience a higher sense of job satisfaction that comes with greater autonomy
(Dierdorff, Rubin, & Bachrach, 2012).
Role ambiguity may be defined in general as a “lack of clear, consistent information” (Kahn
et al., 1964, p. 23), or as the difference between an employee’s expected and perceived roles
(Hartenian et al., 1994). Research shows that job candidates typically do not have realistic
expectations about their future roles (Wanous, 1980). Pre-service school librarians value the
professional standards of their future profession as important to the formation of their role
perceptions (Mardis, 2007, 2013; Mardis & Dickinson, 2009), but current practitioners may not
always believe those professional standards are achievable (McCarthy, 1997).

2.3.3 Role Conflict
Role conflict results from inconsistent behavior expectations (Rizzo, House, & Lirtzman,
1970). Employees may experience different types of role conflict: intra-sender conflict, when a
supervisor has conflicting expectations; inter-sender conflict, when employees receive conflicting
expectations from supervisors and peers; inter-role conflict, when an employee feels pressure to
choose aspects of one role over another; and person-role conflict, when an employee’s values
conflict with her or his role expectations (Kahn et al., 1964). Role conflict may cause employees
stress, decrease their job satisfaction and role performance, and negatively affect their performance
evaluations (Hartenian et al., 1994). Supervisors can reduce role conflict by assuring employees that
29
	  

their actual roles will be comparable to their perceived roles (Hartenian et al., 1994). Employees can
reduce role conflict through realism (Dubinsky, Howell, Ingram, & Bellenger, 1986), or having a
more accurate and complete idea of what will be entailed in their positions (Hartenian et al., 1994).
School librarians and school administrators have different perceptions about school
librarians’ roles (Dorrell & Lawson, 1995; Hartzell, 2002). The two most recent sets of professional
standards (AASL & AECT, 1998; AASL, 2009a) have placed a greater emphasis on the instructional
role of the school librarian. Some administrators have a limited perception of school librarians’
roles, and prefer school librarians to engage in more ‘traditional’ activities associated with the
Information Specialist role, like providing materials and reference assistance (Shannon, 2009). Other
administrators have a broader perception of school librarians’ roles, actively encourage collaboration
between teachers and school librarians, and support school librarians’ leadership and participation in
school committees (Church, 2010). School librarians have their own role perceptions based on their
existing competencies, which can affect the types of work in which they choose to engage
(Sandberg, 2000). When teachers and administrators do not understand what the school librarian is
capable of providing, they are less likely to support those efforts (Hartzell, 2001). Without support
from their administrators, school librarians are limited in what they can achieve with their programs
(Oberg, 2009)

2.3.4 Job Insecurity
Role ambiguity and role conflict affect employees’ perceptions of control over their role
performance, which may create a feeling of job insecurity (Ashford, Lee, & Bobko, 1989). Job
insecurity is defined as a perceived threat to maintaining a position or aspects of a position (Ashford
et al., 1989), regardless of whether such a threat actually exists (Rosenblatt & Ruvio, 1996).
30
	  

Employees may experience job insecurity when their work conditions change, representing an
abrogation of a ‘psychological contract’ between the organization and its employees (Rousseau,
1989). Job insecurity may cause employees to experience stress and decreased job satisfaction
(Ashford et al., 1989). Employees may attempt to reduce perceptions of job insecurity by increasing
their role performance (Ashford et al., 1989; Rosenblatt & Ruvio, 1996).
Some school districts have eliminated school librarians to cover budget shortfalls
(Resmovits, 2011; Russon, 2013; Solochek, 2013), and others may be considering such cuts
(Everhart & Mardis, 2014). Even if they themselves are not under immediate threat of being cut,
the possibility alone is enough to create the perception of job insecurity in school librarians.

2.3.5 Role Overload
Role overload can result from legitimate role performance expectations held by supervisors
and peers that are too numerous for an individual to complete during normal working hours (Kahn
et al., 1964). Employees who accept all of the role expectations directed at them are more likely to
experience role conflict, as they attempt to reconcile their various performance expectations (Grace,
1972). Role overload can also be defined as “conflict between several roles for the same person
which require different or incompatible behaviors” (Rizzo et al., 1970, p.155). However role
overload is defined, employees who experience it are more likely to feel stress, lower morale,
decreased job satisfaction, and reduced organizational commitment (Lauermann & Karabenick,
2011), although these consequences may in part be influenced by coincident role ambiguity and role
conflict (Conley & You, 2009).

31
	  

In an effort to ameliorate feelings of job insecurity by increasing role performance, school
librarians may accept a broader definition of their roles, with a concomitant increase in performance
expectations. School librarians may not have a choice in accepting a broader definition of their roles
as school districts increase performance expectations to cover gaps left by cuts or to shore up areas
that need support (Booher-Jennings, 2006; Valli, Croninger, & Walters, 2007). School librarians may
have non-instructional technology responsibilities (such as repair and maintenance, as opposed to
integrating technology into instruction), added to their performance expectations (Yates, 1997).
Even if they have the technical skills to repair and maintain technology, this type of role
performance necessarily takes time away from other types of role performance in which school
librarians could be engaging. School librarians may be expected to cover multiple schools, further
increasing demands on their time (Donham van Deusen, 1996).

2.3.6 Organizational Justice
Organizational justice, or employees’ perception of fair treatment by their organization, may
influence their role performance (Coyle-Shapiro, Kessler, & Purcell, 2004; Folger, 1993; Johnson,
Holladay, & Quinones, 2009); employees who feel they are being treated fairly will be more inclined
to engage in extra-role behavior (Dierdorff et al., 2012; Jiang, Sun, & Law, 2011; Johnson et al.,
2009; Peng, Hwang, & Wong, 2010). Johnson et al. (2009), described organizational justice as
“employees’ reactions to outcomes (distributive justice), the process that led to those outcomes
(procedural justice), and their treatment during the process (interactional and informational justice)”
(p. 410). Employees’ sense of organizational justice may be influenced by how their role
performance is evaluated. The next section comprises a discussion of performance evaluation and
how it affects school librarians.
32
	  

2.4 Performance Evaluation and The School Librarian
In addition to professional standards and job descriptions, another factor that can influence
school librarians’ role perceptions and role performance is how that performance is evaluated. As a
job description provides performance expectations, a performance evaluation measures whether and
to what extent those expectations were met.

2.4.1 Brief History of Teacher Performance Evaluation and Its Purpose
Teacher evaluation in the United States has a history reaching back to the colonial period
(Stronge & Tucker, 1995). These early evaluations were conducted not by a principal, head teacher,
or even other teachers, but by learned members of the community, and were based on conformity to
the prevailing cultural and religious ideals (C. H. Peterson, 1982). These evaluations were used to
remove teachers who were not deemed suitable to continue teaching in the community.
In the early 1900s, evaluation was a tool for “efficiency-minded local school boards”
(Glasman, 1986, p. 227), who were attempting to apply the principles of scientific management
developed for factory or industrial work to education. Presumably, savings would accrue by
discovering and eliminating those educators who were judged to be inefficient or ineffective. These
evaluations were largely based on traits or characteristics, such as appearance, punctuality, and poise
(Wilson & Wood, 1996) with the idea being that teachers who possessed these qualities would be
effective, even though there was no empirical evidence that this was the case. Ultimately, traitsbased evaluation fell by the wayside as the state and federal courts upheld challenges to promotion
and retention decisions in other areas of industry; the courts said that evaluations must be based on
the work described in the job description, not on poorly defined, wholly subjective traits.
33
	  

Through the late 1980s and 90s, there was a shift in the purpose of evaluation; it was seen as
a tool that could be used to assess and improve teacher performance (Blake et al., 1995; Matula,
2011; K. Peterson, 2004; Wickert, 1987; Wilson & Wood, 1996). In the modern era of education,
evaluation has been repurposed again. Now, it is a high-stakes prod used to push teachers and other
instructional staff like school librarians towards meeting standards of accountability for student
achievement as measured through standardized testing (Halverson & Clifford, 2006; Kimball &
Milanowski, 2009; Matula, 2011; Ravitch, 2010; Stronge & Tucker, 1995). Evaluation has always
been used as a tool to determine teacher competence and retention (Wilson & Wood, 1996).
Unfortunately, there are a number of problems associated with evaluation and a fair and accurate
assessment of teacher performance.

2.4.2 Principal Role in Evaluation
Stronge and Tucker (1995) studied state-level evaluation practices. They found that while 33
of the 42 states that responded to their survey mandated that teachers be evaluated, only 22 states
provided evaluation guidelines to local school boards. Even when the guidelines are provided,
principals may not have had the necessary training to effectively evaluate, (Wilson & Wood, 1996),
or may feel that they did not require training on evaluation (Wickert, 1987). The job demands
placed on principals make it difficult for them to spend the time to observe teachers properly in
order to provide fair assessment of their performance (Blake et al., 1995; Bryant, 2002; Matula,
2011). This is unfortunate since observation is a favored method of gathering information for most
principals (Everhart, 2006; Jacob & Lefgren, 2008). There is even research that questions how
effective principals are at determining teacher performance in the context of student achievement
(Kimball & Milanowski, 2009; Matula, 2011). However, there is also research to support their
34
	  

effectiveness, at least in determining high and low performing teachers (Jacob & Lefgren, 2008) and
in comparison to other predictors of teacher performance like experience and education level (D. N.
Harris & Sass, 2012; Jacob & Lefgren, 2008). The issues with teacher evaluation affect school
librarians because they are teachers, too.

2.4.3 Performance Evaluation of School Librarians
School librarians are considered to be part of the instructional staff (Stronge & Helm, 1992),
and teaching is a central focus of their role (AASL & AECT, 1998; AASL, 2009a). However, this
does not mean that they should be evaluated in the same way classroom teachers are evaluated. The
states that mandate teacher evaluation have done an even poorer job of providing guidelines for
educational support personnel like school librarians, guidance counselors, and school psychologists
than they do for teachers; only 15 of 33 states provided guidance for evaluating support personnel,
as opposed to 22 of 33 for teachers (Stronge & Tucker, 1995).
Sometimes, school librarians are evaluated using the same instrument used to evaluate
teachers (Bryant, 2002; Pfister & Towle, 1983; Vincelette & Pfister, 1984; Young, Green, & Gross,
1995). Taylor and Bryant (1996) found that almost half of the school librarians they surveyed were
evaluated using the same instrument that was developed for teachers. As they point out, “while
using the same form works well to evaluate the teaching role of the specialists, it ignores many other
important tasks” (Taylor & Bryant, 1996, p. 72). Since the emphasis of accountability is on teacher
performance as measured by student achievement on standardized tests, principals with a heavy task
load may feel that it is acceptable to not spend time evaluating the performance of their school
librarians if they don’t generate these scores (Young et al., 1995); Taylor and Bryant (1996) found
that 15% of the school librarians they surveyed reported not being evaluated at all. Aside from the
35
	  

legal issues of receiving a performance rating that is not backed up by data, there are more serious
implications for school librarians: What is not important enough to evaluate today, may not be
important enough to fund tomorrow. Even when administrators have the time to evaluate, they
may not have the training necessary to properly use an instrument that was designed specifically for
school librarians (Wilson & Wood, 1996).

2.4.4 Challenges in Effective Evaluation of School Librarians
As information specialists, it should not be surprising that school librarians have a variety of
sources from which to pull data relevant to their performance. Unfortunately, there is research that
suggests principals do not look at the reports school librarians produce or include them in their
assessment of a school librarian’s performance (Everhart, 2006; Taylor & Bryant, 1996). Jacob and
Lefgren (2008) found that principals tend to rely on three information sources when assessing
teacher performance: student achievement; information from parents, like requests for a specific
teacher; and observation. Unfortunately, school librarians are largely incapable of producing data in
two of these three categories; information literacy skills are not commonly assessed on most
standardized tests, and even if they were, the school librarian is no student’s primary source of
instruction, making it difficult to hold them accountable for students’ performance. Similarly, the
staffing circumstances of the school library (there is either only one librarian, or if two, they work
together) do not allow parents to request a specific librarian, although parents could conceivably
provide their opinions about quality of the school librarian’s service to the principal. This leaves
observation as school librarians’ best hope for being able to demonstrate their performance to their
evaluators.

36
	  

Many teacher evaluation instruments rely heavily on observation (Helm, 1995) despite the
fact that principals struggle with taking notes (Wickert, 1987). Even if a principal has an evaluation
instrument specific to the school librarian, the skills necessary to use the instrument in a valid way,
and the will to ensure that the evaluation is done properly, they may have different perceptions
about the role of the school librarian than the school librarian has (Bryant, 2002; Dorrell & Lawson,
1995). This conflict can lead to a skewed performance appraisal of the school librarian, because the
principal may value and expect to see functions and behaviors that the school librarian may not
value as highly, or may not be able to perform in their library setting. Another issue with evaluation
that can arise is conflation of the evaluation of the school librarian’s performance and the evaluation
of the school library program.

2.4.5 Program Evaluation versus Performance Evaluation
Program evaluation is essential to the school library. Through it, the school librarian can
determine the effectiveness of their service to the school, but program evaluation is not the same as
performance evaluation. Certainly, if the school librarian manages a wildly successful recreational
reading program, he or she might also be highly effective in his or her job; likewise, if the program is
a failure, the school librarian may not be effective in the performance of their role. However, this is
not necessarily the case: The successful recreational reading program might be managed by the
librarian in name only, while actually being run by a teacher, Parent Teacher Organization, or other
volunteers. The program that failed might have a brilliant school librarian behind it, but no funds to
enact it, or little support from teachers who feel tremendous pressure to churn out passing scores
for students taking their standardized tests.

37
	  

Haycock deftly described this issue: It is “foolhardy” and “egocentric” for the school
librarian to assume responsibility for factors they have no control over that affect the outcomes of
their program (Haycock, 1999, p. 14). The school librarian does not set funding levels from their
district or state, and cannot collaborate without willing teachers or innovate without administrator
support. To be sure, effective school librarians will attempt to find ways around these obstacles, but
fundraisers and grants are never certain, and professional relationships do not develop overnight.
What is certain, however, is that school librarians can be credited for their efforts. Ideally, program
evaluation and performance evaluation would be used complementarily, to provide a complete
picture of the value of the services being offered to the school and the skill of the person offering
them.

2.5 Related Research
Many theoretical frameworks can be used to analyze employee role perceptions and role
performance. This dissertation involved a qualitative content analysis of school librarians’
professional standards, job descriptions, and performance evaluations, for which an
operationalizable theoretical framework does not exist. There is no other research that compares
school librarians’ professional standards to their job descriptions, or their job descriptions to their
performance evaluations. Some research related to the qualitative content analysis of library job
postings; qualitative content analysis of school administrators’ job descriptions, performance
evaluations, and state standards; and analysis of high school administrators’ performance
expectations for school guidance counselors as compared to their performance evaluations and
professional standards is provided to place the outcomes of this dissertation in context.

38
	  

2.5.1 Content Analyses of Library Job Postings
Some researchers have done qualitative content analysis of job advertisements for academic
or research librarians. Kwasik (2002) used job postings from SERIALIST (a discussion forum),
American Libraries, College and Research Libraries News, and The Chronicle of Higher Education for academic
serials librarians to determine what skills were necessary to work in the (then) emerging digital
environment, and used this information to identify areas for professional development for serials
librarians. Albitz (2002) used qualitative and quantitative measures to look at electronic resource
librarian position announcements posted in College and Research Libraries News. She found that the
number of position announcements was fairly consistent over a six-year period, and that the
responsibilities described by the position covered a broad range of types of work encompassing
“almost any function one might typically find in an academic library” (Albitz, 2002, p. 595). Lynch
and Smith (2001) analyzed academic library job advertisements posted in College and Research Libraries
News from 1973 to 1998. They found that by 1998 communication and computer technology skills
were considered necessary to have and that instruction had become a routine part of reference work.
Kennan, Cole, Willard, Wilson, and Marion (2006) conducted two separate studies of job
postings. The first study compared job advertisements from the United States and Australia that
were posted during a period of eight weeks in 2004. The second study provided a historical
perspective of Australian job postings; the researchers collected and analyzed one month’s worth of
job postings from 1974, 1984, 1994, and 2004 (Kennan et al., 2006). They found that the job
postings from the United States placed greater emphasis on professional qualifications and specific
content area knowledge than those from Australia. They also found that over time, the knowledge,
skills, and abilities being required of librarians had become more abstruse, perhaps as a result of the
changing nature of the profession.

39
	  

Park, Lu, and Marion (2009) performed content analysis of 349 job descriptions posted in
AutoCat, a listserv for cataloging professionals. Their analysis included job descriptions posted by
special, public, school, and academic libraries, with the majority of the descriptions coming from
academic libraries; the job descriptions were not disaggregated for the analysis. They found that
technology had a significant effect on cataloging as a profession, changing everything from job titles
to the responsibilities, skills, and competencies required to be a cataloger (Park et al., 2009).
Brewerton (2011) looked at the job descriptions of academic or subject area librarians; he
describes how some of the job descriptions contained duties that could be considered outside the
purview of the typical work of subject area librarians. Brewerton also mentions the prevalence of a
phrase that boils down to ‘other duties as required’. This speaks to the simple fact that no job
description, no matter how thoughtfully crafted and well written, can truly encapsulate all of the
work to be accomplished in a job (Organ, 1988).
This research does not assess the actual job descriptions provided by the employing
organization, only the posting or advertisement for the job, and was based on academic or research
librarian job postings, not on job posting for school librarians. This research did not compare the
job postings or advertisements to the relevant professional standards.

2.5.2 Research Related to Standards, Job Descriptions, and Performance Evaluations
Catano (2002) compared the job descriptions and performance evaluations of school
administrators in Virginia to that state’s standards for school administrators using qualitative content
analysis. Catano found that there was a high level of correspondence between the job descriptions
and performance evaluations for most of the state standards. Every school division (equivalent to
40
	  

school districts) expected school administrators to communicate with staff and parents and focus on
instruction. Responsibilities related to facilities management expected by the school divisions were
not present in the state standards. The majority of school divisions encompassed most of the state
standards in their performance evaluation instruments.
Nebe (2010) researched how high school administrators performance expectations of school
guidance counselors compared to the counselors’ professional standards and performance
evaluations; the content analysis was informed by Organizational Role Theory and Leader-Member
Exchange Theory. Nebe found that high school administrators’ performance expectations were
mostly aligned with guidance counselors’ professional standards. Guidance counselors’ performance
evaluation instruments were aligned only 13% with high school administrators’ performance
expectations. Guidance counselors’ performance evaluation instruments were more related to their
professional standards, with 21% alignment between them; alignment was more likely if the district
used a performance evaluation instrument designed for school counselors.

2.6 Summary
School libraries have existed since the early 1800s. As the needs of nation changed, so too
did the nature of education and the place of libraries in schools. The importance of school libraries
continued to grow as new technologies found a place in education and as access to, and creation of,
information became critical to succeed in school, work, and life. As the information age dawned, it
seemed as though school libraries had finally secured their place in schools: 96% of schools had
libraries in 1900-1991 (USDOE & NCES, 2005b). Since then, the number of school libraries and

41
	  

school librarians has been in decline, which should be a concern for a nation with a growing reliance
on digital technology and electronic resources.
As the school library has changed, so too has the role of the school librarian. With the
advent and growing sophistication of technology, the effort required to fulfill the technical and
administrative roles of the school librarian has greatly diminished. This change has transformed the
teaching aspects of school librarians’ roles, in style and substance: Technology provides new
methods of designing and delivering instruction, and is itself a subject to be taught.
School librarians have different perceptions of what those roles are than what their
administrators’ perceptions of school librarians’ role are, and these differences can affect school
librarians’ role performance. Pre-service school librarians’ perceptions of their future roles are
influenced by the professional standards (Mardis, 2007, 2013; Mardis & Dickinson, 2009) and those
perceptions may be viewed as representative of their expected roles. As school librarians enter the
workforce, their expected roles are tempered by the role performance expectations of their school
administrators. If school librarians’ and school administrators’ perceptions of school librarians’ roles
are similar, school librarians will likely experience low levels of role ambiguity, although research has
shown that such alignment may be the exception rather than the rule (Church, 2008, 2010; Dorrell &
Lawson, 1995; Hartzell, 1997, 2002, 2003; O’Neal, 2004; Shannon, 2009).
School librarians’ perceived roles may differ from the way they are required to enact their
roles, and this difference may create role conflict for school librarians. Conditions like budget and
staffing cuts may cause feelings of job insecurity in school librarians, even if they are not threatened
directly by such cuts. To mitigate feelings of job insecurity, school librarians may increase their role
performance by broadening their role perceptions and voluntarily accepting more performance
expectations from their administrators. School librarians may also experience increased
42
	  

performance expectations as a result of school districts and administrators trying to cope with
reduced funding and fewer personnel and increased pressure to raise student achievement as
measured by standardized tests. However their performance expectations are increased, school
librarians may experience role overload as they try to accomplish more in the same amount of time.
Teacher performance evaluation has a long history, beginning in the colonial era. Modern
teacher evaluation is becoming focused on demonstrating teacher effectiveness as measured by
student achievement on standardized tests, a result of a growing school accountability movement.
School librarians’ performance evaluation is rather less storied: when school librarians are evaluated
at all, they may be evaluated using an instrument designed for classroom teachers. A teacher
evaluation may be able to assess school librarians’ instructional role performance, but it cannot
possibly capture the full range of school librarians’ roles. Although school librarians can generate
reports to better inform their administrators about their performance, those reports may either go
unread or be undervalued, as administrators prefer to use observation as their primary data source
for performance evaluations. Even when school librarians are evaluated using an instrument
specifically designed for them, their administrators may lack the time and training to properly
complete it.
The interplay of the sources of role perceptions, what those perceptions are and how they
are formed, how role performance is evaluated, and attendant phenomena like role ambiguity, role
conflict, job insecurity, and role overload, creates a complex web whose dimensions have barely
begun to be revealed. There are many potential starting points for researching these relationships
and their effects: further research is needed on school librarians’ perceptions of their roles and
administrators’ perceptions of school librarians’ roles and how they are formed. Research is needed

43
	  

on school librarians’ actual role performance and how it compares to their expected and perceived
roles. Research is also needed on school librarians’ feelings of morale, stress, and job satisfaction.
The research in this dissertation is focused on analyzing the performance expectations from
school librarians’ professional standards as compared to the performance expectations from their
job descriptions. This dissertation also compares the performance expectations from Florida’s
school librarians’ job descriptions to the performance measures from their performance evaluations.
The method used to perform these analyses is discussed in Chapter 3.

44
	  

CHAPTER THREE
METHOD
In this chapter, the researcher discusses the research questions and context of the study,
describes the sample, and explains the research design.
3.1 Research Questions
The purposes of this research were to 1) compare how the performance expectations from
school librarians’ professional standards compare to the performance expectations from school
librarians’ job descriptions in Florida, 2) determine what types of performance expectations appear
in Florida’s school librarians’ job descriptions that are not represented in their professional
standards, and 3) determine how the performance expectations from Florida’s school librarians’ job
descriptions compare to the performance measures from their performance evaluations. The
research questions addressed in this dissertation are:

RQ1. Which performance expectations from the professional standards in Empowering
Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs are represented in Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions?
RQ2. What kinds of performance expectations from Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions are not represented in the professional standards from Empowering Learners?

45
	  

RQ3. How do the performance expectations from Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions compare to the performance measures from Florida school librarians’ performance
evaluations?

3.2 Methodology
The researcher chose to answer the research questions by using a qualitative content analytic
approach to guide the design of data collection and analysis. Although content analysis in general
has been dismissed by some as either too simplistic for proper statistical analysis or not sufficiently
qualitative (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008), this method has been used successfully over the last few decades
(Neuendorf, 2002). While qualitative content analysis can be challenging because it requires a
tremendous amount of work and there is no one correct way to conduct it, it can be a fruitful
method to use (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008).
Neuendorf defines content analysis as “the systematic, objective, quantitative analysis of
message characteristics” (2002, p.1), referring specifically to quantitative content analysis. Content
analysis can also be more qualitative, with the researcher doing more than simply counting words to
look at the meaning or themes of documents and other media (Wildemuth, 2009). Berg (2007)
suggests that the synthesis of quantitative and qualitative content analysis can provide a richer
picture of the phenomena being studied. Schreier defines qualitative content analysis as “a method
for describing the meaning of qualitative material in a systematic way” (2012, p.1).
Although the order of the steps in the qualitative content analysis process may vary slightly
(Berg, 2007; Elo & Kyngäs, 2008; Hsieh & Shannon, 2005; Neuendorf, 2002; Schreier, 2012;
Wildemuth, 2009), researchers using the qualitative content analysis process will typically engage in
46
	  

the following: selecting material, including sampling; determining the unit of analysis; deciding
whether to use an inductive, deductive, or other approach; choosing to search only for manifest
content, or to include latent content; and finally, reporting their data.

3.3 Data Collection
In this section, the researcher describes the context of the research, the process of data
collection, and the sample.

3.3.1 Study Context
The researcher chose Florida as the state from which to collect and analyze school librarians’
job descriptions and performance evaluations for several reasons. Florida has a large population of
school librarians: nearly all of the districts in Florida have school librarian positions. Florida has
been significantly affected by the mortgage crisis, having one of the highest foreclosure rates in the
country (Harwell, 2013). This has doubly affected school funding, because school districts in
Florida receive a significant portion of their funding from local property taxes (Toppo & Gillum,
2009): as families lost their homes and left the state (Hart, 2009) districts lost the money from the
local property taxes, and state funding decreased as school enrollments dropped (Luhby, 2012). The
decreases in education funding have affected Florida’s school librarians: a few districts have
eliminated or reduced school librarians, or added performance expectations to school librarian
positions.

47
	  

In 2011, the Florida Legislature passed SB 736, the Student Success Act, to establish a
system to provide ‘performance pay’ for instructional personnel. This legislation gave districts the
leverage to base a percentage of teachers’ salaries on their students’ achievement as measured by
standardized tests. This emphasis on student achievement-based performance evaluation has
created problems, as the majority of Florida’s instructional personnel do not teach subjects that are
assessed on the state’s standardized test. There is not a uniform process to determine how these
teachers’ performance will be evaluated for, or if they are even eligible to receive, performance pay.
Although the Student Success Act does not go full into effect until the 2014-2015 school year, all of
Florida’s school districts have completed or are in the process of revising the performance
evaluations for all instructional personnel. The new performance evaluations affect school
librarians, as they are instructional personnel whose subject area is not assessed on the state’s
standardized test.
Each county in Florida is a school district; there are 67 counties in Florida, which means
there are 67 school districts. The districts range in size from just a few schools to the fifth largest
school district in the nation. Each district has a school board, although their composition and
formation vary from district to district. One of the responsibilities of the school boards is to
approve job descriptions and performance evaluations for school personnel. Not every Florida
school district has a board-approved job description for school librarians. Every school district has
an instrument used to evaluate school librarians’ performance, although that instrument may not be
tailored specifically to school librarians.

48
	  

3.3.2 Data Collection
The researcher collected data from documentary sources. One source of data was
Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, the current set of professional standards for
school librarians published by AASL. Other documents, in the form of job descriptions and
performance evaluations, were collected from Florida’s public school districts. Data were not
collected from private, parochial, charter, or university/lab schools. The researcher already owned a
copy of Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, but needed to collect the job
descriptions and performance evaluations for Florida’s school librarians. Data collection began
during summer 2013.
The researcher began data collection by emailing a request for the job description and
performance evaluation to a representative from each Florida school district’s human resources or
personnel department; email addresses were obtained from the district’s website. This method of
data collection proved problematic: some respondents sent only one of the documents requested,
others had automated ‘out-of-office’ replies indicating their current absence or impending
retirement, some did not have access to the documents requested, and others replied that formal
information requests needed to be submitted or directed the researcher to the district’s research
review board. Some of the researcher’s emails did not receive a response.
Based on the mixed responses to email, the researcher decided to call each district and speak
with a representative in human resources or personnel. This method was only a small improvement
over trying to collect the data through email, as many of the same problems were encountered: the
personnel contacted did not have access to the documents requested, the necessary personnel were
unavailable, and/or the personnel only sent one of the requested documents. The researcher kept
copious notes about who had been contacted in each district, who needed to be contacted in each
49
	  

district, who the proper contacts were, when contact occurred, and when documents were received.
Nearly all of the documents were received electronically, but two districts faxed their documents to
the researcher.

3.3.3 Description of the Sample
A total of 58 job descriptions and 63 performance evaluations for school librarians were
collected from Florida’s 67 public school districts. Job descriptions and performance evaluations
were not collected from private, parochial, charter, or university/lab schools. The researcher also
analyzed a copy of Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs.

3.3.4 Description of the Data Set
This section describes details about the data that were collected and analyzed from
Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, and the job descriptions and performance
evaluations for school librarians in Florida’s public school districts for this research (see Appendices
A and B for a list of data about the job descriptions and performance evaluations).

3.3.4.1 Data from Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs. The
narrative description of the five roles (Information Specialist, Instructional Partner, Leader, Program
Administrator, and Teacher) included 27 performance expectations (see Appendix C). The 14
guidelines (Addressing Multiple Literacies, Assessment in Teaching for Learning, The Budget,
Building Collaborative Partnerships, Collection and Information Access, Effective Practices for
50
	  

Inquiry, Empowering Learning through Leadership, The Learning Space, Outreach, Planning and
Evaluating the School Library Program, Policies, Professional Development, The Role of Reading,
and Staffing; an example of a guideline is included in Appendix D) included a total of 136
performance expectations, of which 134 were unique: the performance expectation “Creates an
environment that is conducive to active and participatory learning, resource-based learning, and
collaboration with teaching staff” appears in the guidelines The Learning Space (AASL, 2009, p.33)
and Empowering Learning through Leadership (AASL, 2009, p. 45), while the performance
expectation “Integrates the use of state-of-the-art and emerging technologies as a means for
effective and creative learning” appears in the guidelines Addressing Multiple Literacies (AASL,
2009, p. 23) and Effective Practices for Inquiry (AASL, 2009, p. 25). In Addressing Multiple
Literacies, there is a performance expectation “Adapts to and models new skills, new technologies,
and new understandings of the learning process” (AASL, 2009, p. 23) that is very similar to one
from Effective Practices of Inquiry “Adapts to and models new technologies and new
understandings of the learning process” but these were distinct enough to be considered unique.
Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs was published in 2009.

3.3.4.2 Data from public school librarians’ job descriptions in Florida. As shown in
Appendix A, eight public school districts in Florida do not have school board approved job
descriptions for school librarians, and one district had eliminated the school librarian position,
making a total of 58 job descriptions. All but one of the job descriptions were specific to school
librarians; one district used a classroom teacher job description for the school librarian, and this job
description was included in the analysis.

51
	  

Job description were categorized as either Copeland or other. A job description was
classified as Copeland if it bore the ©EMCS mark, or if it did not have the ©EMCS mark, but
comprised performance expectations identical to ones from a known Copeland. If a job description
did not have an ©EMCS mark, and comprised performance expectations different than those from
a known Copeland, it was classified as other. A majority (n=34 or 59%) of the public school
districts used a Copeland model job description. Classification of a job description in one of the
categories did not necessarily mean that all of the job descriptions in that category were identical to
one another: there were variations in formatting, phrasing, and number of performance
expectations, although the performance expectations on the Copeland job descriptions were fairly
uniform.
Of the districts using the Copeland job description, a number of them were identical.
Districts 5, 8, 23, 27, and 38 were identical. Districts 33 and 39 were identical, and had the same
performance expectations as Districts 5, 8, 23, 27, and 38, with a slight variation in order. Districts
34, 14, 48, 54, and 66 had job descriptions that were identical to each other. Districts 15, 49, and 50
had job descriptions that were identical to each other. Districts 13, 19, and 62 had job descriptions
that were identical to each other.
Combined, the job descriptions included a total of 2081 performance expectations, of which
611 were unique. Only 35 of the job descriptions had dates that indicated when they were adopted
or approved, or last amended or revised; the median age of those job descriptions was 2004, with
the oldest dating from 1974 and the most recent dating from 2012.

3.3.4.3 Data from public school librarians’ performance evaluations in Florida.
Appendix B includes a list of the available performance evaluations used for school librarians in
52
	  

Florida. Nearly all public school districts have board approved performance evaluations for school
librarians, but two districts chose not to provide theirs, one district was in the process of revising the
evaluation and unable to provide it, and one district had eliminated the school librarian position,
giving the researcher a total of 63 performance evaluations. Of these, only 31 were specifically for
school librarians. The remaining job descriptions were either for instructional personnel (n=30) or
for instructional support staff (n=2). There were four categories of performance evaluations for
school librarians: Copeland (n=22), Danielson (n=14), District-created (n=13), and Marzano
(n=14).
As with the job description categories, a performance evaluation was classified as Copeland
if it bore the ©EMCS mark; was described by the district as being, or based on, a Copeland
evaluation; or comprised performance measures identical to ones from a known Copeland
evaluation. A performance evaluation was classified as Danielson if it was described by the district
as either being or based on a Danielson performance evaluation. A performance evaluation was
classified as Marzano if the district described it as either being or based on a Marzano performance
evaluation. A performance evaluation was classified as District-created if it was described as such or
did not comport with any of the other categories. Classification of a performance evaluation in one
of the categories did not mean that all of the evaluations in that category were identical to one
another: there were variations in formatting, phrasing, number, and type of performance measures in
the performance evaluations in a given category.
In the course of analyzing the performance evaluations, some were found that did not
contain performance measures. After reviewing communications with the districts, the researcher
determined that each district sent what they were using for performance evaluations and that
subsequent inquiries for additional documents would serve no further purpose in those cases. A
53
	  

total of 49 comparisons between school librarians’ job descriptions and performance evaluations
were completed. Combined, the performance evaluations analyzed included a total of 2096
performance expectations, of which 696 were unique. Only 32 of the 63 performance evaluations
collected had dates that indicated the year they were adopted; the median age of those performance
evaluations was 2012, with the oldest dating from 2001 and the most recent dating from 2013.

3.4 Analysis of the Data
Data analysis proceeded in two steps: first, the researcher created the data set, then the
researcher performed a qualitative content analysis of the data.

3.4.1 Creating the Data Set
Each of the job descriptions had a clearly designated section of performance expectations.
The majority of these sections were labeled “performance responsibilities,” but some were called
“duties and responsibilities,” “essential job functions,” “responsibilities and duties,” “job tasks,” or
other variations on those themes. Data were not collected from other sections in the job
descriptions related to physical requirements; qualifications; terms of employment; or knowledge,
skills, and abilities, as these sections did not contain performance expectations
Collecting data from the performance evaluations was more complex. Many school districts
sent their entire performance evaluation handbook, which frequently contained the performance
evaluations for all instructional personnel and instructions on how to perform the evaluations, which
required the researcher to locate the performance evaluation for school librarians in the document.
54
	  

Most school districts used a matrix or rubric format that clearly indicated performance measures.
Some districts used other formats, in which performance measures were sometimes accompanied by
narrative sections or performance indicators or both. In these cases, special care was taken to
correctly identify the performance measures. As mentioned previously, some performance
evaluations did not have performance measures and were not analyzed.
After a thorough reading of Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, the
researcher chose to collect data from a section of the standards titled “The Changing Roles of the
SLMS” (American Association of School Librarians, 2009a, p. 16), which features a narrative
description of performance responsibilities associated with school librarians’ roles as leaders,
instructional partners, information specialists, teachers, and program administrators. Data were also
collected and analyzed from the 14 guidelines for school library programs; these guidelines include
performance expectations for school librarians. Data were not collected or analyzed from other
sections in the professional standards, as they did not contain performance expectations different
from those found in the guidelines.

3.4.2 Thematic Analysis
Qualitative content analysis can be performed using inductive or deductive methods, or
through an integrated approach that uses both inductive and deductive methods (E. H. Bradley,
Curry, & Devers, 2007). The integrated approach combines the use of a codebook with opencoding of items that do not fit in the established framework. The data for this research were
analyzed using an integrated approach. The researcher used theme as the unit of analysis.
Performance expectations and performance measures were analyzed for action/subject; some were
complex constructs containing more than one action/subject. For the first part of the analysis, the

55
	  

researcher developed a codebook from Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, and
performance expectations that were not coded using that framework were open coded.
Performance expectations from the job descriptions were compared to performance measures from
the performance evaluations on the basis of action/subject matches.
Graneheim and Lundman describe a theme as “words or statements that relate to the same
central meaning” (2004, p. 106), and Berg defines a theme as “a simple sentence, a string of words
with a subject and a predicate” (2007, p. 312). Each performance expectation from the professional
standards and job descriptions described at least one subject and an action to be performed related
to that subject, which meets Berg’s criteria for theme. The performance measures from the
performance evaluations also described at least one action and a subject themselves, or were
accompanied by performance indicators that did.

3.4.3 Coding Framework and Method
The researcher created a coding framework with 19 categories using the five roles and 14
guidelines from Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs. The roles and guidelines
include performance expectations, and performance expectations from the job descriptions were
compared to those in the roles and guidelines to categorize the performance expectations from the
job descriptions. Performance responsibilities from the job descriptions were coded by whether the
action and subject corresponded with ones in the performance expectations from the professional
standards.
Descriptive qualifiers like adjectives or adverbs were not considered when coding. As an
example, ‘communicate effectively with stakeholders’ is equivalent to ‘communicate with
56
	  

stakeholders’ because the action and subject are the same, regardless of the qualifier ‘effectively.’
Spelling errors or typos were not considered during coding. As examples, when the researcher
found “Apply the principals of learning…” and “…adhere to the Codes if Ethics…” the researcher
treated them as equivalent to “apply the principles of learning” and “adhere to the Codes of Ethics.”
Equivalent definitions were considered during coding. As an example, ‘Manage the school
library budget’ is equivalent to ‘Administer the media center budget’ because even though ‘manage’
and ‘administer’, and ‘school library’ and ‘media center’ are not identical terms, they have similar
meanings. A performance expectation that called for school librarians to ‘create the school library
budget’ would not be a match for the previous example, as ‘create’ has a different meaning than
‘manage’ or ‘administer.’
Prescriptive qualifiers were considered when determining matches. As an example,
‘communicate with stakeholders’ would not be considered equivalent to ‘communicate with
stakeholders through the library website’ because the latter requires a specific method of
communicating where the former does not. However, ‘Communicate with stakeholders through
methods such as the library website, email, or newsletters,’ would match ‘communicate with
stakeholders’ because although the method is specified, it is not required.
Some performance expectations and performance measures described more than one
action/subject pairing. The researcher decided to analyze those performance expectations and
performance measures as they were written, rather than trying to parse out each action/subject
pairing and risk distorting their meanings. In cases where a performance expectation had multiple
action/subject pairings, the researcher thoroughly analyzed it to determine what, if any, matches
were possible. In cases where multiple action/subject pairings occurred, performance expectations
from the job descriptions were marked with more than one code. Use of this coding framework
57
	  

provided the analysis to answer Research Question 1: Which performance responsibilities from the
professional standards in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs are represented in
Florida school librarians’ job descriptions?

3.4.4 Open Coding
Not every performance expectation from the job descriptions could be coded using the
framework. If the researcher determined there was not a match between the actions and subjects in
the performance expectations in the professional standards and job descriptions, that performance
expectation from the job description remained uncoded until the first round of analysis was
completed. After the first round of coding was completed, the researcher sorted the uncoded
performance expectations alphabetically. Many of the performance expectations used similar
phrasing, and sorting them alphabetically facilitated analysis, as it grouped together many identical or
nearly identical performance expectations.
Once sorted, the uncoded performance expectations were analyzed for their actions and
subjects. The same rules regarding qualifiers used in the coding process were applied during the
open coding process: descriptive qualifiers were not considered, but equivalent definitions and
prescriptive qualifiers were. Categories were created on the fly as each performance expectation was
analyzed.
Once the categorization was completed, the researcher analyzed the categories themselves
for broader and/or related themes. Drawing inspiration from the guidelines in the professional
standards, the researcher placed topically related performance expectations into larger categories.
These super-categories were dubbed ‘the missing guidelines.’ Each performance expectation
associated with one of the missing guidelines was then coded for that guideline. Performance
58
	  

expectations that were open coded did not receive multiple codes, as the process used to categorize
them precluded that possibility: the performance expectations were only placed in one category.
Open coding provided the answer to Research Question 2: What kinds of performance expectations
from Florida school librarians’ job descriptions are not represented in the professional standards
from Empowering Learners?

3.4.5 Comparing Performance Evaluations and Job Descriptions
The researcher compared the school librarians’ job description from a school district to the
school librarians’ performance evaluation from that same district: job descriptions and performance
evaluations were not compared across districts. Comparisons were only possible for districts from
which the researcher had collected both kinds of documents. As mentioned previously, some
performance evaluations did not contain performance measures: it was not possible to compare
these evaluations to their corresponding job descriptions. The researcher performed a total of 49
comparisons between job descriptions and performance evaluations.
Performance expectations from the job descriptions were compared to the performance
measures on the performance evaluations using the action and subject method as described
previously. Again, the same rules regarding qualifiers were used in this comparison process:
descriptive qualifiers were not considered, but equivalent definitions and prescriptive qualifiers were.
If a performance measure included performance indicators, the performance expectations from the
job descriptions were also compared to the indicators to determine action/subject matches.
When the researcher identified a match between performance expectations and performance
measures, the item number from the job description was recorded next to that performance
59
	  

measure. If the performance expectations from the job description were not already numbered, the
researcher numbered them. A performance expectation from the job description could match
multiple performance measures.

3.5 Evaluating the Quality of the Research
Traditionally, in the positivist research paradigm, researchers discuss issues like reliability and
validity when evaluating the quality of research (Wildemuth, 2009). Reliability is a measure of
consistency: using the same instrument should yield the same results when applied to the same
object (Babbie, 2010). Validity refers to how well a measurement represents the phenomena being
measured (Babbie, 2010). Qualitative content analysis is different from the quantitative nature of the
positivist research paradigm in its assumptions, purposes, and processes, which makes measures like
reliability and validity difficult to apply (Wildemuth, 2009). Qualitative researchers may use a
construct called trustworthiness to evaluate the quality of research instead of validity and reliability
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Trustworthiness contains four criteria: credibility, transferability,
dependability, and confirmability (Wildemuth, 2009).

3.5.1 Credibility
Credibility speaks to the “adequate representation of the constructions of the social world
under study” (Bradley, 1993, p. 436). Researchers must design strategies that effectively capture
their data and develop coding processes that are transparent to strengthen the credibility of their
qualitative research. Experience in the field can also enhance researchers’ credibility (Lincoln &
60
	  

Guba, 1985). Credibility is also affected by the knowledge and experience of the coders
(Wildemuth, 2009). The researcher who prepared this dissertation has extensive knowledge of and
experience in the field of school librarianship, and felt that the proposed process for collecting and
sampling the data was sound and effective. The description of the analysis process was explained in
a clear fashion that other researchers should be able to follow.

3.5.2 Transferability
Transferability refers to "the extent to which the researcher’s working hypothesis can be
applied to another context” (Wildemuth, 2009, p. 313), but it is not incumbent upon a researcher to
demonstrate said application. A researcher must provide data sets and descriptions that are
sufficiently rich enough for other researchers to make their own judgments about how effectively
the findings can be applied to other contexts. This researcher will make available data sets and
descriptions of sufficient quality to allow other researchers to make these judgments, though they
should be aware that Florida was a unique context in which to conduct this research.

3.5.3 Dependability
Bradley defines dependability as “the coherence of the internal process and the way the
researcher accounts for changing conditions in the phenomena” (Bradley, 1993, p. 437). The open
coding process is a flexible one, which easily allows researchers to adapt to unforeseen themes that
may emerge from the data. Dependability can be verified by determining the consistency of the
research process by auditing the materials generated during the process. This researcher feels that
the proposed research process is a coherent one. Now that the research process is complete, the
61
	  

researcher can verify the dependability of this research by conducting an audit of the research
materials generated during the process.

3.5.4 Confirmability
Bradley defines confirmability as “the extent to which the characteristics of the data, as
posited by the researcher, can be confirmed by others to read or reviewed the research results”
(Bradley, 1993, p. 437). Like dependability, confirmability can be determined by auditing the
coherence of the data, findings, and interpretations of the research. Now that the research is
complete, this researcher can conduct the audits necessary to determine the confirmability of this
research.

3.5.5 Reliability & Validity
Although Wildemuth (2009) stated that trustworthiness is a better measure of research
quality for qualitative content analysis than reliability and validity, not all researchers agree. Schreier
argued that dismissing reliability as irrelevant to qualitative research is “to throw out the baby with
the bathwater” (2012, p. 166). She stated that reliability can be applied to the coding framework,
and that it is not a yes/no criterion, but rather the extent to which a coding framework is consistent.
This can be determined by inter-coder reliability, or comparing the intersubjectivity of the coding.
A researcher working with another coder can assess the intersubjectivity of the coding. The
data analysis for this dissertation was performed by the researcher. Once the researcher completed
the analysis, a second party, who is an experienced school librarian in current practice, reviewed the
entire analysis of the performance expectations in the job descriptions and professional standards,
62
	  

and a sample of the comparisons of the job descriptions and performance evaluations. For the
comparison of the performance expectations in the job descriptions and professional standards, the
second party agreed completely with the researcher, save for one performance expectation that the
second party felt could have been coded according to the established framework. After a discussion
with the researcher about prescriptive qualifiers, the second party agreed that the performance
expectation had been categorized correctly by the researcher.
The second party reviewed a random sample of 10 comparisons (out of 49) between job
descriptions and performance evaluations. The second party agreed completely with the researcher
on four of the comparisons. For the other six comparisons, there was a high level of agreement.
Where there were differences, nearly all of them were additional performance expectations the
second party added to performance measures that already had performance expectations attached to
them. After review, the researcher determined that nearly all of these additions resulted from looser
interpretations on the part of the second party.
In two instances, the second party added performance expectations where the researcher had
not. After review, the researcher determined that the second party was correct in these instances.
The researcher conducted further review to determine whether these failures were systematic in the
analysis. No other similar errors were discovered for comparisons of identical or similar
performance expectations and performance measures, and the researcher determined that these two
instances were isolated events. The researcher corrected the two comparisons and used the
corrected comparisons to complete the analysis.

3.5.6 Ethical Considerations
63
	  

The researcher inquired with the institutional review board (IRB) at Florida State University
about the need to obtain approval to conduct this research. After a phone conversation with one of
the committee members, the member determined that the researcher was not required to obtain IRB
approval to conduct this research. This research did not involve human subjects, and the data
analyzed did not include any private or potentially sensitive information: Empowering Learners:
Guidelines for School Library Programs is a publication of AASL available for purchase, and
approximately half of the job descriptions for Florida’s school librarians are available on their
respective districts’ websites. During data collection, the researcher did not receive any completed
or partially completed performance evaluations containing personal information, only the blank
instruments used to complete the evaluations. Other data pertaining to performance ratings or
salaries were not collected or analyzed, and aliases were used to report data about the school
districts. The researcher was unable to conceive of any other potential for harm in conducting this
qualitative content analysis. 	  

3.5.7 Limitations
This research is a qualitative content analysis of the professional standards for school
librarians presented in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (American Association
of School Librarians, 2009), and the job descriptions and performance evaluations of public school
librarians in Florida. Data were not collected or analyzed from private, parochial, charter, or
university partnership/lab schools, so the findings of this research may have little or no relevance to
school librarians working in those conditions. The findings of this research are not generalizable to
the larger population of school librarians, but that is outside the scope of this research.

64
	  

Qualitative content analysis is not a research method that can be used to determine causal
relationships between variables (Berg, 2007). However, this is not a limitation for this research since
the researcher is not attempting to determine causal relationships, but rather to describe the
relationships between the professional standards, and the job descriptions and performance
evaluations for Florida’s school librarians.
Qualitative content analysis can only be used on recorded documents or other textual
artifacts (Berg, 2007). Performance expectations and performance measures are recorded in the
professional standards, job descriptions, and performance evaluations, but there is potential for
performance expectations to be communicated to school librarians through other channels that may
not be in written form, or if in written form, not necessarily accessible, such as verbal
communication of performance expectations from school administrators to school librarians or
communication of performance expectations from school administrators to school librarians
through memos, notes, or email.

3.6 Summary of the Method
The researcher developed a coding framework from the five roles and 14 guidelines
from Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs. Performance expectations from the
job descriptions were coded using this framework. Matches were determined on the basis of action
and subject agreement between performance expectations. Descriptive qualifiers like adjectives and
adverbs were not considered, while equivalent definitions and prescriptive qualifiers were
considered. Performance expectations from the job descriptions that could not be coded using the
framework were open coded and categorized into a set of ‘missing guidelines.’
65
	  

Performance expectations from the job descriptions were compared to the performance
measures on the performance evaluations, and matches were determined on the basis of agreement
between action and subject. Again, descriptive qualifiers were not considered, while equivalent
definitions and prescriptive qualifiers were. If a performance measure included performance
indicators, the performance expectations from the job descriptions were also compared to the
indicators to determine matches.
A second party who is an experienced school librarian reviewed the analysis of the job
descriptions and professional standards, and a sample of the comparisons of job descriptions and
performance evaluations. The findings of this research are discussed in Chapter 4.

66
	  

CHAPTER FOUR
FINDINGS
The researcher analyzed school librarians’ professional standards, job descriptions, and
performance evaluations to discover how performance expectations from their professional
standards compared to performance expectations from their job descriptions, and how performance
expectations from their job descriptions compared to performance measures from their
performance evaluations. This chapter presents the findings of these analyses.

4.1 Results
The results of the data analysis for the three research questions are discussed in this section.

4.2.1 Analysis 1: Comparison between Professional Standards and Job Descriptions
The researcher conducted the analysis by using the coding framework developed from
Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs to compare the performance expectations
from all 58 of Florida’s school librarians’ job descriptions to the performance expectations from the
professional standards in Empowering Learners. Of the job descriptions analyzed, 34 were Copeland
models, and 24 were of other types. The researcher found that all of the roles from the professional
standards were represented in the performance expectations from all 58 job descriptions, but some
were more represented than others, as illustrated in Table 1.

The roles from Empowering Learners were represented 103 times in the performance
expectations from the job descriptions. Of the roles, Instructional Partner was the most represented
(n=40) in the performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations
emphasized collaboration between school librarians and teachers, and school librarians’ knowledge
and application of the curriculum, instructional design, and resources.
The Program Administrator role was the next most represented (n=32) in the performance
expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations discussed school librarians’
provision of resources, and development and implementation of budgets, policies, plans, and
mission of the school library.
The role of Information Specialist was the next most represented (n=14) in the performance
expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations focused on the use,
modeling, and integration of technology, and the legal and ethical implications of the use of
technology and information.
The Teacher role was the next most represented (n=9) in the performance expectations
from the job descriptions. The performance expectations called for school librarians to advocate for
reading in a variety of formats, teach critical thinking skills, encourage the use of information to

68
	  

create new knowledge, and develop a collection that will meets the diverse needs of a variety
learners.
The role of Leader was the least represented (n=8) in the performance expectations from the
job descriptions. The performance expectations encouraged school librarians to develop
relationships with and be an active member of the learning community and larger community, foster
21st century skills in the school, and to demonstrate technology leadership and awareness of the
opportunities and difficulties facing the profession.
The researcher found that all of the guidelines from the professional standards were
represented in the performance expectations from the job descriptions, but some were more
represented than others, as shown in Table 2.

Of the guidelines, Collection and Information Access was the most represented (n=77) in
the performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations were
focused on various aspects of collection development.
The Learning Space was the next most represented (n=53) guideline in the performance
expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations were related to creating a
welcoming environment in the school library and ensuring access to the facility and its materials and
services.
The guideline Addressing Multiple Literacies was the next most represented (n=48) in the
performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations called for
school librarians to integrate technology in their instruction and provide instruction in the use of
technology and information skills.
Professional Development was the next most represented (n=30) guideline in the
performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations encouraged
school librarians to maintain and develop their skill sets, especially in regards to technology.
The guideline Staffing was the next most represented (n=29) in the performance
expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations focused on the supervision
of library support staff and volunteers.
Outreach (n=20) and The Role of Reading (n=20) were the next most represented
guidelines in the performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance
expectations for Outreach called for school librarians to attend staff and departmental meetings and
promote the school library program to a variety of stakeholders. The performance expectations for
The Role of Reading discussed encouraging reading through promotional displays.
70
	  

The Budget was the next most represented (n=19) guideline in the performance expectations
from the job descriptions. The performance expectations focused on the preparation, allocation,
and administration of the budget for the school library program.
The guideline Empowering Learning through Leadership was the next most represented
(n=18) in the performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations
encouraged school librarians to create an environment conducive to learning and to support their
schools’ committees, programs, and services.

Program (n=14) were the next most represented guidelines in the performance expectations from
the job descriptions. The performance expectations for Effective Practices for Inquiry called for
school librarians to integrate technology and to use instructional strategies to encourage critical
thinking. The performance expectations for Planning and Evaluating the School Library Program
focused on setting goals for and evaluating the school library program.
The guideline Building Collaborative Partnerships was the next most represented (n=11) in
the performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations emphasized
collaboration between the school librarian and other teachers.
Policies was the next most represented (n=10) guideline in the performance expectations
from the job descriptions. The performance expectations discussed the goals and objectives of the
school library program.
The guideline Assessment in Teaching for Learning was the least represented (n=6) in the
performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations were related to
using assessments and evaluating instruction.

4.2.2 Analysis 2: Open Coded Performance Expectations
After using the coding framework to complete the first part of the analysis, the researcher
open coded the performance expectations from Florida’s public school librarians’ job descriptions
that did not compare with those from the professional standards. The researcher found that the
remaining performance expectations fell into seven main categories: Compliance and Liability,
Facilitating Technology Use in the Library and School, Facilitating the Use of Instructional
Resources, Library Operations and Services, Maintaining the Learning Community, Mechanics of
Teaching, and Reflective Professional Development. These categories emerged based on the
researcher’s knowledge of the literature and professional field, and encompassed the remaining
performance expectations. Some categories were more frequently represented in the performance
expectations than others, as illustrated in Table 3.

Of the categories, Library Operations and Services was the most represented (n=100) in the
open coded performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations
detailed how school librarians should administer interlibrary loans, provide reference assistance and
reading guidance, handle overdue fines, maintain records and complete reports, assist students and
staff with the production and use of media, inform faculty and administration about policies and
72
	  

procedures for handling challenges to library and instructional materials, and develop and maintain a
professional library for administrators and teachers.
The category Compliance and Liability was the next most represented (n=81) in the open
coded performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations included
providing instruction on and adherence to safety procedures and proper use of materials and
equipment; following and enforcing school rules, administrative regulations, school board policies,
and state and federal laws and regulations; modeling and maintaining high standards of ethical and
professional behavior and judgment; demonstrating punctuality and attendance; maintaining
confidentiality; recognizing indicators of child abuse and taking appropriate actions; producing
required records and reports; maintaining teacher certification; fulfilling professional responsibilities
and other duties as required; and assisting with the school testing program.
The Mechanics of Teaching category was the next most represented (n=39) in the open
coded performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations
described setting and communicating high learning expectations, applying principles of effective
teaching and learning to instruction, demonstrating effective classroom management, using
instructional strategies to meet the needs of diverse learners, and ensuring student growth and
achievement.
The category Maintaining the Learning Community was the next most represented (n=16) in
the open coded performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance expectations
focused on fostering mutual respect between and among students and adults, demonstrating positive
interpersonal relationships with all stakeholders to increase student achievement, sharing
information about student needs and performance with teachers and families, and promoting

73
	  

student responsibility, appropriate social behavior, integrity, valuing of cultural diversity, and respect
for self and others through role modeling and learning activities.
Facilitating Technology Use in the Library and School was the next most represented (n=11)
category in the open coded performance expectations from the job descriptions. The performance
expectations called for school librarians to use technology for administrative tasks, assist classroom
teachers with using technology, coordinate instructional technology services with the technology
specialist, and maintain a basic knowledge of and experience in areas of instructional technology
including computers, CD-ROM, closed circuit television, TV production, and related technology.
The categories Facilitating Use of Instructional Resources (n=7) and Reflective Professional
Development (n=7) were the least represented in the open coded performance expectations from
the job descriptions. The performance expectations for Facilitating Use of Instructional Resources
encouraged the creative use of all types of resources, guiding teachers in selecting instructional
resources, and teaching the use of media resources and technology. The performance expectations
for Reflective Professional Development required the school librarian to conduct a personal
assessment to determine professional growth needs, an assessment of the staff to determine their
professional growth needs, and the development of a plan with goals and time tables to satisfy the
requirements of the school district and/or state.

4.2.3 Analysis 3: Comparison between Job Descriptions and Performance Evaluations
The researcher compared the performance expectations from school librarians’ job
descriptions to the performance measures from the corresponding performance evaluation. Table 4
shows the distribution of the 49 comparisons the researcher was able to complete.

4.2.3.1 Copeland performance evaluations. The districts using the Copeland
performance evaluations had most of the highest percentages of agreement between the
performance measures and performance expectations, including the only six districts that had 100%
agreement. The districts using the Copeland evaluation had percentages of agreement that ranged
from 100% agreement to 2% agreement. All of the school districts that used the Copeland
performance evaluation also used a Copeland job description. Table 5 shows the percentages of
agreement for all of the districts using the Copeland evaluation.

4.2 Summary
The results of the qualitative content analysis of the performance expectations from
Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs and Florida’s school librarians’ job
descriptions, and the comparison of the performance expectations from Florida’s school librarians’
job descriptions to the performance measures from their performance evaluations were discussed in
this chapter.
All of the roles from Empowering Learners are represented in the performance expectations
from the job descriptions, but some are more represented than others, with the Instructional Partner
Role being the most frequently represented. All of the guidelines from Empowering Learners are also
78
	  

represented in the performance expectations from the job descriptions, but some are more
represented than others, with Collection and Information Access being the most frequently
represented.
Not all of the performance expectations from Florida’s school librarians’ job descriptions
corresponded to performance expectations from Empowering Learners. These remaining performance
expectations were open coded, and fell into seven main categories: Compliance and Liability,
Facilitating Technology Use in the Library and School, Facilitating the Use of Instructional
Resources, Library Operations and Services, Maintaining the Learning Community, Mechanics of
Teaching, and Reflective Professional Development. Of these seven categories, Library Operations
and Services was the most frequently represented in the open coded performance expectations.
A majority of the districts in Florida use a Copeland job description, with the others being of
unknown origin. There are four types of performance evaluations for school librarians used by
Florida school districts: Copeland, Danielson, District-created, and Marzano. The most districts
used the Copeland evaluation, and all of them also had a Copeland job description. The districts
that used the Copeland evaluation had most of the highest percentages of agreement, ranging from
100% to 2%, with six of the districts having 100% agreement between the job description and
performance evaluation. Twelve districts used the Danielson evaluation, and half of them had a
Copeland job description. The districts that used the Danielson evaluation had percentages of
agreement that ranged from 68% to 5%. Ten districts used a district-created evaluation, and two of
them had a Copeland job description. The districts that used a district-created evaluation had most
of the lowest percentages of agreement, ranging from 65% to 0%, with three of the districts having
0% agreement between the job description and performance evaluation. Eight districts used the
Marzano evaluation, and three of them had a Copeland job description. The districts that used the
79
	  

Marzano evaluation had percentages of agreement that ranged from 14% to 0%. Discussion of
these findings, conclusions, and recommendations for further research are presented in Chapter 5.

80
	  

CHAPTER FIVE
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The researcher analyzed the professional standards from Empowering Learners: Guidelines for
School Library Programs, and the job descriptions and performance evaluations of Florida’s school
librarians to discover how the performance expectations from their professional standards compared
to the performance expectations from their job descriptions, and how the performance expectations
from their job descriptions compared to the performance measures from their performance
evaluations. This chapter includes a discussion of the findings of this research and the implications
of those findings, and recommendations for further research.

5.1 Restatement of the Problem
Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs is the most recent set of professional
standards for school librarians, describing AASL’s vision of the work in which it feels school
librarians should be engaged. School librarians have their own visions of what their work should be
(O’Neal, 2004), which may be mediated by their school administrators’ visions of school librarians’
roles. School librarians are not employed by AASL, they are employed by the school districts in
which they work, and are contractually obligated to fulfill the job descriptions under which they are
hired, as well as to satisfy the requirements of their performance evaluations. While the professional
standards may represent the vision of the professional organization, if the performance expectations
in school librarians’ professional standards are different from the performance expectations in their
job descriptions, and school librarians’ performance evaluations are measuring still other
performance expectations, then school librarians may have difficulty forming a clear idea of precisely
81
	  

what they should be doing to contribute to the educational program of their schools. This research
addressed the following research questions:

RQ1. Which performance expectations from the professional standards in Empowering
Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs are represented in Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions?
RQ2. What kinds of performance expectations from Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions are not represented in the professional standards from Empowering Learners?
RQ3. How do the performance expectations from Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions compare to the performance measures from Florida school librarians’
performance evaluations?

5.2 Review of the Method
The researcher used qualitative content analysis on Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School
Library Programs, and the job descriptions and performance evaluations for public school librarians in
Florida, comparing the actions and subjects from the performance expectations and performance
measures. The researcher used a codebook created from the roles and guidelines in Empowering
Learners to categorize the performance expectations from Florida’s school librarians’ job
descriptions; performance expectations that did not comport with the coding framework were open
coded and new categories emerged from these performance expectations. The researcher compared
the performance expectations from Florida’s school librarians’ job descriptions to the performance
82
	  

measures from the performance evaluation for school librarians from the corresponding school
district.

5.3 Discussion of Findings
This section includes a discussion of the findings and their implications for each of the
research questions.

5.3.1 RQ1: Which performance expectations from the professional standards in Empowering
Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs are represented in Florida school
librarians’ job descriptions?
The first research question addressed in this dissertation asked which performance
expectations from the professional standards were represented in the job descriptions of public
school librarians in Florida.

5.3.1.1 The roles of Information Specialist, Instructional Partner, and Program
Administrator: Implications for Role Conflict. In 2001, McCracken found that school librarians
surveyed thought the Information Specialist role was the most important role. Empowering Learners:
Guidelines for School Library Programs included the results of a survey where school librarians ranked
what they thought their most important roles were at the time and what they thought their most
important roles would be in the future (American Association of School Librarians, 2009). The
school librarians surveyed thought that the most important role for the future was Instructional
83
	  

Partner, followed by Information Specialist, Teacher, and Program Administrator (American
Association of School Librarians, 2009). Church (2010) found that some school administrators
encouraged collaboration between school librarians and teachers. Shannon (2009) found that some
school administrators thought that role performance associated with providing resources and
services was more important than collaboration between school librarians and teachers.
Administrator support is critical for school librarians to achieve the goals of their programs (Oberg,
2009).
Instructional Partner, Program Administrator, and Information Specialist were the most
frequently represented roles in the performance expectations from the job descriptions. Depending
on the role perceptions of school librarians and their administrators, these findings have implications
for role conflict. When the role perceptions of school librarians and school administrators are
similar, as with school librarians who think that the Instructional Partner role is the most important
and work for school administrators who are supportive of collaboration, those school librarians may
not experience role conflict. When the role perceptions of school librarians and school
administrators are different, as with school librarians who think the Information Specialist role is the
most important but work for school administrators who want them to collaborate, those school
librarians may experience intra-sender role conflict (Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, & Snoek, 1964). School
librarians thought the Program Administrator role was the least important role (American
Association of School Librarians, 2009), but it was the second most frequently represented role in
the performance expectations. The performance expectations in the guidelines The Budget,
Planning and Evaluating the School Library Program, Policies, and Staffing also speak to the role of
Program Administrator role, and taken together, represent a significant portion of expected role
performance for school librarians in Florida. The difference between perceptions of the importance
of the Program Administrator role, and the number of performance expectations related to its
84
	  

performance may cause school librarians to feel either inter-role conflict, where employees must
choose between role aspects, or person-role conflict, where employees’ values conflict with their
role expectations (Kahn et al., 1964).
This dissertation research was exploratory, with a scope limited to the analysis of the extent
of agreement among these documentary sources. The researcher believes that the potential for role
conflict provides a direction for further research regarding how school librarians and school
administrators perceive the roles of school librarians. Additional research is needed to determine
whether and to what extent school librarians may experience role conflict, its origins, and its effects
on their role performance.

5.3.1.2 The Role of Teacher: Implications for Role Overload and Role Conflict. The
role of Teacher as described in Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs (American
Association of School Librarians & Association for Educational Communications and Technology,
1988) included performance expectations related to teaching information and critical thinking skills,
using media for recreational purposes, encouraging lifelong learning, and teaching students about
copyright and privacy. The Teacher role also included performance expectations for school
librarians to offer professional development for staff members about using information and the laws
and policies regarding its use, and teaching parents about encouraging reading, listening, and viewing
for their children, and how to recognize their children’s information needs.
The Teacher role as described in Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (American
Association of School Librarians & Association for Educational Communications and Technology,
1998) shifted, and included performance expectations for school librarians to engage in professional
development, especially in regards to information technology; demonstrate knowledge of teaching
85
	  

which was to be applied to their instruction; and teach students how to analyze their learning and
information needs, to locate and use resources, and to understand and communicate information.
The role of Teacher as described in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs
went in yet a different direction, and emphasized performance expectations related to encouraging
critical thinking; fostering student collaboration and evaluation of their work; and supporting reading
for pleasure in all formats, the application of reading research to practice, and building a collection
to meet the various needs of diverse learners (American Association of School Librarians, 2009).
The Teacher role has changed a great deal over the past three iterations of the professional
standards. The present instantiation of the role is focused on promoting reading, which is a
significant departure from the previous incarnations. Some of the performance expectations
embodied by the Teacher role as defined in the previous sets of standards still exist in some form
within Empowering Learners, but are scattered throughout several guidelines, including Addressing
Multiple Literacies, Assessing Teaching and Learning, Building Collaborative Partnerships, Effective
Practices for Inquiry, and Professional Development. This dispersal likely accounts for the relatively
low frequency of representation of the Teacher role in the performance expectations from the job
descriptions. Similarly, the guideline The Role of Reading might have been more frequently
represented in the performance expectations from the job descriptions if it had exclusively included
the reading-oriented performance expectations from the Teacher role. The category Reflective
Professional Development, derived from the open coded performance expectations and one of the
least frequently represented, could easily be subsumed under the guideline Professional
Development by including an expectation that school librarians engage in reflective practice to
assess their professional development needs as well as those of their faculty and staff.

86
	  

It may be that the authors of Empowering Learners thought that the Teacher role was
becoming too expansive, and sought to balance it out by dividing performance expectations related
to that role among several guidelines. Other performance expectations related to teaching may have
been cut from the professional standards altogether, which could account for some of the
performance expectations that were open coded and categorized under Mechanics of Teaching and
Maintaining the Learning Community.
The addition of these two categories of performance expectations might also be explained by
differences in specificity: Where teaching is painted in broader strokes in the roles and guidelines
from Empowering Learners, the performance expectations from the job descriptions represented in the
category Mechanics of Teaching present a finer-grained picture of the fundamentals of teaching,
such as classroom management, setting and communicating learning expectations, applying
principles of teaching to learning, and using instructional strategies to meet student needs and ensure
growth and achievement. The performance expectations from Maintaining the Learning
Community describe fostering the mutual respect, building the interpersonal relationships, and
establishing effective communication with all stakeholders that are all vital to sustaining a positive
culture of learning in a school.
The performance expectations in the job descriptions and professional standards related to
teaching are multifarious and intensive. Teaching is a legitimate focus of school librarians’ role
performance, but the amount of role performance required to satisfy all of the expectations may well
exceed the number of work hours in the day. If school librarians accept all of these performance
expectations, they may experience a sense of role overload (Kahn et al., 1964). If they do experience
role overload, school librarians may also experience role conflict as they try to decide which aspects
of their roles to engage in (Grace, 1972).
87
	  

Research is needed to explore whether, to what extent, and why school librarians may
experience role overload, if it results in perceptions of role conflict, and the concomitant effects of
said experience. Further research is needed to determine what school librarians are teaching and
how, including their collaborations with teachers and integrating technology with their teaching.
Additional research could explore the roles school librarians play in promoting reading, especially
with a focus on best practices.

5.3.1.3 The role of Leader: Implications for practice. In the previous two sets of
professional standards, Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs (American
Association of School Librarians & Association for Educational Communications and Technology,
1988) and Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (American Association of School
Librarians & Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 1998), school librarian
leadership was discussed in terms of instructional leadership and fostering collaboration. In
Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (American Association of School Librarians,
2009), Leader was described for the first time as a discrete role for school librarians, and focused on
active participation in the local and global learning community, and fostering 21st century skills.
Killeen (2009) described the importance of school librarian leadership as demonstrated through
service on school committees. Church (2011) explained how leadership can infuse school librarians’
other roles. Johnston (2012) found that there was a decided lack of empirical research on school
librarians’ technology leadership.
Leader was the role that was least represented in the performance expectations from the job
descriptions. Two of the guidelines, Empowering Learning through Leadership, and Outreach,
embodied some of the role performance called for in the Leader role, and were slightly better
88
	  

represented in the performance expectations from the job descriptions than the Leader role; the
performance expectations from the role and guidelines taken together represent a small part of
school librarians’ performance expectations.
Empowering Learners was published in 2009, and 27 (47%) of the Florida job descriptions for
school librarians date from before that; it may be the case that more performance expectations
related to the Leader role will be included as Florida school districts revise their job descriptions for
school librarians. Revisions are certainly needed, as the median date of the job descriptions is 2004,
with 19 (33%) of them more than ten years old.
Even if additional Leader performance expectations are added to their job descriptions,
school librarians may experience barriers in trying to enact that role. Hartzell (2002) described how
teachers may actively resent school librarians’ attempts to provide instructional leadership as staff
developers, instructional partners, or consultants. Church (2010) described some school
administrators fostering instructional collaboration between school librarians and teachers, and
administrator support is critical for school librarians’ success (Oberg, 2009). It may be the case that
administrator support, where it exists, is sufficient to override teacher prejudice where it exists.
Further research of school librarians’ role performance as Leaders could address several
areas. Research is needed to determine the current performance and efficacy of school librarian
leadership. Research is also needed to determine how school librarians’ role performance as Leaders
is perceived by school administrators and teachers. Research about the barriers school librarians
face trying to enact the Leader role and may help practitioners determine how to overcome these
barriers.

89
	  

5.3.2 RQ2: What kinds of performance expectations from Florida school librarians’
job descriptions are not represented in the professional standards from Empowering
Learners?
The second research question addressed in this dissertation analyzed the types of
performance expectations from the job descriptions that were not represented in the professional
standards.

5.3.2.1 Shifting priorities: performance expectations from the job descriptions related
to Library Operations and Services, Facilitating the Use of Instructional Resources, and
Facilitating Technology Use in the Library and School. Previous sets of standards (AASL &
Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 1988; AASL & Department of
Audiovisual Instruction of the National Education Association, 1969; National Education
Association, ALA, & Certain, 1925) included discussion on topics related to the operation of the
library facility and program, such as collecting fines, performing interlibrary loans, providing reading
guidance, and circulation guidelines. This changed with Information Power: Building Partnerships for
Learning (AASL & Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 1998): For the
first time since their creation, the operational aspects of a school library program were not discussed
in the professional standards, nor did they return in Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library
Programs. Other performance expectations that were related to guiding teachers in selecting and
using instructional resources, teaching the use of media resources, and maintaining knowledge of
instructional technology that had appeared in previous sets of professional standards (AASL &
Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 1975, 1988, 1998) were not in
Empowering Learners, either.
90
	  

Of the performance expectations in the job descriptions that did not comport with those in
Empowering Learners, the most were related to Library Operations and Services; these performance
expectations called for school librarians to perform actions like collecting fines for overdue books;
following standard library practices in cataloging, processing, labeling, shelving, and circulating
materials; performing interlibrary loans; and providing reference assistance and reading guidance.
Performance expectations from the open coded categories Facilitating Technology Use in the
Library and School, and Facilitating the Use of Instructional resources were not frequently
represented in the performance expectations from the job descriptions. These performance
expectations were related to guiding teachers in selecting and using instructional resources, teaching
the use of media resources, and maintaining knowledge of instructional technology.
It was beyond the scope of this research to determine why these performance expectations
have vanished from the professional standards but remain in the job descriptions. It may be due to
several factors, including fundamental differences in the natures of the professional organization and
school districts.
The professional organization may represent an aspirational vision of school librarianship
through their standards, but it does not employ school librarians, and consequently, school librarians
are under no obligation to realize that vision: A school librarian receives no rewards or suffers any
consequences for fulfilling (or not) the vision of the professional organization. School districts are
the agencies that actually employ school librarians, and their job descriptions represent stated
performance expectations that the school librarians agree to fulfill when they sign their contracts,
with an explicit understanding of the rewards and consequences for doing so or not. The
professional organization may have the freedom to gloss over things like circulating books,
collecting fines, and providing reading guidance and reference assistance as these have been part of
91
	  

school librarianship since the beginning of the profession; to the professional organization,
specifying that school librarians should circulate materials may seem redundant as it is an obvious
part of their role performance. School districts likely have more interest in specifying the types of
role performance they expect school librarians to perform to ensure that they are, in fact, performed.
Another factor that may account for the lack of performance expectations regarding
operational aspects in the professional standards is if the professional organization no longer
considers those types of performance to be part of school librarians’ roles. This is a radical notion,
as operating the school library has been a central function of school librarianship since the beginning
of the profession, and providing guidance in selecting and using instructional materials, teaching the
use of media resources, and maintaining knowledge of instructional technology, have been around
for a while. Yet the last two sets of professional standards (American Association of School
Librarians & Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 1998; American
Association of School Librarians, 2009) have been pulling focus away from school library operations
and shifting emphasis towards instructional collaboration. If the professional organization is pulling
away from operating the library, this decision has serious implications for the future of the
profession and the professional organization, for what is a school librarian without a library?
The authors of the next set of professional standards for school librarians may wish to
consider including performance expectations associated with operating a school library, assuming
that the purpose of the standards is to depict the role performance in which school librarians may
legitimately be expected to engage. If the purpose of the standards is to serve as an aspirational
vision of the future of the profession, the authors of the next set of professional standards may wish
to consider including a discussion of the meaning and future of school libraries, for their destiny is
inextricably linked to that of the school library profession.
92
	  

5.3.2.2 The nature of professionalism: performance expectations from the job
descriptions related to Compliance and Liability. Discussions of laws and ethics in the
professional standards have largely been focused on copyright issues and the ethical use of
information (AASL & Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 1988, 1998;
AASL, 2009). School librarians represent an intersection between two professions, that of
librarianship and that of teaching. The teaching profession has its own sets of ethics and codes of
professionalism, and these have not been meaningfully discussed in the professional standards for
school librarians.
Performance expectations related to Compliance and Liability were the second most
represented in the job descriptions. These performance expectations included demonstrating
punctuality and attendance; fulfilling professional responsibilities and other duties as required;
following and enforcing school rules, administrative regulations, school board policies, and state and
federal laws and regulations; maintaining confidentiality; maintaining teacher certification; modeling
and maintaining high standards of ethical and professional behavior and judgment; producing
required records and reports; providing instruction on and ensuring adherence to safety procedures
and proper use of materials and equipment; recognizing indicators of child abuse and taking
appropriate reporting actions; and assisting with the school testing program.
As has been stated before, AASL does not employ school librarians: They are employed by
the districts in which they serve. Many of the performance expectations in this category addressed
issues related to fulfilling requirements that may be specific to a given school district, e.g. policies on
attendance and punctuality. However, taken as a whole, these performance expectations speak to
the nature of professionalism, and their lack of representation in the professional standards is
curious. It may be impossible for AASL to address the multifarious regulations from every school
93
	  

district in their professional standards, but that is unnecessary: All that is needed is a guideline in the
next set of professional standards that addresses these issues in a non-specific fashion, for example,
by including a performance expectation that states ‘School librarians fulfill the professional
responsibilities required of them by their school and district.’ AASL does not need to discuss what
those professional responsibilities are in order to encourage school librarians to follow them.
Two performance responsibilities from Compliance and Liability are cause for concern. The
first is one that is likely standard language on any job description for any position: ‘perform other
duties as required.’ This performance expectation, or variations on that theme, appeared on nearly
every one of the school librarian job descriptions. The reason that this expectation is troubling is
that it has great potential to be misused, especially when there are not additional qualifiers like
‘related duties’ that narrow the scope of additional role performance to the domain of school
librarianship.
The performance expectations on the theme of ‘school librarians will assist with the testing
program of the school’ is another cause for concern. That type of role performance is clearly
outside the domain of school librarianship, but it appeared on 25 of the job descriptions. The
researcher included these testing performance expectations in the category of Compliance and
Liability because they seemed to be oriented towards trying to comply with the state’s requirements
for administering the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT); school librarians sometimes
may be needed as proctors, readers, or administrators depending on the number and type of student
accommodations and qualified personnel available in the school. However, these performance
expectations do not specify only the FCAT, but use the more general phrase ‘testing program of the
school,’ which could include other state tests, or tests generated by the school or district. The
FCAT occurs only once a year, but the Florida Assessments for Instruction in Reading (FAIR)
94
	  

occurs three times a year, and for several weeks at a time. Depending on the level of assistance
expected, these testing related performance expectations have the potential to significantly affect
school librarians’ abilities to engage in role performance specific to their domain.
There is research that has analyzed the types of role performance school librarians engage in
during their work days (Everhart, 1992, 1994, 1997, 2000), but there have been many changes in
school libraries in the intervening years. Further research is needed to provide deeper insights into
the barriers and enablers that shape school librarians’ role performance.

5.3.3 RQ3: How do the performance expectations from Florida school librarians’ job
descriptions compare to the performance measures from Florida school librarians’
performance evaluations?
The third research question addressed in this dissertation analyzed how the performance
expectations on the school librarian job description from a school district compared to the
performance measures on the evaluation from that district.

5.3.3.1 School librarians evaluated on instruments designed for instructional
personnel and instructional support Staff. The literature on school librarians’ performance
evaluation paints a bleak picture. School librarians are often evaluated using instruments for
instructional personnel that are not tailored to their role (Bryant, 2002; Pfister & Towle, 1983;
Vincelette & Pfister, 1984; Young, Green, & Gross, 1995). Almost half of the school librarians
Taylor and Bryant (1996) surveyed reported being evaluated using an instrument that was developed
95
	  

for teachers. There is a similar situation in Florida eighteen years later: Of the 63 performance
evaluations collected, 30 (48%) were designated as for instructional personnel and 2 (3%) were
designated for instructional support staff, with 31 (49%) designated for school librarians. The
school librarian and instructional personnel evaluations were represented in the Copeland,
Danielson, district-created, and Marzano categories. The instructional support staff evaluations
were only represented in the district-created and Marzano categories.
Of the 49 evaluation instruments analyzed in this research, 19 were designated for
instructional personnel and two were designated as for instructional support staff. All but one of
the evaluation instruments designated for instructional personnel or instructional support staff had a
rate of agreement below 50% when compared to the job descriptions for school librarians. Of
these, those with the lowest rates of agreement tended to have newer evaluations paired with older
job descriptions, with evaluation dates ranging from 2013 to 2011, and job description dates ranging
from 2006 to 1990. Evaluations with higher rates of agreement (but still below 50%) were all
Copeland job descriptions compared to Copeland performance evaluations.
Although school librarians are instructional staff, teaching is only part of their roles, and
using an evaluation instrument that is designed for instructional personnel or instructional support
staff will not effectively capture all of the role performance expected of school librarians. If school
librarians feel their performance is not being fairly evaluated, this perception may influence their
perceptions of organizational justice and affect their role performance.
The Florida Legislature passed SB 736 in 2011, which allows school districts to base a
percentage of instructional personnel’s salaries on their students’ achievement scores as measured by
standardized tests. Although school librarians have a positive effect on student achievement in
general (Baumbach, 2003; Krashen, Lee, & McQuillan, 2012; Lance & Hofschire, 2011; Lance,
96
	  

Rodney, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2000), their specific content area is not assessed on standardized tests.
Instructional staff, like school librarians, who teach in areas not assessed on the standardized tests
may have their student achievement scores based on students they do not see on a regular basis.
These factors together create a potentially harmful combination, because if school librarians’
performance evaluations are not effective at measuring all of their role performance, and their
contributions to student achievement are based on students they are not primarily responsible for,
school librarians could easily receive negative performance evaluations through no fault of their
own. Flawed evaluations come with potential legal ramifications, as employees who feel they are
being evaluated unfairly may file suits against their employers.

5.3.3.2 School librarians evaluated on instruments designed for school librarians.
Twenty-eight of the 49 performance evaluations analyzed in this research were designated for school
librarians. Of these 28 performance evaluation instruments, 16 had rates of agreement of 50% or
more, with five of those at 100% agreement; those five were Copeland job descriptions matched to
Copeland evaluations. Of the 12 performance evaluations for school librarians with rates of
agreement below 50%, three had dates for the evaluation and job description (see Appendices A and
B for date information). The performance evaluation for District 51 was from 2012 but the job
description was from 1984, and the performance evaluation for District 2 was from 2011 but the job
description was from 2003. It is possible that the differences in the ages of the job descriptions and
the performance evaluations affected the lower rates of agreement. The roles of school librarians
have evolved over time, as has the purpose of evaluation (Matula, 2011; Wilson & Wood, 1996). If a
district has a job description for school librarians from an era before teaching became a central focus

97
	  

of the role, and uses a modern evaluation designed to assess performance based on student
achievement as measured by standardized tests, the two documents are not likely to agree.
District 41 had a performance evaluation for school librarians from 2012 and a job
description from 2008, but a rate of agreement of 43%. There was another factor besides age that
affected the rate of agreement: the number of performance measures and performance expectations.
The job description from District 41 had nine performance expectations, but the performance
evaluation had 22 performance measures. Eight of the nine performance expectations matched the
performance measures, but the large difference between the numbers of expectations and measures
decreased the rate of agreement.
Performance evaluations designed specifically for school librarians were better at
representing the performance expectations from their job descriptions. Instead of using an
undifferentiated evaluation for instructional personnel to assess school librarians’ role performance,
school district officials may wish to consider using evaluation instruments designed specifically for
school librarians; such evaluations may provide more accurate assessments of school librarians’
work. Making an effort to tailor performance evaluations to the position may also foster more
accurate assessment of other instructional personnel, such as guidance counselors, and art, music,
and physical education teachers, who do not teach in a classroom and consequently do not generate
the kinds of student achievement that can be measured on standardized tests.

5.3.3.3 Implications for research and practice. Research is needed to determine whether
and to what extent school librarians feel their performance evaluations are accurate assessments of
their performance, to determine what school librarians’ perceptions of organizational justice are and
what effect their performance evaluations have on their perceptions of organizational justice, and
98
	  

whether and to what extent these factors influence their role performance. Research is also needed
to determine how districts that are using effective evaluations developed and implemented them, to
promote best practices in performance evaluation.
School district officials may wish to consider updating the job description for a position
when they update the performance evaluation for that position, and revisions should occur on a
regular basis: A district that uses a job description for school librarians from 40 years ago is doing a
disservice to its practitioners, when so much has changed in school libraries since that time. Most of
the districts that had lower rates of agreement had older job descriptions compared to newer
evaluations. If a district updates its performance evaluation without also updating the corresponding
job description, the measures and expectations are naturally going to begin to drift apart.
Employees may experience role ambiguity (Kahn et al., 1964) if they feel their performance
measures and performance expectations are dissimilar, and experience role conflict (Rizzo, House, &
Lirtzman, 1970) as they try to decide to whether to do what’s expected or required of them or what
is being measured.
School district officials may wish to consider adopting a revision cycle for their job
descriptions and performance evaluations, perhaps set to start a couple of years after the publication
of new professional standards. School district officials may wish to consider how the number of
performance expectations compares to the number of performance measures. Organizational
justice is defined as employees’ perceptions of fair treatment (Johnson, Holladay, & Quinones,
2009), and it affects their role performance (Dierdorff, Rubin, & Bachrach, 2012; Jiang, Sun, & Law,
2011). If there are many more measures than there are expectations, employees may feel they are
being evaluated on work they are not required to perform. If there are many more expectations than
measures, employees may feel that all of their work is not being evaluated. Employees who do not
99
	  

feel that their performance evaluations are accurate assessments of their work may feel that they are
not being treated fairly by their organizations. Either of these scenarios only serves to decrease
perceptions of organizational justice, which has the potential to negatively affect employees’ role
performance.

5.3.4 Limitations
This research was exploratory. Data were collected from public school districts in
Florida, and any conclusions or implications are not generalizable to the larger population of school
librarians. Documentary sources may be used by employees as sources informing their role
perceptions (Dierdorff & Rubin, 2007; Schuler, Aldag, & Brief, 1977), but they cannot illustrate what
employees’ role perceptions are, nor are they the only sources employees may use to form their role
perceptions; similarly, it was beyond the scope of this research to determine whether and to what
extent the documents analyzed influence school librarians’ role perceptions. This research analyzed
the agreement between job descriptions and performance evaluations, but that is not a measure of
how effective or accurate the evaluations are. What this research has done is establish a foundation
on which further research into these topics can be constructed.

5.3.5 Conclusion
School librarianship has evolved as the nature of education and society’s access to and use of
information has changed. Perceptions of the roles of school librarians have evolved more slowly,
where some pursue the future of the role while others have yet to turn their gaze from the past. The
findings from this study suggest that pattern continues to this day, with the existence of
100
	  

incongruences among job descriptions, professional evaluations, and national guidelines. School
librarians may be most effective in environments in which they and their administrators are clear
about the purpose of the school library program, and when school librarians’ efforts are recognized
as making important contributions to the learning community. This research was exploratory, and
suggested many fruitful directions for further research.
