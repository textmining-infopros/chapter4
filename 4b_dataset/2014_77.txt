ABSTRACT
Information literacy is an essential skill set individuals need to locate, retrieve,
evaluate, and effectively use information in an effort to assemble and create new
knowledge. Information literacy is recognized by accreditation agencies, professional
organizations, and academic institutions as a vital part of higher education.
Information literacy programs, led primarily by librarians, have developed at institutes
of higher education to instruct students on becoming information literate. Community
colleges have increased their efforts to enhance information literacy instruction for
their students with the goal of creating lifelong learners who will use their skills to
solve problems and make informed decisions. In the end, information literacy is about
developing and producing critically thinking individuals.
Unlike similar community colleges in surrounding counties and states, Cecil
College continues to lack an information literacy program to instruct its rapidly
growing student population in the knowledge and skills needed to become information
literate. This Executive Position Paper investigates the perceptions teaching faculty
have regarding information literacy, as well as which skills are being taught in the
classroom by teaching faculty and which are being taught by librarians. A review of
scholarly literature examines the information-seeking behavior of college students at
community colleges and the collaborative efforts between teaching faculty and
librarians, and explores several critiques that have surfaced regarding information
literacy

xi

Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected utilizing a survey
instrument to examine teaching faculty‘s knowledge of information literacy, the
methods they use to provide information literacy instruction, collaborative efforts they
have had with librarians and other faculty, and their observations of students‘
information literacy abilities. To gather additional information, face-to-face
interviews were conducted with a number of teaching faculty, librarians and
administrators.
Based on the data collected, six recommendations for enhancing the current
information literacy program at Cecil College were developed and presented. They
include the following: developing a localized definition of information literacy,
formulating appropriate outcomes that tie into the institutional mission, increasing
library instruction and intervention throughout the college curriculum, cultivating
faculty-librarian collaborative relationships, forming learning communities, and
adopting appropriate assessment tools to assess the students‘ information literacy
skills and to evaluate their success.

Chapter 1
INFORMATION LITERACY AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE
Introduction
Information literacy (IL) is defined by the American Library Association
(ALA) as ―a set of abilities requiring individuals to recognize when information is
needed and to have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed
information‖ (ALA, 1989). It is recognized by accreditation agencies, professional
organizations, and state departments of education as a necessary part of higher
education. The goals of information literacy are to produce lifelong learners who
possess the ―abilities to locate, organize, store, retrieve, evaluate, synthesize, and
annotate information from print, electronic, and other sources in preparation for
solving problems and making informed decisions‖ (Association of College and
Research Libraries, 2000). In the end, information literacy is about developing and
producing individuals who can think critically.
The movement to produce information literate students has been around for
more than a decade. The push to educate students with IL skills has increased as the
level and sophistication of technology has risen. Much of the literature on IL has
focused on four-year institutions and the programs or initiatives to promote IL among
their students. The small body of literature specific to community colleges and IL
focuses on the information-seeking behavior of community college students or
implementing IL programs into the community college curriculum.

1

The primary mission of a community college is focused on teaching and
learning. Community colleges serve five curricular purposes: academic transfer
preparation, vocational-technical education, developmental education, continuing
education, and community service (Warren, 2006). The student body of most
community colleges is exceptionally varied and diverse in experience, learning styles,
and previous education. When it comes to IL instruction, the open-door admissions
policy of community colleges puts a burden on librarians who must be knowledgeable
and considerate of the wide range of students‘ abilities, ages, experiences, goals,
programs, and time constraints (Branch & Gilchrist, 1996).
Community college librarians and teaching faculty use multiple instructional
styles to teach students. IL is being incorporated into library instruction sessions and,
in some instances, into course curricula as well as the mission of community colleges.
While the need to become information literate is vital, community college students are
not developing the necessary knowledge and skills.
Purpose of Study
Cecil College has an active instruction program for teaching IL skills to its
students, and promotes IL to its teaching faculty. However, Cecil College does not
have a formal IL plan. Although Cecil College has recognized that IL plays an
essential role in many leaning outcomes, it is not considered a core leaning outcome of
its General Education Program (Cecil College, 2013). In its Self-Study Report (Cecil
College, 2010a) for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE),
the College acknowledged it was imperative that all faculty, staff, and students be well
informed about academic integrity, including plagiarism and appropriate Internet
etiquette. It further concluded that most courses and programs require specialized

2

program-specific IL skills, including advanced research and evaluative skills. In fact,
the College‘s own recommendations specified the formal integration of IL into more
courses and programs. The purpose of this study is to enhance the current IL program
by identifying relevant literature, analyzing data collected from teaching faculty, and
recommending available resources the library and librarians could utilize for IL
instruction.
The Self-Study Report (Cecil College, 2010a) placed librarians at the forefront
of improving IL programming across the curriculum and identified them to develop
learning modules for IL that could be incorporated into multiple courses so that
students would be able to repeatedly practice skills pertaining to IL. These modules
would also benefit online students who may not have had formal IL instruction in a
course or with a librarian. As noted in its Self-Study Report (Cecil College, 2010a),
Cecil College has experienced a significant growth in the number of online or hybrid
courses it offers, increasing from 57 courses in FY 2005 to 201 courses in FY 2009.
The College is expected to see continued growth in online courses, and any learning
modules pertaining to IL could be incorporated into the Blackboard™ course
management system.
In addition, Cecil College‘s Strategic Enrollment Management Plan 2013-1015
(Cecil College, 2013) has developed targeted ―Actions‖ and ―Outcomes‖ that pertain
to the library services and librarians. Under ―retention strategies,‖ the library is
responsible for developing financial literacy programs that would be incorporated into
student life and academic programs. There would be clear elements of basic and
advanced IL skills infused in any financial literacy program because the two literacies
complement one another.

3

In addition, librarians are responsible for creating more online tutorials for
students related to academic success strategies (Cecil College, 2013). These tutorials
incorporate some IL skills which can contribute to students‘ learning. Additionally,
under ―infrastructure and operations,‖ library services are encouraged to utilize mobile
technology applications which students, faculty, and staff can use for research (Cecil
College, 2013). This action may necessitate the need for library staff to develop new
teaching methods to instruct users about these mobile applications and may require
more collaboration among teaching faculty and librarians.
Finally, the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) has recognized IL as a
general education requirement for all public education institutions. An in-state
institution shall provide to its students a general education designed to give students
the skills and knowledge necessary to demonstrate IL (COMAR 13B.02.02.16).
Furthermore, the general education programs at public institutions may incorporate
knowledge and skills involving the use of quantitative data, effective writing,
information retrieval, and information literacy (COMAR 13B.06.01.03). By
enhancing the current IL instruction program, Cecil College will further align itself
with Maryland regulations designed for higher education institutions.
This improvement plan is divided into four chapters. Chapter one describes
the need for this project, background information about Cecil College, a brief history
of community colleges in the United States, and key questions that will guide this
improvement plan. Chapter two examines the relevant literature regarding IL and the
information-seeking behavior of community college students. Additionally,

4

collaborative efforts between librarians and teaching faculty will be examined. The
concept of IL and several different models will also be discussed. Chapter three
discusses the methodology used to conduct a survey of the faculty and the resulting
data collected. Additionally, excerpts from follow-up interviews with several teaching
faculty will be described. Chapter four provides recommendations, strategies, and
activities needed to enhance the current IL program at Cecil College.

Community Colleges
Community colleges are a unique American creation that emerged in the early
part of the twentieth century in the form of junior colleges. By the 1960s, the term
―junior college‖ was replaced by the more inclusive term ―community colleges‖
(Cohen, 1994). Community colleges are two-year institutions offering associate
degrees to their target audience, which is the local community. These institutions are
connected directly to the local population and form local partnerships (Warren, 2006).
According to Warren (2006), community colleges serve five educational
purposes: academic transfer preparation, vocational-technical education,
developmental education, continuing education, and community service. These
multiple missions produce a diverse and dynamic environment for faculty, staff, and
students. However, community colleges continue to be plagued by three issues even
as enrollment rates continue to climb. These issues include conflicts and divisiveness
due to multiple missions, lack of political and community support to lobby for
increased funding, and low retention and transfer rates (Warren, 2006).
Enrollment at community colleges has risen steadily over the past fifty years.
According the National Center for Education Statistics (2011), the number of students

5

enrolled in two-year institutions was 850,361 in 1963, and increased to 7,680,875 in
2010. Enrollment at community colleges in Maryland is expected to increase over the
next ten years. The MHEC (2013b) expects total enrollments at Maryland‘s sixteen
community colleges by 2022 to have increased by 19%, with the number of full-time
students expected to grow by 31%, and part-time enrollments projected to increase by
12%. The MHEC (2013b) report also projects enrollment at Cecil College for the
same period to show a significant increase of 20%, with full-time students projected to
increase by 37%, and part-time enrollment up by 8%.
Students choose community colleges over traditional four-year colleges for a
variety of reasons. These may include full-time employment, a desire to return to
school after a long absence, convenient and flexible classes, or close proximity to
home (Groce, 2008). In addition, students balance competing and often conflicting
personal, academic, and financial priorities and responsibilities. The open-door
admission policy challenges teaching faculty and librarians to develop creative
strategies to engage students‘ diverse learning styles, technical abilities, and individual
experiences (Branch & Gilchrist, 1996; Groce, 2008). In some cases, librarians and
teaching faculty share teaching strategies and curriculum to form learning
communities to engage students with educational opportunities (Warren, 2006).
Library bibliographic instruction sessions, or library research skills, are a
regular part of the community college experience (Branch & Gilchrist, 1996; England
& Pasco, 2005; Fry, 2009; Grafstein, 2007; Johnson, 2009; Weiler, 2005; Warren,
2006). In the past decade, there has been a significant importance placed on library
instruction and IL. Today, librarians are contributing to the institutional curriculum by
offering information retrieval classes, developing strategies to address the methods

6

students use to access information, and assessing their impact and effect on student
learning and success (Groce, 2008). Branch and Gilchrist (1996) believe integrating
IL into the community colleges‘ mission increases the quality of education and
contributes to students‘ success.
Cecil College: The Setting
Cecil College is a public two-year, open-admission institution located in Cecil
County, Maryland. Cecil Community College was founded in 1968 to meet the
postsecondary and continuing education needs of county residents. In 2007, the
institution, with approval from the Maryland Higher Education Commission, changed
its name to Cecil College. The college is comprised of the North East main campus
and two additional centers located in Elkton and Perryville, Maryland. According to
the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) (2013a), fall 2011 enrollment at
Cecil College totaled 2,606 students, and 1,077 were enrolled full-time and 1,529 were
enrolled part-time. The college employed 47 full-time and 168 part-time adjunct
faculty who provided instruction for more than 100 associate degrees and certificate
programs (MHEC, 2013a). Of the sixteen community colleges in Maryland, Cecil
College continues to be one of the fastest growing educational institutions (MHEC,
2013b).
In 2010, Cecil College reported the number of candidates for graduation
increased by 13.4% between 2007 and 2009 (Cecil College, 2010a). The MHEC
published the graduation rates for students two, three, and four years after they
matriculated into Cecil College (MHEC, 2013c). The study reported 308 first-time,
full-time students had matriculated into Cecil College in the fall of 2008. After two
years, 1.4% had graduated; 10.4% had graduated after three years, and 10.4% had also

7

graduated after four years (MHEC, 2013c). The graduation rates for Cecil College
were mixed when compared with statewide percentages for the same 2008 cohorts
(See Table 1.1).

However, retention rates are another measure of student success and are related
to student completion (See Table 1.2). Cecil College has developed a comprehensive
tracking system that tracks student attendance and performance at three intervention
points throughout the semester. In addition, Cecil College has also hired additional
and increased fiscal resources for student life activities, co-curricular activities, and
career services. Additionally, the operating hours have been extended in the writing,
reading, and computer labs, tutoring services have expanded, and online library
resources have increased. As a result, there have been modest increases in retention
rates at Cecil College (Cecil College, 2010a; Cecil College, 2013).

The Veterans Memorial Library serves Cecil College and offers programs,
resources, and services to faculty, staff, students, and the community (Veterans
Memorial Library, n.d.). The library provides access to print materials, reference
sources, subject-specific databases, electronic books and journals, and special
collections. The library is staffed by one administrator, one professional librarian, two
library staff, and three adjunct librarians. In addition, the Librarian for Instruction,
Information Technology, and Systems Administration is responsible for developing,
promoting, and conducting information literacy instruction for Cecil College
(Veterans Memorial Library, n.d.).
Problem Statement
Currently, Cecil College does not have a formal IL program. The Veterans
Memorial Library is mentioned in the Cecil College catalog as providing an essential
part of the lifelong learning process (Cecil College, 2011). As the literature indicated,
libraries and librarians are taking the lead in developing IL programs and promoting
them to college administrators, faculty, and students. IL usually gains attention from
college administrators when regional accrediting agencies like the MSCHE mention it
as part of the accreditation process. Cecil College will undergo a periodic review in
2015 and a full self-study review in 2019-2020 (MSCHE, 2012).

9

Developing a full IL program at a community college needs the support of the
teaching faculty. While many students are using the Internet and library resources to
locate information, the students are not evaluating the information they locate,
continue to have difficulty finding reliable sources, or fail to establish suitable criteria
for evaluating credible sources (Karas, 2007). For Cecil College, data was gathered
from teaching faculty to determine their knowledge of IL, to gauge how they view its
importance, and to ascertain their observations of students‘ IL skills.
Librarians cannot develop and assess IL programs based solely on established
standards without consulting with faculty, or vital information will be lost (Gullikson,
2006). Any resulting program would only engage students at a superficial level,
whereas recognizing and incorporating faculty perceptions of IL would lead to
different pedagogical approaches in the design of a program. The input from Cecil
College teaching faculty, as well as evidence and facts compiled from a literature
review, have provided the appropriate guidance to enhance the current IL instruction
program and possibly establish a formal IL plan. Furthermore, the data compiled may
indicate more appropriate instruction techniques and models needed to teach IL to the
community college students.
To summarize, Cecil College has an active IL instruction program, but does
not have an IL plan. Some of the components which will be considered to enhance the
current program include limited staffing and resources, data collected from faculty,
and a review of the current literature.

10

Key Questions
The goal of this executive position paper is to strengthen the current IL
instruction program at Cecil College. The following questions provided the central
focus for this improvement plan and guided the examination:
1.

How do Cecil College teaching faculty understand IL?

2.

In what ways are the teaching faculty incorporating IL knowledge and
skills into their courses?

3.

In what ways, if any, are the teaching faculty collaborating with
librarians to incorporate IL knowledge and skills into their courses?

4.

What collaborative efforts between teaching faculty and librarians are
documented in the scholarly literature and which collaborative efforts
have been successful?
Summary

In the past decade, a significant importance has been placed on library
instruction and IL at community colleges across the country. Librarians responded by
teaching IL skills, developing strategies to improve the methods students use to
retrieve information, assessing their impact on student learning, and developing IL
programs. Currently, Cecil College does not have an IL program. But guided by four
key questions, this study will, in the end, provide recommendations, strategies, and
activities needed to strengthen the current IL program at Cecil College. In the next
chapter, the scholarly literature will be reviewed relating to IL, the informationseeking behavior of community college students, and faculty-librarian collaboration.

Chapter 2
KEY ASPECTS OF INFORMATION LITEARCY
Information literacy is vital for producing lifelong learners and developing
critical thinking skills among individuals. It is recognized as an essential skill set that
must be incorporated into the curriculum of higher education institutes in order to
graduate students who are information literate. A review of the literature in this
chapter examines various definitions, models, and critiques of IL. In addition, this
review also investigates students‘ information-seeking behaviors, and explores
collaborative efforts between faculty and librarians to incorporate IL into the
curriculum.
A Scholarly Examination
According to Johnston and Webber (2003), IL did not develop suddenly at the
end of the 1980s. Librarians have played an important role in pushing the IL initiative
in the United States. The most commonly cited IL statement was formulated by the
American Library Association (ALA) Presidential Committee on IL in 1989:
To be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when
information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use
effectively the needed information. Producing such a citizenry will
require that schools and colleges appreciate and integrate the concept of
information literacy into their learning programs and that they play a
leadership role in equipping individuals and institutions to take
advantage of the opportunities inherent within the information society.
Ultimately, information literate people are those who have learned how
to learn. They know how to learn because they know how knowledge
is organized, how to find information and how to use information in

12

such a way that others can learn from them. They are people prepared
for lifelong learning, because they can always find the information
needed for any task or decision at hand. (para. 3)
In 2000, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) further
expanded on ALA‘s statement by synthesizing and formulizing key desirable
behaviors that information literate students should exhibit. These include the abilities
to: (a) determine the nature and extent of the information needed; (b) access needed
information effectively and efficiently; (c) evaluate information and its sources
critically and incorporate selected information into his/her knowledge base and value
system; (d) use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose; and (e)
understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information
and access and use information ethically and legally (ACRL, 2000, para. 2).
These ACRL standards place the student at the center of the IL process, as is
evidenced by a long series of behavioral indicators and outcomes, which are
influenced by the information science discipline and traditional library bibliographic
instruction. The result is a ―tick-the-box‖ approach, reducing a complex set of skills
and knowledge to small, discrete units (Gullikson, 2006; Owusu-Ansah, 2005).
Both the ALA‘s and ACRL‘s statements and standards have been used the
United States. In Australia, the development of an information literate person is
introduced in primary school, rather than focusing only on students attending institutes
of higher education. The Council of Australian University Libraries adopted the
ACRL standards, but according to Johnston and Webber (2003), they added two
additional standards: information literate persons recognize lifelong learning to be a
continual process and they realize that participative citizenship requires everyone to be
information literate. Furthermore, the information literate individual must expand,
reframe, or create new knowledge by integrating prior knowledge and new

13

understandings as an individual or as a member of a group. In the United Kingdom,
the Society of College, National, and University Libraries provides a progression
model from basic to more sophisticated skills, which places much more emphasis on
technology rather than library bibliographic instruction (Johnston & Webber, 2003).
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) closely follows the ALA and ACRL by defining IL as a set of skills which
adults need to be effective in all aspects of their lives and integrated alongside
problem-solving and communication skills (Catts & Lau, 2008). UNESCO states that
storing and retrieving information are additional competencies people must possess.
In addition, IL must be considered in a broader context which includes education, civil
society, health, security, and work to enable people to move from dependence on
knowledge brokers to become knowledge builders (Catt & Lau, 2008).
Information literacy is viewed in broad terms and seems impossible to identify
specifically without excluding all other literacies, such as computer, media, visual,
network, and library literacy or the role of pedagogy in creating authentic learning
environments, influenced by constructivist learning (Breivik, 2005). Information
literacy is best envisioned as a broad concept that encompasses critical thinking skills
that provide humans, who are processors, managers, and users of information, with the
ability to make critical decisions (Breivik, 2005; Bruce, 1999; Eisenberg, 2008). In
the end, IL is exemplified by the ability to discover, retrieve, and use information.
Defining Information Literacy
In 1974, Paul Zurkowski introduced the term ―information literacy‖ to describe
individuals who were trained and capable of using various tools or applications to find
and use information to solve their work problems (Kapitzke, 2003). In 1989, the ALA

14

issued their definition of an information literate individual as possessing the skills to
find, evaluate, and use information effectively to solve a particular problem or make a
decision (Mackey & Jacobson, 2004). The definition provided both a conceptual and
pragmatic approach to IL, and it also broadly described the goals of lifelong learning.
In 2000, the ACRL published Information Literacy Competency Standards for
Higher Education, which articulated performance indicators and outcomes for
assessing when students have successfully become information literate. The ACRL‘s
standards focused on students‘ outcomes based on five information skill standards
which included 22 performance indicators and 87 outcome measurements (see
Appendix A). Among ACRL standards are students‘ ability to locate, evaluate,
organize, and use information for specific needs, as well as the capability to think
critically and communicate effectively. The ACRL‘s Competency Standards basically
reiterate the ALA‘s initial definition, while including a measurable method to
determine what constitutes an information literate student.
Many definitions have developed since 1989, but they all derive from the
ALA‘s initial definition. Several definitions expand IL beyond library bibliographic
instruction to incorporate skill-based learning, problem-based learning, and criticalbased learning (Breivik, 2005). Information literacy is also considered a subset of
critical thinking in some definitions. The initial definition of IL has evolved over
time, but perhaps, as Owusu-Ansah (2005) states, IL is too huge and diverse to be
confined to one single definition.
Six Models of Information Literacy
Six major IL models have been designed and constructed based on the ALA‘s
definition of IL. These models highlight core knowledge and skills students or

15

individuals must possess to be considered information literate. In addition, several of
these paradigms build on previous standards and benchmarks and also include
specifics pertaining to technology, information management, and critical thinking
skills. The following six models are the most commonly used in higher education:
ACRL Information Literacy Model. The ACRL model (Figure 2.1) is
divided into five major standards: (a) know the information needed, (b) access the
needed information, (c) evaluate the gathered information, (d) use the information
effectively to accomplish a purpose, and (e) and understand the ethical/legal uses of
information (ACRL, 2000). These are further broken down into 22 performance
indicators and 87 measureable outcomes, which include the ability to articulate an
information need, develop a research question, identify key concepts, and synthesize
retrieved information with original thoughts to form new information. The model also
distinguishes critical thinking and reasoning within its framework, but information
technology is not interwoven within its indicators or outcomes. The model continues
to be the foundation for many IL programs in institutes of higher education in the
United States and Canada because it appears to be more appropriate for curriculum
integration.

ACRL Information Literacy Model.

Seven Faces of Information Literacy Model. The Seven Faces of
Information Literacy model (see Figure 2.2) was developed from work published by
Bruce (1999). She concluded that information technology, sources, process,
information management, knowledge construction, knowledge extension, and wisdom
encompass the ―faces‖ of IL. The model embeds the information process in a
technological context, inseparable from information itself, and applies cognitive states,
such as knowledge, understanding, and wisdom to describe IL circumstances. Bruce‘s
(1999) model emphasizes the individual perspective when it comes to finding and
understanding sources, defining the structure and scope of an information problem,
and synthesizing as well as creating knowledge. The model is rooted in the emergence
of the information society, which Bruce (1999) characterized by the rapid growth in

17

the availability of information and the constant changes in technology which are used
to disseminate access and manage information (Grafstein, 2007).

Figure 2.2

Seven Faces of Information Literacy Model.

Seven Pillars of Information Literacy Model. The Seven Pillars model was
developed in the late 1990s in the United Kingdom by the Society of College,
National, and University Libraries. The model (see Figure 2.3) employs study skills,
with students utilizing information acquisition tools, and conceptual skills, with
students being aware how information is produced and used. The model identifies
core skills such as recognizing information needs, identifying problem solving
strategies, and evaluating information, but also includes information technology as a
core component. The seven pillars model also ranks five levels of expertise ranging
from novice to expert. With basic library skills and information technology skills as

18

the foundation for the seven pillars, these distinct skill sets form a theoretical
framework which leads to information literate individuals.

Figure 2.3

Seven Pillars of Information Literacy Model

UNESCO Information Literacy Model. The UNESCO model has five
stages for a person to become information literate. The model (see Figure 2.4) is
comparable to the ACRL model in both skills and process, but includes information
management as a key characteristic. The emphasis on managing information, such as
storing, reusing, recording, preserving, and disposing, is not emphasized in other
models, and is a reflection of UNESCO‘s mission. The model positions IL as
distinctly separate from computer literacy or media literacy.

19

Figure 2.4

UNESCO Information Literacy Model.

Big6™ Model. The Big6™ model centers on the information problem-solving
process and the skills needed to discover a solution. The model (see Figure 2.5),
developed by Michael Eisenberg and Robert Berkowitz, unifies information and
technical skills to assist students in comprehending the information problem-solving
process so students connect the process with their lives (Eisenberg, 2008). The model
is composed of six broad areas including task definition, information-seeking
strategies, location and access, use of information, synthesis, and evaluation. The
Big6™ model does not, however, delve into legal/ethical issues. This model was
designed specifically for K-12 students and has been implemented in primary and
secondary education curriculums world-wide, but it has also been adopted by a
number of higher education institutions. Eisenberg and Berkowitz developed the
model in response to information overload, which characterized the new information
environment (Eisenberg, 2008). It is based on teaching and integrating information

20

searching skills as well as technology use skills, primarily as a method for enhancing
information technology (Grafstein, 2007).

Figure 2.5

Big6™Model.

Information Fluency Model. The Information Fluency model (see Figure
2.6), which incorporates relevant technology, critical thinking skills, and the ACRL
standards was developed by the Associated Colleges of the South to characterize
individuals who function with relative ease in a world of increasing information and
changing technologies. By using appropriate technologies, critical thinking, and
proper information-seeking behavior, individuals will become information fluent and
be able to collect necessary information, employ critical thinking skills, synthesize
information, and present those conclusions using a variety of research and multimedia
tools. The aim of the model is to bring librarians, teaching faculty, and information

21

technology (IT) personnel together to collaborate and develop initiatives to address the
impact of information and continual technological changes on higher education
(Sharkey, 2006).

Figure 2.6

Information Fluency Model

Similarities and Difference among IL Models. Most of the models examined
have similar characteristics in that they follow a linear process and focus on the skills
needed to become information literate. The only exception is the Seven Faces model
which focuses on broad concepts without determining the relationship between the
faceted structures it utilizes. The ACRL model is based largely on skill acquisition
and concept awareness which forms the basis of the model‘s performance indicators.
The Seven Pillars, UNESCO, Information Fluency, and Big6™ models incorporated

22

many of the same skills and concepts found in the ACRL model, but not to the same
degree and depth. However, the similarities ended with regards to technology and
ethical issues related to IL.
The ACRL model has recognized that IL has been influenced by recent
technological developments, and that fluency with information technology skills
merely assists and supports IL. The most important IL skill in the ACRL model is
critical thinking. The UNESCO model has incorporated technology through the use of
information management skills which place emphasis on storing, recording,
preserving, and disposing of information.
According to the Seven Faces model, the transition to electronic formats has
had a significant impact on how individuals use information and, more importantly,
how information is sought and retrieved. Similarly, the Big6™ model can be
characterized as a process to the information environment by enhancing IT skills in an
existing IL context. The Information Fluency model merged technology with critical
thinking and IL concepts to form a collaborative paradigm between teaching faculty,
librarians, and IT personnel.
Finally, the Seven Pillars model is designed to include IT skills as a core part
of IL. Basic library/research skills and IT skills intersect to form the foundation of
this model, which follows an individual‘s progression from novice to expert. As in the
Seven Faces and Information Fluency a models, the Seven Pillars model has also
emphasized the significant impact technology has had on IL. However, unlike the

23

ACRL model, the Seven Pillars and other models have scarcely made reference to
ethical or legal issues regarding IL.
Finally, these models share additional characteristics that have kept them from
being incorporated into the curriculum and have continued to keep IL regarded as a
separate subject. According to Markless and Streatfield (2012), most models: (a) are
not linked to the learning process as it is currently understood; (b) ignore or underplay
reflection, iteration, trial and error, and different learning styles and strategies; (c)
ignore peer interaction and the collaborative nature of much enquiry; and (d) use a
language that does not resonate with academic staff and students nor reflect the
language of the disciplines. These claims were supported by the literature regarding
the information-seeking behavior of college students and some articles relating to
faculty perceptions of IL.
Critiques of Information Literacy
There is debate over what constitutes information literacy. Is it just
bibliographic instruction, or is it a more theoretical concept used to describe students‘
research process and behavior? Information literacy advocates, including librarians,
higher education institutions, and accrediting agencies prefer the latter, and view IL as
the foundation for lifelong learning. Owusu-Ansah (2005) believed that debates over
the definition of IL distract from IL education. His well-documented research
indicates there is no real deviation from the original definition produced by ALA in
1989. The ALA definition describes IL as a set of abilities to identify an information
need and then locate, evaluate, and use the retrieved information. The ALA‘s
definition is utilized as a tool for teaching lifelong learning as well as a skill set for

24

social empowerment (Owusu-Ansah, 2005). Regardless, Marcum (2002) argued that
different definitions have emerged as a result of increased skills and changes in
learners‘ mindsets. Marcum (2002) contends that most education systems and
libraries describe IL skills such as locating, accessing, evaluating, and using
information in terms of printed sources and not incorporating emerging technologies
in terms of gathering content and information transfer. Nevertheless, scholars,
librarians, and academics feel the definition debate is appropriate and beneficial given
that IL continues to evolve.
Some argue only librarians view IL as a crucial skill set that all individuals, in
particular students, need, and it requires the intervention of librarians. To rectify a
presumed deficiency among information seekers, librarians recognized an opportunity
to participate in the education process (Owusu-Ansah, 2005). Kapitzke (2003)
contended the term ―information literacy‖ was created when library science advocates
failed to have bibliographic instruction/library skills programming included as part of
the core curriculum in higher education.
Marcum (2002) also believed IL skills which were currently being taught lack
realistic objectives and will have a short ―shelf life‖ because competency in the
workplace is required, not just literacy. Marcum further contended that IL programs
should strive to produce graduates who function in the workplace and are not simply
familiar with tools, resources, research methods, and critical thinking skills geared
toward academics. Kapitzke (2003) supported Marcum‘s argument by stating the IL
framework is currently inadequate because it neglects the implication of new
technologies.

25

Owusu-Ansah (2005) suggested librarians have marginalized themselves by
concentrating on ACRL‘s Standard Four which assigns subject faculty the
responsibility to teach students the effective use of information to accomplish a
purpose. For many, IL instruction is overly focused on basic skills as opposed to fully
encompassing visual, interactive, and cultural spheres currently emerging (Marcum,
2002).
Accrediting Agencies and Information Literacy
Accreditation agency documents emphasize goal-based assessment models
using mission-driven standards to define educational quality (Gratch-Lindauer, 2002).
Accrediting agencies detail expected goals and objectives which academic programs
and units should have in place to support the home institution. These are then used to
evaluate the success of programs and units in achieving stated goals, and then to
provide recommendations for improvements or modifications (Gratch-Lindauer,
2002).
The MSCHE accrediting agency made reference to IL in Standard 11
(Educational Offerings) and Standard 12 (General Education), and enumerated skills
needed for students to exhibit competency (MSCHE, 2006). Gratch-Lindauer (2002)
feels that the MSCHE‘s Standards have strengthened librarians‘ teaching role by
connecting their expertise with information resources and research skills to students‘
learning experience. In addition, libraries and librarians contributed to institutional
goals by developing learning objectives regarding the acquisition of IL skills. By
assessing students‘ progress and achievement, librarians were able to demonstrate how
the outcomes are used to improve student learning, even if the skills are not easily

26

acquired and cannot be applied in more than one context (Gratch-Lindauer, 2002;
Mackey & Jacobson, 2004).
In addition, the MSCHE asserted that collaboration among librarians, faculty,
and administrators was a ―fundamental element‖ by establishing a framework with
guidelines that fosters and encourages collaboration within an integrated IL program
(Saunders, 2007). Supplemental documentation issued by MSCHE warned
institutions about relying on single library instruction sessions for IL delivery which,
according to Saunders (2007), implies that a deeper level of collaboration is expected.
Accrediting agencies assert that IL should be a shared teaching responsibility, but
librarians still have difficulty establishing collaborative relationships with teaching
faculty (Saunders, 2007). Nevertheless, IL is integrated into a number of accrediting
agencies‘ statements regarding General Education outcomes, or aligned with related
analytical skills, such as critical thinking.
Information-Seeking Behavior of College Students
Information-seeking behavior has been studied since the 1950s, but researchers
have focused on students‘ behavior during the past twenty years (Weiler, 2005).
Information-seeking behavior simply refers to the process we use to search for
information and utilize the information once gathered.
According to Seamans (2002), librarians know very little about how first-year
students obtain information, let alone if they use it effectively, making it difficult to
design library instructional programs. This has an impact on how academic libraries
provide services to college students. She also observed that student conducted a vast
amount of research using the Internet, a method encouraged by high school teachers.
Some students evaluate resources using relatively sophisticated methods, but rely

27

predominately on peers, who they view as experts, to validate the research information
they have gathered. Seamans (2002) concluded that students approached research
acquisition with a predetermined perspective, seeking supportive evidence. They
rarely searched for opposing viewpoints or sought to explore a topic more broadly.
However, she was unable to determine if this was a result of the assignments given or
based on the research process they developed during high school. In addition, students
rarely engaged in developing effective search sequences with Boolean operators to
string keywords together. Many first-year students were also not concerned about
using a critical approach when evaluating information retrieved for research.
Johnston and Webber (2003) feel an individual will experience changes
throughout their lives which affect the type of information they need as well as the
methods employed to access, evaluate, understand, and use information. In addition,
economic, social, and cultural changes affect how students retrieve information and
students‘ personal goals, as depicted in Figure 2.7.

28

Information Literate Student in the Changing Information Society.
Adapted from ―Information literacy in higher education: A review and
case study,‖ by B. Johnston and S. Webber, 2003, Studies in Higher
Education, 28(3), p. 348. Copyright 2003 by Taylor & Francis Group.

According to Casper and Bernhisel (2006), students primarily turned to the
Web for research and did not go farther. They seldom evaluated the credibility of
Web sources and were unable to distinguish between scholarly and popular journals.
In addition, they were unaware of when to appropriately cite their sources or
acknowledge they need further guidance with their information gathering. Students
also reported developing their research skills during their high school years or were
self-taught (Casper & Bernhisel, 2006).
Head and Eisenberg (2010) found that many college students had difficulty
starting the research process, especially defining a research inquiry. Over threefourths (84%) of students reported ―getting started‖ as the most difficult part of the

29

research process, followed by defining a topic (66%). A majority of students had
developed an established research routine which included techniques and skills they
initially learned in high school, but refashioned once they entered a higher education
institution. Students were driven by familiarity and habit, using an established set of
resources for a majority of their research, while occasionally using additional sources.
According to Head and Eisenberg (2010), students reported being uncertain about
assessing the quality of their own research. They used risk-averse strategies based on
efficiency and predictability in order to manage and control the information available
to them, while they showed less frustration when finding information for their
personal lives. It is evident that students have developed research strategies to
manage, control, and limit all the information they retrieve.
Head and Eisenberg (2010) also reported that students evaluated information
they retrieved from the Internet, but made less effort to evaluate information retrieved
from library resources. They looked at currency as the lead indicator of validity.
Evaluating information was a collaborative process, with 61% turning to their friends,
peers, and family members. In addition, 49% asked instructors for assistance, while
only 11% asked librarians for assistance (Head & Eisenberg, 2010). A majority of
students applied a blended approach, including self-taught methods, to evaluate the
credibility of web-based content. Students believed they were adept at evaluating
information and applying IL techniques to course-related research assignments.
According to Head and Eisenberg (2010), students were most concerned with passing
the course (99%) followed by finishing the assignment (97%), and getting a good
grade (97%).

30

Weiler (2005) found motivation to be critical to students‘ information-seeking
behavior. Time was a major motivating factor. Students based their informationseeking experiences on the amount of time they expended, and would accept
inappropriate information or lower quality information if it took less time. She also
concluded that students seek supportive evidence for their predetermined perspectives.
In addition, she concluded students were concerned about information accuracy only if
their instructor perceived it to be crucial. Not surprisingly, students were motivated,
either intrinsically or extrinsically, to spend more time seeking information for their
own personal or professional use (Weiler, 2005).
Ironically, Casper and Bernhisel (2006) found that students felt competent
about their abilities to conduct library research as well as their computer skills, but
their research on incoming college students indicated that many of them rated
themselves higher than their abilities. Their research also found that students were
confident with general IL skills, but at the same time, reported their skills for
conducting research were not complete.
However, Gross and Latham (2007) concluded from their research that many
students were unaware of their IL and computer skill deficit and were unlikely to seek
to remedy this problem. Anecdotal evidence from librarians, including myself,
provided corroborating evidence that students demonstrated inflated views of their IL
skills. In addition, Gross and Latham (2007) reported that ―library anxiety‖ also
played a role in the lack of confidence students felt in their abilities to engage in
information-seeking tasks. Library anxiety is the term used to describe the feelings of
discomfort and stress students describe when they begin the research process and use
an academic library (Mellon, 1986). Finally, their research supported the notion that

31

IL instruction at the K-12 level is inconsistent (Gross & Latham, 2007). Students are
not entering college with adequate research skills, and some students may not acquire
these skills before graduating.
Given‘s (2002) study of mature undergraduate students indicated that their
information-seeking behavior differed from younger undergraduates. The real-life
experiences of mature undergraduates, which contrast considerably with those of
younger undergraduates, have a significant effect on their information-seeking
behavior. Mature undergraduates tend not to use academic sources, since they find
these resources problematic in solving their everyday information needs. They have
established their own research behavior that compliments either their job-related
information-seeking behavior or their everyday life information-seeking (Given,
2002).
Single-session instruction often has no effect on the types of sources that
students used for research (Fry, 2009; Gandhi, 2004; Gross & Latham, 2007).
However, some studies found that there was an increase in the students‘ confidence
level while conducting research after a single-session instruction (Hsieh & Holden,
2010). Hsieh and Holden‘s own research indicated improved post-test scores from
students after single-session instruction. In addition, they reported students valued
library instruction sessions, which they contend counters the argument that singlesession instruction is ineffective. However, their research did conclude that some
topics were found by the students to be too complicated for meaningful coverage in a
single-session (Hsieh & Holden, 2010).
Not surprisingly, students do not view libraries and librarians as part of their
information-support network. Students do not often turn to librarians for advice or

32

guidance when trying to determine the quality of sources. Students do use library
resources, but not librarian-related services (Head & Eisenberg, 2010). Head and
Eisenberg (2010) believed library instruction would benefit from rethinking and
reexamination, such as modifying sessions to emphasize the research process over
finding research sources, topic development, and honing their research strategies.
Evaluation, interpretation, and synthesis are key information competencies of the 21st
century.

Information-seeking Behavior of Community College Students
Gandhi (2005) found that a majority of community college students did not
possess adequate library research skills. Her study at Valencia Community College in
Florida affirmed previous student perceptions. Students saw no relevance from the
information presented during library sessions to their specific research needs. Gandhi
(2005) also discovered students were overwhelmed by the research process and rarely
explored electronic resources beyond their ability to retrieve needed information. In
addition, library sessions were not being designed for students‘ different technology
skills and learning styles. She contended the lack of adequate research skills could
seriously impede students‘ academic careers and hinder their ability to become
lifelong learners.
Karas and Green (2007) identified several themes related to the informationseeking behavior of community college students. They lacked experience doing
research, they predominately used Internet search engines, and they searched library
databases, to a limited extent, for additional material. Students did not comprehend
the need to verify the validity of information they retrieved, nor do they possess

33

strategies to properly evaluate sources, which were usually based on one or two
surface quality criteria. Most students did not believe that validating resources was
fundamental to their education, as their primary goal was completing the assignment.
The authors (2007) further reported that information-seeking behavior was often
dependent on students‘ majors, with students in the soft, pure, and life disciplines
engaging in more information-seeking behavior. Most students, however, gathered
information from familiar sources which they felt were easier and less time consuming
to use, and did not branch out to other resources available to them. In addition,
students rarely went to the library because they had access to online resources, and
often ignored print materials altogether.
Karas and Green (2007) also described library anxiety played a significant role
in the information-seeking behavior of community college students. Most students
feared their lack of library and research skills would reflect negatively on them or
would be perceived as a negative characteristic by their peers or instructors. Their
fears were alleviated to some extent after single-session, multiple sessions, or
computer-assisted library instruction, but students‘ research skills did not improve
significantly. Students found the library intervention overwhelming, with too much
information presented outside the context of their research needs. Finally, the authors
also found students learned more when library interventions included hands-on
activities.
Groce (2008) also found that most community college students had difficulty
conducting research and obtaining information on their specific topics. Her research,
which supports Gandhi (2005) and Karas and Green (2007), found students
predominately used resources retrieved from Internet search engines, they did not

34

accurately evaluate their resources, and they rarely visited the library or used its
resources. Students were unable to determine the difference between scholarly
resources, such as peer-reviewed articles, and sources which summarized broad topics.
In addition, students believed there was too much emphasis placed on learning search
strategies without being connected to a problem-solving context and not enough time
was given to skill practice or feedback from either librarians or teaching faculty. All
of these issues combined to result in lower motivation among students. Groce‘s
(2008) examination of nontraditional community college students found they were
often distracted, rushed, and unprepared, and allocated little time to library research.
Groce (2008) found that traditional community college students were not
reluctant to using technology, while nontraditional students had some difficulty using
it correctly. Many students, whether traditional, nontraditional or returning students,
were overwhelmed by library resources and the technological skills needed to utilize
them correctly. In addition, off-campus students were not receiving adequate training
about library resources from librarians, who, in some instances, were also responsible
for teaching faculty how to use similar resources (Groce, 2008).
Fry (2009) recognized the difficulty in examining community colleges students
because they have diverse experiences, learning styles, skills, and educational goals.
In addition, these students are ethnically, culturally, and socioeconomically more
varied than traditional college student populations, and they come to college with
significant limitations such as reading level, technical skills, time commitments,
language, and assorted ages. Similarly, Branch and Gilchrist‘s (1996) seminal article
described the diverse information-seeking habits of community college students and,
ten years later, Warren (2006) reported the student population had become further

35

diverse and their information-seeking behavior more difficult to generalize. However,
Fry (2009) was able to identify similar characteristics shared by community college
students in their information-seeking behavior.
Fry‘s (2009) examination of several studies found that community college
students relied on information-seeking habits they developed before entering college.
He concluded that students rarely retained information-seeking skills taught by
librarians or teaching faculty, and seldom used library resources for their research
needs because they did not connect library resources to the importance of their
coursework. Fry (2009) pointed to one study in which almost 38% of students
surveyed reported never using library databases, and over 44% of students reported
never utilizing the library. This supports previous studies which reported that most
community college students are unfamiliar with libraries, librarians, and the resources
or services libraries provide.
Community college students feel confident in their abilities to conduct
research, but fail to demonstrate these skills. Ironically, students report the more time
they spend on conducting research; the less satisfied they are with the results retrieved.
Students continue to have difficulty narrowing broad topics, recognizing their
information needs, and developing research strategies for retrieving information. In
addition, students are satisfied using non-authoritative results for their research.
Understanding the information-seeking behavior of community college students could
be beneficial for librarians and teaching faculty in developing strategies to teach
research skills.

36

Information Literacy and Faculty-Librarian Collaborations
The success of IL is related to faculty-librarian collaborations. The
monumental advances in technology have multiplied the information available to
students with the role of the librarians and faculty expanding incrementally (Brasley,
2008).
In her study of faculty-librarian collaboration, Gandhi (2005) asserted that
librarians and teaching faculty could mutually reinforce IL skills by integrating IL
components within specific courses, which helped to establish positive relationships as
well as meaningful assignments for students. Classroom experiences that blended
subject content with information research and evaluation skills could increase student
comprehension. Gandhi (2005) referred to several studies that were conducted at
Southeastern Louisiana University, Towson University, and Glendale Community
College which reported positive experiences resulting from faculty-librarian
collaborations, but this type of relationship remains unique rather than the norm.
Librarians have been proactive in developing strategies to establish campus
partnerships that incorporate institutional values and missions. Developing
collaborative partnerships with teaching faculty begins with single-session library
instruction. Single-session instruction is the most prevalent format for teaching IL
skills, but this approach has many disadvantages. According to Gandhi (2005),
librarians have only one hour to assess students‘ prior IL knowledge and skills.
Librarians usually present an enormous amount of information in a short time, which
can be overwhelming for students who find the information irrelevant to their research
needs. In addition, the single-sessions allow for only minimal or superficial
collaboration with teaching faculty (Gandhi, 2005).

Faculty perceptions and attitudes toward librarians affect the collaborative
process (Black, Crest, & Volland, 2003; Hopkins & Julian, 2008). This has an effect
on students‘ attitudes toward IL instruction and the learning and teaching environment
in the classroom (Hopkins & Julian, 2008; Reed, Kinder, & Farnum, 2007). Teaching
faculty are reluctant to enter collaborative relationships with librarians for fear of
losing valuable course time and control over content (Mackey & Jacobson, 2004; Reed
et al., 2007). Without collaboration, librarians are unable to identify students‘ needs,
are uncertain about how teaching faculty are integrating research skills into the
students‘ assignments, and more importantly, are unable to show students how library
resources are crucial to their coursework (Reed et al., 2007).
Information literacy instruction is often marginalized by some faculty who
view it as a ―library skill‖ as opposed to research skills (Johnston & Webber, 2003).
They further asserted teaching faculty were mostly unaware of how to teach IL skills.
Similarly, Borelli et al. (2009) argued teaching faculty know very little about how to
teach IL skills because many of them lack IL knowledge and skills themselves.
According to McGuinness (2006), many teaching faculty feel students are
responsible for becoming information literate by completing IL exercises, attending
library-based instruction, participating in a research methods course, engaging in core
skill modules, taking computer or library skills classes, receiving feedback, or
obtaining general direction from faculty or librarians, who can recommend important
sources. She also reported that teaching faculty believed that students develop IL
skills based on their personal interests and motivation, which relied completely on
students being proactive about learning these skills. McGuiness (2006) further

38

reported that faculty felt IL skills were acquired in other learning situations, such as
students‘ social development, and that teaching such skills was not a priority.
Furthermore, convincing teaching faculty, department heads, deans, and key
administrators that IL skills are essential to student learning continues to be a difficult
mission, which usually falls to librarians to accomplish (Jenkins & Boosinger, 2003).
Some administrators acknowledge that integrating IL into the curriculum can be
achieved through positive and proactive collaborations between librarians and
teaching faculty (England & Pasco, 2005). This collaborative effort would lead to
more authentic learning. Community college administrators understand the
importance of authentic learning, yet they often struggle to provide a continual twoway path between education and training, and between theory and practice (Eisenberg,
2008; England & Pasco, 2005). More importantly, collaboration between teaching
faculty and librarians is considered by most accrediting agencies as a factor
contributing to IL skills acquisition (Jenkins & Boosinger, 2003; Saunders, 2007).
Gutiérrez and Wang (2001) recommended IL be taught through a series of
library sessions as opposed to a single-session. Students would value the library
sessions because the information would be provided at the point of need. Their study
found single-session instruction was not sufficient to significantly improve library or
research skills, except in students who were already regular library users (Gutiérrez &
Wang, 2001). This reinforces the argument that research skills need practice, and
teaching faculty need to generate assignments that incorporate and require students to
use library resources.
Hopkins and Julian (2008) reported that most library instruction programs have
formalized relationships with English departments to provide IL instruction based on

39

integrated assignments. However, this was not the case with other subject-based
courses, as students occasionally selected research topics unrelated to their majors, but
received subject-specific library instruction. The authors believe successful facultylibrarian collaboration should begin with creating a standard curriculum, designing
subject-based learning outcomes, and developing a plan to integrate library instruction
into discipline-specific courses. This may also encourage librarians to focus their
instruction sessions on course assignments and meaningful advanced research
methods, thus avoiding the repetition of lower-level library skills (Hopkins & Julian,
2008).
Faculty-librarian collaborations can lead to effective research assignment
design and library instruction tailored to particular courses. Students would learn how
to use library resources more effectively, gain real-life experiences, obtain the
opportunity for critical reflection, and, for a number of students, demonstrate less
research anxiety (Bruce, 2002; Gandhi, 2005; Breivik, 2005; Borelli et al., 2009). In
addition, Gandhi (2005) found that faculty-librarian collaborations reinforced positive
relationships between students and librarians. Students actively engaged with faculty
regarding content, and consulted librarians regarding research.
Eisenberg (2008) advocated a collaborative approach, which involves teaching
faculty, librarians, and technology experts. He viewed teaching IL skills within the
curriculum to be appropriate, but did not advocate adding more content. Eisenberg
(2008) suggested curriculum mapping to identify relevant and appropriate placement
of IL in the context of the subject area curriculum, as well as linking and integrating
discipline-based topics, lesson plans, and assignments.

40

Black et al. (2003) asserted that building collaborative partnerships is so
critical that librarians must reach out to teaching faculty, who typically operate from a
culture defined by content focus, autonomy, time constraints, and resistance to change.
In addition, they found that librarians can leverage their technological expertise to
establish relationships with teaching faculty and increase integrating IL into course
curricula. In addition, some librarians have developed faculty-focused workshops to
enhance collaborative partnerships and promote library instruction programs.
Bruce (2002) found that librarians are moving from an information-retrieval
centered-view toward an approach that encourages students‘ learning. Librarians now
focus their expertise on emerging and communication-oriented technologies to
promote IL. However, librarians‘ new focus must be grounded in learning and
teaching pedagogy, according to Johnston and Webber (2003). They suggest that
librarians are often criticized by academics for the library instructions programs they
have developed and implemented because they are not based on established pedagogy
or lack an assessment component. Teaching IL, however, can also contribute content
to academic programs as faculty-librarian collaborations become more complex and
important (Gratch-Lindauer, 2002).
Effective faculty-librarian collaboration efforts can lead to successful
outcomes if they are planned prior to the course. Reed et al. (2007) described
significant improvements in IL skills among students. They found that 85% of
students were able to pass an IL test taken after library instruction, while only 29%
were able to pass prior to library intervention. In addition, the authors reported that
students viewed librarians as instructors who added depth and insight into the
curriculum, and independently consulted with librarians about course work.

41

According to Reed et al. (2007), faculty noticed an improvement in
assignments from the previous year, and also saw their workload reduced as students
consulted more with librarians. Some students still had difficulty with IL skills, while
others adhered to previously held views about IL due to mixed messages received
from teaching faculty. According to Reed et al. (2007), collaboration was successful
when focused on using databases, especially searching techniques, and library
services. It also resulted in more students receiving IL instruction, better integration
of librarians into the classroom, and an increase in faculty knowledge of IL content in
their courses. Reed et al. (2007) warn, however, that collaboration does require a
great deal of time, especially when librarians are involved in all aspects of course
development.
Gullikson (2006) contended that there is little guidance available to librarians
on which aspects of the ACRL standards to emphasize when collaborating with
teaching faculty. After a thorough examination, (2006) concluded nine of the 87
outcomes were librarians‘ primary responsibility, while 53 were to be addressed by the
course instructor. Furthermore, only 25 outcomes were considered to be collective
tasks for faculty and librarians. Gullikson (2006) also reported that faculty had
difficulty understanding the language of the outcomes, and complained about the
repetition and wordiness used in the ACRL standards.
Interpersonal faculty-librarian relationships have led to customized IL
instruction, with faculty supplying the content of the course, and librarians shaping the
research questions, teaching the skills to discover the answers, and paving the way for
collaborative instruction (Black et al., 2003).

Librarian-Faculty Collaboration Model. Adapted from ―Building a
successful information literacy infrastructure on the foundation of
librarian-faculty collaboration,‖ by C. Black, S. Crest, and M. Volland,
2001, Research Strategies, 18(1), p. 218. Copyright 2003 by Elsevier
Science Inc.

As depicted in Figure 2.8, customized instruction results when librarians acknowledge
that faculty have purview over the curriculum. Black et al. (2003) also found that
librarians can avoid these negative perceptions by employing a number of strategies,
including formal communication, campus involvement, or informal contacts.
Brasley (2008) believed librarians must align an instruction program to their
institution‘s educational goals and missions, and must work with teaching faculty to
craft mutually agreed upon objectives. The author details a framework for
collaboration:
1.

creating a shared vision;

2.

developing mutually agreed curricular/learning outcomes;

3.

establishing a curriculum mapping project to (a) review the degree
requirements, (b) analyze courses for existing IL and identify

43

weakness, and (c) create a draft curriculum map identifying where IL
exists in the curriculum and areas for potential collaboration;
4.

identifying common courses for integrating IL; and

5.

establishing an assessment strategy with activities, ranging from direct,
indirect, formative, summative, qualitative, quantitative, and diagnostic
measures.

Brasley (2008) described effective models of collaboration (see Appendix B)
that range from informal to programmatic, but they share common features for IL
instruction. The Introduction model teaches freshmen basic or generic IL skills, while
the General Education model integrates IL outcomes into General Education goals.
The Learning Outcome model has librarians and teaching faculty collaborating to
create activities, assignments, and learning outcomes intended for the discipline-based
department. The Information Literacy Course model is designed to help students
acquire IL competencies through a credit course or tied to a discipline-based course,
while the Faculty Focus model emphasizes discipline faculty facilitating IL instruction
through faculty-librarian training. Finally, the On-Demand model, which is the
prevailing model in most libraries, results from faculty requests for IL instruction,
which can lead to improved assignments and learning outcomes over time.
Einfalt and Turley (2009a) described a collaborative model which promotes a
three-way interaction among teaching faculty, librarians, and skills advisors. The
model is based on overlapping aims in IL (research) offered by the librarian, and
academic literacy (academic skill support) supplied by the skill adviser. According to
Einfalt and Turley (2009a), academic literacy involves knowledge, concepts, and skills
that address study effectiveness and academic achievement. The focus is on the
learning process with language being a key building block of knowledge, and writing

44

being a way of learning, expressing, and thinking. Like IL, academic literacy is a
process-to-product approach with a genesis in constructivist learning theory.
Einfalt and Turley (2009b) explained the levels of a collaborative approach:
cooperation, collaboration, and team teaching among faculty, librarian, and skills
adviser. The authors content that interactions among the three participants involve
support sessions, consultation advice, sharing information, and providing feedback
within an institutional context. With students being central to this model, the goal is
to engage them in both research and skill development. The authors also believed this
model provided more potential for collaboration among all three participants. They
also called for an end to remedial generic skills classes. Finally, Einfalt and Turley
(2009b) feel their model yields a positive experience for first-year students by
redefining the support provided.
Assessment is an essential part of the collaborative process. With the
increased emphasis on accountability, there is a growing interest in developing
methods to measure students‘ learning (Burkhardt, MacDonald, & Rathemacher,
2005). Radcliff, Jensen, Salem, Burhanna, and Gedeon (2007) described three levels
of assessment to determine IL skill acquisition and retention. Classroom assessment,
which librarians are most likely to be involved with, provides more feedback
regarding student learning, but focuses on one class and is tied to course-related
outcomes. Programmatic assessment centers on learning outcomes for a specific
program or discipline, which may differ from institutional goals. Finally, institutional
assessment views students‘ skills as a whole, which may involve testing students
before they begin their first semester and during their last year (Radcliff et al., 2007).

45

Accrediting agencies like MSCHE look for evidence that IL skills are being integrated
into the curriculum.
Gandhi (2005) asserted that prior knowledge is needed to assess students‘ IL
knowledge and skills, and she advocated for using pre- and post-tests to verify that
learning had been successful. Burkhardt et al. (2005) believed that quantitative and
qualitative assessment provided a holistic approach to evaluate students‘ knowledge
and skills, as well as to determine the effectiveness of an IL instruction program. Both
approaches can assist librarians and teaching faculty in developing learning objectives,
which can define what students need to comprehend during the learning and research
process. The need for faculty-librarian collaboration is aptly summarized by Bruce
(2002) who simply stated, ―Information literacy education is not possible without
partnerships‖ (p. 13).
Summary of Scholarly Examination
Several important points materialized during the literature review that helped
address some of the key questions which guided this improvement plan. First, the
initial definition of IL, developed by the ALA in 1989, continues to be the basis for
subsequent definitions which have been developed during the intervening years.
Subsequent IL models have developed that are also grounded in the ALA‘s definition,
but take into account information-seeking behavior, diverse learning styles, and rapid
technological changes. Although criticisms continue over what constitutes IL, there
has been no real deviation from the ALA‘s initial definition. Additional critiques
contend that IL does not incorporate emerging technologies, lacks realistic objectives,
and is viewed by only librarians as a crucial skill. Regardless, IL, as outlined by the

46

ALA, is included as a measurable standard by most higher education accreditation
agencies.
Second, the literature review revealed that librarians are not aware of students‘
information-seeking behaviors, which have already been established during high
school. Regardless of whether they attend a 2- or 4-year institution, college students
establish their own research behaviors in high school and adjust those familiar habits
when they enter college. They are confident with their research skills, yet they have
little experience using scholarly resources and even less skill evaluating the accuracy
of sources. Primarily, students use the Internet and familiar search engines to retrieve
evidence that supports their predetermined perspectives. Most students are satisfied
with their research skills and never seek to improve them. Similarly, many students
exhibit a high level of confidence regarding their knowledge of technology, but they
cannot demonstrate such skills. Lastly, there are additional factors, such as time, prior
experience, educational goals, and everyday life, which strongly influence a student‘s
information-seeking behavior.
Finally, faculty-librarian collaborations are essential to reinforce IL skills, but
the literature implies these relationships are not widespread. Librarians are more
proactive in developing collaborative partnerships, and typically begin this process
through the single-session library instruction. However, the literature indicated mixed
results for single-session instruction, though it continues to be the most popular
method for teaching IL. Nevertheless, teaching faculty report receiving improved
assignments, with students incorporating quality sources because they are using library
resources more effectively, have less library anxiety, and show enhanced research
skills. The literature also described several collaborative models that have been

47

effective in establishing faculty-librarian collaborative relationships. These
partnerships, however, take an enormous amount of time and effort. Assessment is
often tied to faculty-librarian collaboration, with librarians designing library
instruction based on prior knowledge of students‘ research skills which can be used to
create common learning objectives.
The literature review examined IL definitions and standards used in higher
education as well as revealed the information-seeking behavior of community college
students. In addition, this scholarly examination provided evidence that facultylibrarian collaborations are essential for IL to be effective. The information gathered
from this section was incorporated into the methods used to examine IL at Cecil
College.

Chapter 3
EXAMINING INFORMATION LITERACY AT CECIL COLLEGE
This chapter examines Cecil College faculty perceptions of IL. Both
quantitative and qualitative data were collected. In the first phase, a survey was used
to record teaching faculty‘s knowledge of IL and document their opinions of students‘
IL skills. For the second phase, face-to-face interviews were conducted with several
full-time and part-time adjunct faculty to gain additional insight about IL at Cecil
College. The results, which will be reported and discussed in a subsequent section,
will be drawn upon to develop recommendations which will be reported in the next
chapter.
As previously stated, the goal of this improvement plan is to strengthen the
current IL program at Cecil College. The following questions have provided the
central focus for this improvement plan and guided this examination:
1.

How do Cecil College teaching faculty understand IL?

2.

In what ways are the teaching faculty incorporating IL knowledge and
skills into their courses?

3.

In what ways, if any, are the teaching faculty collaborating with
librarians to incorporate IL knowledge and skills into their courses?

4.

What collaborative efforts between teaching faculty and librarians are
documented in the scholarly literature and which collaborative efforts
have been successful?

49

Methodology and Data Collection
The Survey
A 23 question survey instrument was designed with questions adapted from
Public Opinion Laboratory (see Appendix C). Public Opinion Laboratory developed
the survey for Northern Illinois University (NIU) to collect information from teaching
faculty regarding IL integration into the classroom and their assessment of students‘
skills. The NIU survey was conducted from February 2005 through March 2005. The
results indicated that 59% of teaching faculty taught a course with at least one IL
component, 75% of teaching faculty designed assignments to develop information
gathering skills, 42% used graded assignments to assess students‘ IL skills, 41%
utilized research papers, and 68% indicated some interest in collaborating with the
University Libraries to develop IL components for their courses (Public Opinion
Laboratory, 2005).
The survey distributed to Cecil College teaching faculty was divided into three
sections (see Appendix D). The initial section comprised 11 questions which were
designed to ascertain faculty knowledge of IL, their ability to integrate IL components
into classroom, and collaboration efforts with librarians. Space was provided for
faculty to make additional comments if they so desired. The second section had nine
Likert-type items for faculty to rate their observations of students‘ IL skills. The scale
was comprised of four categories where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree,
and 4 = strongly agree. Again, space was provided for additional comments. The
third section had two questions to obtain demographic information regarding their
faculty status and their teaching experience. An additional question was added which

50

asked participants if they were willing to participate in a follow-up face-to-face
interview to discuss IL at Cecil College.
Prior to submitting the research protocol for review to the Instructional Review
Board (IRB) of the University of Delaware, the survey, follow-up interview questions,
and additional protocol materials were sent to Lorraine Martorana, Director of Library
Services at Cecil College, and Dr. C. Dan Stoicescu, Director of Institutional Research
at Cecil College, for review. The completed research protocol received IRB approval
in March 2011. Dr. Stoicescu and Dr. David Linthicum, Dean of Academic Programs
at Cecil College, were contacted soon after and notified that the survey could proceed.
Dr. Linthicum distributed the survey through e-mail to full-time and part-time adjunct
faculty.
The survey was sent electronically to 199 teaching faculty at Cecil College, 44
of whom were employed full-time, and 155 of whom were part-time adjunct faculty
(MHEC, 2012). Librarians and administrators were not included in the survey to only
collect teaching faculty perceptions of IL. However, librarians and administrators
were interviewed later on in the data gathering process. Data collection occurred
during a 32 day response period. Completed surveys were returned either via e-mail,
or were printed out and sent through campus mail. A total of 23 faculty responded to
the survey.
The decision to offer the survey to all 199 full-time teaching faculty and parttime adjunct faculty was made after calculating the sample size needed to produce
statistically significant results. With an error level of 4.5% and a finite population size
of 199, the sample size that was needed based on the confidence levels for achieving
the specified error level were near the overall population size (Table 3.1). According

51

to statistical researchers, determining the sample size is among the most complex tasks
researchers must undertake in order to ensure accuracy in the results reported and to
minimize false conclusions (Gorman & Clayton, 2005; Robson, 2000; Sapsford,
1999).

Note: Adapted from ―The adequacy of response rate to online and paper surveys: What can
be done?‖ by D. Nulty, 2008, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 33(3), p. 310.

With smaller populations, a larger percentage of the population needs to be
surveyed to achieve the same level of accuracy that would result from surveying a
smaller sample size from a larger population. Nulty (2008) contends that if the entire
population is surveyed, the purpose is to establish the views of the entire population.
Thus, in order to ascertain the knowledge and views teaching faculty have regarding
IL at Cecil College, the decision was made to survey the entire population. Because
the survey was delivered electronically via e-mail, there was no additional cost in
money or time incurred by sampling the entire population of teaching faculty.
Nulty (2008) performed research on the adequacy of response rates among
online and paper surveys. His research confirmed previous studies which concluded
that response rates to online surveys are much lower than those obtained when

52

utilizing the traditional paper surveys. He contended that it is disconcerting to accept
low response rates on any survey because the proportion of non-respondents may be
too high for the researcher to be sure that those who responded are representative of
those who did not respond. In addition, he asserted that it is reasonable to expect that
any survey that samples a population will have some sampling error and bias (Nulty,
2008).
Nevertheless, by utilizing the ―liberal conditions‖ established by Nulty (2008)
in relation to acceptable sampling error and established confidence levels, a lower
response rate is acceptable when sampling a small population. The problem, however,
is not the response rate to the survey, but that the survey results may suffer from
systematic bias which will affect any summative judgment regarding the sampled
population. With this in mind, if the total population is 200, the total response rate
required is 12%, and the required number of respondents needed is 23. This would be
under Nulty‘s liberal conditions with a 10% sampling error and an 80% confidence
level (Nulty, 2008). As stated previously, the return rate for the survey distributed to
Cecil College teaching faculty was 11.6%.
The analysis of the survey distributed at Cecil College focused on 12 survey
questions that produced the most relevant quantitative data. Specifically, survey
questions which addressed faculty knowledge of IL (Q1, Q2, & Q3), collaborating
with college librarians (Q4 & Q7) and assessing students‘ IL skills (Q11, Q14, Q16 &
Q19) were examined. The open-ended responses were also summarized and
categorized. A summary of the findings are presented later in this chapter.

53

The Interviews
Follow-up interviews were conducted with six individuals randomly selected
from survey participants who indicated they were willing to participate in a follow-up
interview. In addition, two librarians, and two administrators were also interviewed to
obtain their perspectives on IL at Cecil College. The main purpose of the follow-up
interviews was to gather additional information about teaching faculty‘s knowledge
and perceptions of IL. The interviews were also conducted to gain additional data
about Cecil College students‘ research skills and collaborative efforts with college
librarians.
Face-to-face interviews were conducted with those teaching faculty who
indicated they were willing to further discuss IL at Cecil College. Each interview
lasted approximately 45 minutes. An interview protocol was developed consisting of
an e-mail request for an interview, a consent form, an interview script, and interview
questions to ensure the interviewees were presented with uniformed queries (see
Appendix E). When appropriate, follow-up questions were also asked. The
interviews were recorded with the permission of the interviewees, and they were
assured that their identities would remain confidential. Each interviewee was also
reminded they were free to withdraw consent and discontinue the interview at any
time without penalty or prejudice. All interviews were conducted in a private room or
a private office at Cecil College.
The recorded interviews were transcribed immediately upon completion and
categorized into phrases and statements according to themes and categories. During
transcription, all identifiable information was stripped to protect the privacy of
participants. The information was stored in a password-protected Excel spreadsheet.

54

The data gathered during the interviews will be summarized and presented in the
findings.
Analyzing the Results
The following analysis is based on survey responses combined with results
from interviews conducted with teaching faculty at Cecil College. Comments
provided through the survey as well as during the interviews afforded a vital insight
into faculty perceptions, and both will be included as appropriate to explain the data.
As mentioned, there was some concern that the return rate of 11.6% was low
and the results would be deemed to be insufficient to yield reliable results. However,
when combined with comments from the interviews conducted with faculty, the
patterns and trends in the survey data combined with data obtained from the scholarly
literature, it was determined there was sufficient information to make informed
recommendations. It should be noted that by using traditional statistical research
methodology, 131 results were needed for the survey to achieve a 95% confidence
level with a 5% error level (Nulty, 2008; Sapsford, 1999).
The next section will present a descriptive analysis of the participants‘
familiarity with IL, and will examine their perceptions of Cecil College students‘ IL
knowledge and skills. In general, the teaching faculty at Cecil College hold a mixed
awareness of IL.

Defining Information Literacy
The majority of teaching faculty surveyed were able to define IL. They were
not provided with an IL definition, but were simply asked if they could define IL

55

based on their own knowledge and familiarity with the concept. Of those surveyed,
61% believed they could define IL, while 39% were not able to do so.
Immediately following the initial question, participants were provided with
several phrases and prompted to determine which statements they believed best
describe IL. The statements were based on the ACRL Standards, but were reworded
using conversational language. Additional options were provided if participants were
inclined to select all of the statements, none of the statements, or to identify their lack
of knowledge regarding IL.
The results confirmed that established IL definitions are not well known by
Cecil College faculty. Only five respondents (22%) identified all the statements as
indicative of IL. No individual indicated that none of the statements described IL or
that they had no knowledge of the concept. Surprisingly, no respondent selected the
first statement, ―Knowing what you need to know,‖ which corresponds to ACRL
Standard One, which is considered to be the first step taken by an information literate
individual.
Nevertheless, as indicated in Figure 3.1, Cecil College faculty selected three
statements to best describe IL. Being able to effectively and efficiently access or
―knowing where to find answers‖ was identified by 23% as best defining IL. The
ability to ―seek assistance‖ may have led some survey respondents to inadvertently
believe reference was being made to the library and its resources. In follow-up
interviews, several interviewees made comments which equated IL with library
research skills. One interviewee defined IL as ―…students being able to use library
resources and do research, but I do think it expands beyond that to be able to use the
Web to do the same kind of research.‖ An adjunct faculty spoke of having the

56

librarian come to their English 101 classes, but did not invite a librarian to their
English 102 classes because, ―I feel that [the students] have received library training
already, and if they have any questions, they can go ask at the library or they can ask
me.‖

Figure 3.1

Describing Information Literacy

57

In addition, the ability to evaluate the credibility and reliability of sources (see
Figure 3.1) was selected by 21% of respondents as best characterizing IL. In followup interviews, several teaching faculty believed this to be a crucial skill but admitted
their students were weak at evaluating the reliability, validity, and accuracy of the
information they retrieve and use in their research. Two interviewees mentioned
incorporating a unit on evaluating sources for their students. One adjunct faculty
stated, ―I show them how to evaluate sources, while the librarian is showing them
what sources to use.‖ The follow-up interviews revealed that some Cecil College
teaching faculty show their students more in-depth research and web evaluative skills
than those taught during library sessions.
Finally, using information ethically and legally, and avoiding plagiarism and
copyright violations was perceived by 23% of respondents to best describe IL (see
Figure 3.1). According to several interviewees, academic dishonesty and integrity are
parallel to IL knowledge and skills. Cecil College‘s academic dishonesty policy could
be used to define IL, according to one interviewee, while several others interviewed
understood IL to be already acknowledged in this policy. In several follow-up
interviews, a number of teaching faculty stressed the need to include plagiarism in any
definition of IL. One interviewee expressed frustration with students who
inadvertently plagiarize by throwing their hands up in the air and stating, ―It‘s about
getting them to understand… but they think they have a handle on it. They look at
you cross-eyed when I ask them where they got the sources, and they say online… but
where online!‖

58

Teaching Information Literacy at Cecil College
The majority of survey respondents (86%) believed that IL concepts, in some
form, are being taught at Cecil College, while 14% were not aware these concepts are
being taught on campus (see Figure 3.2). Approximately 24% of respondents are
teaching IL in their classrooms (see Figure 3.2). Participants were asked to identify
courses that included any IL components, and several identified English 101, nursing,
physical science, and business. However, as previously mentioned, the IL component
may take the form of a unit on evaluating resources or avoiding plagiarism. In
addition, librarians‘ efforts at teaching IL are noticed by only 38% of respondents (see
Figure 3.2). Two respondents, however, wrote some insightful comments. One
respondent was unaware that librarians could assist with integrating IL components
into the classroom, while the other wrote s/he did not realize librarians at community
colleges taught such skills.

Figure 3.2

Teaching Information Literacy Skills

59

During the 2011-2012 academic year, the Librarian for Instruction,
Information Technology, and Systems Administration conducted 41 instruction
sessions, with 533 student being taught IL skills (Veteran Memorial Library, n.d.).
However, almost two-thirds of faculty respondents reported never having discussed
the possibility of integrating IL components into their course curriculum with a
librarian. Only 35% of respondents reported having such discussions with college
librarians, contrary to recent national trends. The Primary Research Group (2009)
reported that 57% of faculty in the United States had IL integration discussions with
librarians. The data suggested that teaching faculty at smaller institutions were more
likely to have those conversations with librarians.
As Figure 3.3 illustrates, data gathered from the survey indicates that some
faculty (32%) are designing assignments to cultivate their students‘ information
gathering skills, or developing coursework to promote students‘ information
evaluative skills (19%). Although there is still a reliance on librarians to teach IL
skills (19%), the teaching faculty are comfortable providing lecture-type instruction
about research skills (17%).

60

Figure 3.3

Methods Used to Teach Information Literacy

A few teaching faculty (10%) used ―other methods‖ to teach IL, while only
four percent did not employ any method mentioned. No respondent, however,
provided examples of ―other methods‖ they are using in their classroom. Different
methods may be used by teaching faculty to teach IL at Cecil College, but there is no
indication students are learning these skills. The Primary Research Group (2009)
study also reported that teaching faculty at community colleges were incorporating IL
teaching in their classrooms in some form.
Few respondents (9%) believe they are solely responsible for teaching students
IL skills, while many (30%) consider the English faculty responsible for providing IL
instruction (see Figure 3.4). Among the faculty respondents, 22% believe librarians

61

should be responsible for teaching IL skills, while 13% believe individual discipline
departments should teach IL. Only 26% of respondents indicated that collaborative
teaching between faculty and librarians is the desired approach, although it was
mentioned in several follow-up interviews.
One interviewee voiced the opinion, ―I think we are all responsible, every
single teacher on campus is responsible…. But it has to be a joint venture between
librarians and faculty.‖ During another interview, one respondent captured the belief
that other interviewees had by saying, ―I think a collaborative environment would be
good for teaching, but I would favor it being part of the core curriculum, begun early
and immediately.‖

Figure 3.4

Responsibility for Teaching Information Literacy

Cecil College Students and Information Literacy
There is no comprehensive assessment tool used at Cecil College to measure
students‘ IL skills. Currently, librarians use the ―one-minute paper‖ assessment tool
(see Appendix F), which provides a quick, simple method to collect responses on
student learning after receiving the library‘s single-session instruction. Another
method to gauge students‘ skills is to gather data from teaching faculty observations.
The analysis of three questions pertaining to Cecil College students‘ IL skills
provides a glimpse of their abilities. Figure 3.5 shows that most respondents surveyed
believe students are able to locate and retrieve information needed to complete course
assignments (52%). This was substantiated by several comments during the follow-up

63

interviews, but several statements indicated that students only seek information to
support their initial opinions or hypotheses. Students are not seeking alternative
arguments or theories, and rarely include print sources or scholarly information that is
not current, according to those interviewed. This observation is supported by the
scholarly literature (Casper & Bernhisel, 2006; Head & Eisenberg, 2010; Seamans,
2002; Weiler, 2005). One interviewee disagreed that students were able to find
reliable information, and remarked that library resources were limited for their
students‘ needs. The interviewee admitted accessing other databases to provide
articles to students that were more relevant to their research topics.

Figure 3.5

Students Ability to Locate and Retrieve Information

Cecil College students may be capable of locating and retrieving information,
but they are not able to effectively evaluate the accuracy or validity of the information

64

they obtain (see Figure 3.6). This sentiment was echoed in several follow-up
interviews as well as the survey data. A few teaching faculty indicated they teach
source evaluation in their classrooms, but do not call on librarians to teach evaluation
skills. However, librarians often encounter students with assignments that refer to
sources no longer available at the library, or that have been replaced with more
appropriate resources, or that were never available. According to Cecil College
librarians, they also encounter students who are instructed to use an index to find
relevant sources, but are unfamiliar with or do not completely grasp the concept of an
index. In any event, 57% of those surveyed disagree with the premise that Cecil
College students are able to evaluate the credibility and validity of information.

Figure 3.6

Students Ability to Effectively Evaluate Information

65

Finally, the survey concluded by seeking an overall assessment of the IL skills
of Cecil College students (see Figure 3.7). Students‘ abilities were considered
sufficient by 39% of respondents, while 48% disagreed that students‘ skills were
sufficient.

Figure 3.7

Information Literacy Skills of Cecil College Students

Again, follow-up interviews provided vital insight into students‘ IL abilities.
Those interviewees who self-identified as English instructors believe students leave
their classes with some IL skill level, but they are not sure if those IL skills are
reinforced in other courses. According to one interviewee, ―[The students] are not
doing great, but they‘re working on it.‖ One respondent who strongly disagreed
wrote, ―Rarely do I have a successful final research paper. Information literacy and
critical literacy are too new to students and they need more practice.‖ It was clear

66

from written comments and follow-up interviews that students entering Cecil College
have low IL skills, but gain some skill level while they are enrolled. Whether the
students are information literate when they graduate is uncertain.

Findings
This study revealed contradictions regarding IL among the teaching faculty at
Cecil College, including their knowledge, teaching methods, and assessment of
students‘ abilities. Although the response rate was a concern, the data gathered from
follow-up interviews reinforced the survey results and supported similar findings
described in the study by Borelli et al. (2009) which found faculty are unable to teach
IL skills because they lack IL knowledge themselves. As mentioned in the literature
review, it is imperative that Cecil College understand the teaching faculty‘s
perceptions of IL before developing curricula and programs that include IL
instruction.
Three themes emerged from analyzing the survey results and studying the
follow-up interviews. First, there was no uniform definition of IL. The respondents
viewed IL differently, placing equal emphasis on the ability to find information and
the ability to cite sources. However, follow-up interviews revealed that the ability to
evaluate the credibility of sources was of great importance and was synonymous with
being information literate. This is consistent with the findings reported by Gullikson
(2006).
Second, a collaborative effort between faculty and librarians may be necessary
to ensure that the teaching of IL at Cecil College will be successful. Although a
majority of respondents believe the English faculty should be responsible for teaching

67

IL, they also feel librarians should be part of the collaborative process to teach
students IL skills. Various statements supporting librarian and faculty collaboration
were mentioned throughout the follow-up interviews with faculty, librarians, and
administrators. Librarians are viewed to be available to introduce students to library
resources and how to use them effectively, but they are not brought into the
classrooms to teach source evaluation or critical thinking skills. Furthermore,
librarians are not approached by faculty to discuss integrating IL into the classroom.
This is also consistent with results reported by Black et al. (2003), Mackey and
Jacobson (2004), and Reed et al. (2007). The survey results, along with several
remarks made during the follow-up interviews, indicate teaching faculty would be
receptive to such collaborative partnerships.
Finally, Cecil College students lack IL skills. Results from the survey indicate
that students had relatively little difficulty retrieving information, but students cannot
distinguish the credibility of sources they use for research. The survey results are
supported by the literature which reported that a majority of community college
students did not have adequate IL skills upon entering college (Gandhi, 2005; Groce,
2008; Karas & Green, 2007). Again, the follow-up interviews confirmed these
assertions. Students‘ IL abilities upon entering Cecil College are low or inadequate.
Information literacy skills are primarily taught to students during English composition
courses (ENG 101), which may include a library instruction session, with
reinforcement in subsequent classes (ENG 102) if a student is required to take the
class. It is unclear, however, if those skills and abilities are continually emphasized in
other courses and disciplines. Therefore, students may not be graduating from Cecil
College possessing IL skills.

68

Interview Highlights
For this study, survey data was supplemented by interviews with a number of
Cecil College faculty, librarians, and administrators. A question at the end of the
survey asked respondents if they were willing to participate in a follow-up interview
and eleven respondents indicated their willingness to participate. Six were randomly
selected and contacted to schedule a follow-up interview. The interviews were
structured to elicit qualitative data to supplement the survey results. The interviewees
were also provided with an opportunity to have a candid discussions regarding IL.
Librarians and administrators were also interviewed to seek their knowledge of IL and
their input on possible recommendations for establishing an IL program at Cecil
College. To ensure the interviewees‘ anonymity, pseudonyms were created for each
participant.

Selected Interviews
Although Cecil College librarians and administrators were interviewed, the
interviews conducted with several teaching faculty provided more in-depth comments
and perceptions on IL and students‘ abilities. The primary purpose for these
interviews was to gather additional information to supplement the survey results.
Each participant has been provided with a pseudonym to protect their identities and
assure confidentiality. A summary of selected interviews follows.
Chris. Chris is a full-time professor in the Department of English who has
been working for Cecil College for more than five years. She currently teaches
sections of ENG 101 and ENG 102. Chris believes that students do not understand
that IL is a process, and she believes this is common among most students. According

69

to Chris, ―Students don‘t equate [IL] to their own process since it doesn‘t affect their
life… They only see research as an academic process and don‘t see its application in
real life.‖ In addition, Chris discussed the difficulty she encounters while trying to
convince students that research skills and IL skills are transferable to their personal
lives and future careers.
With regard to teaching IL skills, Chris believes it should be integrated
throughout the entire curriculum, especially collaborative efforts between librarians
and teaching faculty. However, she does understand why teaching these skills fall to
the English department, because IL accompanies teaching critical thinking and
analytical skills. According to Chris, ―The problem is that all the other disciplines
tend to say, ‗That‘s the English department‘s job to bring in the library.‘‖ But Chris
also believes the students are missing out on reinforcement of their IL skills being
reinforced.
Fran. Fran is a part-time adjunct instructor working with the Department of
English. She has been working for Cecil College for less than five years, and she
teaches ENG 101and ENG 102. Fran feels her students are acquiring IL skills in her
classes, but is concerned they are not learning them in other classes. She teaches first
or second year students who either have difficulty conducting research, evaluating and
citing sources, or writing critically. However, they are learning ―step by step‖ she
states with a smile. ―The students are supposed to have these skills when they enter
Cecil, but I know they don‘t have them coming in and I question how much they leave
with.‖
Fran believes IL should be stressed as an interdisciplinary skill at Cecil
College and not identified or associated with only one department. For Fran,

70

developing a separate IL class might be a solution because she believes there is an
overwhelming amount of material to cover in both introductory English courses. ―A
separate class completely focused on IL would be ideal, because, right now, it‘s
competing with [the] writing and analytical skills we‘re trying to teach them.‖ She
also believes the library is essential for teaching IL, but does not believe the library
should be held solely responsible for educating the students or faculty.
Pat. Pat is a part-time adjunct instructor also working for the Department of
English. She has been working at Cecil College for more than five years, and she also
teaches ENG 101 and ENG 102. Pat defines IL as the ability to understand how to
conduct research. However, she believes that students need help developing topics to
better comprehend the resources they need as well as the types of sources they need.
Pat believes she is accountable for teaching IL as an English instructor. She states, ―I
hold myself responsible for giving [students] direction and teaching what IL is. It‘s
just knowledge in a different way.‖ She also feels every instructor on campus is
responsible for teaching IL, including librarians and administrators, especially because
they set campus policy.
Pat believes all academic disciplines need to instruct students on the
differences between scholarly and non-scholarly information within the context of
new technology, the Internet, and social media. More importantly, she feels strongly
about teaching students how to distinguish between facts and opinions, which she
believes baffles students. In her classes, Pat demonstrates to her students how facts,
even though based on research, can be used to skew arguments to support a writer‘s
position. In addition, she contends that teaching faculty need to understand IL better

71

so they can teach their students and ―take it step-by-step, so they students understand it
better and know how to evaluate [information] better.‖
Tom. Tom is a part-time instructor in the Social Science Department. He has
been with the department for less than five years. He has taught at other community
colleges and at four-year institutions. For Tom, technology has changed how his
students conduct research and he spends class time informing students how to use the
Internet and the library databases to find articles that are scholarly or peer-reviewed.
Tom said:
I know English is doing some teaching and you hope some of it resonates with
the students and hope they can apply it later in your class, but, other than that,
you don‘t get to spend a lot of time discussing [research].
Tom indicated has not had many conversations with colleagues about teaching
IL, but he was certain that research skills are being taught throughout campus. He
could not support his assertion, however.
Tom was also steadfast that single-session library instruction was not very
effective for teaching IL skills, and works best in conjunction with other courses. He
discusses IL skills with his students because there is an overabundance of information
for the students to absorb in one sitting, and students miss other valuable information
if they are absent during those library sessions. Tom states, ―My method is to teach,
model, have [the students] practice, and then reflect about what kind of information
they retrieved. I even do some reflection at the end of the semester to see what
worked and what didn‘t.‖ Furthermore, he feels students have a handle on IL skills,
but these abilities can be easily lost if not reinforced in other courses. For Tom, this
was definitely a concern.

72

Additional Comments
During the follow-up interviews, the interviewees also discussed various topics
that the survey was not able to capture. For instance, several interviewees, including
librarians and faculty, felt administrators lacked an understanding of IL, but ―proceed
as if they do.‖ They also contend that IL has not been a priority at Cecil College,
possibly due to the various transitions that have occurred within the library, among the
faculty, and at administrative level, which have resulted in IL being forgotten or put
on the backburner. In addition, several interviewees blamed budget reductions as a
possible reason an IL program has not been developed at Cecil College. One
interviewee suggested abandoning the whole IL definition and establishing a ―building
block‖ strategy for conducting research, with the student being able to construct a
research structure depending on any topic. A ―building block‖ strategy might exist for
conducting business research or might exist for researching statistics or might exist for
seeking data on petrochemicals, all leading to ―building‖ a research structure/strategy.
The follow-up interviews also provided insight into current trends at
community colleges. Several interviewees mentioned developing learning
communities in which an instructor would teach a specific subject, an English
instructor would teach students proper writing techniques and style, and a librarian
would teach research methods and skills. This approach might provide a more
comprehensive strategy for incorporating IL throughout the curriculum, but several
interviewees felt some instructors would be hesitant about yielding class time to either
English faculty or a librarian

74

Overall, the themes that were detected in the interviews were consistent with
what was stated in the literature. There were, however, slight inconsistencies. The
teaching faculty differed on whether students arrived at Cecil College with adequate
IL skills. While several felt they did not, a few believed students did arrive with some
IL skills, but they were lost because these skills were not reinforced in courses outside
the English department.
Another theme that had conflicting reactions was teaching faculty awareness of
IL. There was no consistent belief that teaching faculty lacked understanding of IL
concepts, but there was some disparity regarding their level of understanding. Several
interviewees felt that teaching faculty could teach students IL skills if they had a better
understanding. They also felt this would alleviate the English faculty and librarians
from having sole responsibility for IL instruction at Cecil College.
With regard to library instruction, a few teaching faculty stated that it was not
effective for their students. They felt there was too much information given for
students to absorb and the students sometimes had no context to attach any
significance to learning about IL. Most agreed this was not the fault of the librarians,
but the inability of students to see IL as an essential skill. In general, the interviewees
had positive comments regarding library services or their interactions with library
staff.
Integrating IL into the curriculum was another common theme that surfaced
during the interviews. Several teaching faculty believed this would benefit students
because IL skills could be reinforced by having the students practice these skills in
multiple courses or in various disciplines. While a few mentioned that IL skills could
be connected to student learning by using a scaffold approach or creating ―building

75

blocks,‖ a few interviewees discussed creating learning communities to encourage
student learning. They believed this approach would be more beneficial because
students would receive content from discipline faculty, while English faculty would
reinforce critical/analytical writing skills and the librarians would provide advanced
research skills. However, most interviewees felt teaching faculty would be reluctant
to relinquish classroom time for IL instruction or collaborating with faculty outside
their discipline.
Another common sentiment articulated throughout the interviews centered on
IL not being viewed as a priority at Cecil College. Many felt the college
administration did not understand IL in terms of student learning or attributed budget
reductions for IL declining as a priority. However, the administrators that were
interviewed indicated IL was a significant concern at Cecil College.
Two major themes were consistent throughout the interviews. The first was
that all of the interviewees agreed that IL skills were not being reinforced and
practiced in the courses taught at Cecil College. Several acknowledged teaching or
practicing IL in their classes, but they believed it was not consistently done across
campus. No interviewee could confidently name an instructor or course where IL is
being reinforced besides their own. The second major theme addressed the inability of
students to view IL as essential skills that are transferable to everyday life. It was
apparent that several interviewees were frustrated. The consensus was that students do
not see the need for IL/research skills outside college or, more importantly, in the
workplace.
Unexpectedly, neither learning outcomes nor assessment were mentioned
during these follow-up interviews. Several interviewees mentioned course-centered

76

assessment, such as research papers, bibliographies, or quality sources as their guide
for measuring students‘ IL abilities.
Finally, it was clear that the interviewees were enthusiastic about education.
They all felt equally responsible for teaching students to become information literate,
but they were frustrated about not being able to convince students of the importance of
IL. One interviewee, Chris, had a unique insight into this predicament: ―If we don‘t
use the word knowledge and explain how it relates to them, then I think we risk the
students being overwhelmed by the information. Information needs to be equated to
knowledge…‖

77

Chapter 4
RECOMMENDATIONS
This executive position paper now presents recommendations for strengthening
the current IL instruction program at Cecil College based on data gathered from the
literature review, survey results, and interviews with teaching faculty, librarians and
administrators. The recommendations are intended to assist Cecil College in
enhancing its current instruction program to produce students who are information
literate, critical thinkers, and lifelong learners.
As detailed in previous chapters, there is a perception among the teaching
faculty that Cecil College students lack adequate IL skills. Currently, IL skills are
taught to students during English composition courses, but it is uncertain if those skills
are reinforced or emphasized in other coursework or if the students are information
literate when they graduate from Cecil College.
This study has focused on improving the IL abilities of Cecil College students
as well as increasing faculty-librarian collaboration and enhancing the teaching
faculty‘s knowledge of IL.
Cecil College Information Literacy Model
I developed a pyramid diagram to represent the six stages I have recommended
for strengthening IL instruction at Cecil College. The Cecil College Information
Literacy Model (see Figure 4.1) begins with a definition of IL unique to Cecil College,
followed by establishing measurable outcomes, conducting library instruction and

78

course intervention, increasing faculty-librarian collaboration, organizing learning
communities, and adopting instruments to measure student learning.

Figure 4.1

Cecil College Information Literacy Model
Recommendations

Define Information Literacy
First, a definition of IL needs to be developed which reflects the needs of the
college and its students. Several IL definitions require individuals to ―recognize when
information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
needed information‖ (ACRL, 2000). These definitions can be used as the basis for
initial IL discussions among faculty, librarians, and administrators. The importance of
critical thinking needs to be added to an IL definition for Cecil College to ensure

79

information literate individuals are proficient in the abilities to critically reflect upon
and evaluate their own research, the sources used, the information retrieved, and the
end product produced. Critical thinking skills must also be included to meet the
requirements for English composition courses. Computer or technology literacies,
which have their own distinctive abilities and skills, should not be included, but rather
aligned with any IL definition for Cecil College.
As indicated by the survey results, the teaching faculty had a divergent concept
of IL. The respondents placed significant importance on effectively and efficiently
locating information, which conforms to ACRL Standard 2. They also placed nearly
equal importance on students‘ ability to evaluate credible sources, which corresponds
to ACRL Standard 3. ACRL Standards 1 and 4 were not considered part of their view
of IL. However, several respondents defined IL in terms of avoiding plagiarism.
One theme that emerged from the follow-up interviews was the need for
teaching faculty to have a better understanding of IL in order to reinforce these skills
across the curriculum. It is evident that teaching faculty lacked a clear understanding
of IL as defined by defined by ACRL which continues to be the basis of many IL
instruction programs in higher education, including Cecil College.
As discussed in the literature, it is vital for teaching faculty to be involved in
discussions aimed at establishing an IL definition (Gullikson, 2006). Not only will
this ensure teaching faculty support for a campus-wide definition, but they will also
view IL in terms of developing critical thinking abilities, teaching evaluative skills,
and discussing plagiarism. Administrative cooperation at Cecil College is also
essential for a campus-wide definition, and subsequent initiative, to gain support and
become fully established. However, as indicated by the follow-up interviews, IL is
not perceived to be a priority at Cecil College. Nevertheless, librarians must have a
role in determining a new IL definition as they are the experts on the subject, and can
lead discussions on the latest trends and best practices that have been successful at
other community colleges. By including input from faculty, librarians, and

80

administrators, the local needs of the college and students will be addressed and the
foundation will be set for an IL plan.
A campus-wide committee established by either the Faculty Senate or
appointed by the Vice President for Academic Programs would be the appropriate
vehicle for establishing a standardized definition of IL. For instance, a student might
have to demonstrate the following abilities to be considered information literate at
Cecil College:
1.

define and construct appropriate research questions and identify the
information needed;

2.

demonstrate effective search strategies;

3.

identify appropriate resources based on the scope, nature and intent of
information needed;

4.

locate resources from either an digital, online or physical environment;

5.

extract information from appropriate print, online or multimedia
resources;

6.

critically evaluate information using multiple and appropriate criteria
for a variety of formats;

7.

comprehend the organization of information and the research process;

8.

understand issues regarding intellectual property and copyright;

9.

cite sources in an acceptable format; and

10.

possess the knowledge to support lifelong learning (ACRL, 2000;
Bruce 1999; Bruce, 2002; Catts & Lau, 2008; Eisenberg, 2008;
Grafstein, 2007; Sharkey, 2006).

A final IL definition for Cecil College that has been agreed upon by all
constituents could be used by academic departments, deans, chairs, and teaching
faculty to formulate the benchmarks and strategies need to ensure the students are
becoming information literate. In fact, Cecil College can examine Delaware County

81

Community College (2004) and Chesapeake College (2013) as examples of IL being
locally defined.
Cecil College may further wish to prioritize these conditions based on data
collected from the survey and literature review to facilitate the understanding of IL by
the teaching faculty according to the following grouping: Group 1 (Condition 1, 4, 6,
9); Group 2 (Condition 2, 3, 5, and 8); and Group 3 (Condition 7 and 8). Group 1
could be implemented initially, followed by Group 2 and Group 3. This would
correspond with existing beliefs that teaching faculty currently have regarding IL.
Develop Outcomes
Second, Cecil College needs to establish and develop measurable learning
outcomes that can be utilized to report on the impact of IL instruction on Cecil College
students. Learning outcomes can be designed to provide direction for IL instruction
and the methods to build a student‘s IL skills and abilities. Furthermore, they can
provide a progressive structure to build a student‘s research competency and critical
thinking skills. As indicated by the survey results, teaching faculty felt Cecil College
students lacked IL skills, especially the ability to evaluate credible sources to use in
their research. The follow-up interviews confirmed this view of Cecil College
students. Additionally, the feeling that IL skills learned at the freshman level are not
reinforced or practiced throughout the curriculum was a recurring theme also
identified in the follow-up interviews. Developing learning outcomes could reverse
this situation.
More specifically, the outcomes can support the strategic goals of the
institution and be aligned with the initiatives discussed in the Cecil College Strategic
Plan 2010-2015 (2010b), which includes a strong emphasis on student completion. In

82

addition, these outcomes can be developed to reflect the recommendations formulated
for Cecil College by MSCHE, such as implementing other qualitative methods for
assessing student achievement of learning outcomes. They must, however, be adopted
by academic departments with clear and consistent student learning outcomes defined
at the program and course levels (Cecil College, 2010b).
These measurable outcomes need to de designed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the IL instruction on student learning and eventually provide
measurable data for improvement. More importantly, the results from measurable
outcomes can be used by Cecil College administrators, teaching faculty, and librarians
for determining priorities with regard to instruction, training, resources, and success.
The results can also be used to communicate the benefits of IL. The aim must be to
develop appropriate measurable outcomes that can later be assessed.
The learning outcomes must clearly describe the goals and measurable
objectives that Cecil College students are expected to learn. Cecil College can look at
the New Jersey Institute of Technology‘s Institute Information Literacy Plan
(Information Literacy Subcommittee, 2009) or the Hoover Library Information
Literacy Plan (Stricklett & Jones, 2011) for examples of clearly defined learning
outcomes. Both institutions have enumerated and defined IL outcomes with detailed
descriptions and objectives that are easily understood by students, teaching faculty,
and librarians.
Hoover Library has developed graduated learning outcomes that are based on a
sequence of library research and IL skills that further expand the basic concepts
presented at the freshman level and conclude during the senior seminar or capstone
course. The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has defined eight IL outcomes

83

and embedded them in the required courses for each major and academic department.
The overall goals of these two IL plans are based on introducing IL at the freshman
level and introducing more complex research and library skills, such as advanced
search strategies, higher resource evaluation, and more sophisticated critical thinking,
as students advance through the curriculum. Upon developing outcomes, they must
align with course objectives, department goals, and institutional priorities (Radcliff,
2007). The outcomes must also be measureable so that they can be assessed.
Academic departments will need to develop their specific learning outcomes, with
faculty and librarians collaborating to establish these outcomes. Curriculum mapping
can be used to determine the appropriate placement of IL within a subject discipline
curriculum and can be used to establish discipline-specific learning outcomes
(Brasley, 2008; Eisenberg, 2008; Hopkins & Julian, 2008). This method ensures a
strong faculty commitment that the outcomes are learned in the classroom, especially
since the academic departments can play a key factor for motivating student success
(Rockman, 2004). As a result, the Hoover Library and NJIT IL plans emphasized the
importance of collaboration between various academic and administrative units for
successful integration of IL and identified key stakeholders by stating their
responsibilities at the library, academic, and institutional levels.
Library Instruction and Intervention
Third, Library Services, which includes the Veterans Memorial Library,
librarians and library staff, need to move away from traditional library services and
focus more on IL instruction as suggested in the literature (Eisenberg & Head, 2010).
Currently, the library‘s mission is to support teaching and learning at Cecil College.
Library Services needs to focus more on becoming an environment that fosters

84

creativity, discovery, critical thinking, and instruction (Bruce, 2002). Not only will
this be consistent with the move to a campus-wide IL program, but it will also
promote the institution goals for student success.
The library needs to promote IL to faculty, students, and the community as a
core competency for lifelong learning. The survey results revealed that several
respondents were either unaware librarians could assist with integrating IL
components into their classroom or did not realize librarians were capable of teaching
IL skills. In addition, two-thirds of the respondents reported never having discussed
integrating IL elements with a librarian at Cecil College. It is evident that librarians
are not viewed as instructors by teaching faculty.
To reverse this trend, librarians at Cecil College need to become more visible
as teaching librarians. This could be accomplished by involvement in developing
measurable learning outcomes to foster a strong campus-wide consensus. In addition,
the librarians will have to work collaboratively with faculty to integrate IL
components into course curricula and academic departments‘ learning outcomes.
Accomplishing this will require faculty-focused initiatives, such as workshops,
conference sessions, online webcasts, or professional readings to embed IL concepts
into their classes and assignments (Black et al., 2003).
As previously mentioned, the librarians can recommend and advise academic
departments and administrators regarding successful strategies and best practices for
implementing IL that have been incorporated successfully at other community
colleges. Further information on developing campus-wide IL programs can be
obtained from two ACRL documents: Characteristics of Programs of Information

85

Literacy that Illustrate Best Practices (2012) and Guidelines for Instruction Programs
in Academic Libraries (2011).
Nonetheless, Library Services needs to concentrate their efforts on IL
instruction. The findings from the survey indicated that several teaching faculty are
designing assignments to foster students‘ IL skills or nurturing students‘ evaluative
skills. However, there is still a reliance on librarians to teach IL using the singlesession instruction model. Unfortunately, the literature reported single-session
instruction demonstrates research skills without any real connection to the curriculum
or course materials, providing a vast amount of IL content which students often fail to
retain (Kapitzke, 2003; Marcum, 2002; Sunders, 2007). The follow-up interviews
corroborated this assertion. During these interviews, some participants felt their
students were overwhelmed by the information presented during the single-session
instruction. In addition, the single-session also does not account for students‘ various
learning styles or experiences. Therefore, the library should begin moving away from
single-session instruction and concentrate on library sessions that enhance students‘
research skills.
Sessions focused on IL could also be given to teaching faculty, who in turn
could better instruct their students and reinforce these research skills. A number of
participants in the follow-up interviews believed this could help to reinforce IL skills
beyond the single-session instruction, but only if the teaching faculty had a solid
understanding of IL. This could be accomplished by developing IL workshops
designed specifically for teaching faculty. The scholarly literature discusses students
being more receptive to IL instruction if there is a connection made with course
assignments and eventually course grades (Maybee, 2006; Weiler, 2005; Seamans,

86

2002). Librarians need to add various active learning components, such as financial,
medical, personal, or workplace so students can learn to apply or connect IL skills to
the students‘ everyday life information-seeking behavior outside the academic
environment (Given, 2002).
Library Services could also develop student-centered workshops or ―labs‖ or
mini-instruction sessions that engage students in developing their IL skills (Gandhi,
2004). These sessions could be designed around various topics, such as examining a
particular database, searching the Web more efficiently, discussing citation styles, or
providing hands-on research experience. Librarians must also develop or adopt selfpaced online tutorials, Blackboard modules, or streaming video seminar that focus on
IL skills for students, which is consistent with the ―retention strategies‖ stated in the
college‘s Strategic Enrollment Management Plan 2013-2015 (Cecil College,2013).
However, there are several customizable online tutorials that Library Services could
utilize at no cost. These include TILT (Texas Information Literacy Tutorial) from the
University of Texas, OASIS (Online Advancement of Student Information Skills)
from San Francisco State University, and Go for the Gold from James Madison
University (Lawrence, 2007). Libraries have utilized these tutorials entirely or
adopted partial content to accommodate their individual needs.
Currently, the library provides online guides to assist students‘ research and
affords another mechanism to promote IL. Working collaboratively with full-time
teaching faculty and part-time adjunct faculty, the librarians could develop more
effective library and research-based assessment tools to measure learning outcomes.
In addition, Library Services could partner with Cecil County Public School high

87

school teachers to offer basic IL workshops or in-service training to enhance their
knowledge of IL and improve their students‘ college readiness.
The role of the current instruction librarian (Librarian for Instruction,
Information Technology, and Systems Administration) may need to be restructured to
focus on instructional design. A librarian with instructional design experience or
responsibilities could work closely with teaching faculty and technology staff to
promote information and technology literacies. In addition, an additional instruction
librarian may need to be recruited to handle any increase in library instruction. At this
point, however, recruiting an additional librarian is not a priority.
Finally, Library Services may need to be placed under Academic Programs and
report to the Dean of Academic Programs to better align library services with an
academic and instruction focus. Currently, Library Services is under Student Services
and Institutional Effectiveness, which includes admissions, athletics, financial aid, and
registration, and reports to the Vice President of Student Services and Institutional
Effectiveness. Reporting directly to the Dean of Academic Programs would afford
Library Services parallel relationships with the academic departments, along with their
faculty, to solidify collaborative relationships and develop new ones.
Faculty-Librarian Collaborations
Fourth, collaborative partnerships need to increase between librarians and
teaching faculty. These efforts are crucial and will benefit students‘ learning in
addition to being advantageous to both teaching faculty and librarians. Facultylibrarian collaboration promotes curricula that fosters IL and embeds these concepts
into courses and assignments. In addition, collaboration between these two groups

88

will increase librarians‘ connections with students and lead to improved IL knowledge
across campus.
As reported previously, the survey results revealed a lack of collaboration
between teaching faculty and librarians, with several respondents reporting that they
never discussed integrating IL elements with a librarian. Moreover, any collaborative
effort between teaching faculty and librarians was limited and was usually done
through single-session instruction. As indicated by the follow-up interviews,
librarians are brought to the classroom to introduce students to library resources and
how to effectively use them, but are not involved in teaching effective source
evaluation methods. Ironically, several interviewees believed librarians should be part
of the collaborative process.
By working collaboratively with librarians and their IL knowledge and
expertise, it will be easier for teaching faculty to integrate IL components into their
courses. Librarians can also provide instructional design assistance to teaching faculty
who may be reluctant to integrate IL into their classrooms. As previously reported,
one theme that emerged during the follow-up interviews was integrating IL into the
curriculum to assist in reinforcing IL skills among students. In addition, collaboration
can also take the form of librarians providing assistance in assessing students‘
progress toward becoming information literate. Developing collaborative partnerships
will display the pragmatic and potential contributions librarians can make to the
teaching and learning process.
For instance, librarians can assume a more active role with teaching faculty to
design assignments that encourage IL. Many researchers have reported that some
teaching faculty notice their students are producing better quality assignments and

89

research papers (Hsieh & Holden, 2010; Karas & Green, 2007; Weiler, 2005) after
collaborating with librarians. Some teaching faculty have also reported spending less
time advising students on the research process and focusing more on teaching critical
thinking skills or content-specific material (Borelli et al., 2009; Gandhi, 2005). In
some cases, students view librarians as collaborators in the research process, designing
strategies for obtaining information and provide advice on managing the results
obtained (Donhan & Green, 2004; Einfalt & Turley, 2009a, Reed et al., 2007).
Nevertheless, librarians‘ confidence in designing learning activities would increase as
they continue to collaborate with faculty to foster student-centered learning (Badke,
2005; Brasley, 2008).
More importantly, faculty-librarian collaboration needs to develop to ensure IL
concepts are reinforced in the classroom through the use of active learning
assignments or by creating active learning environments (Gandhi, 2005). Proactive
collaboration between teaching faculty and librarians can be as basic as simply
engaging in regular communication to ensure that appropriate library resources are
available for students‘ assignment and research needs (Black et al., 2003). In addition,
MSCHE‘s accreditation standards strongly encourage faculty-librarian collaborations,
as well as assessing these partnerships using measurable outcomes (MSCHE, 2006;
Saunders, 2007). With Cecil College slated to undergo accreditation in 2015, facultylibrarians collaboration can become the catalyst for strengthening IL instruction
campus-wide. The collective expertise of teaching faculty and librarians can enhance
student learning by collaborating to strengthen IL concepts and skills and make them
transferable beyond the academic environment (Brasley, 2008; Donham & Green,
2004; Gandhi, 2004).

90

Initially, faculty-librarian collaboration must begin with the English
composition courses which are required for all Cecil College students (Hopkins &
Julian, 2008). Several English faculty interviewees confirmed this is the preferred
method for introducing students to IL. The course (ENG 101) is designed to teach
students writing and critical thinking skills, with some IL skills. Librarians can
collaborate with the teaching faculty to develop library sessions in accordance with
course objectives, as well as design active learning exercises that align with students‘
assignments. At the conclusion of the course, the students would have a basic
understanding of IL to build upon in other courses and comprehend the role of the
library in their research. This could be accomplished through a number of assessment
instruments, including administering pre- and post-tests immediately before and after a
library session.
In addition, faculty-librarian collaborations could lead to more than one library
session during an ENG 101 course. As several interviewees confirmed, the common
practice is to bring in a librarian only to teach ―library skills.‖ Nevertheless, an initial
session could instruct students with basic IL skills, with the secondary session
focusing on evaluating retrieved information and appropriate citation techniques. The
collaborative process would be similar for subject-specific courses, but tailored to
meet the learning outcomes, assignments, and instructional needs of the specific
course. The library sessions would also be a faculty-librarian collaborative effort to
teach students appropriate research strategies for the students‘ level of knowledge and
expertise.
Faculty-librarian collaboration can also involve teaching faculty in the
development of the library‘s print and electronic collection. This interaction can result

91

in keener faculty awareness of library resources and better communication with
librarians, leading to stronger collaborative partnerships. In addition, professional
development programs could be developed to familiarize teaching faculty and
librarians with emerging technologies and current trends in undergraduate education
(Black et al., 2001; Donham & Green, 2004) By collaborating teaching faculty and
librarians can forge alliances to engage in and influence the decision-making process
(Badke, 2005; Black et al., 2001; Brasley, 2008).
Collaborative efforts must also involve college administrators. Establishing
faculty-librarian-administrator collaboration would help secure financial resources to
sustain any IL initiative. This would reverse the current belief that administrators do
not understand the importance of IL as discussed in several follow-up interviews. As
a possible result, this partnership could help obtain vital support from academic
departments, departmental chairs, and department faculty to ensure the success of IL
on campus.
Finally, Cecil College can seek to establish an alternative collaborative
environment by adopting a three-way collaborative model (see Figure 4.2) developed
by Einfalt and Turley (2009a), which places students at the center, supported by
faculty, librarians, and skills advisers. The interaction among the three participants
involves support sessions, consultation guidance, sharing information, and providing
essential feedback within the institutional environment (Einfalt & Turley, 2009a). The
model aims to provide a better learning experience for students by redefining the
support provided to them.

92

Einfalt and Turley Model. Adapted from ―Engaging first year students in
skill development: A three-way collaborative model in action,‖ by J.
Einfalt and J. Turley, 2009, Journal of Academic Language and
Learning, 3(2), p. A-107.

Students entering Cecil College may not possess the advanced technological
skills needed to succeed academically. To help them gain these skills, a modified
version of the Einfalt and Turley (2009a) model would replace the skill adviser with
an information technology (IT) staff member as part of the collaborative process (see
Figure 4.3). Information technology staff would join teaching faculty and librarians to
enhance students‘ success. IT staff could offer students technological advice, share
technology information, and provide technical support outside the classroom, while
providing similar support to teaching faculty and librarians within the classrooms.

93

Faculty-Librarian-IT Collaboration Model. Adapted from ―Developing a
three-way collaborative model to promote first year student engagement
and skill support,‖ by J. Einfalt and J. Turley, 2009, E-Journal of
Business Education & Scholarship of Teaching,3(2), p. 44.

A faculty-librarian-IT collaboration may necessitate additional funding,
resources, and staffing. This alternative collaborative relationship, however, could be
beneficial to strengthening IL instruction and ensuring student are information literate.

Learning Communities
Fifth, collaboration across the curriculum can lead to the development of
learning communities at Cecil College. Learning communities engage in cross-subject
learning and change the manner in which students experience learning (Tinto, 2003;
Warren, 2006). Jacobson (2005) has described learning communities to be a
collection of courses that are linked together by overarching themes and are taught by

94

teams of interdisciplinary instructors to cohorts of students. He further believes that
community colleges are ideal for the development of team learning networks that
bring instructors together for structured peer-learning and improved partnerships
across organizations. Collaboration is fundamental to successful learning
communities, with students working collaboratively with other students, teaching
faculty, IT personnel, and librarians.
During the follow-up interviews, a few participants mentioned establishing
learning communities as the possible solution to IL skills not being reinforced or
practiced across the curriculum. The concept of learning communities was rarely
mentioned in the literature, but several interviewees acknowledged they were aware of
the concept being implemented at other community colleges.
Learning communities at Cecil College would require the need to develop new
competencies for each learning community which could relate to learning outcomes
associated with IL. Developing learning communities at Cecil College would also
make it possible to integrate academic courses, occupational skills, and IL content. At
Cecil College, learning communities may develop within each academic discipline.
Within these learning communities, discipline faculty would supply the subject
content while an English instructor would provide the technical writing elements.
English instructors could modify the course content to instruct students to write for a
specific academic discipline.
In addition, the English instructor and librarians would provide instruction on
subject-specific resources, developing techniques to evaluate sources, and appropriate
citation methods. Information literacy concepts and critical thinking skills could be
reinforced by including English instructors and librarians in these learning

95

communities. Furthermore, learning communities could also be formulated for the
specific needs of student sub-groups, such as developmental clusters or returning
students (Jacobson, 2005).
In addition, learning communities could be useful at integrating students into
the academic and social life of Cecil College, regardless of whether they are first-year,
first-generation, or returning students. These learning communities could also lead to
increased retention rates among these groups, which remain a strategic objective for
the college (Cecil College, 2013). The Community College of Baltimore County
(CCBC) has been successful in establishing learning communities and reported
students being more engaged and successful learners (Community College of
Baltimore County, 2007). Learning communities become especially beneficial for
community college students who do not have residence halls for community-building,
who frequently take classes part-time, or who have life demands outside of the
institution. Furthermore, increased professional development, improved classroom
techniques, and shared knowledge have been reported as results from learning
communities (Jacobson, 2005). CCBC (2007) also reported similar results from the
connections formed between students and faculty. These connections have benefited
the students in attaining CCBC‘s general education goals, which include the
development of IL skills. Moreover, learning communities, as described by Jacobson
(2005), have also led to new peer-learning opportunities and improvements to existing
programs that connect secondary schools, colleges, businesses, and community
organizations.
According to Tinto (2003), learning communities can also promote cognitive
development among students by increasing their own knowledge and involving them

96

in constructing new knowledge. Tinto (2003) also believes that students, faculty, and
librarians would develop shared knowledge and shared responsibility by participating
in learning communities. Much evidence suggests that learning communities enhance
student learning, but they also require significant commitment, effort, and time from
the faculty and librarians (Jacobson, 2005; Tinto, 2003; Warren, 2006). Jacobson
(2005) also believes community colleges can drive the development of coherent and
effective education, and learning communities, if executed well, can lead to higher
academic achievement. Finally, developing learning communities at Cecil College
aligns with the core values and strategic objectives which are outlined in its 2010-2015
Strategic Plan (Cecil College, 2010b).
Assessment
Finally, assessment is a crucial component of any IL instruction program.
Cecil College needs to engage in more meaningful assessment at the institutional level
to determine the effect current IL instruction has on student learning. The follow-up
interviews lacked discussion regarding campus-wide assessment, but were focused on
assessment in the classroom. It was evident teaching faculty are conducting formal
and informal assessments of students‘ IL skills. The methods they employ include
research papers, annotated bibliographies, or the credibility of sources. However,
there was no consistency among the interviewees regarding which method they use for
assessment.
Reviewing assessment data can provide both qualitative and quantitative data
on improving an IL program. As previously reported, MSCHE‘s recommendations for
Cecil College suggest the institution seek qualitative measures to determine if students
are achieving established learning outcomes. An examination of MSCHE

97

accreditation standards placed emphasis on goal-based assessment models to
determine the quality of education students receive (Gratch-Lindauer, 2002).
Though limited, the survey results can provide an assessment of students‘ IL
skills in the classroom. A majority of respondents suggested students were capable of
locating information for class assignments and a slightly equal number indicated that
students were unable to evaluate the accuracy and credibility of the information they
retrieved. A majority of respondents also believed the IL skills of Cecil College
students are insufficient. As discussed earlier, teaching faculty are assessing students‘
skills using a combination of in-class assignments or activities, which could be
dependent on the course, and basing their assessment on how well students performed,
which is also dependent on the instructor‘s own IL skills. It is evident that the
assessments of students‘ IL skills may not be consistent.
Cecil College can either develop or adopt existing assessment tools and
customize them to reflect locally established outcomes. Assessment tools could
include pre- and post-tests, e-portfolios, and online tutorials and quizzes. Existing
methods, such as evaluating course assignments, annotated bibliographies and
research assignments, should continue to be used to assess students in the classroom.
Regardless of the assessment methods or tools utilized, the following questions
(Delaware County Community College, 2004) must be addressed by the assessment
process:
1.

What is to be assessed?

2.

How will it be measured?

3.

How much measurable change has resulted from the intervention?

98

The purpose of assessment will be to examine and evaluate the current IL
instruction program. Like any assessment process, which would include assessment of
student learning outcomes, the data collected and analyzed will provide valuable
information about the IL instruction program‘s effectiveness on student learning
outcomes. Assessment, however, could be considered a low priority until learning
outcomes have been establish and after a campus-wide definition of IL has been
established.
Conclusions
This study was hindered by a low return rate to the survey administered to the
teaching faculty at Cecil College. The results may not entirely describe the
perceptions, understanding, and awareness of IL by Cecil College faculty. However,
the data collected from the survey, the follow-up interviews, and the literature review
contributed to identifying recurring themes that provided the context for the
recommendations presented in this executive position paper.
A recent article described the collaboration between librarians and discipline
faculty to develop and teach several one-credit seminars for freshmen at Bronx
Community College. In the article, Sanabria (2013) described the commitment the
institution had to immediately include the library in making IL a strong course
component, which is reflected in general education proficiencies. The aim was to
increase retention among freshmen and increase their GPAs. After one year, freshman
students who participated in these seminars showed significant increases in their
average GPAs and the preliminary data revealed an encouraging retention rate.
These positive collaborative results and improvements in retention rates
provide some qualitative and quantitative support regarding successful faculty-

99

librarian collaborations, the importance of administrative support, and prioritizing IL
at the institutional level. In addition to the educational institutions previously
mentioned in this chapter, I have provided further examples of successful and robust
instruction programs reported in the literature (Gandhi, 2004; Lawrence, 2007),
namely, Roxbury Community College, Valencia College, James Madison University,
SUNY Ulster, and the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.
Finally, a strengthened instruction program will benefit students‘ IL
knowledge and skills which they will need to discover, retrieve, evaluate, and use
information in the 21st century. Librarians, teaching faculty, and administrators can
view the Cecil College Literacy Model as a guide to prioritize and act. Initially,
develop a localized definition of information literacy and formulate appropriate
outcomes that tie into the institutional mission. Secondly, increase library instruction
and intervention throughout the college curriculum and cultivate faculty-librarian
collaborative relationships. Finally, form learning communities and adopt appropriate
assessment tools to assess the students‘ information literacy skills and evaluate their
success. In the end, students will be able to think critically and evaluate the validity of
the abundance of information they encounter regularly. Ultimately, these abilities and
skills will ensure that these students will be lifelong learners.

Appendix B
BRASLEY’S MODELS OF COLLABORATION
The Introduction Model
Students, most often freshmen or transfer students, are taught basic or generic information literacy
competencies in such instructional situations as a one- or two-session presentation (―one-shot‖),
freshman seminars, orientations, first-year composition courses, and introductions to the major. Either
librarians or classroom faculty may move proactively to establish contact for IL instructional
interventions. After an initial consultation on course and information literacy session outcomes,
librarians often teach a segment or multiple class sessions that help students‘ complete research-based
assignments. Primarily, curriculum is focused on introducing the research process, which treats content
areas such as definition of a research question, effective search and retrieval techniques, and evaluation
of sources and Websites. This model can be implemented informally or formally, depending on the type
of partnership established. Some caution that this model may lead to a false sense that information
literacy is complete with the fulfillment of one or two sessions, which is not at all the case.
The General Education (GE) Model
In this model, information literacy outcomes are integrated into GE goals and also certification and
recertification of GE courses. Fulfillment of the IL learning objectives is dispersed throughout the
curriculum; librarians can offer curriculum maps to aid in this complex process. Mutual responsibility
and potential for collaboration among discipline faculty and librarians are a benefit for this model.
However, on the downside IL goals and programming can be set adrift because of the generalized
nature of GE courses. It is advisable for a core group to remain in place to oversee the program and
keep it viable.
The Learning Outcomes Model
The learning outcomes model is the major conduit for the collaborative practices that have been
discussed thus far. Discipline faculty and librarians working together create departmental disciplinary
IL learning outcomes for an academic department. This model also calls for strong faculty-librarian
partnership because the librarian must often work with each department to develop learning outcomes
and then be prepared to deal with the increased demand for information literacy sessions.
Information Literacy Course Model
In recent years, librarians have advocated for credit-bearing courses to help students gain information
literacy competence. These courses run the gamut from one-credit to four or five unit courses and from
standalone to those that are tied to a discipline-based course. Collaborations come in the form of faculty
and administrative support for resources and course approval.
Faculty Focus Model
This model works best with other models and emphasizes creation of supportive tools and approaches
to facilitate information literacy development by discipline faculty. This model requires substantial
partnership, because the librarians need to skillfully assess what tools faculty need and then develop
them. It is important to caution that this model must not be seen as training the faculty; that
interpretation will be resented and rejected.

117

On-Demand Model
Aptly described as the prevailing model in most libraries today, the drivers of this model are typically
faculty who request information literacy instruction sessions for a course. In some cases, librarians
initiate contact as a liaison for a department or program. Faculty who teach a course for multiple years
will typically return, allowing librarian and faculty to continuously improve on IL learning outcomes,
assignments, and products. Much progress has been made in introducing some students on college and
university campuses to this model. Sometimes, informal cooperative relationships blossom into more
fully developed collaborations. However, by its nature instruction is episodic and haphazard, offers only
one or two minimal learning opportunities (such as 50–120 minutes), and most important is often
unsustainable. This model is best used in conjunction with other models to reach the largest number of
students at every level of the institution.
