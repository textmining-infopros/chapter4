Abstract

It’s Not Rocket Library Science:
Design Epistemology and American Librarianship

Rachel Clarke

Chair of the Supervisory Committee:
Associate Professor Allyson Carlyle
Information School

Contemporary American librarianship is typically considered a social science. Yet libraries and
librarians have a strong history of making tools and services that enable access to and use of
information resources. Conceptualizing librarianship from a scientific perspective discounts its
design roots, leaving the field to flounder in the face of other successful information tools and
technologies. Reconceptualizing librarianship as a design discipline offers opportunities for
empowering and supporting the continued relevance of libraries in the 21st century.
In this dissertation, I draw on the humanistic technique of critical inquiry to argue for design as
an appropriate and useful epistemological framework for librarianship and further explore the
nature of design in the field. Following a broader discussion of elements of design epistemology
and their relationship to the library profession, the dissertation examines three critical cases in
depth, each one representing a significant era of library history:



Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature (est. 1848)



The Washington County (MD) Free Library book-wagon (est. 1909)



The eXtensible Catalog (XC) project (est. 2006)

Design artifacts and supporting materials from each case were critically analyzed based on the
framework of identified elements of design epistemology. Examination of the three cases shows
ample evidence that much of librarianship aligns with fundamental epistemological approaches
and tenets of design, including wicked problems, problem finding and framing, iteration,
repertoire, service orientation, and evaluative approaches to design like critique, rationale,
adoption, and reflection-on-action. Other elements of design epistemology, such as the use of
representations, abductive reasoning, and reflection-in-action, were not observed in the cases;
however, the absence of evidence of these elements is not equivalent to their actual absence in
practice.
In addition to the presence or absence of these elements, a critical examination of the ways in
which they manifested in these cases demonstrates that design epistemology tends to be implicit
and passive in American librarianship. Even when design epistemology is explicitly included in
these cases, it is often done so in a context that renders it external to librarianship—as something
that other fields and other professions do. Elements of design epistemology present in
librarianship also help to concretely support the idea of librarianship’s focus on users. Examining
American librarianship from a design-based standpoint reveals three major themes: 1) many
forms of library knowledge not considered valid in scientific contexts are valid in design
epistemology; 2) considerations of materiality reveal affordances, constraints, and limitations on
innovation in library design; and 3) although many core values of librarianship are innately

embedded in library artifacts, evidence of other values, notably cooperation and standardization,
is clearly present.
Finally, critical reflection on the cases in this study reveals that design may be implicit and
externalized in librarianship due to both lack of support and character of leadership and that the
normative and evangelical agenda of librarianship never really disappeared with the shift to an
ostensibly neutral and objective scientific epistemology. Given these findings, the overarching
recommendation for the field at large is to incorporate design epistemology explicitly into
American librarianship in research, education, and practice.

Chapter 1 Introduction and Problem Statement
1.1 Introduction
For thousands of years, libraries and librarians have made artifacts to enable access to and use of
information resources. Tools and services enabling and assisting with access to information were
the expert purview of libraries around the world for centuries. In the earliest known libraries of
Sumeria, workers created cuneiform lists of holdings.1 The famous library of Alexandria
implemented the first known deposit model to foster access to knowledge.2 The surge of books
and other related resources that resulted from the development of printing in the Western world
stimulated the enhancement of existing libraries and the creation of new ones, inspiring new
work creating tools like catalogs and shelf lists.3 Innovations like the Bodleian Library’s
cataloging rules starting in 16204 and the French cataloging code of 17915 sought to standardize
bibliographic information so as to provide accurate knowledge of and access to massive
collections. Early American libraries also developed information access tools based on these
examples. In the 19th century, as the number and size of libraries in American increased, so too
did the number of service tools produced. Numerous catalogs, bibliographies, indexes, and
classification systems were created to facilitate inventory and access to materials, while new
models of service like open stacks, reference assistance, recommendations, and readers’ advisory
emerged. Dewey developed his famous decimal-based classification system to enable patrons to

browse shelves by subject rather than acquisition order.6 As libraries transitioned into the 20th
century, additional tools and services were created. The formation of new cooperative models
like the Library of Congress’ Card Distribution program led the way for subsequent coordinated
efforts, like the Cooperative Online Serials Program (CONSER), the Name Authority
Cooperative (NACO), and the National Coordinated Cataloging Program (NCCP).7 Even modern
library databases like NoveList were created specifically to support readers’ advisory and
recommendations.8 What separates a library from merely a collection is the creation of tools and
services that unite users with information.

1.2 Problem statement
Despite overwhelming evidence of this history of innovative tool and service creation, as the 20th
century progressed, new tools and services were increasingly created not by librarians, but by
scientists and technologists.9 As librarians—for whatever reason—were reluctant to embrace
technological developments of the 20th century, others stepped in to fill the gap, driving
librarians to rely on vendors and automation marketplaces as sources of service tools.10 Libraries
and librarians are increasingly no longer creators of tools for libraries, but users and consumers
of them.11

Finding themselves in a subservient position to these external creators left most American
libraries struggling to keep abreast of new technological developments. Other publically
available information access tools of the late 20th and early 21st centuries captured users’
attention. Google, for example, quickly outpaced library catalogs in both perceived ease of use
and search functionality.12 Retail websites like Amazon.com have established features like
recommendations, reviews, ratings, and previews as the norm, and leave users expecting similar
experiences from libraries.13 In addition to functionality, today’s information seekers place a
high value on ease and convenience,14 even sacrificing accuracy for accessibility.15 Even medical
students—people who may someday make critical life-altering decisions about peoples’ health
and bodies—routinely favor more generic and populist tools like Google and Wikipedia when
conducting biomedical research.16 Shachaf found that the quality of answers provided by
Wikipedia’s reference desk (a question-and-answer service provided by Wikipedia volunteer
contributors) matched or even outperformed traditional library reference services.17 While
librarians are quick to point out flaws in these services, they are not the ones designing them,
therefore they are powerless to change them in ways that may better serve library users.

American libraries and librarians ceded the ability and power to create innovative tools and
services to external providers, leaving libraries on the trailing edge of technology. Given that tool
and service creation is such an integral component of librarianship, libraries and librarians need a
way to regain creative power if they are to remain relevant in the coming years. Librarians need
to reclaim their professional identity as makers—as creators, not consumers, of tools and
services—and the accordant methods, techniques, and conceptual approaches that underlie this
kind of work. Librarianship is not a science. It is, and always has been, a design discipline, and
therefore should be guided by design epistemology.

1.3 Research questions
In this study, I argue that design epistemology is a useful and appropriate lens through which to
view, investigate, and understand American librarianship. To address both the conceptual
problem of how to understand librarianship as a professional discipline rooted in design
epistemology and the normative argument for such a paradigm shift, I propose the following
research questions:
1. In what ways does design epistemology manifest in American librarianship?
2. What is uniquely revealed about librarianship when examining the discipline from a
design standpoint?
3. What are the implications of reconsidering librarianship from a design standpoint, and
how might these implications be explicitly made manifest?
In the spirit of humanistic inquiry, I approach this argument by first reviewing foundational
literature of design in order to distill what I call fundamental elements of design epistemology. I
draw on sources from a variety of disciplines with established demonstration of design practices,
methods, methodologies. Subsequently, I examine specific examples of artifacts in American

5
librarianship to better understand the nature of these elements of design epistemology in the
profession. Selected projects for examination represent the breadth of American librarianship,
including multiple time periods and aspects of library service (reference, technical services, etc.).
They have also been chosen for their formative and significant contributions to librarianship,
judged by community recognition and/or longevity of use. Finally, a concluding discussion and
reflection discusses implications of viewing these examples through a design lens, potential
benefits and drawbacks for American librarianship, and future recommendations for library
research, education, and practice.
My examples include the following:


Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature (est. 1848)



The Washington County Free Library (MD) book-wagon (est. 1909)



The eXtensible Catalog (XC) project (est. 2006)

More details, including a full explication and justification for this approach, along with detailed
descriptions of the examples, appear in Chapter 3: Approach and Activities.

1.4 Significance of the work
If you accept the provocative statement that librarianship is a design discipline, then a number of
significant implications for library work, education, and research follow. The first objective of
this research is to understand the uses and roles of design artifacts, methods, and underlying
ways of thinking and knowing throughout the course of American librarianship. An analysis of
librarianship from the standpoint of design offers the potential to reveal alternative insights than
those drawn from other traditional approaches, thus contributing a new perspective on and
understanding of the field. Second, this research will demonstrate, through both intellectual

6
argument and artifactual evidence, that design epistemology is an appropriate and useful
framework for conceptualizing the profession and work of librarianship. In addition to the
aforementioned new insights that this epistemological perspective can offer, understanding the
role design has played in the creation of previous library tools will help inform the use of design
in future library work. Finally, the demonstration of the applicability of design as a fundamental
approach to librarianship lays the groundwork for a paradigm shift in the field’s ways of thinking
and knowing, offering justification for new topics in library education and alternative legitimate
avenues for research and assessment that dovetail more closely with the practical applications of
library work and help bridge the theory/practice divide in librarianship.

Chapter 2 Literature Review and Project Rationale
2.1 Why does librarianship need a design epistemology?
The purpose of this chapter is two-fold: it addresses what is meant by design epistemology in the
context of this study, and demonstrates the absence of explicit acknowledgement of this
epistemological framework in librarianship. This dual purpose is achieved through a combination
of approaches: a brief review of existing epistemological influences in American librarianship;
an explication of the elements of design epistemology, especially those that distinguish it from
other epistemologies common in librarianship; and a subsequent examination of the disconnect
between a recent adoption of design methods and techniques (sometimes colloquially called
“design thinking”) in the library domain and the lack of incorporation of underlying design
epistemology alongside these applications. Thus this chapter reveals a gap between the existing
work in librarianship and research surrounding design epistemology.
It should be noted that the aim of this chapter is to highlight this gap and to show how useful,
relevant and important design epistemology is for the field. Therefore, holistic coverage such as
an in-depth historical examination of the epistemological influences of librarianship, while
certainly interesting, is outside the scope of this project.
Similar limitations apply to the realm of design. Entire books could be (and have been!) written
on design, from techniques and artifacts to processes and research. This section is not intended to
be thorough in-depth coverage, but identification of elements common across major authors,
perspectives, and works specifically regarding the epistemology of design. I select from the wellestablished and recognized scholarship of design epistemology to illustrate major points, rather
than provide a complete historical overview.

8

2.2 Existing epistemological approaches to librarianship
Although libraries and librarians have existed in various forms and contexts for thousands of
years, most scholars concur that formal establishment of American librarianship began in 1876
with two defining concurrent events: the first American Library Association meeting in
Philadelphia, and the publication of the first professional journal of librarianship, American
Library Journal (later Library Journal). These events also opened the doors to formal education
in librarianship, which helped solidify the existence and acknowledgement of librarianship as a
professional discipline. Early American librarianship was not the library science of today, but a
profession with more humanistic roots of reading and persuasive rhetoric. Reading was
emphasized as a means of intellectual, moral, and social education and improvement.1 Librarians
assumed the roles of mediators: connecting readers to “good” books and discouraging them from
partaking in problematic ones.2 Even librarianship itself relied on reading for educational
purposes: Justin Winsor’s advice to prospective librarians before 1887 was to read anything and
everything published about libraries, and Charles Ammi Cutter “considered a reading of the
[library] literature sufficient” preparation and self-education for a library career.3
How did librarians know which books would raise readers’ intellectual intelligence and moral
judgment, and which would lead readers into trouble like drinking, crime and upheaval of
society as we know it? Librarians didn’t know what the good books were through science—

librarians didn’t conduct systematic studies.4 So how did librarians know? Like art and
pornography, librarians presumed they would know it when they saw it. Librarians of the late
19th century relied on “a fixed standard in [their] minds” to guide their work in selecting,
collecting, and providing materials.5 As individuals with formal education in reading and rhetoric
and membership in the middle class, their standards and values—as influenced by the
contemporary Victorian era—were surely the right ones to enforce. And enforce them they did:
through editorial articles and letters putting forth claims about the benefits of reading and selfeducation. Such use of passionate rhetoric also reflects the influence of literature and reading, not
science, on the formation of the profession.
However, as librarianship became increasingly established as a profession, other influences
impacted these fundamental epistemological approaches. For instance, the increasing
formalization of education for librarianship, especially its inclusion in the university system at
the graduate level, shifted focus away from procedural training towards more scientific
approaches.6 In 1948 the American Library Association passed a resolution calling for library
education to only be offered at the graduate level7 and by 1951, the American Library
Association had limited accreditation to programs offering masters (i.e., graduate level) degrees.8
Situating librarianship in the academy helped legitimize it as a profession rather than a vocation,

but also emphasized scientific research and publication over practice.9 Although many
practitioners resisted the conceptualization of librarianship as a science and actively advocated
for other conceptualizations (see for example Thompson, who suggested librarianship might be
better considered as a fine art form10), librarians were increasingly educated in an environment
steeped in science, research, and the academy, and in turn taking those epistemological
understandings with them as they moved into practice.
This split between service-based library practice and research-based library science was not a
black-and-white divide. Often they overlapped, as scholars and researchers in library science
emphasized the need for scientific evidence to justify libraries’ social and educational value,
rather than reliance on experience-based assumptions and conclusions.11 Various methods and
methodological approaches to gathering this scientific evidence were drawn upon throughout the
20th century, such as positivistic approaches;12 social epistemology;13 qualitative inquiry;14
hermeneutics; 15 and evidence-based librarianship.16 Scholars often argue about the nature and
underlying philosophical and epistemological assumptions of library science (see for example

the published debates between Sandstrom & Sandstrom and Nyce & Thomas17 or Zwadlo and
Radford & Budd18). Yet few since the beginnings of the 20th century have approached
librarianship as if it was not a science at all.
In summary, despite the short history of the field, librarianship has been influenced by and
understood within the context of various epistemological perspectives. Early approaches
reflected somewhat humanistic epistemologies of bibliography and rhetoric. Scientific influences
in the early part of the twentieth century influenced the evolution of the profession toward a
positivistic epistemology of science. Later conceptions incorporated additional scientific
perspectives and frameworks beyond positivism, but always reflected the idea that librarianship
was the work that emerged from the discipline of library science.

2.3 A different approach: design
In the twentieth century, design epistemology has emerged as a legitimate alternative to
traditional scientific epistemologies. Reviews of epistemological constructs in design based
disciplines reveal significant epistemological differences. The major epistemological division
between traditional science and design stems from the idea that science concerns itself with
observing and describing the existing natural world with the goal of replicability and prediction.

Design, on the other hand, centers on the artificial world: objects created by humans to institute
change and solve problems. Science is about what is, while design is about what could be (or
arguably what should be).19 The objectives of design are to “create things people want”20 by
“addressing problems or ideas in a situated context.”21 Thus design epistemology is one based in
the creation of things that solve problems. Such an inherently different purpose calls for different
methodologies and techniques of practice, and therefore requires a fundamentally different way
of viewing and evaluating knowledge creation: what Cross calls a “designerly way of
knowing.”22
What are these ways of knowing? Scholars from the 1960s, when the first formal investigations
of processes and methods of design began, to the present day, have identified consistent factors
and aspects of design processes across a diverse range of disciplines. Designers from all fields—
from architecture to engineering, from fashion to technology—undergo similar processes,
revealing a common set of fundamental principles that underlie what constitutes knowledge in
design epistemology.23 While there are many perspectives from which designers approach this
process, such as user-centered design or participatory design, and many concrete methods
designers partake in, from A/B testing to word clouds,24 the present discussion is not about the
perspectives and hands-on activities that might differ among these approaches (such as what

kinds of personnel are included on a user-centered design team vs. a participatory design team,
or whether a cognitive walkthrough is a more useful idea-generating method than concept
mapping). Additionally, some authors discuss divergent views on design that at times may even
directly conflict; however, this discussion is not intended to be a complete review of all
perspectives, but rather an overview of the underlying principles common across design that
comprise a unique way of knowing. These underlying principles—what I call “elements of
design epistemology” in this study—include a variety of approaches to knowledge and what
constitutes knowledge in design. See Table 2.1 for an organized list of these elements.

Although they appear here to be very carefully categorized, many of these elements overlap and

which may also serve as an evaluative method. Although I acknowledge the complexity inherent
in articulating these elements, I group them this way purely for purposes of presenting an
organized analysis.

14
These elements appear in in all design disciplines. I posit that these elements also appear
systemically (if not systematically) throughout the discipline of librarianship. To support my
argument, each of these elements will be defined and discussed in detail, drawing on examples
from both traditional design fields as well as librarianship where applicable to illustrate the
concepts.
2.3.1 Creation of problem solutions
2.3.1.1 Artifacts
The verb form of the word “design” means “to create, fashion, execute, or construct according to
plan.”25 One of the first to examine design in a rigorous way, Simon described the design process
as “creating artifacts to obtain goals” 26 and claimed that this focus is a key factor in
distinguishing professional disciplines from those of pure scientific research and inquiry.27 While
Simon comes from a more traditionally scientific perspective, similar definitions can be seen for
design in more creative or craft-oriented domains, such as Charles Eames’ definition of design as
“a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.”28
Regardless of discipline or conceptual representation, design is “creating things people want.”29
This squarely defines design as a creative domain; that is, one that hinges on the action of
creation.
Creation results in some sort of output. Since the word “things” is often limited to the
connotation of physical objects, Kline suggests using the term “artifacts” to refer to all

products—tangible or intangible—made by humans that do not naturally occur on earth.30
Design, therefore, centers on the creation of some artifact. In the most literal sense, artifacts are
physical objects like axes, doors, telephones and cars. In libraries, physical space (architecture
and interior space planning) is often an explicit focus of design. However, physical artifacts are
not the only artificially-created things in our universe. People also create intangible conceptual
systems. These designs may be represented by or documented in physical artifacts. Such
intangible conceptual objects can also be considered artifacts, along with any techniques or
records used to embed them. Myriad examples of these design artifacts exist in librarianship,

knowledge and understanding that comes with and from the creation of such artifacts for
problem-solving is a unique epistemological approach with ways of knowing and understanding
that diverge from other traditional frames of knowledge.44
2.3.1.2 Wicked problems
Creation in design serves a very specific purpose: to solve problems. Although design artifacts
are created with the intention of solving problems, not all problems need design solutions. The
problem “2 + 2 = ?” does not require a creative solution; it requires a mathematical one. Many
problems can be solved with the application of traditional scientific methods. “After all,” Archer
notes, “if the solution to a problem arises automatically and inevitably from the interaction of the
data, then the problem is not, by definition, a design problem.”45 Unlike rational, scientific
problems, design problems are ill-defined from the outset.46 These unique, interconnected, and
ill-defined problems that cannot be definitively described are referred to as “wicked problems.”47
Rittel and Webber identify at least ten characteristics that qualify a problem as “wicked”:
1.

There is no definitive problem or known solution

2.

The problem has no stopping rule

3.

There are no true or false solutions to the problem, only good or bad solutions

4.

No scientific test exists for a solution

5.

Each solution is a “one shot” effort (that is, every solution attempt changes the problem)

By saying ‘at least ten,’ they imply that there may be additional characteristics. For instance,
implicit in their work is the idea that wicked problems are social problems. They do not indicate
whether all 10 conditions must be met to classify a problem as wicked, but the nod to additional
conditions implies that there is no complete number of conditions that must be met. Because
these wicked problems cannot be solved through traditional scientific means, and may only have
better or worse resolutions rather than a single “correct” answer, creative approaches like design
are necessary.48 Design is often relied upon to tackle wicked problems that have failed to be
solved via more traditional research approaches.49
Many problems in professional disciplines display the characteristics of wicked problems, and
librarianship is no exception. Professional practice in American librarianship has centered on
problem-solving from the beginning, from overarching problems like how to provide the best
books to the most people at the lowest cost (put forth by Dewey in 1892 and still the motto of
ALA today50) to specific instantiations at local institutions, like how to increase circulation or
teach information literacy. For example, what is the definition of the problem contemporary
online library catalogs attempt to solve? Is it a question of materials inventory, or information

access? If it is access, is it ease of access, universality of access, remote access, or something
else entirely? Perhaps it includes all of the above, as well as issues of integration with circulation
and statistical reporting. It must include consideration of backend architecture, display,
descriptive cataloging, subject analysis, and authority control. Not only is the problem ill-defined
and interconnected, but it also impacts a wide variety of stakeholders—library patrons,
librarians, organizational management, software vendors and developers. Even Patrick Wilson
writes that library catalogs are not faulty because of poor workmanship or outmoded
organizational schemes, but rather a deeper inherent complexity.51 Due to such complexity,
many problems addressed or attempted to be addressed by libraries could be considered wicked.
Since scientific approaches are not appropriate approaches to these wicked problems, this leaves
design as the only currently established appropriate approach to addressing these library
problems.
2.3.1.3 Problem finding, framing, and reframing
Because wicked problems—the kinds of problems that can be addressed by design—are by
nature ill-defined, it makes sense that thorough investigation and understanding of a problem
would be a key component of the design process. Early scholars of design conceptualized design
as a rational and systematic process. Design was generally characterized as a multi-stage
progression with variations of the following stages: 1) analysis; 2) synthesis; 3) evaluation.52
The first stage, analysis, consisted of activities that have subsequently come to be known in

California Press, 1968), 70.

Psychological Study of Design.”

20
design as “problem finding.” The second synthesis stage represented the actual creation or
formulation of a solution and the final stage addressed how well the solution fit the problem.
Tasks like compiling exhaustive lists of requirements53 and identifying goals and constraints54
were primitive attempts to define and scope design problems. Additional early strategies for
problem identification and definition relied on hierarchical decomposition, or the rational
division of a complex problem into increasingly narrower subsets. We might think of this as akin
to hierarchical classification, where topics are increasingly subdivided more narrowly. Then,
after rank-ordering these sub-problems and deciding on acceptable sub-solutions and
combinations of sub-solutions, these combinations of partial solutions would lead to larger,
overall solutions.55 This was the common understanding of the design process at the time.
However, it quickly became evident early in this area of research that design could not be
reduced so simply. For instance, Darke found ethnographic evidence refuting the idea that
designers identify constraints in a formalized way.56 Instead, designers impose a “generating
concept” or a set of objectives from one particular perspective in order to find a “way in” or to
frame the problem a certain way. Again to use a knowledge organization example, we might
think of this as akin to access points: metadata like title, author, and subject are common “ways
in” for users to access a collection. This idea of framing and reframing—looking at the problem
from different angles or points of view—recurs throughout the literature on design and across
fields like industrial product design, software and technology development, and architecture.57

21
For instance, the problem of accessing e-books in libraries can be looked at from many different
perspectives: how patrons find and download titles is a very different approach than how library
staff acquire titles and make them accessible. How might we reframe this? Viewing an issue
from the point of view of both patrons and library staff is a common occurrence in library
projects. What other views could we take on this issue? How about different types of patrons:
adults, children, teens? How about different environments those patrons are in: the library, work,
school, home, on the road commuting? Other methods for reframing problems include setting
boundaries around the issue (“How do children use library e-books?”); selecting particular
aspects of the problem to pay attention to (“How can we make the download process quick and
easy?”); and imposing coherence (“What is the process children follow to find a library ebook?”). The way in which a problem is framed will guide subsequent design decisions.
Schön also specifically discusses the role that design domains play in understanding, reframing,
and designing solutions for problems.58 Design domains are clusters of concepts, like elements,
features, norms, relations, actions, and constraints, that designers draw upon throughout the
design process. To continue our knowledge organization comparison, we might think of these
like facets representing different aspects and concepts that affect and shape how a designer
understands and therefore addresses the problem under consideration. Goel and Pirolli observe
that designers not only interpret problems through the lens of their own personal experience, they
also “explicitly try to change the problem situation so it more closely fits their expertise,
knowledge, and experience.” 59 Such reframing affects the entire process of design, since rather
than changing from the initial state to a preferred state, as is the traditional conceptualization of

22
the design process, here designers actually change the initial state itself. Problem finding,
framing, and reframing is such an integral part of the design process that Lawson points out it is
designers’ abilities to find the problems—not solutions—that distinguishes good from bad
design. 60
2.3.1.4 Emphasis on service
An emphasis on service seems self-evident for a field mainly concerned with solving complex
and wicked problems. However, the element of service is design is deeper than just problem
solving. For one thing, the service orientation of design is intentional compared to other
traditional approaches from science and art.61 These other epistemologies certainly offer
contributions to others in the form of knowledge from scientific discoveries that in turn affect
social policy or emotional experiences that influence personal behavior. But as Nelson and
Stolterman argue, these are secondary outcomes. Preliminary motivation in science and art are
typically in the service of self in terms of curiosity and expression. Design, on the other hand,
intentionally targets the needs of others, and this specific intention separates it from other forms
of inquiry. Science and art set out to “find meaning”; design aims to “make meaning.”62
Design “makes” meaning literally through artifact creation and metaphorically though
contributing to service in the lives of others. Although Konsorski-Lang and Hampe define design
as “creating things people want,”63 Nelson and Stolterman argue that to truly offer intentional
service, design offers people more than what they want, a “surprise of self-recognition.”64 This

design creates knowledge through intentionally understanding and manifesting desiderata. In
other words, design is not necessarily about solving a problem as stated, but empathetically
understanding the situation and context so that underlying and potentially unknown problems can
be solved, thus demonstrating a dedication to service by going beyond a surface level. We see
this time and again in librarianship, which also explicitly calls out service as a core value of the
profession.65 One illustrative example is the reference interview, where librarians are trained to
delve, explore, and determine a patron’s true underlying information need, because it is not
necessarily directly stated.66 For example, a patron may ask a librarian, “Do you have Time
magazine?” Solving the direct problem as presented, the answer would be a simple “yes” or
“no.” However, the patron may be a student looking for articles about the U.S. war in Iraq, and
associate Time magazine with articles of that genre and topic. Or the patron may be a senior
citizen looking for a recent article about new cancer treatments who recalled the article being
published in Time magazine, but it actually appeared in Newsweek.67 It is the explicit job of the
librarian to give the patron more than what they have expressed as their need, to solve the
problem beyond its presentation.

and then creates a solution, researchers increasingly note that problem finding in design is

ongoing throughout the process. Even early proponents of the three-stage model of design noted
that designers continually cycle through these stages, rather than progressing linearly.68 Archer
also observed confusion and overlapping activities among stages, 69 while Levin noted numerous
feedback loops and cycles of decisions70 and Akin saw constant regeneration of new goals,
problems, and sub-problems throughout all stages of the design process.71 Subsequent work
shows that design problems and solutions develop together, concurrently, in an interconnected
and interdependent way.72 Designers move quickly back and forth between explorations of the
problem and ideas for solutions73 and hone definitions of problems by making attempts at
solutions.74 In fact, there is actually a danger in settling on a problem definition too early, as it
may preemptively narrow the focus, eliminating opportunities for other perspectives and forcing
designers to jump to solutions too quickly.75
Much of this iterative process in design stems from the idea that finding and identifying the
problem to be addressed is just as important—if not more so—than creating a solution. Because
wicked problems—the kinds of problems that can be addressed by design—are by nature illdefined, it makes sense that iterative investigation and understanding of a problem would be a
key component of the design process. Additionally, wicked problems are also characterized as
interconnected: every attempt at a solution changes the problem. This is reflected in the design
process as well, where requirements may be interdependent.76 This interdependent iteration is

also reflected in what Schön called a “web of moves”: every action, choice, or move a designer
makes affects the next move and all subsequent moves down the line, therefore designers must
consider all possible future moves when considering the move at hand.77 We see similar
evidence of moves and effects of moves in other design studies, such as Rowe’s study of
architectural designers.78
2.3.2.2 Repertoire
Repertoire is the name given in design to previous experiences and bodies of knowledge.79
Designers draw on repertoire both to guide current choices and to evaluate decisions and
artifacts. Schön describes repertoire as the “capacity to see unfamiliar situations as familiar ones,
and to do in the former as we have done in the latter, which enables us to bring our past
experiences to bear on the unique case.”80 He points out that a designer’s ability to create
increasingly better solutions hinges on the scope and diversity of his or her repertoire: the more
past experiences a designer has, the more familiar situations he or she can draw upon, and thus
then be more informed in making decisions in uncertain situations. Lloyd and Snelders highlight
the idea that repertoire need not be limited solely to previous design experiences, but to other
external factors such as passive information reception.81 Their case study of Phillippe Starck’s
Juicy Salif 82—a lemon squeezer shaped like a squid after Starck partook in a lunch of calamari—
showed that a designer’s ability to create analogies between present problems and external ideas
also shaped decision making. A prime example of repertoire in librarianship might be in the

work of reader’s advisory, a service requiring librarians to supply reading recommendations to
patrons.83 There is not one authorized list librarians memorize and use to suggest reading
materials. Rather, to perform this work, a librarian must draw on her own personal experience:
every book she has read herself, as well as reviews of books she’s read; recommendations and
reports from other professionals, friends, and family; advertisements on television and
magazines; and all manner of unpredictable sources. Her range of knowledge will differ from
another librarian’s, who may end up offering different suggestions based on his own repertoire.
Greenberg and Buxton point out that repertoire is a crucial aspect that separates rigorous design
evaluation from mere personal opinion, as designers draw on extensive repertoires to evaluate
new artifacts.84
2.3.2.3 Reflection
This idea that designers iteratively frame and reframe, making choices about each subsequent
move based on previous moves and future “what if” moves demonstrates what Schön calls
“reflection-in-action.”85 Many of us are familiar with reflection, or the idea that we look back on
a completed project or past situation with serious thought and consideration, such as a reflective
essay we might write for English class. There is also some evidence of reflection occurring in
librarianship, such as in the Valuable Initiatives in Early Learning that Work Successfully
(VIEWS2) project, which found that purposeful reflection is a key component in the continuous
improvement of storytimes intended to increase literacy skills.86 Designers, too, look back on
projects in a reflective manner, often drawing on such reflection as an evaluation technique.

Reflection can help designers learn from their experiences, become more conscious about design
activities and choices, and analyze what worked well vs. what did not.87 This type of after-thefact “reflection-on-action” is familiar to most people. It is arguably designers’ engagement in
“reflection-in-action,” or the ongoing, continual reflection throughout the process of creation that
is one of the major aspects distinguishing design from other epistemology. Design is often
attributed to innate talent or intuition by people unfamiliar with design epistemologies, both
people external to design processes as well as some designers themselves who are ignorant of
ways to explain their knowledge. Numerous studies show that designers refer to relying on their
personal discretion or intuition when making choices.88 Tacit understanding of what is meant by
“personal discretion” or “intuition” often contributes to the mystery perceived to surround the
design process. But what is commonly attributed to intuition has been dissected and teased out
by design scholars and researchers as a type of knowledge based in reflection-in-action.89 Many
scholars have identified creation and making as a fundamental element of design epistemology.90
Reflection-in-action can only occur during creation: any subsequent reflection is, by nature,
reflection-on-action. Therefore, the process of making is mandatory for reflection-in-action to
exist, and therefore a key component of design epistemology.

2.3.2.4 Use of representations
Throughout the process of creating an artifact to solve a problem, designers create what are
called design representations. Such representations make take a variety of forms, depending on
the discipline and context in which a designers is working, including notes, sketches, models,
prototypes, etc. Regardless of format, these representations serve a variety of purposes
throughout the design process. One of the most obvious uses is to serve as an informational
record. Jones advocated recording and storing ideas, past solutions, requirements, etc., for later
use.91 However, using design representations as “memory backups” or communicative vehicles
is actually a limited and superficial view of how designers use representations.92 The
representations used during the design process are not formal records, such as those that might be
used to communicate finished work to the chairman of the board after a solution has been
finalized. Process representations are a fast, spontaneous, transient process allowing designers to
experiment with ideas on the fly without prematurely committing to one.93 When working with a
representation—unlike working with the actual product itself—no moves are irreversible.94
When I draw a picture of a house, it is easy for me to erase and replace lines representing walls,
floors and roofs. But during the actual construction of the house, it is difficult—if not
impossible—to change the foundation after it has been laid or substitute one type of shingle for
another without worrying that the roof may cave in, or how much more money the second set of
shingles will cost (and this after I’ve already paid for the first ones). The flexibility and
malleability of working with representations affords designers the ability to explore and

experiment with a variety of options. Olpe notes that drawing itself is a process that facilitates
discoveries, mistakes, and successes.95 It is through such exploration and experimentation that
designers make progress toward solutions: the interaction of creating representations and
reflecting on them constitutes knowledge through the clarification of ideas; discovery of new and
alternative ideas; refinement of current ideas and provision of specific points to which designers
can respond.96 Thus representations like drawings are not created with graphical communicative
output as their ultimate goal, but are used to foster knowledge in the form of criticism and
discovery that helps designers understand the problem as much as it helps generate a solution.97
Recent studies even show that creating more representations, especially concurrently and parallel
to one another, can spur more divergent ideas and thus better design solutions.98 Representations
also play a role in the design process by supporting interactions among people. The design
process is a social one, consisting of interaction and negotiations between and among various
parties with differing sets of knowledge, experience, and awareness.99 Representations can play a
mediating role among these diverse parties and affect group dynamics as representations change
according to idea evolution.100
2.3.2.5 Abductive reasoning
Scientific epistemologies rely on conventional forms of inductive and deductive reasoning
(analytical and evaluative activities that prove something must be or demonstrate that something

is actually operative).101 But design relies on abductive reasoning (sometimes called “productive
reasoning” because designers produce things, or “appositional reasoning” because designers
propose apposite responses to problems). This kind of reasoning is not based in analysis or
evaluation, but synthesis, or the suggestion that something may be possible.102 Gedenryd
provides a comprehensive analysis from a cognitive science perspective of why induction and
deduction are inappropriate reasoning methods in design, as they represent abstract thought
alone, and thought alone cannot address the actual task of designing—creating an artifact.103 This
reinforces the idea of making as knowing, since it is only through the actual manifestation of
making that we can discover whether something is really possible.104 Scholars across all eras in
systematic studies of design emphasize the idea of synthesis inherent in abductive reasoning.
Lawson discusses the difference between scientists who tackle problems through analysis (that
is, breaking a problem apart to understand its “rules” before proposing a solution) and designers
who tackle problems through synthesis (that is, by discovering more about the problem by
proposing solutions and discovering “acceptable” solutions).105 Kolko details how designers use
frames and constraints to shape synthesis and solutions. 106
2.3.3 Design evaluation methods
Such alternative approaches to knowledge generation naturally will not hold up to scrutiny and
critical evaluation based in scientific epistemologies. Unlike science, which aims for predictable,

consistent results, design specifically aims for deviations and variations.107 Because what counts
as legitimate knowledge in design is different, then so too must any evaluation methods be
different. While science relies on specific epistemological constructs of evidence, design
considers interpretation as a valid form of epistemological evidence.108 Scientific evidence may
be of assistance to designers by describing existing situations so as to inform frames, conditions,
and constraints. But the purpose of design itself is not to describe the existing world in a factual
or objective manner; rather it seeks to change situations and add meaning to them. Therefore,
subjective interpretation is a valid form of evidence in design, manifesting through evaluative
elements like rationale and expert critique.
Just because design evaluation is not objective in the traditional sense does not mean it is less
valid or invalid. What may seem like arbitrary subjectivity to outsiders is actually evaluation
based on an extensive repertoire of personal knowledge.109 The lack of pre-established and
explicitly defined criteria does not automatically mean that an evaluator’s subjective opinion
comes arbitrarily from thin air. Understanding of values and norms of evaluative criteria have
built up over time, from a designer’s first critique through all subsequent design evaluations and
experiences. It is conformance to—not deviance from—these values that demonstrates and
reifies an evaluator’s authoritative role. Anyone who attempted to arbitrarily assess a design
according to their own personal criteria would lose their community status as a reliable and
expert evaluator. This idea of community-based affirmations of rigor and value are not limited to
design: even the notion of objectivity in scientific epistemologies breaks down when viewed

from the perspective of social construction. Pinch and Bijker posit that “there is nothing
epistemologically special about the nature of scientific knowledge: it is merely one in a whole
series of knowledge cultures.”110 They reference “‘primitive’ tribes” and other indigenous ways
of knowing,111 but there is no reason that the epistemology of design is not also a different, yet
legitimate, knowledge culture. At minimum, design evaluation should consist of a reflective
critique by the design’s creators.112 The following sections describe some additional examples of
evaluative techniques in design epistemology, all of which are considered valid, rigorous criteria
in any design school or firm, across a variety of design disciplines.113
2.3.3.1 Rationale
If design consists of a web of moves, with each move shaping the next, then the reason behind
each choice becomes critically important. Design rationale, in the broadest sense, refers to the
reasons and justifications for designing an artifact, the notation or documentation of justifications
and reasons, and explanations of why an artifact is the way it is.114 In a casual application of
design, these reasons may be tacit or unarticulated. However, capturing the artifacts created in
design with the reasoning behind the decisions for creating them is critical in the idea of design
rationale. Again to use a knowledge organization example, we might think of this as akin to
warrant, or the justification and verification of decisions in the creation of classification
systems.115 Although not specifically framed in the language of design, Beghtol specifically

33
refers to warrant as the “semantic rationale” underlying a classification system.116 The
congruency or divergence of articulated rationale with the artifact itself offers evaluative
information. For example, classification systems can be evaluated on the basis of warrant: if
justification for terms in a vocabulary is based on presence in the literature (known as “literary
warrant”), but terms in the vocabulary are not found to be present in the literature, the disconnect
between the stated rationale and the execution of the artifact offers evaluative insights as to the
vocabulary’s success. In addition to merely evaluative uses, design rationale can also refer to a
method of design wherein the reasons for the design are made explicit.117 Thus rationale
becomes part of the knowledge-making process, contributing to greater theory, rather than just a
technique for assessment. 118
2.3.3.2 Critique
For those not embedded in design epistemologies, critique may call to mind scary memories of
harsh, negative criticism, perhaps in front of a large peer group, like reading a poem aloud in a
creative writing class only to have the instructor and classmates rip it to shreds. Such experiences
are often the extent of knowledge about critique for non-designers. However, although some
similarities exist (much of design education is conducted via classroom and studio critiques119),
critique in design extends beyond simple criticism. Design critique serves as an epistemological
process of knowledge formation.120 This knowledge formation may be used to offer evaluative
insight, where designers with large, well-developed repertoires (Eisner calls them

“connoisseurs”121) are able to discern complex and subtle qualities and characteristics of a design
and make fine-grained discriminations that others may not be able to express.122 Despite the
apparent harshness of stereotypical perceptions of critique, the value inherent in negative
commentary and feedback can be essential to furthering both artifact and knowledge. Kolko
notes that well-executed critique is not simply subjective negativity: it systematically articulates
a framework for evaluation and then compares the work against that framework in the form of an
ongoing, interactive conversation.123 Frameworks are often drawn for repertoires of experience,
and may be based on a variety of aspects, such as rationale, or other criteria such as those
described in the following section.
2.3.3.3 Criteria-based evaluation
Other criteria like novelty, innovation, and relevance to users may also be used for evaluative
purposes, and may vary based on context.124 For example, market adoption might be a viable
criteria for commercial viability of a design, but the number of diverse solutions designed might
be more applicable in other situations such as early brainstorming for new products. The
consideration of context in design evaluation is critical, whereas scientific knowledge
mechanisms purposefully try to detach from context with techniques like controlled laboratory
conditions and identification and separation of confounding variables.
Because design creates artifacts to solve problems, the implication is that such artifacts did not
previously exist. Therefore, one criteria used to assess design is novelty and innovation. Scholars

of design note that some level of originality must be present for something to be considered
design.125 Design focuses on initiating new and novel forms and aims for new phenomena.126 If
such innovation is an underlying objective, then it should certainly be a valid assessment criteria.
However, novelty is not binary, but may be assessed along a spectrum. For instance, newness
may be context dependent: a pre-existing idea implemented in a new setting may be considered
novel. So many libraries now circulate non-traditional materials such as tools, musical
instruments, and cake pans that the idea of circulating non-bibliographic materials may seem to
lack novelty. But even though the Charles County (MD) and Great Bend (KS) libraries have all
been circulating cake pans for a while,127 the service could still be considered new if
implemented at Seattle Public Library or King County Library, or another library not yet
providing such services.
Because design hinges on creation, creativity and imagination plays an integral role. In addition
to new solutions, design hinges on creativity, and therefore innovation can be an appropriate
criteria for design assessment. Rather than just being new, designs should exhibit and
communicate imagination.128 I admit that discerning boundaries around what is imaginative or
creative is difficult, if not impossible. However, there may be other indicators of assessment in
this area, such as recognition from others. For example, the Los Angeles (CA) Public Library

internet-enabled technology that can sign citizens up for a library card on the spot—won the

2.3.4 Summary
All of the elements of design epistemology discussed here—artifact creation; wicked problems;
problem finding, framing and reframing; an emphasis on service; iteration; repertoire; reflection;
use of representations; abductive reasoning; and alternative evaluation methods like rationale,
critique, and criteria-based evaluation—are common threads that underscore a design
epistemology. Design offers a unique epistemology, one based in the making of artifacts rather
than the observation and measurement of the natural world. Instead, the design process is
characterized by its constantly iterative nature, as well as a significant emphasis on problem
finding rather than simply solution generation. The use of representations in the design process
serves a different purpose than the traditional information record and communication mechanism
in other disciplines; in the design process, representations are used to explore and experiment
with ideas. An orientation toward service and a reliance on abductive reasoning also underscore
a unique epistemological approach based in addressing complex wicked problems. This unique
approach means that traditional methods of knowledge and assessment based in scientific
epistemologies are inappropriate, and so evaluation of design knowledge is carried out through
alternative means such as rationale, and critique, and alternative criteria like adoption, novelty,
and innovation.

2.4 Where is the design in librarianship?
In addition to its use in traditional design fields like architecture and graphic design, design
epistemology is specifically called out as underlying professional fields that include both
theoretical and practical contributions, such as engineering, medicine, education, and yes, even
librarianship.130 These practice-based professions need practice-based epistemologies.131 Even
the information systems discipline is increasingly recognizing design research and epistemology
alongside social science.132 Buckland agrees that even information science (which in his view
encompasses librarianship) is a “science of the artificial” focused on the creation and study of
design objects that affect change.133
Although I have referred to many examples of design in librarianship in the previous section, the
profession itself does not seem to have acknowledged—much less embraced—a design
perspective. A recent methodological analysis of library practitioner research does not even
mention design,134 and design is conspicuously absent from research methods books for
librarians, even recent publications.135 Even though librarianship has fostered the creation of
innumerable innovative tools, the idea of design is explicitly conceptualized in specific, practical
ways. Mentions of design are almost exclusively in the context of architecture/interiors design
(see for example American Libraries’ annual “Library Design Showcase,” which only covers

innovative architecture or new and newly renovated libraries136), graphic design (such as
Librarian Design Share,137 a website where librarians can share and trade flyers, handouts,
signage, etc.) and technology (such as web design). Other, broader references to design, such as
Buckland’s Redesigning Library Services: A Manifesto,138 discuss aspects of library services
without ever drawing upon or discussing design epistemology.
Recent years have shown some evidence of the use of design methods and techniques in
librarianship. An interest in what is popularly called “design thinking” (not to be confused with
Cross’ “designerly ways of knowing”) has begun to emerge, evidenced in conference
presentations139 and toolkits.140 The technique of participatory design, a form of design process
that supports cooperation and collaboration between participants (such as potential users of a
system) and designers, researchers, and developers,141 has recently been popular in librarianship.
Grant-funded workshops from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and
subsequent publications142 focus on the method and technique of participatory design, but do not
seem to broach the underlying epistemological assumptions that support and contribute to it.
While the implementation of the techniques put forth by these advocates, such as thinking about
patrons experiences first, can and have certainly helped libraries, they are still centered in ways

for working, not ways of thinking and knowing, and thus lack the underlying epistemological
shift required to fully harness the power of design. This leaves libraries still beholden to
evaluating and assessing tools and services created in one paradigm according to the criteria of
another—an inevitably unsuccessful prospect. Using criteria based in traditional scientific
epistemologies to assess library tools and services is like using a ruler to measure a two-liter
bottle: it may tell you something, but it may not offer all of the relevant and useful information.
Others in librarianship have embraced the empowerment of creation—but for library users, not
the profession itself. The advent of makerspaces and other opportunities to foster creation in
libraries certainly lends credence to the idea of knowledge via making. Resources like the Let’s
Make Guide from the Gates Foundation143 emphasize the value of making in libraries, but they
are couched in the context of the value of making by users, not librarians. Lankes emphasizes
this transition, advising that the future of libraries rests in the shift from passive information
consumption to active information creation.144 However, the focus in all of these endeavors is on
library users (i.e., patrons) as creators—there is no acknowledgement, much less encouragement,
for librarians to reconceptualize themselves as creators and their field as one of design. Other
innovative efforts to reconceptualize the library blatantly ignore design, even as they describe its
very nature: Schnapp and Battles specifically call out for “a way of talking about what libraries
are” and refer to Dewey as a “gadget creator.” They use metaphors of creation (like cooking) and
references from design (like Alexander’s pattern language) to describe libraries, but somehow
never make the connection to frame these discussions in epistemology of design.145 Perhaps “the

way of talking about what libraries are” is not as absent as Schnapp and Battles think: perhaps it
already exists in the world of design.

Chapter 3 Approach and Activities
3.1 General approach
In this study, I argue that design is systemic in the entire scope of the library profession, and
therefore design epistemology is a useful and appropriate lens through which to view,
investigate, and understand American librarianship. I have previously shown that elements of
design epistemology are present throughout the work of the library profession; however,
librarianship does not see itself nor is it perceived by outsiders as a design profession. In this
study, I more closely examine the role and nature of design epistemology in American
librarianship to better understand this disconnect and advocate for change. To construct and
support this argument, this work examines the role of design in American librarianship through
the investigation of the following research questions:
1. In what ways does design epistemology manifest in American librarianship?
2. What is uniquely revealed about librarianship when examining the discipline from a
design standpoint?
3. What are the implications of reconsidering librarianship from a design standpoint, and
how might these implications be explicitly made manifest?
Because research is about the creation of new knowledge, it too depends on design. In designing
this investigation, I do not limit myself to any one single normative methodological approach.
Rather, I propose a combination of research techniques that, in my opinion, best allow me to
fully answer my research questions. Therefore, this research employs close critical analysis of
examples of design artifacts from American librarianship and their relevant contexts to

42
understand the role of design in the profession and argue for its consideration as an
epistemological foundation for the profession.
Although I may refer to these examples as “cases,” I use this term in the loosest sense. They are
not case studies in the traditional social science definition, although they do share some
characteristics, such as depth of investigation,1 capacity for addressing complexity,2 and
consideration of context.3 Instead, I draw on a more humanistic approach, often referred to as
critical inquiry or close reading, to analyze the artifacts and contexts in these examples for
indications of evidence or absence of design epistemology and themes. The term “critical” as it
appears in research literature may have two common meanings. It is often used to describe a case
of significant or strategic importance, such as the “critical incident technique.”4 Or it may be
used to describe studies that reflect on current practices, question taken-for-granted assumptions,
and critique the status quo. 5 In this study, I draw on the second meaning. Rather than simply
offering description and understanding, the main task of critical research is to challenge
prevailing paradigms and offer suggestions and recommendations for change.6 Therefore, this
research seeks not only to understand librarianship from a design perspective, but it takes an
explicitly activist perspective to advocate for reconceptualizing the field as a design-based field.

Such critical approaches have been used in material culture studies and studies of technology,
where artifacts may be “read” as texts,7 or even analyzed from a design perspective8 (see for
example Plotnick’s article examining the case of electric push buttons in the years between 1880
and 19239 or Robertson’s case analyzing the design of the American passport10). Scholars such
as Petroski have explored the design of artifacts like bookshelves, pencils, eyeglasses, and other
objects though historic examples that incorporate the interplay of social and technical factors.11
Studies of design history draw on the similar technique of script analysis to demonstrate what an
artifact reveals about itself through a physical script (its design, including its form, material
properties, affordances, etc.12) as well as a sociotechnical script (messages conveyed via
surrounding contextual materials, such as marketing, brand identity, etc.13). Related to
librarianship, scholars like Bowker & Star and Feinberg use critical approaches to understand
how the design, creation, and implementation of standards like classification systems and
controlled vocabularies shape domains like professional fields and communicate values.14
In this study, I propose to closely analyze examples of tool and service creation in American
librarianship in a similar manner to the above mentioned examples to better understand the
nature of design epistemology in the profession. Based on my earlier review of the literature, I

Close examination of artifacts and surrounding contextual materials looking specifically for
these elements will not only demonstrate that this type of design analysis is possible and
appropriate in librarianship, but also allow the use of the findings to further the understanding of
how design epistemology is present or absent in librarianship. Discussion of and reflection on the
analysis that arises will address the critical perspective, specifically by suggesting
recommendations alternative to the contemporary status quo of research, teaching, and practice
in the field.

3.2 Description and justification for selection of examples
Because this research examines the role of design in librarianship, it makes sense to study
instances of designs themselves, as well as their creation, reception, and other surrounding
contexts. Therefore, each example case in this study reflects the story of an artifact—a tool or
service created for the purpose of library service. Artifacts are common objects of study in art,

45
material culture and design research. Commons lines of inquiry around artifacts investigate the
lifecycle of the artifact or its use and meaning in a cultural context.15 This research uses both of
these approaches by investigating in each case the artifact itself, its design process (i.e., the
creation of the design), as well as any reception or interpretation in the cultural context of the
library profession. This process-oriented analysis examines both the artifacts and their
surrounding contexts over time to gain a more thorough and holistic understanding.
I have previously argued that American librarianship is rife with design artifacts. Although it
would be ideal to examine all of these examples in depth, every study must have some
boundaries, if only for practical reasons of time and resource limitations. Therefore, I will select
three prominent examples to investigate in depth. Criteria used to select examples include the
following:


Close ties to librarianship. All examples should be created in the context of American
libraries, for use in those organizations, ideally by librarians.



Illustrative power. Examples with greater ability to clearly and reliably demonstrate
aspects of design under consideration will be selected to illustrate and argue points.



Historical and topical breadth. Examples will be chosen to cover a broad range of time
within American librarianship and diverse projects and focus within the profession (e.g.,
reference, technical services, etc.).



Formativeness and significance. Examples should consist of noteworthy projects that
demonstrate influence, possibly via reception or longevity.

(New York, NY: Routledge, 2013).

46


Availability of source materials. While more of a practical limitation than an intellectual
concern, evidence can only be drawn from examples with existing documentation and
source materials, which may include the artifact itself, supplementary documentation,
sources such as design sketches and prototypes, personal records, correspondence,
official corporate records, reports, publications, etc., depending on the specific artifact
under examination and its historical and organizational context. Personal sources may
also be consulted where relevant, prompting the use of interviews with people who
participated in an artifact’s creation.

Based on the criteria outlined above, the following examples have been selected for close
analysis:


Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature (est. 1848)



The Washington County (MD) Free Library book-wagon (est. 1909)



The eXtensible Catalog (XC) project (est. 2006)

3.2.1 Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature
Commonly referred to simply as “Poole’s Index,” this case covers the development of Poole’s
Index to Periodical Literature, the first American library tool created to provide subject access to
articles within periodicals. When we think of Poole’s Index today, we often think of the massive
multi-volume work encompassing an entire shelf in the library stacks. However, the Index got its
start as a small manuscript created for the library of the Brothers in Unity Society, a debating
club at Yale University. While a student at Yale, Poole joined the Society and found a position in
the library as assistant librarian. In late 1847 or early 1848, Poole created a handwritten
manuscript subject index to all the periodicals held in the Society library. The manuscript was so

47
useful that the Society voted to print, publish and sell the work.16 An Alphabetical Index to
Subjects, Treated in the Reviews, and Other Periodicals, to Which No Indexes Have Been
Published was published by G.P. Putnam & Sons in June 1848, and orders exceeded
expectations.17 Poole immediately went to work on a subsequent edition of the Index during his
final year at Yale, since at least one publisher had shown interest in a new version.18 This second
edition, this time simply titled An Index to Periodical Literature, was published in October 1853
by Charles B. Norton. By the time it was published, Poole was working as assistant librarian at
the Boston Mercantile Society library.
Despite the popularity and perceived usefulness of the Index, nearly thirty years passed before a
new edition was published. In December 1882, a third edition was published as Poole’s Index to
Periodical Literature by James R. Osgood and Company. Although Poole is credited as the
author, this edition was a collaborative endeavor headed by Poole with the assistance of William
I. Fletcher and the cooperation of the American Library Association and the Library Association
of the United Kingdom. In addition to publishing this third edition of the Index, the cooperative
plan also included the publication of regular supplementary works at five year intervals covering
periodical volumes appearing after the publication of the third edition. The first of these, Poole’s
Index to Periodical Literature: The First Supplement, from January 1, 1882 to January 1, 1887,
again headed by Poole with the assistance of Fletcher, was published by Houghton Mifflin &
Company in October 1888. By 1889, the third edition of the Index was nearly sold out, and plans

were set in motion to reprint copies of it.19 Legal disputes over copyright privileges slowed this
plan, but eventually in 1893 a reprint of the 1882 edition was published by Houghton Mifflin &
Company, this time in a two-part set with Part I covering subjects A-J and Part II covering
subjects K-Z. With this reprint, which matched the first Supplement in publisher and style, the
works were relabeled for consistency: the third edition would now be called “Volume 1”
(comprised of Parts I and II); the first Supplement would henceforth be called “Volume 2,” and
subsequent Supplements would be named accordingly.20
In August 1892, during the preparation of the second Supplement, Poole withdrew his
involvement in the project, although he continued to allow the use of his name and affiliation.21
Therefore, authorship of Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature, The Second Supplement from
Jan. 1, 1887, to Jan. 1, 1892, published in 1893 by Houghton Mifflin & Company, is attributed
to Fletcher with the cooperation of the library associations. One year later, in 1894, Poole passed
away. Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature, Third Supplement from Jan. 1, 1892 to Dec. 31,
1896 by William I. Fletcher and Franklin O. Poole (Poole’s nephew) with the cooperation of the
American Library Association was published in 1897; Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature,
Fourth Supplement from January 1, 1897, to January 1, 1902, by William I. Fletcher and Mary
Poole (Poole’s daughter) with the cooperation of the American Library Association in 1903; and
Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature, Fifth Supplement, from January 1, 1902, to January 1,
1907, by William I. Fletcher and Mary Poole with the cooperation of many librarians in 1908; all
published by Houghton Mifflin. Fletcher and Mary Poole also published an abridged version of

the Index in 1901 and supplements to the abridged version were printed annually until 1905. The
set of Poole’s Index (the third edition in two volumes plus the five supplements) was reprinted
by Peter Smith (Glouster, MA; known for reprinting hard-to find books for libraries22) in 1938,
1958, and again in 1963. In 1998, Paratext LLC released a digitized, searchable version of
Poole’s Index called “Poole’s Plus,” which later incorporated additional resources and is now
called “19th Century Masterfile.”23
Implementation of indexing techniques developed for the first manuscript version at Yale and
used in subsequent editions, the coverage and scope ambitions of the 1853 edition, and the new
cooperative modeling of outsourcing work among libraries implemented in the 1882 edition
make the Index an example worth investigating. Poole’s Index is also representative of
librarianship because it was created in the context of libraries. Not only did it seek to solve a
reference issue specifically of interest to libraries, it was created by a librarian and originally
based not on all existing published periodicals, but on those held by the library for which it was
created. The Index is also a critical case: Poole’s Index was a formative, significant work that a)
provided the first means of access to periodical content in American libraries; b) influenced how
and in what ways libraries index periodicals; and c) is still in use today in the form of 19th
Century Masterfile from Paratext LLC. Poole’s Index “inaugurated a bibliographical form which
became one of the basic cornerstones of library service in the United States.”24 Finally, Poole’s
Index makes an appropriate case because there is much that can be learned from the existing
historical data. The Newberry Library in Chicago holds 13 linear feet of primary source

3.2.2 The Washington County (MD) Free Library book wagon
Bookmobiles may seem ubiquitous and commonplace in today’s libraries, but prior to the 20th
century, such a concept did not yet exist in American librarianship. This case covers what is
now generally considered to be the first bookmobile program in the United States: the
development of the traveling book-wagon of the Washington County Free Library (WCFL) in
Maryland. At the turn of the 20th century, Washington County, a region approximately 75 miles
northwest of Baltimore, was experiencing a period of growth and prosperity. The convergence of
railroads and the development of local industry influenced the rapid growth of the county. The
city of Hagerstown, the county seat, increasingly acted as a hub for the local farmers and other
citizens in the rural areas surrounding the town. In 1900, the population of Washington County
numbered almost 50,000 people, with almost 50% living in Hagerstown and the others
distributed throughout the county (an area of approximately 450 square miles). 25

Inspired by the “Thursday Club of Hagerstown,” a local literary society,26 two wealthy men,
Edward Mealey and Benjamin Newcomer, concerned with a lack of high culture they felt
necessary for the up-and-coming town, decided that a public library was just the thing to help
bridge the perceived cultural void.27 Together they pledged money and land for a free public
library. But because the main unit of government in Maryland is at the county level, this library
was specifically intended to serve the dual demographics of the area: the citizens of the town and
the rural residents in the surrounding county, “the latter, being in my judgement a most important
feature of the work, as there is no class of the community to be more benefited [sic] than
farmers’ sons and daughters during long winter evenings by a supply of useful reading matter.”28

52
From the outset, the entirety of the Washington County Free Library and all of its collections,
tools, and services, was intended to serve not only the citizens of Hagerstown, but residents
throughout the county, including far-flung rural areas. Hired in 1901 as the inaugural WCFL
librarian, Mary Lemist Titcomb, a 44-year-old librarian from New England, was tasked with
serving these dichotomous sets of patrons. She attempted to address this issue through the
implementation of a system of book deposit stations strategically placed throughout the county in
places easily accessible to rural dwellers like local post offices, general stores, tollgates, and
even private homes.29 The success of these deposit stations—which were serviced through the
exchange of books brought by wagon every 60-90 days—quickly evolved into more frequent and
direct delivery of books.
Although Titcomb did not invent the idea of “travelling libraries,” what sets this case apart is the
creation of a comprehensive, systematic plan for delivering books to remote locations as well as
the influential impact of the project on both libraries and other organizations in the United States
and around the world.30 In addition to its embeddedness in librarianship and evidence of
influential impact, abundant records regarding the development and deployment of the WCFL
book wagon are held by the Western Maryland Regional Library, including annual reports from
the years of book wagon service and scrapbooks containing letters, press clippings, and other
correspondence regarding Titcomb.

3.2.3 The eXtensible Catalog (XC)
This case investigates the design and development of the eXtensible Catalog (XC), open-source
software intended to connect library users with resources in a more user-friendly way.31 XC is
not a catalog in the traditional sense of library catalogs. XC is a suite of software tools that
transform, synchronize, and afford the display of library metadata representing multiple resource
formats and collections of library resources, ostensibly in a way that is more usable by librarians
and patrons in modern academic and research libraries. While this may seem old hat when
viewed in the context of contemporary systems for searching and accessing library materials, at
the time of XC’s development in the early 21st century, systems that supported robust library
metadata informed by new standards and models and provided more user-friendly interfaces
were still relatively new and not yet ubiquitous in library systems, even those from commercial
vendors.32
The eXtensible Catalog consists of the following four software products:


The XC OAI Toolkit, which synchronizes MARC metadata within a library’s integrated
library system (ILS) to ensure it remains current with other instances of metadata in other
systems



The XC NCIP Toolkit, which provides the capability to display circulation status and
data and synchronize with the data in the ILS



The XC Metadata Services Toolkit, which aggregates, normalizes, and transforms
metadata from various sources and of varying quality into a standardized schema that
enables interface interactions like faceted browsing and resource relationships



The XC Drupal Toolkit, which supplies a customizable, feature-rich end-user library
interface

These products may be used together to create new interactions with library resources, or they
may be used individually or in smaller combinations to provide varying levels of function
according to a particular organization’s need.
Like the previous cases, XC is representative of librarianship because it was created by libraries,
for libraries. XC seeks to solve specific library problems involving unification and display of
resources for end users, as well as offering tools to librarians to enable and manage these
improved user experiences. It also represents the user-centered turn that became increasingly
prominent in the 21st century, as opposed to previous notions that focused on internal efficiency
that would eventually benefit users down the line.33 Additionally, this case is critical, as it is a
rare example of a self-identified design project in librarianship that is not architectural (i.e.,
buildings or furniture). XC explicitly describes itself as design:
“The University of Rochester libraries have long followed a user-centered design process
for improving existing systems, adding new features, and dreaming up new tools…we
were not simply conducting a study; we were conducting a participatory, collaborative
process of co-creation. We were designing and developing XC—a software suite for

Library Quarterly 67, no. 3 (1997).

55
harnessing the power of library metadata to search simultaneously across multiple silos
and present unified results in more useable ways…”34
Additionally, the recent nature of the project contributes diversity to the time frames covered in
this study, and also means that the software is still available and functional for review and
analysis, and documentation has not yet become unavailable. Project participants are still
available for consultation via interviews (see the Appendix for sample interview questions).

3.3 Project activities and expected outcomes
Unlike a traditional scientific study, where analysis of data leads to a singular set of
generalizable findings, the goal of this research is to offer a unique interpretation to help further
understanding. When I argue that design is an appropriate lens through which to view American
librarianship, I do not intend to imply that it is the singular correct way to understand
librarianship. In the tradition of more humanistic inquiry, I offer one possible interpretation—
that of librarianship as a design epistemology—and I rely on credible sources of evidence to
justify my interpretation. As such, the expected outcome is not a definitive conclusion, but a
reliable and legitimate interpretation, meaning that that sources of data drawn on in the study are
trustworthy and dependable, and that I as the researcher demonstrate sufficient insight regarding
the data.35 Unlike traditional scientific research that aims to generate predictive theories and
prove hypotheses, this line of research need not rule out other competing interpretations to
demonstrate the validity of this one. Rather, this research relies on two factors for assessing
outcomes: 1) that the interpretation is novel (that is, it has not been put forth previously), and 2)
that the interpretation is possible and legitimate because of its basis in trustworthy and credible

34
35

Foster and others, “Introduction,” vi-vii.

56
sources of evidence. The former point is demonstrated in the review of literature and research in
the field. The latter point is demonstrated though triangulation of evidence from multiple
sources, careful authentication of source materials though provenance, and continued
documentation of such provenance so lines of evidence can always be traced.36 I implement
these aspects of rigor by consulting as many primary and secondary sources as possible for each
case, verifying the provenance of those sources, and carefully documenting and referencing
them. To ensure sources are explicitly documented in my own work, I use Chicago Manual of
Style footnotes, which are appropriate when “immediate knowledge of the sources is essential to
readers.”37 This style of reference also more clearly represents both the citation and provenance
of archival, manuscript, and other documentary sources drawn upon in this work. Such attention
to reliability of evidence is key to composing a thorough and persuasive argument.
To demonstrate and communicate my interpretation of American librarianship as a design field, I
rely on descriptive narrative relating the identified elements of design epistemology to artifacts,
processes, actions, and other occurrences in each case. Subsequent to the descriptive narratives, I
synthesize the understandings drawn from my analysis by reflecting on the cases, both
individually and holistically, and how the ways in which they do (or do not) represent design

Chapter 4 Elements of Design Epistemology in American Librarianship
4.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses the ways in which elements of design epistemology identified and defined
in previous chapters manifest in the three cases under critical analysis in this study: Poole’s
Index to Periodical Literature, the Washington County (MD) Free Library (WCFL) book wagon,
and the eXtensible Catalog (XC) project. The presence and nature of elements of design
epistemology previously identified and defined in Chapter 2 (see Table 2.1) will be discussed in
the context of each case with examples drawn from across the cases where relevant and
applicable.

4.2 Creation of problem solutions
4.2.1 Artifacts
As mentioned in Chapter 3.2, each example case in this study reflects the story of an artifact—a
tool or service created for the purpose of library service. The first artifact is Poole’s Index,
although the artifact of the Index is represented by multiple editions, printings, and other
variations. In this case the artifact is not necessarily solely the physical object, such as the set of
books that instantiates the Index, but rather the intangible conceptual artifact that is the Index.
We might be able to think of this in terms of the FRBR work level – an intellectual creation that
subsequently becomes instantiated in various editions, manifestations, and items.1 But, as
previously noted in the discussion of artifacts, physical materiality is not a requirement to be
considered a design artifact.

for the Bibliographic Universe (Library of Congress Cataloging Distribution Service, 2004), accessed June 3,

59
Unlike the abstract work of Poole’s index, the WCFL book wagon itself is a physical artifact.
Yet in addition to being a physical artifact, the book wagon service is also an intangible
intellectual construct of procedures, schedules and routes. Thus, like Poole’s index, it is an
intangible conceptual service design instantiated through physical media like wood, metal, and
wheels.
Artifacts in the XC project are also intangible conceptual artifacts, in that they represent a service
for transforming and displaying metadata and other library bibliographic information. However,
unlike the previous two cases, XC artifacts are instantiated in digital form. Although digital
forms seem intangible in that we as humans cannot directly touch the electronic bits and bytes,
digital objects are also physical objects. Digital media have physical materialities, such as the
physical infrastructure that enables them to be viewed and manipulated.2 Thus even digital
artifacts can in a way be considered as physical artifacts.
4.2.2 Wicked problems
Each of the design artifacts in the three cases under review reveal clear evidence of attempts to
solve what is known as a “wicked problem”—a large social problem that is highly complex and
interconnected. Wicked problems have no right or wrong solutions, only better or worse ones.
Every solution changes the problem, and every solution is a symptom of another problem,
therefore, wicked problems have no stopping rule.3

Poole’s Index set out to solve an important problem of information access: how to find and
access articles within periodicals by subject.
“Although we have every General index that has been issued by the publishers of the
several Reviews and Magazines, yet several hundred volumes of Standard Periodicals in
our library, are comparatively useless, as works of reference, from the want of proper
Indexes. Nearly all of these have been issued within the last twenty years, and contain the
most elaborate discussions of those questions that have interested the literary and political
world, during that period. The object of this work is, to bring within the reach of the
general reader, the contents of these volumes.”4
The informational content within periodical articles—very current and useful information—was
inaccessible, unless you already knew in which periodical to look. This is a complex problem,
interconnected with other aspects of the time. One major complexity affecting access to
periodical information was the rise in popularity of periodical publications in the first half of the
19th century.5 Periodicals were a relatively new format for disseminating information. Unlike
books and pamphlets of the time, which usually focused on one topic and were published in one
self-contained volume, periodicals covered a vast variety of subjects within a single volume, and
printed ongoing volumes. Because they were printed so frequently, periodicals also offered
insights into very contemporary thoughts and scholarship. Periodicals were also more accessible
to everyday society, while books were more often limited to the literary elite, and so periodicals
could reach (and influence) a much larger and more diverse group of readers.6 The growth and

influence of periodicals is highly interconnected with the problem of providing intellectual
access to them.
Some periodical titles did offer access to intellectual content within their own volumes by
printing regular indexes for specific titles. However, there was no tool that provided intellectual
access across multiple periodical titles. The 1848 edition of the Index was Poole’s solution to this
problem. However, while it was useful in solving the problem of subject access to periodicals
within the Society library, like all wicked problems, this solution demonstrated the symptom of
another problem, one of local coverage vs. universal access. Non-Society members who
purchased the Index for use in their libraries soon found that both the holdings and the location
information for the periodicals were local to the Society library; that is, the Index only included
entries for articles contained in periodical titles and volumes possessed by the Society library (so
if your library had other additional titles, the Index could not help you locate information within
them). The pagination information given in the Index was local to the bound volumes in the
Society library (which differed from the pagination information in the periodicals themselves):
“If the Index is used with other editions than those in our Library, the pages, of course, will not
correspond, but the volumes will…”7
The next edition of the Index in 1853 addressed a larger scope of periodicals and used
universally accessible volume and pagination information, but the high growth rate of periodical
literature was unanticipated. Even as it was published, it was already out of date. Several
solutions were attempted to address this issue. Some libraries bound or rebound their copies of

the Index with blank sheets interleaved at regular intervals so as to provide room to handwrite in
additional references, such as the copy now held by the Newberry Library (see Figure 4-1).

Poole kept determinedly working toward a new edition of the Index, “much enlarged and entirely
remodeled, and the references brought down to the close of the year 1863,” incorporating a plan
to issue future supplements to address the ever-continuing nature of periodical publication.8 And
if periodical publications had remained at a consistent number, with the same amount of titles
publishing new volumes, this plan might have worked. But new periodical titles—not just new

volumes of existing titles, but entirely new publications—multiplied like rabbits.9 Poole quickly
became overwhelmed by this “wealth of new material that has appeared since [the] last
edition,”10 despite consecrating all his spare time to indexing work.11 New titles covered
heretofore unaddressed topics, and Poole observed that the diversity of subject coverage also
increased,12 thus contributing to the problem. Preparation of a new edition was still underway in
1869. It is unknown how much of the indexing work had been completed, but Poole hoped that if
financial support and commitment from a publisher could manifest, the new edition could be in
out in two years’ time.13 But no such support was found (despite attempts in 1870 to persuade the
Smithsonian to take on the role).14 In the meantime, other librarians were compiling indexes and
supplementary materials individually, creating an inefficient duplication of work across
libraries.15 The inability to produce a new index in twenty years of trying was a symptom of the
new wicked problem of how periodical indexing could keep up with the growth of periodical
literature.
In 1876, at the first meeting of what would subsequently become the American Library
Association, members agreed that the earlier editions of Poole’s Index had been useful solutions

for library periodical access, despite their flaws.16 A plan was devised to create a third edition, a
cooperative venture with indexing help from librarians across the country.
“The plan, in brief, was this: I would print and send to all the principal libraries a list of
periodicals which it was desirable to index, on which such complete sets as the library
had would be checked and the lists returned to me. Having received these lists, I would
make an equitable distribution of the work, taking a full share of it myself, and giving to
the larger libraries more, and to the smaller libraries less. Each library would engage to
index according to a code of rules which would be furnished the set or sets of periodicals
allotted to it, and send the references to me, who would revise, arrange, and incorporate
the same with the matter of the edition of 1853 and with the work of all the other
contributors. I would assume all the pecuniary responsibilities incurred, employ such
assistance as was needed, print the work, and furnish a copy to each contributing
library.”17
The work took six years and was not without exposing other interconnected problems, such as
how to standardize forms of entry amongst more than 50 indexers.
Poole’s Index also revealed symptoms of the interconnectedness inherent in wicked problems in
the conflation of access, inventory and location information. While the Index may communicate
to a user which articles were in which magazines, it did not communicate whether a library had
those materials in its collection or, if it did, where they could be found within the library. We
know these problems emerged from Poole’s Index because evidence of solution attempts exist.
For instance, a librarian at Drexel University noted in 1902 the creation of “a list of the indexed

periodicals contained in the library posted in a conspicuous place near the indexes.”18 At the
Newberry Library, a date and volume key to Poole’s Index published by ACRL19 includes call
numbers penciled in next to the each title held in the Newberry’s collection (see Figure 4-2).
Even as late as 1997, a binder of information documenting the holdings at the Newberry,
including the date runs of each journal held, was created by Anna Smith (see Figure 4-3). All of
these solution attempts reveal symptoms of new problems documenting and communicating
desirable inventory and location information and demonstrate their interconnectedness to the
problems of subject access.

Poole’s Index, as well as its affiliated tools, offers many attempted solutions to solve the wicked
problem of periodicals access. But, like all wicked problems, no solution is final: there is no
stopping rule. Even today, libraries and other information providers struggle with providing
access to periodicals, which is interconnected with even more aspects, such as models of
publishing, content ownership questions, and intellectual content creation. And like all wicked
problems, we cannot go back to the beginning and start over from a clean slate—everything that

68
occurred in the design of Poole’s Index, from the intellectual constructs of which metadata to
record and how, to the materials used to instantiate it, changes the problem for the next attempt.
***
The Washington County (MD) Free Library (WCFL) book wagon also represents one solution in
an ongoing attempt to solve what can only be viewed as a wicked problem. One characteristic of
wicked problems is that they have multiple stakeholders and various potential framings. Such
differing influences and perspectives can been seen in WCFL from the start. The founders of the
library and the members of the Board of Trustees had a very different understanding than the
librarian of exactly what problem the library was intended to solve.
The founders and board members viewed the library itself as a solution to the problem of lack of
cultured citizenship in the burgeoning area:
“We believe our community to be one of many noble capabilities. Its people are
characterized by industry, energy and enterprise. Just at present one of its predominant
characteristics is its steady and steadily increasing material and commercial prosperity.
Just on this account however it needs and is likely to need increasingly in the future the
complementing and correcting influence of that culture for which, among other
instructions, a Free Public Library is rightly regarding as standing.”20
However, Mary Lemist Titcomb, WCFL librarian from 1901 until her death in 1932, had a
different interpretation of the problem. Like many librarians of the time period, she was
interested in educating and uplifting the populace through reading. At the time of the library’s

founding and Titcomb’s arrival in Hagerstown, there was only one private high school, which
was unaffordable by most families.21 School attendance was not mandated in the Washington
County area until 1915, leaving many of the residents illiterate or poorly educated.22
Characteristic of the contemporary tenets of the library profession, Titcomb believed educating
the underprivileged was best accomplished via reading library books.23 Although on the surface
the concerns of increasing culture and education seem similar, and are arguably related, the
Board of Trustees was actually more concerned about projecting a positive image to counter the
perceived lack of cultural cache stemming from the negative consequences of urban growth,24
while Titcomb was less concerned with appearances and more interested in social enlightenment
and progressive library services.25
From the outset, WCFL was intended to serve all Washington County residents—urban and rural
alike. Funding for the library came from both the Board of County Commissioners and the
Mayor and Council of Hagerstown: in fact, more financial support came from the county ($1500
per year as opposed to Hagerstown’s $1000), indicating an obligation and a commitment to
serving the rural population.26 Some librarians would have been content to open the doors of the
central library building in Hagerstown on August 27, 1901 and consider their work done by
offering access to all patrons, city and county alike. But although the opening day of the

Washington County Free Library was popularly attended, Titcomb immediately noticed a
demographic discrepancy. In the first six months the library was open, nearly 3,000 Hagerstown
residents had registered with the library, while only a mere 455 rural residents had joined.27
The board was concerned with the lack of arrangements for providing library resources to
country citizens, but seemed to have no solutions, and decided to defer action “until a more
perfect system could be devised.”28 Titcomb, who had not been present at the meeting where the
decision to defer was made,29 decided to respond to this perceived need by establishing what she
called “branch libraries” in each of the 26 voting districts of the county.30 Despite the title, these
were not branches as we think of them today, but rather as follows:
“For want of a better title we dignify by the name of branches the small collections of
books placed at various points in the county for the use of the public. Each Branch
consists of an assortment of fifty fresh readable books, in a case somewhat after the
traveling library order, placed, as a rule, in the general store or post office. The books
remain either sixty or ninety days in charge of the merchant or postmaster, as the case
may be, and are then returned to the central library for an exchange.” 31
Patrons could browse books at the branches, or send requests for specific items to the library to
be delivered when the books at the branches were exchanged and replaced. The branch service
was provided for free to the public, with the library taking responsibility for the cases,
transportation and postage.32 Approximately 10% of the total library circulation in the first year

of operation occurred via these branches. In the following year, circulation to these “deposit
stations” (as they became known) nearly doubled, and the number of stations rose from 23 to
38.33
“Requests for books on special topics from individuals living in the villages in which
branches were established last year have become more frequent showing that the library
is coming to be regarded as an integral part of the county at large. 5262 volumes have
gone from the central library to these stations with a circulation record of 12291, or an
average of one book for every three persons in the county exclusive of Hagerstown.”34
Circulation via deposit station continued to rise over the next five years (although not to the same
extent as that first year). These deposit stations were certainly a solution to the problem of
distributing reading material to county residents. If this were a tame problem, the deposit stations
might have indicated a complete, perfect solution. However, like all wicked problems, there are
no good or bad solutions, only better or worse ones. Given the choice between accessibility of
reading materials solely at the Hagerstown library building vs. at deposit stations throughout the
county, the implementation of deposit stations was certainly a better solution than the
Hagerstown branch alone. But it was still not an ideal solution. Titcomb knew that people living
on isolated farms or far back in the mountains were not inclined to purposefully go to the deposit
stations, much less the Library itself.35 She notes that “at no time was [a deposit station] an
economical way of serving the country for there was too little opportunity to consult the
individual tastes of the borrowers, and it sometimes happened that cases of books would go out

and remain for the allotted sixty days, to have it discovered upon return that most of them had
never been taken from the shelf.”36 The cost of the deposit service was high, and many people in
the remotest parts of the county were still not reached.37 New problems had emerged: the deposit
stations could not reach everyone, and even when they did place books in the remote areas, there
was no guarantee the country people would read them. Titcomb herself, in a history of the
WCFL, wrote:
“On the whole a review of the work of the first year of the Library’s existence shows that
it at once established itself as an educational, recreational and democratizing influence in
the community, bringing all classes of people to it and entering all types of homes…But
it had not yet become a County Library. Here indeed the management embarked upon an
uncharted sea. How best to manage the practical distribution of the books? How most
quickly to dispel the feeling in the country that the library would only benefit the
professional classes?”38
Although the problem of getting books to rural regions had certainly been solved, the problem of
getting books to rural people—and therefore encouraging and supporting their reading—had not.
The solution to one problem had become the symptom of another problem. Titcomb realized that
it wasn’t enough to bring books to the country, but that country dwellers were unaware and
uninterested in books and reading.39 As the quote above notes, rural residents felt that the library
was inapplicable and irrelevant to their lives and work, demonstrating not just a problem of
marketing and public relations on the part of the library, but an ongoing tension between city and

county class levels and structures. The problem in this situation thus becomes not just about
distributing reading material to patrons, but navigating and even changing people’s sentiments
and perceptions—no easy task.
These above identified and articulated problems come from the perspectives of the trustees and
the librarian—not the rural citizens (i.e., the end users served by the design solution). Had the
rural patrons been asked, they likely would not have seen any problem present that a library
would solve. Rather, they originally felt they might be better served by their tax support money
going towards a hospital or mill.40 Such vastly differing perspectives from various stakeholders
are another indication of a problem’s wickedness.
In addition to complicated diverging and overlapping beliefs about the mission and purpose of
the library and how it could serve both city and county as well as educate the uninformed
citizenry, other interconnected factors afforded and constrained the problem. Budget limitations
were an ongoing issue. In the early years of the library, the trustees realized that the library
budget was insufficient to pay for itself. In 1902, early attempts to secure funding from Andrew
Carnegie were denied on the grounds that Carnegie limited funding to construction of a physical
building, which WCFL already had.41 The problem of serving the county was also
interconnected with the problem of access—specifically physical geographical access. By 1904,
the number of deposit stations had increased to 55, 25 of which were inaccessible by railroad,
trolley, or stage coach.42 To reach these stations for restocking and delivering requested

materials, the library’s janitor,43 Joshua Thomas, was required to make an average of three trips
per month over rocky roads through rough mountainous terrain in a hired horse-drawn wagon.44
“It was then than the idea of a wagon designed especially for this purpose began to ferment in the
mind of the librarian. The visits of the janitor had already done much to establish cordial
relations between the Library and its patrons.”45
Titcomb pitches her potentially “better” solution idea to the trustees:
“A ‘Library Wagon’ constructed purposely for the transportation of the cases and also
built to carry an assortment of books which could be left at houses along the route is
another step in the county work which the librarian is anxious to attempt. Families could
in this way select directly from the wagon and when Mr. Thomas returned two months or
three months later as the case might be these books could be returned and a fresh
assortment loaned. In the meantime neighborhoods could lend books thus borrowed
among themselves.”46
This clearly demonstrates both the lack of stopping rule and the search for ever better solutions.
In addition to book delivery, Titcomb intended the wagon to be an “outward and visible sign”
advertising library services and also to facilitate building trust and friendship through
interpersonal interactions.47 Thus the idea of the book wagon aimed to solve not only the
problem of delivery and access to library materials, but also to assist with outreach, marketing,
advocacy, and public relations—a set of entangled interconnections indeed.

The case of the eXtensible Catalog reveals multiple wicked problems that motivated its design
and development. The idea for XC began at the River Campus Libraries at the University of
Rochester in upstate New York, around 2005. Inspired by several other projects already
underway at the library, as well as ongoing dissatisfaction with the ability of commercial library
vendor products to meet the desires of library users, two staff members—Jennifer Bowen, then
head of cataloging and currently associate dean, and David Lindahl, the library’s webmaster and
director of digital initiatives at the time—applied for a grant from the National Science
Foundation to create an alternative solution to current library catalog products: an open source
library catalog interface that would offer a unified display resources from a variety of the
library’s collections, both physical and digital.48
“I think the initial impetus for the project was that we were so frustrated with our
vendor… there were several projects all getting started at the same time that really were
born out of developers who were just so frustrated with the OPACs and the limitations of
what we could do to show our patrons what was in our collections and the relationships
between the things in our collections. So that was the initial reason we did it.”49
However, they were met with an issue right away when their grant was rejected by NSF:
although they intended to create something more useful to library users, feedback from the
granting agency indicated the beginnings of a wicked problem: they needed to include more, and
more robust, user research to demonstrably ensure that whatever they created would legitimately

reflect real users’ needs.50 Right off the bat, the problem of creating a new catalog showed signs
of being tightly interconnected with issues of thoroughly understanding users’ needs. It also
demonstrated the idea of problem-finding, and how integral it is to tackling wicked problems: the
recommended user research would assist the XC team in finding and defining what the real
problem (or problems) underlying current library catalogs and related research interactions were.
The original goal of the project was to “support the development of an open source public access
catalog system for research and college libraries.”51 More specifically, this open source catalog
would “unify access to traditional and digital library resources.”52 Much of the focus was on a
user interface that would offer the potential to allow library users to “get more out of academic
library collections” and “give academic libraries more control over how best to help people
gather information.”53
After consideration of this feedback, Bowen and Lindahl incorporated a significant user research
component to the project. This component was headed by Nancy Fried Foster, an anthropologist
who had been temporarily hired by the University of Rochester Library to work on a previous
grant funded project. Her contributions to that project were so successful that the Library hired
her full-time, and she is now known within the American library community for holding the first
permanent full-time anthropologist position in a library. After adding the anthropological user
research portion to the grant, it was resubmitted to and subsequently funded by the Andrew W.

Mellon foundation in March 2006.54 “Developing the XC System – Improving Access to Library
Resources,” (also referred to as the “Phase I” grant by the XC team) supported the development
of an open source public access catalog system for research and college libraries through the
provision of funds not for building or developing the catalog itself, but rather for planning that
development.55
Early goals of XC were ill-defined from the outset: XC was going to allow library users to “get
more out of academic collections” and “give academic libraries more control over how best to
help people gather information” 56—but neither of these offered solid definitions. What did it
mean to “get more” out of a library collection? Did it mean patrons could check out more books?
Did it mean patrons would see more search results on a single screen? Did it mean patrons would
see more diverse types of resources in their search results? Many readers probably assumed that
“getting more” out of a library catalog meant that users would get more of whatever they
wanted—types of formats, connections among resources, semantic responses, intellectual insight
and assistance—but the way this solution was articulated reflects the epitome of an ill-defined
wicked problem. If the solution is “getting more,” what, exactly do current catalogs offer less of?
Thankfully, the description of XC and its goals quickly and continually evolved, each time
attempting to articulate problems more concretely. At the start of the planning stage in early
2006, XC was described “in a nutshell” as “an open source system that libraries can download
and install as an alternative way for users to access their resources.”57 XC was described to
potential project partners in a late 2006 letter as “both an end-user application and a platform to

be available as open source software,” functioning alongside an ILS to provide library users with
access to all formats of library resources with an easier, more intuitive, customizable interface
that also provided connections to other applications, such as learning management systems or
other courseware.58 By the end of Phase I, XC was described as:
“an open-source system that will unify access to traditional and digital library resources.
XC will help research library users at any level of proficiency get more out of diverse
library collections through a simple yet powerful interface that provides comprehensive
results sorted into useful categories. For libraries, XC will provide an extensible metadata
platform supporting multiple schemas that can be searched simultaneously to support
FRBR-like functionality and navigation. XC will integrate easily with functionality from
other library applications, such as metasearch. And XC will search across digital and
legacy content.”59
The wickedness of the problems in the XC project become clear when we look at the change in
aims over the course of the project. Note the changes in focus from the broad and somewhat
vague high-level description of XC as “alternative access to resources” compared with the
following year’s more concrete description of exactly what solutions XC will provide. Early
descriptions of the project, such as the first grant application and subsequent announcements
about approval and funding described the goals of XC in terms of academic library end users,
allowing them to “get more out of academic collections”60 by bringing together physical and
digital library materials in a single interface for access. Partway through Phase I we can see

increasing references to metadata—a back-end function—rather than just a discussion of end
user interactions, as it became clear to the team that interface and metadata were inseparably
interconnected. Any attempt to solve the former problem must involve an attempt to solve the
latter. Bowen discussed the five overarching goals of XC during this phase:
1. Provide access to all library resources, digital and non-digital;
2. Bring metadata about library resources into a more open Web environment;
3. Provide an interface with new Web functionality such as Web 2.0 features and faceted
browsing;
4. Conduct user research to inform system development;
5. Publish the XC code as open-source software;
and their tight interconnections and implications for metadata and metadata requirements.61 For
instance, to achieve the goal of providing access to all physical and digital resources, the system
must be capable of acquiring and managing metadata in a variety of formats from a variety of
sources, and handle multiple metadata schemas. That is, bringing together descriptions of
resources of disparate formats and collections (such as physical books, digital journal articles,
digital images; special collections materials, etc.) to be represented together in a single user
interface depended on standardized metadata among all those resources. But differing formats
and collections by their very nature often use different metadata standards, such as MARC for
books; Dublin Core for institutional repositories; EAD for archival collections, and so on. Thus a
new, interconnected problem of how to achieve metadata that described all of these resources
needed to be addressed in order to solve the problem of presenting those resources together.

eXtensible Catalog, Phase 1,” Information Technology and Libraries 52, no. 2 (June 2008), 6-19.

80
Creating an interface that displayed results from all collections required more than just interface
design—it required specific metadata, thus adding another level of complexity to the problem
that, as the XC team quickly learned, could not be separated out. Bowen’s detailed requirements
for XC metadata reveal a number of interconnected, wicked problems. The influence of this
wicked interconnection is also revealed in the descriptive shift in XC rhetoric. The 2007 press
release for the Phase 2 grant funding announcement describes XC as “a set of open-source
software applications libraries can use to share their collections.”62 By 2008, XC was being
referred to as “a unique set of software toolkits” that “provide a metadata infrastructure which
will facilitate the reuse of metadata in any number of web applications and systems,”63
demonstrating a shift of emphasis to metadata and back-end functionality rather than previous
descriptions which focused on patrons’ interactions with library collections. And by the press
release in July 2009, XC was described as “a common open-source framework for enhancing and
enriching metadata for libraries and other cultural institutions,”64 relegating user interfaces and
interactions to the background.
As discussed in previous chapters, another characteristic that makes problems wicked is differing
perspectives among stakeholders. Examination of any software development process is likely to
uncover multiple primary and secondary stakeholders, and XC was no exception. Lindahl, in
charge of software architecture for the project, was astutely aware of this issue. He notes that
stakeholders for a given design put forth specific requirements and then want to know what the
solution will look like. But, he added, “the problem is that they’re not only one with a

requirement.”65 Multiple stakeholders have differing needs, some of which may come into
tension with one another, and all of which certainly influence what the ultimate design result will
be.
Conflicting requirements from diverse stakeholders often contribute to a problem’s wickedness,
but with XC some interesting shifts became evident. From the outset, it was clear that the goals
of XC served at least two potentially conflicting masters: library patrons and library staff.
Although the original goals of XC focused more on interfaces to serve end users, as the focus
shifted to the metadata necessary to support those goals, so too did the influence of the
stakeholders:
“The interesting thing about the eXtensible Catalog is a lot of the interfaces were
interfaces for librarians. Like, metadata experts who would manipulate metadata. Or
system admins who might run the processing steps, schedule them.”66
Other stakeholder interactions occurred with the shifting aims to incorporate interaction between
XC and other applications such as learning management systems. For example, the Dublin Core
Education Application Profile Task Group67 use case for XC identifies primary actors,
demonstrating evidence of additional stakeholders beyond library patrons and staff. 68

One activity of the Dublin Core Education Community is developing an application profile module describing
usage of DCMI properties specifically relevant to education. The phrase “application profile module” refers to
the scope of the profile: it only includes properties relevant to describing the educational aspects of any resource,
and/or the educational context within which it has been or may be used. The intention is that the DC-Education
Application Profile will be usable with other application profiles. See http://dublincore.org/groups/education for

Wicked problems are also characterized by the lack of a stopping rule. That is, every solution
attempt creates new problems and opportunities for solutions, rather than offering a complete,
ultimate solution. XC clearly demonstrates this idea throughout its course of progress. As
attempts were made to solve problems with catalog user interfaces, new problems of metadata
needs and requirements emerged. As solutions were put forth for new metadata, software to
transform and share metadata became necessary. When asked how she knew XC was done,
Bowen commented not on the release of software or deployment of new catalog interfaces,
which could presumably could always be ongoing with new developments, but rather that she
knew the project was done because the grant funding had ended.69 Even as XC moved toward the
release of the software toolkits, issues of sustainability and maintenance arose, prompting the
formation of a new institutional entity, the eXtensible Catalog Organization (XCO), to manage
the project beyond the end of the allotted grant funding.70
4.2.3 Problem finding, framing and reframing
The characteristics of wicked problems make them difficult to tackle. After all, if I asked you to
sit down and solve the problem of periodicals access, where would you even begin? Design
epistemology offers knowledge and techniques to address wicked problems through problem
finding, framing, and reframing. In design, finding the problem can be just as important, if not
more so, than solving the problem. Finding a problem is not so much going into the world
finding a wrong to be righted, but finding the specific context (often called a domain) in which a
problem is situated. Identifying design domains is a key part of the design process, bringing a
larger abstract wicked problem into a specific, concrete context that is explicitly addressable.

83
Making decisions regarding these domain aspects, such as which are flexible, which are fixed,
and which to prioritize, helps designers frame a problem. Poole’s Index demonstrates excellent
examples of framing. From its first edition on, Poole frames the problem of periodicals access in
a very specific way: as he saw it, the issue stemmed from lack of subject access to these
materials. “The plan of the work is to furnish a concise and convenient reference to the contents
of these volumes, and to this end, generally but a single reference is made to an article, under the
most prominent Word of its Subject.”71 Poole also specifically framed the problem within the
domain of the Society library. Poole says “The first edition of my Index…was intended only for
use in that library,”72 and that “the work was begun with no reference to publication, but merely
to furnish for the Library [of the Brothers in Unity] a manuscript copy containing about one-third
of the matter of the present volume.”73 Framing the problem squarely in the Society library
affected not only the scope and content coverage (only periodicals owned by the Society library
were indexed), but also set the framing of the problem for a particular user group: students who
were members of the Society of Brothers in Unity,74 and thus a group of users with vastly
different characteristics than, say, genteel ladies of the time. Poole explicitly adhered to the
student-as-user throughout all the editions of the Index to which he contributed, directing
contributors to index only the articles of interest to the “general student.”75 But even he clarifies
his framing of that domain in a very specific way: “By ‘general student’ I mean the very cultured
general student.”76 In the same letter, he also describes how he frames scope: he directs

contributing indexers to exclude highly scientific and technical articles.77 This leaves others to
take up alternatively framed attempts at solutions, such as H. F. Bassett’s work on a catalogue of
more than 5,000 papers within scientific journals, none of which were included in Poole’s
Index.78
Despite the influence of the ongoing publication of periodicals to the wicked problem of access,
Poole easily frames this factor so that it is essentially eliminated from consideration:
“The reason you note for not finishing, that, after the 3rd supplement appears, you will
have to go on and make a 4th, & so ad infinitum, I don’t see. It is the reason of the woman
didn’t wash her dishes. Go on, and make the 4th, and the 20th if need be…”79
This particular framing essentially eliminates many of the problems that stemmed from material
limitations of printed catalogs and indexes. Although this made problem solving highly
accessible in the context of a printed index tool—issuing supplementary volumes became the
clear solution—Poole’s framing of the problem in this assumption may arguably have limited
creative alternative approaches to the design of these information tools. Had the framing of the
problem included the need to address ongoing publications and acquisitions, certainly Poole’s
Index in the form we know it would not have sufficed.
Although Poole’s Index demonstrates evidence of problem framing, there is less direct evidence
of problem reframing, which allows designers to look at problems in new contexts or from new
angles. Like the example above, Poole appears very committed to his framing of the problem.

85
However, some evidence of reframing does exist. For example, others reframed the problem in
terms of alternative access points. R.R. Bowker founded The Library Index, a comparable tool
for accessing articles in periodicals, explicitly drawing on the work of Poole’s Index, but adding
additional access points for title and author.80 C. Edward Wall created the Cumulative Author
Index for Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature 1802-1906, saying that “The need for an author
approach to Poole’s Index has been the ‘mote’ troubling the eye of every indexer, scholar,
researcher, librarian and general reader ever to come in contact with the tool.”81
Like Poole’s Index, the WCFL was influenced by a particular problem framing. Titcomb
repeatedly emphasizes the goal of serving the rural residents of Washington County, as opposed
to other goals. This offers a particular specific framing of library service, one which is reinforced
by the founders and financial supporters of the library, who emphasized serving the entire county
as well as the town.82
Although the evidence of how Titcomb’s specific framing of library services is well-evident, less
can be said for evidence of reframing. In fact, Titcomb’s stance regarding the library as outreach
service changed very little during her tenure as WCFL librarian. Although there is little evidence
of problem reframing, if the reframing is interpreted more broadly we can see how it may have
occurred in the WCFL book wagon case. Instead of reframing the problem, Titcomb seems to
possibly reframe the possible boundary of potential solutions—what we might describe today as
“thinking outside the box.” Titcomb reframed the idea of the traditional library “branch” (the

term for deposit station at the time) by looking beyond the possibilities of a set physical space
people needed to visit to acquire books. “The book goes to the man not waiting for the man to
come to the book.”83 While this may not be the typical approach to reframing, Titcomb’s ability
to reframe potential solutions arguably offers the potential for innovative ideas.
Although there is little evidence of reframing in Poole’s Index and the WCFL book wagon,
reframing is much more clearly evident in the case of XC, especially in the previously mentioned
shift in the project’s focus from user interface interactions to library staff tools.
“We were trying to develop an open source discovery system but then we quickly
realized that we needed an open source metadata platform that was pretty robust to be
able to deliver the kind of front end that we wanted to deliver.”84
The reframing of XC from a patron-focused discovery system to a staff-focused toolkit had an
immense impact on the design and development of XC and its ultimate outcomes. One
interesting aspect of the XC is that this front-end-to-back-end reframing is conscious and
explicit. XC demonstrates not only evidence that reframing occurred, but evidence of how that
reframing affected the future of the project, which artifacts were ultimately created and which
features were included.
The reframing of XC was influenced by several factors. The first significant influence stemmed
from the awarding of the Phase I grant from the Mellon Foundation. Lindahl specifically
mentions that this grant was not to be used to fund any actual hands-on development of XC—
only planning for such development.85 This meant that the XC team had to switch gears and

84

87
reassess their approach. A large portion of the Phase I grant was then used to convene a
conference of thought leaders and potential partners who might be knowledgeable about and
interested in the types of problems XC intended to solve. As Lindahl notes, the XC team “ended
up being able to hold a conference that really shaped what XC became.”86 It was at this
conference that attendees offered critical feedback, insights, and suggestions regarding the
development potential and directions of XC. For instance, Eric Lease Morgan raised the issue of
libraries’ ability to control their own data, while Jeremy Frumkin pointed out concerns of scope
management: how, exactly, was XC going to achieve all the myriad goals it claimed to
attempt?87 Based on the specific comments received from these partners, as well as results from a
survey of libraries, by the end of Phase I the scope of XC was refined and reframed to focus
more on metadata tools.88
The framing of a design problem affects all subsequent solution attempts, and every decision
made toward a solution affects the next decision: what Schön calls a “web of moves.”89 XC is a
prime example of moves affecting other moves because of its commitment to reflecting needs
drawn specifically from user research. Findings from user work practice studies informed
decisions regarding XC design features. Foster expressed this eloquently in a blog post where
she described how user needs influence metadata decisions. She draws on an example of
searching for books by size: although traditionally considered an unpopular search strategy, if

88
user research indeed uncovered that library users wanted to find books of certain measurements
it would imply the need to record those measurements in the metadata.
“If we really wanted to help our patrons find items in our OPAC by size, we would need
to include the thickness of each item in our metadata records. Since we don’t currently do
this, we would have to go out and start measure [sic] things like crazy and enter the
information into hundreds of thousands of records. We’re not going to do that, but we
could if we were convinced that it would be worth it.
We may face a similar challenge, depending on what our XC user research discovers, and
what features we think we might want to add to the system. In making our decision, we
will have to consider the costs not just of programming but of adding or massaging
metadata when we decide which of several possible features to build.90
Foster clearly illustrates the web of moves for XC, showing that user research not only affected
decisions about interfaces and presentation (which in turn affect the programming and coding of
those interfaces) but also decisions about metadata. The web of moves of XC, as with most
designs, was far-reaching.
4.2.4 Service orientation
Design differs from other traditions of inquiry because of its inclusion of service as a defining
element.91 The idea of design as improving the state of the world through problem-solving is
interconnected with design’s focus on service. Throughout its history, librarianship has often
been considered a service profession, and so it should come as no surprise that this element of

89
design epistemology is so clearly evident in library artifacts and design processes. Poole’s Index
clearly demonstrates a service orientation from its first printed edition to all the additional tools
and services created around it. As discussed in an earlier section, Poole’s Index was created
under the guise of service to information seekers, to unite them with the content contained within
periodicals. However, the dedication to service in this case goes far beyond the tool itself.
Throughout the history of Poole’s Index, there is an attitude and established precedent of
sacrifice for the purpose of service: the belief that the service provided by this tool was so
valuable to users that the creators and contributors would give freely of their time, labor and
expertise to manifest such an important instrument.
The creation of each iteration of the Index required a great deal of work, most of which was done
in librarians’ free time with no financial compensation. Poole frequently speaks—nay, boasts—
about his work on the Index being a “labor of love,” completed entirely off the clock and without
financial compensation.92 Remembrances of Poole mention that during the preparation of the
1848 edition, he worked in the library after hours until early morning, sleeping in his clothes on
the table.93 Poole claimed to have devoted all of his spare time outside of his duties as Assistant
Librarian at the Boston Athenaeum to the 1853 edition,94 and he himself similarly described his
work on the 1882 edition:
“Not one of the 634 [volumes] credited to the Chicago Public Library was done in the
library working hours. I indexed every one of them myself in my own home twelve miles

from the city after 9 o’clock at night. I carried these vols out in my hands and returned
them in the same way to the library.”95
So devoted was Poole that he dedicated his own personal time in service of the Index, and, in
turn, its users. Although some, like Robert Harrison, thought the proposal for the 1882 edition
might fail due to the lack of follow-through from gratuitous labor, 96 more than 50 librarians—
the majority of whom worked on the Index without pay in off-hours—demonstrated an
incredible commitment to service. “This labor, which has been credited to his library, has usually
been done in hours of his own, taken from rest and recreation. The librarian will have his pay in
the consciousness that what he has done will benefit his library and his readers…”97 Even the
reviews of the Index that included criticisms of the tool itself remarked at and admired the
immense amount of dedication and service that went into it, the “gratuitous and self-sacrificing
labors.” 98 J. Ashton Cross noted that “Nobody wanted librarians to work for nothing, but cooperative labor was not unpaid labor.”99 Time and money would be saved through the division of
labor, and all participating librarians would benefit from the service they contributed when they
could make use of the Index as a bibliographical reference tool in their day-to-day work.
Mary Titcomb also felt strongly drown to the service aspect of librarianship. She herself stated
that “the functions of a library are manifold, but still may all be summed up in one word,-service.”100 Wiegand notes that Titcomb consistently saw the library as an opportunity to

accomplish social good.101 But as with all service enterprises, the question arises: who is being
served, how, and why? When design is not only about what could be, but also what should be,
who decides the “should”? As was common in librarianship of the time, Titcomb evangelically
believed that the less fortunate citizens, the illiterate rural residents, should have access to books
and should improve their literacy, education, and knowledge. Her belief was actually in direct
contrast to the articulated desires of the residents she aimed to improve. Rural residents were
more interested in starting a hospital or a mill than a library.102
But in a designerly fashion, Titcomb is not satisfied to simply give the users what they want. She
sought to give them what they didn’t even know they needed.
“Furthermore, the work of a Library in a community, is never solely to supply known
wants but ever and always to be on the alert to create a demand … The Librarian has
learned that as far as lies within his resources, it is his business to see that the right book
reaches the right person, even if it involves convincing that person that he wants the
book.”103
The book wagon was Mary Titcomb’s method of not only getting the right book to the right
person, but it was used to draw attention to the library and its services, convincing users that a
need existed within them for books that they hadn’t previously realized until the book wagon
came.
XC expresses a service orientation in a different way, through the focus on and advocacy for
open source tools that afford control back to libraries. In addition to the goal of creating a catalog

user interface that they felt would better serve library patrons, the discourse around the project
indicates that XC was also intended to be created in service of libraries. For instance, several of
the articulated goals of XC specifically refer to benefits to be gleaned by libraries, such as
“giv[ing] academic libraries more control over how best to help people gather information” and
offering “inexpensive, flexible alternatives to using off-the-shelf software to provide access to
library collections.”104 Although the early goals of XC were clearly framed in service to both
library patrons and staff, the final deliverables shifted to emphasize service to libraries and
related organizations. XC was explicitly developed in the service of libraries and clearly reflects
a service orientation.

4.3 Generation of knowledge through making
4.3.1 Iteration
The evidence of iteration in all three cases is clear. In Poole’s index, each edition was an iterative
improvement on the one before. Even during the development of his very first index, Poole says
“for a year or more I plodded on, feeling my way in the dark, frequently throwing aside all I had
done and beginning again.”105 The printing of the 1848 edition was an iterative improvement in
the durability, and therefore the usability, of Poole’s original, now no longer existent, manuscript
Index at the Society library. After the printing of the 1848 Index, Poole “again remodeled the
scheme,” implying iterative development.106 The 1853 iteration increased the scope and coverage
of the 1848 Index. It contained all the entries in the 1848 edition plus “six times as much matter
in addition”107: 38 more periodical titles, additional volumes from the extant titles, and entries for

articles published subsequent to the printing of the 1848 edition. Additional improvements
included the attempt to ascertain authorship information for anonymously written articles,108 as
well as altering the localized citations to something more universally applicable.109 The 1882
iteration not only increased the scope and coverage again, but also implemented the cooperative
indexing plan, an improvement in workflow without which the edition would likely not exist.
Iteration is also evident in the 1893 reprint of the 1882 Index: while the intellectual content of
the work remained the same, the use of heavier paper in the 1893 reprint was a iterative response
to the material character of the earlier printing, since many users noted the paper in the 1882
Index quickly became ragged and torn, making it difficult, if not impossible, to use.110 Because
the 1893 reprint used thicker paper, it could not be bound as one single volume, and so in this
iteration the work was divided into two volumes neatly between J and K.111 It is this specific
iteration of Poole’s Index along with its subsequent supplements, that comprise what we
commonly think of when we think of “Poole’s Index” today. We don’t typically think of the
1848 or 1853 editions, leaving them to function more as early prototypes and multiple design
iterations that led to the Index as we now know it.
Like the editions of Poole’s Index, the WCFL book wagon also went through multiple iterations.
The first book wagon started in 1904 as a simple rented Concord wagon, used by Joshua Thomas
to convey books back and forth to the deposit stations.112 By 1907, the rented wagon was
replaced by a custom creation—the aforementioned “Library Wagon” envisioned by Titcomb to

be the herald of library services. The custom-built carriage had shelves along both sides and a
space in the center for storage and transport of book boxes to deposit stations along the route.
Titcomb herself described it as “a cross between a grocer’s delivery wagon and the tin pedlers
[sic] cart of by gone New England days.”113 It held 200 books and five or six boxes and was
pulled by two mules along the county roads.114 But even her first idea quickly revealed the need
for iteration: because the wagon was originally painted black, some rural residents mistook it for
a hearse. In response, Titcomb had the wheels and door panels painted red, demonstrating an
early user-responsive iteration on her original design.115 In 1909, Farrington described it thus:
“Drawn by a pair of sleek horses, it rumbles to the farmer’s gate and the driver throws open a
door on each side, revealing rows of the latest and most desirable books arranged on shelves just
as though they were housed in an alcove of an ordinary library.”116

Titcomb’s idea of using a wagon for rural book delivery was self-admittedly not original.117
However, as previously noted, Titcomb’s design aimed to solve a much more complex problem
than just book delivery. What made Titcomb’s solution different was the interpersonal
interactions with the rural residents. Unlike other existing book wagon services, the WCFL
stopped at more than just deposit stations. It stopped at houses and farms, interacting directly
with residents, offering reading suggestions and advice and taking requests for books to be
brought on the next trip.118 Thus the driver of the wagon has a significant role in the service.
Joshua Thomas, the library’s janitor, had previously been a produce buyer throughout the region,
and so was very familiar with both the roads and the people, opening up avenues of trust in

96
reluctant rural patrons.119 Since many of the rural citizens were unfamiliar with specific books or
titles, the driver quickly emerged as recommender and reader’s advisor.120
By December 1909, there were 16 routes, some taking as long as 4 days to travel. “On his long
trips, the driver spends the nights at farmhouses or at little country hotels.”121 Unfortunately, in
August 1910, the book wagon was completely destroyed in a railroad accident. Titcomb wrote in
that year’s annual report:
“The loss to readers in the County can scarcely be estimated. Families had grown to
depend on its periodical visits and the scope of its work was continually being extended.
To equip as soon as possible another wagon and continue this method of reaching the
rural districts is the most immediate need of the Library.”122
From the time of its destruction, county extension serves were essentially frozen. Deposit
stations were abandoned, and circulation dropped fifty percent.123 Financial constraints prevented
the replacement of the book wagon until William Kealhofer, the treasurer for the Board of
Trustees, generously donated $2500 to the library for the explicit purpose of replacing the book
wagon.124
But rather than procuring another horse-drawn wagon of the same specifications, the library
purchased an International Harvester car with a 22-horsepower engine and solid tires in March
1912.125 The Autobuggy had a custom top with shelves for 300 books and storage for four

deposit cases.126 Although this iteration carried 100 more individual books, it had space for 1-2
fewer cases—clearly a reaction to the increased interest in direct delivery service and reduction
in deposit stations. In addition to servicing deposit stations and delivering books directly to
families, in 1913 the bookmobile also began to be used to transport the school librarian to
classrooms around the county.127 However, it was not without issues. The presence of a librarian
on the traveling routes was key to interpersonal service. “The advantage of sending a trained
library worker out with the wagon is seen in the fact that she is increasingly depended upon to
select the books, and meeting people in their own homes, can study conditions and suit the book
to the individual.”128 But because the car was so heavy, the female library staff could not drive it
themselves, and so a chauffeur was necessary.129

99
In addition to the need for a chauffeur, this second book wagon (and first book automobile)
suffered other problems. First, a series of accidents in 1913 affected its performance.130 In 1915,
car troubles and cold weather made it necessary to send books across the county by parcel post
instead of by automobile:
“Wet days, wet roads and repairs shorten the time of operation…After the second trip in
the Spring, the wagon was in the shop for one month for repairs. Again this Fall—just at
the beginning of our most profitable seasons—two more months were lost for the same
reason, and we were obliged to discontinue the work a month earlier than usual for lack
of a chauffeur. Consequently we were able to cover but one third of the county a second
time, making four trips less than last year.”131
The need for a more durable vehicle that could successfully traverse the rough, mountainous
roads as well as the ever-increasing growth of county services motivated a new iteration on the
WCFL book wagon.132 In 1917, the library purchased a specially equipped Koehler truck, with a
limousine that could accommodate two passengers in addition to the chauffeur. It held 500 books
and six deposit station cases.133 The Koehler provided service for five years, when it began to
show signs of wear.
Around 1921, after considering both the constraints of the county terrain as well as the needs and
convenience of the librarians who traveled with the book wagon, the Koehler was replaced with

a Dodge Business Car.134 This particular iteration was found to be so satisfactory that when it
began to show signs of wear after five years, it was replaced by another of the same make.135

As book wagon service increased, deposit station service lessened. In 1909, two deposit stations
closed because those areas could be better served by the book wagon.136 In 1915, five deposit
stations were abandoned during the year “as it was found that these neighborhoods could be

better served by the automobile.”137 By 1931, deposit station service had been discontinued
altogether.138

Between the stock market crash of 1929, the death of Titcomb in 1932, and the deepening
economic depression in the United States in the 1930s, many WCFL services were reduced or
eliminated—the book wagon among them.139 Book wagon service was reduced starting in 1932

and curtailed entirely in 1940, when the current Dodge Business Car book wagon was sold.140
Funding requests for a new bookmobile were submitted in 1947, 1948 and 1949, but no funds
were allotted for the service.141 Finally, in November 1949, the Board of Trustees decided to use
money from library investments to buy a Studebaker truck.142 Affectionately nicknamed
“Delilah,” this bookmobile was manned by a driver, a librarian, and a library assistant. By 1957,
Delilah made 166 stops per week and had circulated 1,316,594 books (almost one-third of
WCFL’s total circulation).143
New versions of the bookmobile appeared in 1957, 1969, 1985, and 2004, each demonstrating
iterative improvement on the previous model (see Table 4-1). Today, WCFL still relies on
bookmobiles to serve patrons throughout the county.

It also bears noting that the book wagon—and therefore its iterations—are not limited to the
physical material artifact itself. For instance, the routes of the book wagon changed in an
iterative manner throughout the course of book wagon work. Figures 4-8 through 4-10 illustrate
a significant iteration in routes between 1908 and 1910. Sometimes routes were added to reach
new territory; other times routes were changed or consolidated for efficiency: “it has been found
advisable to change or consolidate some of the routes laid out and to increase the territory
covered by others.”144

Iterations in staffing have also been noted, and certainly collections and materials carried by the
book wagon have iteratively been redesigned throughout the years. Although Titcomb might not
have called the practice iteration in so many words, she clearly believed in constant
improvement. She says:
“…let us not forget that only never ceasing activity and watchfulness can make our
institution the library of our dreams ‘Like a circle in the water/Which never ceaseth to
enlarge itself”-until it has reached with its beneficent influence every man, woman and
child in Washington County.”145
Likewise, her position on the library as a living entity means not only constant vigilance,
marketing, and advocacy of the library’s usefulness and benefits to society, but a clear
acknowledgement that any given project is never simply completed and done. She notes that “to
follow a well blazed trail from year to year, may not be reckoned as satisfactory progress,”146
thus indicating the necessary role of iteration in the continuous improvement of library services
and increased reach.
Like Poole’s Index and the WCFL book wagon, XC did not emerge from a vacuum, but rather
was an iteration on projects that came before. Even before the first NSF grant application for XC,
Lindahl and web developer Jeff Suszczynski were working on a prototype user interface called
CUIPID 4 (later abbreviated to C4) that included features like faceted browsing and
metasearch.147 This prototype was later used as proof-of concept for the types of functionality the

XC user interface would provide.148 Iteration also occurred during the development of the XC
schema, the metadata standard created by the team to aggregate, normalize, and transform
metadata among other schemas currently used to describe and represent library collections. As
the XC team attempted to represent Resource Description and Access (RDA) concepts in the XC
schema, they first used Dublin Core (DC) elements directly. But they soon found that some RDA
concepts that needed to be represented in the XC schema had no equivalent terms in DC.
Therefore, in the subsequent XC schema, new, non-DC elements such as “thesisAdvisor” were
added.149 Other iterations occurred based on similar rationale, and the Pre-Release Version of
the XC Schema was published on January 7, 2009. Anything prior to Version 1.0 was considered
“pre-release,” implying that some form of iteration was likely to occur between this and
subsequent released versions.150
Additional iteration in XC was observed as part of the typical software development process.
Iterative versions of the Metadata Services Toolkit, the OAI toolkit, the NCIP toolkit, and the
Drupal user interface are all easily identifiable based on typical software version numbering. For
example, version 1.5.2 of the MST was released in January 2014; 1.5.3 in April 2014; 1.5.4 in
October 2014, and the current version, 1.5.5, in July 2015.151 Where still available, release notes
indicate what changes were made in each new iteration. For instance, version 7.x-1.2 of the
Drupal toolkit fixed a security issue that previously allowed malicious users to access the NCIP
module.152

All of these examples speak to iteration. But in addition to these examples of iteration’s
influence on the process of development and the resulting products, what is interesting about XC
is how such iteration was consciously built into the project itself. The vision and plan for XC was
purposefully evolutionary from the outset and throughout the course of the project.
“Our vision and plan for XC continues to evolve. What started as a vision for getting
around the limitations of our local ILS now looks like a way to bring the potential of
‘Library 2.0’ to any library through open source applications - and makes the vision very
exciting - and might I say ‘extensible?’”153
A commitment to ongoing revision throughout the software development process demonstrates
not just happenstance iteration, but purposeful incorporation:
“Between now [January 2009] and the release of the XC Software in July 2009, we will
continue to refine the definitions of the current XC Normalization and Transformation
Services, and develop the XC Aggregation and Authority Control services. As this work
progresses, we will make additional changes to these services and to the definition of the
XC Schema as needed to support the functionality of the XC software.”154
It was a revamped iteration of the unfunded NSF grant that made the XC project possible.
“Our grant proposals were in [DocuShare], we could look at the versions of the proposals
and we would sort of iterate on them with our program officers, they would give us
feedback. And it’s great to sort of see how you got somewhere.”155

Over time, the descriptions of XC slowly changed from an interface to a suite of software tools.
The iterations of scope and focus that emerged from the Phase I conference shifted the project
from its front-end to back-end focus. The final report from this phase still included discussion of
C4 as a proof-of-concept interface, but the proposed architecture to be developed in Phase 2
began to speak to the modular ideas of multiple softwares, most of which dealt with “back-end”
issues.156 The Phase 2 funding press release described the XC as “a platform for local
development and experimentation that will ultimately allow libraries to share their collections
through a variety of applications, such as Web sites, institutional repositories, and content
management systems.”157 The Phase 2 final report described major achievements in creating
tools for ILS interoperability, metadata management, and the creation of a user interface built on
existing Drupal modules.158 The Phase 2 final report also noted achievements beyond software
development, including contributions to research findings regarding the work practices of library
users, the creation of a non-profit organization to manage future software maintenance and
development, communication and dissemination of project results, and provision of training and
experience with cutting-edge technologies,159 thus showing iteration not just of project elements,
but the goals, objectives, and outcomes of the entire project itself. Additionally, the open source
nature of the project contributed to its iterative character. The Java-based XC tools (the MST,
NCIP and OAI toolkits) were made available under the MIT Open Source License and the
Drupal-based user interface toolkit was made available under the GNU General Public
License.160 Both licenses allow modification of the software code, therefore making it available

for others to iterate on.161 And iterate they did. Many other institutions and organizations used
and iterated on the XC software to create new projects, one of the most notable of these being the
English Short Title catalog by Carl Stahmer at University of California, Davis.
The idea of iteration as a key part of XC was spearheaded by Lindahl, who believed strongly in
the need for a shift in academic libraries from thinking about design as just a single end product
to thinking about design as an iterative, ongoing process:
“I also find that people forget really easily. Especially when you think about library
interfaces… at Rochester we spent years iterating on and improving the website. We had
a great website. But if you looked at it on an absolute basis it still had a lot of flaws. And
sometimes I think people, some of the librarians at Rochester would say, ‘oh this website
is still terrible, look at all the problems.’ And then when you go back and look at where
we were and how we got to where we got to, and recognize that some of the flaws are just
flaws because you know it doesn’t work as easy as Google. Because you still have to go
to all those databases. Like we still have to get people to these other resources. Because
it’s not all, it’s not as simple. I think people seeing the history, having it all documented,
the pictures of the old interfaces, the written results from doing heuristics testing and
assessment usability tests and the ways that we made changes and the ways that we came
to the language that we were using, people easily forget that it’s not about the absolute
quality of the current interface, it’s about the quality of the process, the design process
you go through to get from somewhere to some place better.”162

4.3.2 Repertoire
It should not come as a surprise that any project headed by William Frederick Poole would
display evidence of repertoire, a key aspect of design where reliance on personal knowledge and
experience from all contexts, including former design projects, is a legitimate source of
knowledge. Poole’s beliefs that superior library education and understanding came from hands
on experience are well documented in the memoirs of those who worked closely with Poole.163
“‘Experience in a large library is the best preparation for library work,’ he used to say.”164
Poole’s Index also bears many hallmarks of professional repertoire. For instance, although the
1848 edition was by all reports well-received, Poole’s exposure to other library tools—
consciously or not—certainly influenced its design. When he began working at the Society
library in 1847, Poole worked as assistant librarian to John Edmands, who in that same year
compiled a small subject guide to assist library users entitled Subjects for Debate, with Reference
to Authorities.165 This handy guide offered references to books and specific periodical articles in
the Brothers library collection on common debate themes, such as “Capital Punishment” and “Is
War Ever Justifiable?” Although this “prehistoric Poole”166 was not an index by any stretch of
the imagination, but rather something akin to a subject bibliography,167 it certainly laid the
groundwork for a periodical index.
Additionally, as others begged for Poole to publish a new edition of the Index in the years
leading up to 1876, Poole knew from his own previous experience that such an undertaking was

simply “too large for one man to achieve.”168 He may have also drawn on repertoire when he
suggested, instead of one man taking on the work, a cooperative approach to periodical indexing
could be employed instead. Although uncredited in the work itself, Poole actually received
indexing assistance from at least one other person during the creation of the 1853 edition. D.C.
Gilman, a Yale student at the time (who would subsequently go on to be President of Johns
Hopkins University), indexed at least 5 periodical titles for this edition.169 So the idea of sharing
work among more than one indexer was an experience Poole had dealt with in the past and could
now bring to bear on the current situation. If the problem was too much work for one man, then
why not spread the work among many? This previous collaboration also offered additional
repertory knowledge: that index entries from multiple indexers could vary widely. From his work
with Gilman, Poole knew that although indexers needed a certain amount of leeway to use their
judgement, they also needed guidelines.170 Therefore, as part of a committee along with Charles
A. Cutter and Justin Winsor, Poole devised rules and guidelines for the cooperative indexing
project.171 From his work with Gilman he also know that oversight would be necessary.172 A
“central bureau”173 would review the index entries and make the proper alterations to ensure
conformity. Poole nominated himself in the role of central bureau, and selected William I.

Repertory knowledge in design is not limited to that gained through iteration on a single project,
but through every experience and exposure. Poole worked on a number of other library projects,
from Finding Lists of the Chicago Public Library to architectural plans for the Newberry Library,
all of which surely must have influenced his approach to librarianship and, in turn, his indexing
designs. Although it is difficult to provide concrete evidence of such broad influences, one can
actually be seen in the opposite direction—Poole exhibits use of repertory knowledge gained
from the creation of the 1848 and 1853 indexes in his 1854 Catalogue of the Mercantile Library
of Boston.175 This work demonstrates many principles gleaned from the creation of the 1853
Index, such as the “title-a-line” principle, inversion of titles to bring out subject terms, and the
particular arrangement of author, title, and subject in a single alphabetical sequence.176 Repertory
knowledge gained from work on the Index also came in handy for reference service, as Poole
found the bibliographical information he obtained during its preparation very valuable for
working in libraries overall.177
Like Poole, Mary Titcomb was also an active librarian who traveled in professional circles and
drew on a large repertoire of knowledge, both library-related and from other experiences, to
inform her work across the board. Titcomb was already 44 years old when she arrived in
Hagerstown to assume the position of WCFL Librarian, with extensive library experience under

her belt: she apprenticed at the Concord (Mass.) Public Library before serving as librarian at the
Rutland (VT) Public Library.178 She was also secretary of the first Vermont Library Commission
and spent twelve years what we might now call consulting—organizing or reorganizing libraries
throughout Vermont that needed attention and assistance.179 This extensive experience was a
major reason for her selection for the WCFL position. Many citizens thought that a local
Washington County resident should have been selected for the post,180 but the minutes of the
WCFL Board of Trustees cite her “wide experience in Library work” as reason for her
selection.181 Titcomb’s experience—her repertory knowledge—was a major factor in her
recruitment.
Titcomb put this repertory knowledge to good use in many areas of WCFL, from children’s
librarianship to school outreach, and even a training program for education in librarianship.182 In
the case of the book wagon, she herself acknowledges drawing on several specific ideas to which
she had been exposed in her past. First was Dr. Thomas Bray’s 1697 idea about lending libraries
in Maryland which advocated for taking books to people in the countryside, rather than requiring
those people to travel miles for access to intellectual resources:183
“Standing Libraries will signifie little in the Country, where Persons must ride some
miles to look into a Book; such Journeys being too expensive of Time and Money: But

Lending Libraries, which come home to ‘em without Charge, may tolerably well supply
the Vacancies...”184
Titcomb was directly inspired by Bray’s idea to create the early deposit stations, the precursors
that directly led to the book wagon service. Here she describes exactly the connection between
Bray and the work at WCFL:
“Quite the modern library idea of carrying the war into the enemy’s country in the guise
of rural delivery, deposit stations and traveling libraries. Identical also were his notions as
to the management of these early deposit stations with the branches sent out today from
our library, for he plans to provide for them ‘book presses made on purpose to keep them
in’ and to deposit them with ‘the minister or schoolmaster in some market town if near
the center of the Deanery, that so they may with very little trouble be sent for on any
market day and returned within a limited time.’ He also opines that ‘any minister or
schoolmaster for the use of such a library under his key will be willing to undertake the
trouble to lend out the books and receive them in upon occasion.’ Precisely what 38
merchants, postmasters and others are doing today with the cases of books sent out from
the central library at Hagerstown.”185
Titcomb was also influenced by Melvil Dewey’s “traveling libraries.”186 Launched in New York
State in 1893, Dewey’s traveling library program consisted of ten locking oak bookcases filled
with 100 books each which were sent to small public libraries around the state for six-month loan

periods.187 By 1900, the number of cases had risen to 1,000, and circulated 360 times.188 As an
active librarian in New England during this time (Titcomb’s participation in the American
Library Association, of which Dewey played a significant role, is well-established189), Dewey’s
traveling libraries cannot have escaped her. Indeed, Titcomb and Dewey even corresponded in
later years, with him expressing admiration for her work.190
In XC, repertoire is not as explicitly evident as in Poole’s Index and the WCFL book wagon, but
suggestions of repertoire are still present. The most notable examples come from interviews with
Lindahl and Foster, who described the relationships between their previous projects and the work
on XC. Lindahl drew on knowledge gleaned during his time at Xerox. He described how one
project in which he participated—the digitization of 70,000 35mm art history slides and
development of a Java-based software tool that integrated with the library’s ILS to mimic a light
table—built up his knowledge of library related work practices and technologies.
“I’m kind of telling you a lot of history, but basically I learned the MARC format, I
learned Z39.50, I learned how to integrate software between the web and Innovative
system, which was, little did I know, probably one of the hardest ILSes to integrate
with.”191
He spoke about what he learned on this project, and while that knowledge may seem like
“history,” it is clear that his knowledge of MARC, Z39.50, and the Innovative Interfaces

integrated library system and other library-related topics offered a foundation of knowledge that
not only assisted his work on XC, but without which XC would not have been possible.
Foster also drew on her repertoire of knowledge. But unlike Lindahl, who drew on previous
knowledge about libraries, Foster demonstrated knowledge by drawing a parallel between her
previous anthropological studies in the Amazon communities of South American and her work at
the University of Rochester and XC.
“I had the theoretical background and I had a lot of research experience that on the
surface seemed like it would be very different because it was like in the Amazon basin,
but actually in terms of the issues I was dealing with, had a lot of similarities. And also
methodologically there were similarities, because I had spent a lot of time looking at how
people worked, and then developing, you know, interpretations of culture and society. So
it was really a pretty short step to the participatory design stuff.”192
Foster deftly took repertory knowledge from a previous situation—her work in the Amazon—
and transferred it to her work on XC based on connections between the previous and current
situations.
4.3.3 Reflection
Although evidence of reflection was sought in existing materials, no evidence of this element of
design epistemology was observed in Poole’s Index or the WCFL book wagon cases. It is
unclear whether reflection was not legitimately present in the course of the work; present but not
recorded in the artifacts or documents surrounding the design; or recorded but records of its
presence were subsequently lost. Given that the answer to this conundrum is unknown, I cannot

192

Foster, interview.

119
rule out the existence of these elements; however, neither can I sufficiently argue for their
presence. Since interviews were not possible in these historical cases, the only other way such
evidence might be recorded would be if Poole or Titcomb somehow communicated about their
reflection process to another person who recorded it, or if they recorded it themselves in a diary
or memoir, neither of which are known to exist.
There are a few instances in XC where reflection can be observed. These examples appear to
demonstrate reflection-on-action (i.e., reflecting on a design decision after it has been made). For
example, the XC Phase 2 final report includes a concluding section that indicates some reflection
on the overall project, including challenges and lessons learned.193 Additionally, the XC
interviewees all noted that the interview process itself served as a kind of reflection-on-action,
such as Foster, who said “It was fun to reflect back on it [XC].”194 All of the interviewees
indicated that, at the very least, the interviews for this study offered them a useful and enjoyable
opportunity to reflect on XC.195 It is also clear that they each had reflective evaluatory
contributions prior to the interviews. Bowen mentioned an unfinished book manuscript that
detailed reflections on the project:
“You know at one point we were thinking, we had actually started writing a book about
our experiences developing XC. And we were not, that did not continue. So we never
published it. But there was a lot that we wanted to say about what worked and what
didn’t work, about the project and to be able to share that and we’ve never really done
that.”196

120
Although the discussion did not articulate specific details, it was clear that active thought had
been put in to reflecting on the project and sharing those reflections with a wider community.
She also mentioned how reflection fostered knowledge through change of perspectives: “the
longer we go out from finishing it or not working on it anymore, perspectives change a bit. And
Nancy and Dave may have very different ideas about what we should have done differently.”197
In contrast, Lindahl expressed more personal reflections about himself, his motivations and
passions:
“I think that what I also learned that is sort of frustrating, I’m not frustrated by it because
I’m proud of it, but I mean, I don’t want to be a salesperson. And I don’t want to be an
open source community builder. Like, that’s not interesting to me... I want to do
interesting projects that are in the space of applied research. I want to build, I want to do
research that’s applied. You know, I don’t want to do basic research. I’m not interested in
that. And I don’t want to build a non-profit or open source software company. We did
that. But it wasn’t that interesting. I don’t want to do it. So, that’s not my role. And we
probably, you know, if we had a fourth XC leader beyond Nancy, myself and Jennifer, it
would have been the business person. The person who was passionate about building that
entity and reaching out and building all those bridges and we didn’t have that.”198
But even though his current reflective position came from a personal place, it offers insight at
more than just a personal level. First, it speaks to what might have happened differently to make
XC even more successful—specifically a full-time position in a business management role,
which is useful evaluative feedback. Second, his personal connection also seems to advocate for

197
198

121
deeper reflective and evaluative connections beyond individual projects: looking at ourselves and
our own roles, and the ways in which they align and diverge with design projects can also offer
useful evaluation.
Although evaluation is connoted with success, failure—especially reflection on failure—can also
offer useful evaluation. Both Bowen and Lindahl mentioned that one unsuccessful aspect of XC
was its inability to rapidly process large quantities of metadata records. Bowen noted that
learning what doesn’t work can be just as useful as learning what does:
“We thought this was going to work but when we try to run a million records through it,
it won’t, you know, there’s no way. I mean, I guess that was really the outcome of the
project, we learned that it really isn’t robust enough. We learned that that’s something
that’s not going to work.”199
Lindahl discusses using this seeming failure to actively iterate improvements:
“[The metadata services toolkit] worked really slowly at first. And one of the steps in our
process was to hire a software engineer. I think there were well over 20 software
developers that worked on eXtensible Catalog over the many years. But one of those
developers was hired specifically to make the metadata toolkit run faster…And he did it.
He made it run faster. We hired him based on his expertise and he found the bottlenecks
in the processing. And it really came down to, you know, we’re processing millions of
records so milliseconds count. So he would find where the biggest milliseconds were
coming from and squash ‘em.”200

199

122
Foster had alternative perspectives about project evaluation and success. She noted that
regardless of functionality, XC was successful because it was able to gather specific knowledge
about user needs and use that knowledge in the design process. For instance, she talked about
how XC was not just about achieving the functionality of faceting, but also learning about
information behavior:
“So just as one example, Jennifer created the metadata standard in a way where later on
you could facet for non-microform formats. ‘Cause we just got back so many people
saying that they hated microform. They really didn’t want to see that stuff. But there was
a lot of other stuff that we got that was to do with faceting and how people browse and
what kind of information they want. You could say that it influenced the interface, and it
did, but what it really influenced was what had to happen under the hood so that the
interface could be workable for people.”201
Additional evaluative reflection reveals that failure and success are not always diametrically
opposed. Bowen astutely observed that what might be perceived as certain failures on the part of
XC really have more to do with context and placement in time.
“[XC] didn’t succeed in the way we originally intended it to. Some parts of the software,
I think, were really successful. And in fact I think that they still, I think that they were
ahead of their time, actually. And I think that there will be more call for them perhaps as
we move away from a MARC-based environment. Unfortunately I think we were
developing that part of the software in a period of great flux. RDA was being developed
actually at the same time as XC and we were trying to implement the RDA linked data

123
properties, but they hadn’t been fully defined yet, so that made it very difficult. [laughs]
And BIBFRAME hadn’t even been conceived of yet, but we knew there was going to be
something that would come after MARC, so this particular part of the software, the
metadata platform was really designed to transform MARC metadata into something else.
And what else? It could be any number of things, but what people inevitably will want it
to become, which will be perhaps BIBFRAME, but it hadn’t even been conceived of yet.
So I still think that there’s a use that hasn’t even been, I think that people will find uses
for it in the future with some additional development that there’s a platform that we
created that could be used, say, to transform MARC data to BIBFRAME data. So that
part of the project, yes, I think it’s a success and I think it will become more of a success.
That’s what’s being used by the digital humanities community right now.”202
Although portions of XC software might have been less functional, XC pushed other entities,
like the Library of Congress, to step up their game, to push for and improve new developments
and standards, and create what could be perceived as a success, albeit for an entirely different
project.
The length of time between the end of the XC project in 2011 and the research of this study in
2015-2016 meant that these descriptions and observations of reflection are limited to reflectionon-action. No evidence of reflection-in-action (i.e., reflection during the course of making design
decisions) was seen in any of the three cases. While this is unfortunate, it is not surprising,
because by its very nature, reflection-in-action must occur during the design process, and these
cases were analyzed ex post facto.

202

Bowen, interview.

124
4.3.4 Use of representations
Evidence of the use of representations in the design process is also tenuous in all three cases.
Although Poole’s indexing process is described,203 none of the actual slips representing the
indexing entries in Poole’s Index appear to still exist. Without these documents, it is impossible
to tell if they were used in a manner consistent with ideating and communicating, as they are in
design, and if so, in what way. There are a few marked page proofs from the 1882 edition that
have survived which could arguably constitute evidence of design representation. However,
these examples are limited to a few pages from the prefatory materials (none of the index entry
pages) and the corrections are mostly typographical. Regarding the book wagon, Titcomb makes
reference to interviewing wagon makers prior to the design and construction of the first iteration,
trying “to elucidate her ideas with pen and pencil,”204 which may be the closest allusion to
sketched representation across all three cases. However, like the slips from Poole’s Index, none
of these ideation drawings are known to have survived. Regarding XC, much of the
documentation and several interviewees referred to notes and prototypes, but none of these
materials were currently available.
4.3.5 Abductive reasoning
Similar to reflection-in-action, abductive reasoning is an internal thought process that takes place
during design work. Therefore, it is difficult to observe even under ideal circumstances. Between
the after-the-fact nature of this inquiry and the lack of ability to observe thought processes, no
evidence of abductive reasoning could be gleaned in the early historical cases. Although attempts
were made to elicit information about abductive reasoning during interviews with XC

125
participants, the time removed from their work and the lack of an easy, common language to
describe design and abductive reasoning without asking leading questions made engagement of
this topic nearly impossible. Thus no conclusions can be drawn as to the presence or absence of
abductive reasoning itself in each of the three cases, only that evidence of it could not be
observed for a variety of reasons.

4.4 Design Evaluation Methods
If design problems have no right or wrong solutions, only better or worse ones, how do we know
what constitutes better or worse? Criteria for assessment in design epistemology also differ from
those in the sciences and humanities. Each of the cases in this study drew on elements of
assessment in design, specifically critique, rationale, and adoption to demonstrate validity and
success.
4.4.1 Critique
Often, design critique occurs at the end of a project as part of a final assessment. But in an ideal
situation, critique of a design happens throughout the design process, not just after its completion
and/or deployment.
Poole’s Index clearly demonstrates the use of critique through the solicitation of feedback during
the design process. Although the 1848 and 1853 editions of Poole’s Index do not evince much in
the way of feedback, the 1882 edition offers a few examples of Poole asking for input from other
experienced librarians, such as this letter to Justin Winsor:
“I enclose a rough list of periodicals I have made with the reference to including them in
the new edition of my Index. I submit it for your inspection and revision. I shall be very
glad to receive your thoughts on the subject. Shall the list be larger or smaller? Shall

126
some here included be left out and others added? Please show it to Mr Cutter. By putting
our heads together and [collating] our ideas we may be able to strike the happy mean. We
cannot index everything.”205
Poole also solicited feedback on the scope and coverage of the Index, such as the question of
whether to include Saturday newspapers, or specialty topics like science, medicine, and law. He
says: “Please think about it, and talk it over with your associate professionals, and give me the
results of your deliberations.”206 While Poole directly sought feedback from well-known
librarians of proven experience, others too had feedback and suggestions. Library Journal
printed a four-page table of proposed periodicals to be indexed, noting that it was “strictly
provisional, and librarians or others interested should at once express their criticisms or
suggestions to Mr. Poole.”207 Based on the response of the committee in a subsequent report, it
was clear that the open opportunity for critique surfaced issues of scope, as well as problematic
and unclear use of abbreviations.208 In 1877, Walter Biscoe published a through critique of the
1853 Index, in the context of the work proceeding on the new edition. He offered a thorough
analysis of the ways in which the 1853 Index fails to meet its own goals, as stated in the
Preface.209 In June of 1878, “to avoid certain imperfections evident in the old index,” Library
Journal hosted a symposium (a kind of debate published in print) on the plan and indexing
guidelines for the 1882 edition, where librarians could contribute comment or critique.210 Seven

librarians contributed in-depth critique, mostly concerning the lack of classified arrangement,
vocabulary control and cross-references.211
Other critique came after editions of the Index were published, in the form of published reviews.
While nearly every review praised the Index, regardless of edition, several also offered critique.
For example, The Church Review was satisfied with the general idea of the 1848 Index, but it
criticized the omission of existing indexes as well as the focus on American magazines.212
Norton’s Literary Gazette echoed the problematic focus on American periodicals when
reviewing the release of the 1853 edition.213 The New-England Historical and Genealogical
Register criticized the abbreviation of their own title in the preparation of the 1882 edition:
“…we cannot understand upon what principle the committee in charge of this matter
propose to omit the word ‘Historical’ in the title of this periodical, and adopt as an
abbreviation of its title, ‘N.E. Gen. Reg.’ If ‘N.E. Hist. & Gen. Reg.’ is too long to print,
‘Hist. & Gen. Reg.’ certainly is not. We hope they have been more careful with other
titles.”214
Yet a review of the same edition from The Nation asserts that the abbreviations are easily
understood.215 This is a useful example of critique, since critique need not be negative: pointing
out concrete successes (not just general praise as most of the reviews in this example provide) is

also valid assessment of a design. In fact, the review in The Nation runs just over 2,000 words,
offering an in-depth, expert critique that eminently characterizes design assessment.
The WCFL book wagon does not offer evidence of critique in the same manner. Direct critique
does not appear to have been purposefully sought from peers and experts. However, the book
wagon idea from WCFL was copied by many other libraries throughout the country. Such
adoption and emulation may also be considered as indirect critique of a design, in that how much
or little a design is used or copied can provide a kind of feedback on that design. However, the
concrete connection to explicit critique is tenuous, and adoption and emulation of the WCFL
book wagon will therefore be covered in greater detail under the more appropriate section
discussing criteria-based evaluation.
XC, on the other hand, does explicitly display evidence of purposefully seeking critique
throughout the project, rather than leaving it until the end. This tactic was explicitly intended to
ensure a better design outcome. One example of early solicitation of critique was a direct
outcome of receiving funding specifically for planning rather than system building, because that
funding enabled the partners conference in February 2006.216 Lindahl had written a software
architecture for XC prior to this meeting, and based on this preliminary design, experts and
thought leaders offered ideas and feedback. He emphasized the impact of this platform for
critique: “We ended up being able to hold a conference that really shaped what XC became.”217
In addition to the conference, other avenues were used to solicit critique throughout the planning
phase. A survey was distributed to representatives of partner institutions and potential users of

XC in an attempt to glean feedback. While much of the survey focused on needs assessment,
information was also gathered by asking respondents to critique current library systems. 218 This
critique was then used to prioritize and design different features of XC. Also, a blog was set up
as part of the http://extensiblecatalog.info website, and many of the posts throughout Phase I
specifically ask for input.219 It is difficult to ascertain how effective this strategy was at garnering
interaction because most of the comments appear to have been lost (presumably due to the port
of http://extensiblecatalog.info to http://extensiblecatalog.org, likely circa 2014 with the
transition from the University of Rochester to the new XCO non-profit organization). However,
there is trace evidence that some feedback was indeed posted by community members, sparking
conversations and influencing design decisions.220
The incorporation of critique into the planning stages of design, rather than relegating it to the
end, ties into the idea of iteration. To ensure useful iteration, evaluation such as critique must
happen throughout the design process. This also reflects the idea articulated by Lindahl that
success is in the process, rather than a singular end product.
4.4.2 Rationale
Although experts may point what they see as flaws in a given design as part of critique, that does
not automatically mean those flaws are legitimate. Much of this assessment hinges on how the

problem was framed. Although rationale is used throughout the design process to guide decisionmaking, it can also be used as a legitimate form of assessment. We can better identify which
solutions are “better” or “worse” if we understand and communicate why specific elements of
that solution were chosen and applied.
For instance, to anyone looking for all the articles within periodicals written by a specific author,
Poole’s Index would have been a terrible solution. But Poole did not frame the problem thus; as
noted earlier, he specifically framed it as an issue of subject access. Therefore, all the design
decisions over the course of the Index should support this framing, and not another. When
rationale aligns with design decisions, better solutions emerge. If rationale does not align with
the decision—if the choices do not support the goal as framed—the solution may be interpreted
as a worse one (or the problem may be revisited and reframed). Many examples of using
rationale to justify and assess design decisions appear in the development of Poole’s Index. For
example, not only did Poole frame the problem in terms of subject access, but he was also very
explicit that such access be quick and convenient.221 To support speed of access, Poole chose to
favor brevity, and not to include full, detailed references, which he contended would be
overwhelming to library users and slow them down in their work. “The great minuteness of
reference in Indexes, is as often an inconvenience, as an aid to the general reader…”222 Most
articles had only a single subject reference, to ensure conciseness.223 Although Poole never
discussed it explicitly, the implication is clear that the use of abbreviations was also meant to
save space on the page as well as a user’s working memory. Poole also returned to the theme of
user convenience when responding to critique of the plan for the 1882 Index. He justified the use

of alphabetical arrangement, rather than classified arrangement, by saying that “a simple
alphabetical arrangement requires no preliminary study.”224 Alphabetical order, he argued, is
already familiar to all, unlike classified arrangements, which take time to learn—time which
Poole believed readers would not take.225 Poole also explicitly demonstrated rationale in his
stipulations for preferred spelling; not so much for user convenience, but for user perceptions
and respect:
“Plow is the spelling adopted by every manufacturer of the implement in the United
States, and of every agricultural society which does not have its reports printed in Boston
and Cambridge. Plough is a bit of provincialism in this day, and I don’t want our book to
have the atmosphere of provincialism.”226
Other examples of rationale are connected to materiality, either decisions about materials or
decisions based on material constraints. While Poole wanted rough edges on the first Supplement
for aesthetic reasons, saying that cut edges were “Dutchy” and “simply horrid,”227 the publishers
at Houghton Mifflin & Company felt differently:
“As a matter of taste, we agree entirely with Mr. Poole in preferring a half morocco
binding with gilt top and rough edges, but unfortunately the popular taste, we have found
by experience, does not appreciate this style. We have even known customers to return

such volumes, complaining that the binding was left unfinished, because of the rough
edges.”228
In addition to aesthetics and sales potential, the publishers at Houghton, Mifflin, and Co. also
pointed out that rough edges pose a usability problem. “A Dictionary or book of reference is far
less easily consulted & run over if the leaves are untrimmed...”229 and “we cannot imagine that
those who use the ‘Index’ constantly would like to have an untrimmed copy for daily use any
more than they would like to have an untrimmed Webster’s or Worcester’s Dictionary or any of
the cyclopaedias.”230 (See Figures 4-11 and 4-12 for an example of rough/untrimmed vs.
cut/trimmed pages).
Other rationale included the continued justification for brevity and narrow focus on subject
access. In the Preface to the fourth Supplement, Fletcher and Mary Poole stated that although the
inclusion of additional access points, such as authors, in Poole’s Index was desirable, “such
entries added to those now included would nearly double the amount of matter and the
consequent size and cost of the volumes, which consideration is simply prohibitive from a
commercial point of view.”231 The rationale changed with the authorship: instead of user speed
and convenience as underlying justification, material costs and return on investment drove
design decisions, a choice which ultimately led to Poole’s Index losing favor to other indexes
like Wilson’s Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, which did include those additional
desirable access points.

In the case of the WCFL book wagon, Titcomb did at times offer rationale for book wagon
design choices, such as the previously noted example of painting red accents on the wagon to
distinguish it from a hearse. She also noted that one of the major reasons for the book wagon’s
success was the ability to incorporate “the personal element” into library work in the county.
“The tastes of the individual can be consulted; if there are children, attention can be called to the
books that will please them, if the wagon does not contain what is desired, a memorandum can
be taken then and there, and the book mailed to the individual.”232 This illustrates a kind of
rationale for the book wagon as a more successful service than could be offered by deposit
stations alone.
There were several different techniques used to demonstrate the book wagon’s success in
reaching the country residents. Some, like traditional circulation statistics, were used to
demonstrate success by showing the increasing numbers of books checked out during the periods
when the book wagon was actively in use, and declining numbers when it was out of service.
Other quantitative data, such as the increase in number of routes, miles traveled, or number of
registered patrons, were also frequently given in annual reports to demonstrate the book wagon’s
success and lobby for increased support.
“A second year’s test of the book wagon has demonstrated the fact that as yet, no better
way of reaching the remoter portions of the County could be devised. Sixteen routes
through various parts of the country have been laid out, and forty trips have been made
by the wagon over these routes during the year, so that each section has been visited very
nearly three times, or, in other words, the wagon has covered the ground about every four

135
months. Once in three months would have been a more desirable average, but the expense
has been a consideration, and also the fact that it has been impossible to oftener find a
competent understudy to undertake the duties of Mr. Thomas at the central library.”233
However, most librarians know that circulation statistics can be misleading. For example, just
because a patron checked out a book from the library does not mean he or she has read it.
Numbers of registered users for WCFL was highly problematic, since nearly all registered
patrons were residents of Hagerstown, and only a very small proportion of rural residents ever
formally registered as library patrons.234
To combat this, Titcomb explicitly emphasized on numerous occasions that statistics alone are
not enough to indicate success.
“After all is said, a report is a vain thing. Figures, comparisons, statistics cannot be made
to tell the story of the year’s work; for the vital part, the spiritual essence cannot be put
into words. How shall be estimated the effect of some tale of heroism upon the sensitive
mind of the child? How [to] tabulate the revivifying, recreative, informing influence of a
great book on the heart and mind of an adult? And how shall be chronicled the steps on
the pathway towards making the library a community center? A definite goal every
librarian must have, but how near one arrives, or how far one falls short, can never be
expressed in terms of registration and circulation.”235
Instead, Titcomb turned to additional alternative forms of evaluation, many of which are
reflective of design. One of the most interesting aspects of the WCFL case is the purposeful use

136
of storytelling as an evaluative measure. Rather than relying on statistics alone, Titcomb asserted
success by relating stories of positive encounters:
“The interest in the wagon has not waned in any part of the county and by degrees even
the more remote places are waking up. Until this year, Pleasant Valley has been to us,
one in name only, though it is situated in the rugged but beautiful mountains above
Smithsburg. On our first trip there, three years ago, it took much persuasion to lend 47
books to a sluggish and ignorant people. On our visit there last June, every household
was won over and 127 books distributed. One or two discouraged truck farmers were at
home and seemed glad to get any information that would help them to better methods of
raising and disposing of their crops. Families who turned us away before, brought the
children out for books. It was a real children’s day, 79 out of the 127 volumes being
loaned to them.”236
In conjunction with stories, Titcomb used the technique of listing the titles of books that patrons
selected off the book wagon, such as the following example:
“One farmer asked for, --

236





a winter’s reading course in Agriculture all taken from the bulletin.237

Or this example:
“Not long ago a trip was taken across the mountain from Trego to Samples Manor. It had
been rather a discouraging day, for such days do come, when at last the car drove up to a
small cottage where a summy faced lad of fourteen waited with his pile of books. When
asked if he was fond of reading he said, “Yes I am, if it is important.” He handled volume
after volume with such keen pleasure that it seemed quite worth while the whole trip just
to satisfy this one little mountain boy. And these are what he finally decided were
important.


Rhymes of our planet



Siam and Java



Hero tales of American history



Star-land



Siegfried



Saints and heroes”238

Titcomb used the titles themselves to demonstrate the success of the book wagon. Listing titles
not only showed that books were being put into hands of potential readers, but which books were
theoretically being read. Since a major concern of the time was encouraging people to read
“quality” literature, Titcomb used lists like the first one above to show that farmers were not
frittering away their days reading trashy novels, but rather interested in bettering themselves in
practical and useful arts that would help them improve themselves and their work. The second
example shows how higher quality titles of history and classics were selected by youth who

138
might otherwise succumb to what was considered lesser quality fiction at the time. By listing
specific titles, Titcomb demonstrated the success of the wagon in not just reaching country
residents, but helping them partake of quality literature.
XC also demonstrates several concrete examples of using rationale as an evaluative measure by
offering reasons and justifications for design decisions. For instance, many of the toolkits were
built on standards like OAI-PMH because of the benefits standardization offered in terms of the
ability to use the tools across collections and organizational settings.239 Had XC designed its own
protocols, it could not have met its goal of reusability by other libraries and institutions.
The decision to create multiple software tools instead of one program was also supported by
rationale. In addition to rejecting the “monolithic software architecture” approaches of
commercial library systems,240 dividing XC into modular chunks meant that the tools could be
used either together or alone.241 Beyond the rationale for using existing metadata standards,
Bowen discusses rationale based on the XC user research findings that influenced metadata
decisions, such as creation of a “thesisAdvisor” role, based on perceived need from the academic
user base for which XC was intended.242 In fact, it could be argued that the entire user research
arm of the XC project was intended to serve as rationale for the design of XC software and
schemas.
Although the alignment of rationale with desired outcomes can be used as a form of assessment
in design, it is not without issues. One major concern stems from the information that underlies
the rationale: what if the assumptions it was based on are incorrect? Throughout the development

of Poole’s Index, Poole makes assertions about what users want and what would be useful or
convenient for them. Partially he draws on repertoire for this—by the time work on the 1882
edition was underway, Poole had more than 30 years of front-line experience working with
library patrons in a variety of settings. However, while Poole’s repertory knowledge might have
been valid for his specific framing of the problem, it may lose legitimacy when extended to
broader applications, such as other user demographics or other types of libraries. Rationale in the
cases of the WCFL book wagon and XC also sometimes relied on assumptions. In the former
case, Titcomb assumed (as did many librarians of the day) that increased exposure to quality
books would create opportunities for increased literacy and a more informed and democratic
citizenry. The latter case made assumptions about which standards and models should underlie
XC’s development, for instance, building a catalog that could support the FRBR model of
bibliographic description. While this is valid rationale for decision-making regarding the system,
what happens if FRBR turns out to be a problematic model, or not in line with the findings based
on the user research conducted by the XC team? While rationale is considered a legitimate form
of assessment in design, the justification of rationale alone is not sufficient. These examples
show that rationale must be closely tied to the way any given wicked problem is framed in order
to offer a rigorous evaluation, and that the framing of the problem must be accurately represented
through a thorough understanding of the domain.
4.4.3 Criteria-based evaluation
Various criteria may be used as a basis for evaluation in design, including (but not limited to)
examples like novelty, adoption, adaptation, and visibility. Examples of these manifest
throughout the three cases in this dissertation.

140
Throughout its development (and even beyond), Poole’s Index clearly shows a high rate of
acceptance, both through commercial reviews and sales. Reviews across the board, for all
editions, were nothing but glowing.243 For example:
“A copy of a new index to the Periodical Literature of England and America was
exhibited to the Convention, and, on motion of Mr. Folsom, it was unanimously resolved,
That we have examined the work entitled ‘Index to Periodicals’ by W.F. Poole, Librarian
of the Mercantile Library of Boston, and that we approve of its plan and execution, and
we recommend that a similar system of indexing be extended to the transactions and
memoirs of learned societies.”244
“As to its great value, it cannot be questioned, in the assistance which it proffers, not only
to the general reader, but to clergymen, lawyers, librarians, authors, and especially to
editors.”245
“This is truly a valuable work. It is a complete key to the periodical literature of the day.
Writers, and all who are required to consult the principal reviews and magazines, will
find this work quite indispensable.”246
“One of the most important publications of the American press for the year, if not the
past decade.”247

The 750 copies of the 1848 edition were in demand before they were even off the printing press,
with colleges like Brown, Dartmouth, and Union Hamilton ordering 20-50 copies each.248 Five
hundred copies of the 1853 edition were printed in October 1853 and by April 1854 they were
nearly gone.249 Although the exact print run for the 1882 edition seems to have been lost to time,
by 1890 only about 38 copies remained unsold,250 and the publication was essentially considered
out of print, motivating the 1893 reprint.251 And although the original number of printed copies
of the first Supplement released in October 1888 is also unknown, it had sold almost 700 copies
by January 1889 and was nearly out of stock entirely by May of 1891.252 The full set of Poole’s
Index (the 1893 reprint plus the five Supplements) was reprinted three times: in 1938, 1958, and
1963, by Peter Smith, a publisher known for reprinting works of interest to libraries and
scholars.253 The fact that it was reprinted multiple times in the twentieth century reflects the
continued interest in and use of Poole’s Index.
Interestingly enough, even as Poole’s Index petered out in the wake of other tools, like the
Reader’s Guide, or new technologies, like periodical databases, Poole’s Index continued (and
continues) to be used, albeit for somewhat different purposes than it was originally intended.
This appears in various ways. For instance, scholars have used Poole’s Index as the basis for
analysis of periodical trends, such as patterns of titles created and discontinued, dates and

chronological information, and geographic distribution.254 The ability to analyze Poole’s Index
along these lines is likely only made easier now that it is available in digital form. Poole’s Index
was also used as a collection development tool, helping illustrate gaps and offering suggestions
on what to acquire:
“The “Index” is the most important aid to good library work which has recently appeared.
It is also a keen reminder of numerous deficiencies in our collection. Some notable works
which have been carefully indexed have no place in our library. Even the series which
hold prominent places in our list of periodicals are incomplete. Under these
circumstances, it would be well to provide suitable accommodation, and then purchase
for the use of our readers all of the leading magazines and reviews to which reference is
made in Poole’s Index.”255
In this way, Poole’s Index not only guides collection development, but it embodies an
authoritative stance that reflects judgement and sets standards regarding which periodicals
should be considered worthy for inclusion in a library collection, since, as Cairns notes, there
were many periodicals of the time that did not appear in the Index,256 some due to Poole’s
explicit decision making, others due to tardiness or other flaws of volunteer contributors.257
Poole’s Index was also similarly used by booksellers to advertise the sales of periodicals and
sets, such as in the following Boston Book Company circular:

“The publication of Poole’s Index has stimulated the demand for the sets included in that
work, and the experience of former years has demonstrated the increasing difficulty of
obtaining a sufficient supply of such as have already become scarce; we will therefore,
for the sake of fairness, record the orders given us according to the date of receipt, and
will ask that lists of wants be forwarded to us as early as possible.”258
Future interpretations might look to the subject terms used in Poole’s Index as a reflection of
contemporary thought both in librarianship as well as society at large.
In the case of the WCFL book wagon, there is evidence of direct adoption of the book wagon
itself as patrons partook of its service. “Mr. Thomas reports an increase of interest in every
section; often when he goes back over a route, he finds that new borrowers have left a message
with old ones, asking him to call.”259 However, a more interesting form of adoption occurred in
the case of the WCFL book wagon as numerous other libraries and institutions attempted to
emulate the service in their own local contexts.
Between 1909 and 1919, Titcomb and WCFL received numerous letters inquiring about details
regarding the book wagon, including specifications, costs, and service particulars for the purpose
of starting something similar locally. The following letter from a librarian in Connecticut is
representative:
“Our library association has under its consideration the question of library book wagon
service for the towns in the vicinity, and I am advised to write to you in regard to this
matter, as I understand that such service has been successfully conducted in your section

of the country. I would be pleased to have any information available on the subject—
method of conducting the work, means of transportation, compensation of librarians, how
the enterprise is regarded by the public, and anything else which ^would^ help me to a
knowledge of the undertaking. Printed matter relating to this branch of library service
would be much appreciated.260
Librarians from across the United States came to see the WCFL book wagon and participate in
trips to serve county routes.261
“Our success along this line has made our library a matter of national importance, so
much so that when the Librarian of the Yamaguchi Public library of Yamaguchi, Japan,
asked our government for the latest information upon the best method of reaching rural
communities with library books, the authorities at Washington [D.C.] referred him to the
Washington County Free library as an example.”262
Newspaper and magazine articles profiling similar services enacted at other libraries consistently
refer to the inspiration of the WCFL book wagon. Such interest in emulating Titcomb’s design
clearly demonstrates that it was held in high regard by others, both within the library profession
but also by other organizations such as the YMCA and local clubs and societies.263 Even
booksellers were interested in taking up the traveling book wagon idea to ploy their wares.264

Although adoption via emulation can serve as design evaluation in that these types of instances
are demonstrative of success for the WCFL book wagon specifically, the copy-cat nature of these
projects presents issues. Blindly adopting a design without consideration of context may actually
run counter to success. For instance, Edna Bullock wrote the following to Titcomb in 1911 to
inquire about the possibility of starting a book wagon service in Lincoln, Nebraska:
“I should very much like your opinion on my estimate of the probable expense of
maintaining a county library in our county. We have railroads in all directions. There is
probably not a village without its railroad. Our county roads are fine. Lincoln is at the
center of the county.”265
One of the motivating factors for the WCFL book wagon was the lack of accessibility to deposit
stations and rural residences by railroad. However, Bullock notes the prevalence of railroads in
Lincoln. Simply adopting a book wagon plan without considering the local context would likely
be an ill-fitting solution to the problem of book distribution in Lincoln—if such a problem even
existed in the first place.
But others took the inspiration of the WCFL book wagon and iterated on it to better serve their
local needs. Shortly after corresponding with Titcomb about the WCFL book wagon, the Berea
(KY) College library started their own book wagon service.266 A notable example is that of the
St. Louis Public Library. In 1915, Alice Hazeltine, the children’s librarian, wrote to Titcomb
asking for details about the book wagon and inquiring about the possibility of using a book
wagon to support children’s work.

“We have been thinking of one large enough to be used as a miniature children’s room,
with shelves inside, or shelving swung so that the books might be used either inside or
out, according to the weather. As I remember the pictures of your wagons the shelves are
all outside. Will you tell me how the work is then done on a rainy day?”267
In 1916, the St. Louis Public Library unveiled its “playground wagon,” a truck clearly based on
the WCFL book wagon but specifically designed for use at children’s playgrounds.
“On the road it appears as a simple and ordinary motor truck, but once arrived at the
playground it ceases to be ordinary, albeit as simple as ever. Within, a bookcase has been
concealed, a bookcase on wheels, with a capacity for 380 volumes. This is rolled out on a
shelf hooked to the end of the truck and supported by a wooden upright. A small slide is
next pulled out, making a desk at which the books are issued. Having loosened the chains
which hold the books in place during the journey, having placed an empty box beside his
stool to hold the returned books, and having seated himself on the stool before the desk,
the driver of the machine is ready for the children, who have been ready for him since the
machine first drove on to the grounds.”268
Such emulation is not just a flattering nod, but an evaluative measure helping to demonstrate the
success of the WCFL book wagon through influence and impact.

Like the previous two cases in this study, adoption, adaptation, and reuse is a major evaluative
indicator in XC. In addition to the University of Rochester and XC partner institutions, many
other libraries used part or all of XC in various projects. Denver Public Library used the XC
Drupal user interface toolkit and the XC OAI-PMH toolkit to create its “Creating Communities”
website, a 2010 IMLS-funded project to digitize, unite, and deploy a large collection of local
neighborhood history resources. 269 In 2011, Lehigh University used the XC NCIP toolkit to
perform circulation functions between their ILS and a newly released resource sharing system
named E-ZBorrow.270 And from 2011 to the present, Kyushu University library in Japan has

been using the entire XC suite of tools to provide next-generation catalog services to its
patrons.271 Lindahl explicitly characterized this adoption as a positive evaluation and
demonstration of success: “And it was good enough to be put into production in libraries in
Japan. I mean, they adopted it as a real interfaces for their live library.”272
Many more institutions have possibly partaken of XC due to its freely open accessibility.
However, detailed names and specific numbers are unknown for the very same reason. It is
difficult (not to mention potentially in conflict with library values of privacy) to keep track of
who downloads the software and for what purposes they may or may not end up using it. Bowen
speaks to this phenomenon:
“You know, that’s the thing with open source software, you never know who’s using it,
because anybody can download it and take it. And unless they write to you or post
something and say ‘hey, we’re using it,’ you never know. In fact I found out that the
digital humanities use, the English Short Title Catalog, I found out purely by accident
because I went to a presentation at a conference and they were talking about it. They
hadn’t contacted us. We had no idea. So you just don’t know who’s using it.”273
Interestingly, in addition to the software product itself and the schema incorporated within it,
other aspects of XC were also adopted and reused by others. Materials and documentation about
the anthropological methods used by Foster for the user research portions of XC development
were also provided for others to use via Creative Commons licensing.

“But one of the things we always did at Rochester was to share everything completely
openly. So, I mean, it doesn’t surprise me. And I mean, you know, it’s nice. That people
use your stuff. Attribution would be nice, but you know, it’s just sort of gotten out there
now, and everybody uses the methods that we developed...we did want to get it out there
for free and we succeeded, so that’s a good thing.”274
Here Foster touches on two types of success: first, that these methods and information were
made available, and second, that people actually used them. But like the XC software suite and
schema, the Creative Commons licensing and distribution model offered no recordkeeping
regarding who might be using these methods and where. In later years, Foster has begun to
collect some of this information via AnthroMap, a collaborative Google map identifying
institutions and locations that self-identify as using the methods she developed.275
Adoption is often tied up with determining success, and XC was no exception. Although I have
previously pointed out that one indicator of evaluative success can be adoption and
implementation, and shown examples of this in XC, such indicators are not binary. That is to say,
although adoption can be used to evaluate a design, it must be used holistically, and lack of
adoption does not inherently indicate poor design. For instance, although modules of XC are still
currently in use by many organizations, Bowen indicates that XC is no longer used at all at the
University of Rochester itself. 276 However, this is likely less an evaluative reflection and more to
do with shifting priorities of the institution leading to reduced or eliminated support for the
sustainability of the XC implementation at Rochester.

150
Finally, an interesting evaluative element that appears in XC might be seen as related to
adoption, although it is not adoption itself: the idea of visibility, and that visible prominence
within a community may also function as a form of assessment. For instance, Foster notes that
even though the software may have had limited success if evaluated on the premise of adopting
the entire system (i.e., all the component parts together), many organizations did incorporate XC
tools and components into projects where XC afforded functionality yet remained hidden.
“I think that the software actually has been very successful but not entirely, it’s been
successful, it had limited success, it had some success, as a system. It’s not always
visible. It’s had much greater success as when parts of eXtensible catalog are
incorporated as parts of bigger systems where it’s not so visible.”277
Thus XC may not have been accorded as much success due to its lack of visibility, yet these
other successful projects could not have functioned without it. Lindahl also notes how the
visibility of XC motivated other organizations and institutions to move forward with future
metadata developments:
“We produced something that got the Library of Congress to invite us to come and talk
about it. We produced something that got the Library of Congress to, Jennifer and I
believe, move forward with RDA.”278
Regardless of whether or not XC was considered a successful project in and of itself, other forms
of success, such as its visibility, may be used as additional evaluation criteria for a design.

4.5 Summary
This chapter discussed observable evidence regarding the ways in which elements of design
epistemology manifested in the three cases: Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature, the
Washington County (MD) Free Library (WCFL) book wagon, and the eXtensible Catalog (XC)
project. Many previously defined elements of design epistemology were evident in these cases,
specifically wicked problems; problem finding and framing; service-based orientation; iterative
processes; drawing on repertoire; and the use of assessment techniques aligned with design
epistemology such as critique, rationale, and adoption. Evidence of other aspects of design
epistemology, such as the use of representations; abductive reasoning; and reflection (especially
during the design process), was not observed in these three cases, and it is not known whether
this is because those elements are actually absent from the process, or because they were
unrecorded or records of instances involving such elements did not survive.

Chapter 5 Discussion
In the previous chapter, I discussed the ways in which elements of design epistemology manifest
in American librarianship based on a critical analysis of three major cases, thus challenging the
status quo that librarianship is a social science discipline. This chapter now presents an
interpretation and discussion about what these manifestations mean and what is uniquely
revealed about librarianship when examining the discipline based on this new understanding. My
critical analysis now critiques the role of design in American librarianship by arguing that
elements of design epistemology often manifest implicitly and passively throughout American
librarianship. That is, artifacts and actors in these cases do illustrate elements of design
epistemology—some more visibly and strongly than others—but they often do so unconsciously
or without realizing (much less embracing) the epistemological underpinnings of these elements.
On the occasions where elements of design epistemology are explicitly present, such as some
examples from the eXtensible Catalog where the application of design methods and
epistemology are explicitly discussed, they are often relegated to external contexts outside of
librarianship, either through source materials, education, or other delineations of professional
jurisdictions. Elements of design epistemology also manifest in ways that reveal the user-focused
nature of librarianship. Beyond these discussions, this chapter also discusses insights that are
revealed when looking at librarianship from a design standpoint. Analyzing these cases from the
perspective of design offers insights about knowledge construction, values, and the effects of
materiality on librarianship that have gone mostly unaddressed until now.

5.1 The overall role of design in librarianship
In this chapter, I discuss the ways in which elements of design epistemology manifest in
American librarianship based on a critical analysis of three major cases. No discussion can cover

153
every identifiable theme found in the case evidence, so this discussion will focus on topics
pertinent to the contemporary field of librarianship as well as interesting insights that potentially
offer greater impact on the field. While some points may seem negative or critical, it is not my
intention to take away from the many positive contributions these libraries and their designs have
made. Rather, this is a product of the critical analysis method that specifically seeks to change
the status quo and critique the current existing situation.
5.1.1 Design is implicit and passive
The first interpretation I posit is that overall, design plays an implicit and passive role in
American librarianship. That is to say, epistemological underpinnings of design are implied
throughout the discipline of American librarianship, yet are not plainly or overtly expressed.
Although this idea was hinted at in the literature review, evidence from all three cases confirms
that even though design is occurring throughout library work, explicit consideration of that work
as underscored by design epistemology is rarely present.
Many identified elements of design epistemology are clearly present in all three examples (see
Table 5-1). However, despite the implicit presence of the majority of elements in each of the
three cases, they are not explicitly grounded in design epistemology. Lack of explicit
conceptualization of librarianship as a field based in part on design epistemology in the historical
examples is not surprising. After all, clear understanding and articulation of design as an
epistemology did not even begin until the 1960s, so it would be ludicrous to expect these early
projects to contain explicit design discourse. But it would also be faulty to assume that situations
and contexts of the past did not include a concept simply because the same words were not used
to describe it then as are used today. And in fact, we see that this is the case for much of design
in librarianship: there is no evidence that Poole referred to his choices and decisions about the

154
Index as “rationale,” nor that Titcomb called the multiple versions of book wagons “iterations,”
yet the actions and concepts of rationale and iteration are clearly present. Regardless of language,
the previous chapter has shown that the actions and occurrences throughout each of the three
cases can clearly be interpreted in the context of design epistemology: a rose by any other name
indeed smells as sweet.

What is interesting to note is less the language surrounding the elements of design epistemology
than the perceived intent. In almost all of the previously described instances of design
epistemology, there was no observable evidence that design actions like drawing on repertoire or
participating in reflection were actively undertaken. For example, there is strong evidence that
John Edmands’ pamphlet Subjects for Debate, with Reference to Authorities1 was part of Poole’s
repertoire and as such, influenced the design of Poole’s Index. But Poole denies ever
encountering it because it was published six months before he began working at the Society
library.2 However, books and other bibliographic tools are unlikely to evaporate in such a short
time period. Poole’s presence in the Society library during the time of the pamphlet’s creation
and use means that he was likely influenced by it, even if he was himself unaware of such
influence. “It seems reasonable to suppose that Dr. Poole did get the suggestion of his Index
from this pamphlet, nor is it strange if after forty years he failed to remember it.”3 Edmands’
Subjects for Debate was surely part of Poole’s repertoire of knowledge, even if Poole himself did
not admit it.
While these elements of design epistemology indeed occurred in each case, I argue that they
occurred passively rather than proactively, allowing them to occur rather than purposefully
drawing on them, afterthoughts if consciously considered at all. Designers, on the other hand, are
trained in these techniques through formal education such as design studios and critique
sessions.4 To consider an analogy: many people search Google every day without actively

156
thinking about what they are doing, while librarians are trained in specific, rigorous searching
methods and techniques. The same might be said of librarians drawing on design epistemology:
librarians draw on elements of design epistemology like repertory knowledge and reflection
every day, but few are trained to actively and explicitly perform such tasks.
Although myriad examples of implicit design epistemology exist in American librarianship, there
are occasional examples of explicit references to and incorporation of design epistemology. One
of the most interesting aspects of XC is that it is one of few projects in librarianship to explicitly
self-identify as a design project. However, it is clear that despite explicit use of the term, the
concept of design does not necessarily refer to epistemology. In this case, the concept of design
has different interpretations based on context and perspectives. Design is considered, at varying
times throughout the XC project, to be a process, a specific type of technique, and an
epistemological construct. These different understandings of design serve different purposes and
roles, thus communicating varied ideas about exactly what role design played in the project and
what it might contribute to librarianship at large.
Interviews with XC personnel revealed two distinct interpretations of design: one focused on a
creative process to produce a product and the other on discovering new knowledge. We might
think of the former as methods and the latter as epistemology. For instance, Lindahl specifically
mentioned a divide between “productizing” and basic research in the context of leaving his
previous job:

157
“So after a while at working at Xerox I got tired of the fact that Xerox had a real tough
time turning, productizing things that research did. And that was frustrating because we
got to build cool things but they didn’t actually materialize into real products.”5
This illustrates the idea of design as the creation of an artifact. But Lindahl is very clear that
creating an artifact is not a singular one-time achievement but rather an emergent representation
of an ongoing, iterative process, and that academic libraries acknowledge the former but not yet
the latter.
“So, I find this in the library I’m in today and I’ll find it in every organization I’ll ever
work in, I’m sure, is that people don’t want to understand design as a process. They tend
to want to know what the next design’s going to look like. Right? Like if you look at a
current design and you’re like well they have a requirement and they want to know,
‘what’s the solution look like?’ The problem is that they’re not only one with a
requirement. And what you need is to collect the requirements, then you need to have an
iterative process to get from point A to point B. And the designer doesn’t know what the
end result looks like. And it’s not very satisfying for the person who has the issue with
the current design. Right? So I think libraries have to shift from seeing design as a next
step kind of a process to one where the process is the solution…I’ll give you an example.
Let’s say you’re looking at someone’s research guide on a website. On a library website.
And it has problems. Like maybe it’s really cluttered. And to get from there to something
that’s really useable for the end user you might have to change it several times. And then
evaluate the changes and change it again. Where the thing that you publish next isn’t the

158
first idea you had to fix it. But it was like you actually created three or four iterations,
none of which got published. Right? And then you finally come up with something that
you can publish. I think that idea of iterating is a really important concept to get academic
libraries to, to get them to see the world that way. To see sort of trying incremental
improvements rather than being able to picture the end result. It’s like a creative
process.”6
In this way, design as typically understood in the academic library domain is an iterative process
resulting in an artifact—a method for achieving a solution, but not necessarily a foundation for
knowledge creation. Specific types of techniques are used to achieve this artifact, including the
iteration mentioned above, as well as other user-centered design methods. Lindahl, however,
tried to articulate and advocate for something beyond just process or method. He tried to get
academic librarians to “see the world in a new way,” that is, to acknowledge and embrace a
design epistemology.
5.1.2 Design is relegated to the external
Although XC demonstrates explicit and purposeful consideration and incorporation of some
aspects of design, others—especially at a more epistemological level—remain implicit and
relegated to jurisdictions external to librarianship. For instance, although design was considered
to be an inherently fundamental aspect of the XC project, some of the discourse surrounding XC
does not reflect this idea. A literature review conducted during the planning phase covered the
categories of usability testing; catalog and related library technology research and development;
libraries as physical spaces; conceptual models of searching; authoritative information and peer

6

159
review; qualitative and ethnographic research in higher education; and qualitative and
ethnographic research in libraries.7 Literature on design was not reviewed, unless it fell into one
of the above categories, such as usability testing, which could only offer a very narrow slice of
design as an overall epistemological approach. In fact, in this literature review, usability testing
and user-centered design seem to be conflated and understood as similar, if not the same.8 One
might assume that design epistemology is such a high-level, almost “meta” topic that it might not
warrant inclusion in such a review—akin to including an epistemological work like Kuhn9 in a
literature review for a simple biological experiment. However, the fact that so much space in this
literature review is dedicated to qualitative and ethnographic research, which seem like parallel
topics epistemologically, does seem to suggest that higher level topics were worthy of
consideration, and that design was not one of them.
Additionally, in the categories of literature collected on the website for review, there is no
category for design. The categories are identified by the following labels: architecture, catalog
functionality, developer tools, digital libraries, FRBR, metadata, open source, problems,
proprietary, search, seminal reports, standards, user interface, user research, user tools, and web
2.0.10 Although there may be snippets of design within these categories (such as user interface
design), they again offer a limited understanding of design, and there is no overarching category
designated for the topic. Oddly enough, there is no mention of “participatory design” despite the
emphasis on using participatory design techniques in the user research for XC. Although this

online literature review was at one point open for additional suggestions and feedback in the
form of a blog post, any mentions of design resources in the comments have since been lost to
time, so there is no way to know if suggestions for additional literature specifically regarding
design were made.
Also, although an iterative epistemological approach was spearheaded by Lindahl, some of the
evidence of iteration in XC is externalized. For example, the iterative approach evident in
software versioning is an established protocol in software development and not necessarily
reflective of a design epistemology. Although software versioning may be considered iteration in
literal sense, it may not reflect true design iteration if all it does is correct mistakes and fix bugs.
While technically such correction improve on the design, do they really change the overall
design to something better? Fixing software bugs may be more like tightening a screw on a
bicycle—you need that work to make the design functional (and safe!), but it doesn’t really
create a substantively new design.
Other considerations, like sources of design knowledge, underscore the externalization of design
in XC. The expertise of the team leads was incredibly diverse and drew upon the expertise of
existing staff in “programming, metadata, anthropology, graphic design, user-centered design,
and usability testing.”11 Of the three team leads, Lindahl earned multiple computer science
degrees and experience working at Xerox; Foster received a PhD in applied anthropology; and
Bowen studied music before pursuing a master’s degree in library science. This is not to argue
that one needs an MLIS to work in or understand a library, but to show that the people working

on this project brought in ideas, concepts and methods that they learned from other domains.
Although all three participants led areas of design work—Lindahl headed the software
architecture and development; Foster developed research methods, protocols, and findings;
Bowen created the metadata schema—much of the design in XC was perceived as related to
software. Credit for design work was assigned to specific areas of work and the people in those
areas. For instance, Bowen says “…it was really Dave Lindahl that designed the system” and
“He’s really the designer. It really was his design.”12 Bowen credits Lindahl as the designer of
XC; she does not seem to see herself as a designer, even though she headed the design of the
metadata schema and referred to it as such in the title of a white paper about the design of the XC
element set.13 Lindahl, on the other hand, does describe Bowen’s role as a design role:
“[Jennifer] was designing the foundation of what was essentially a huge metadata software
project,”14 even if Bowen did not describe it that way herself. Foster, too, credits Lindahl for
“bringing this kind of design work into libraries,”15 implying that design work is something
external to libraries. She also discusses how her own participatory design work for the user
research arm of XC was informed by external sources: “I knew about participatory design and
user-centered design just because I knew people from Xerox and I talked to them.” 16
This view of Lindahl as the designer and that design came from external sources contributes to
the idea that design is something external to librarianship. Design may have been explicitly
present in XC because it was explicitly brought in from an external source—in this case, the
design and development work Lindahl experienced and contributed to at Xerox. Lindahl also

went looking for design ideas and instruction at IDEO, the famous design firm, again looking
externally for approaches, methods and knowledge in places outside of libraries. Hiring an
anthropologist was not only “the way they did it at Xerox”17 but another example of bringing in
external elements, and so the participatory design aspects that were Foster’s design purview may
still be considered separate from library work.
The externalization of design is not unique to XC. Despite numerous elements of design
epistemology identified in Poole’s Index, the majority of work done on the project actually
occurred outside the scope and boundaries of official library work, which assists in contributing
to the idea that design is external to librarianship. As previously described, almost all of the work
for Poole’s Index was completed in librarians’ free time with no financial compensation. When
indexing was underway, Poole spent all of his free time outside of library hours devoted to the
work. Although such self-sacrifice has been lauded under the banner of service, a closer
examination reveals that such an extreme commitment to service may have actually been
problematic, not just for the specific case of Poole’s Index, but librarianship as a whole.
Although Poole often positions himself as the martyr of the Index, there is evidence to suggest
that he did not imagine that the return on its investment would always be so sacrificial. Poole felt
that once users (and investors, like library directors and trustees) saw the benefits of the Index,
they would understand its value and allot library resources accordingly. Such “self-denying
labor” would also help “in raising the profession of the Librarian to its proper dignity,”
legitimizing indexing and the creation of such knowledge tools and making them worthy of
professional status.18

163
But this was not to be: despite rave reviews of the 1882 Index, which should surely have
demonstrated its worth, the subsequent Supplements were not completed on library time or with
library funding. Poole once again fronted money for the plates and printing,19 and once again,
voluntarily free labor was solicited from the library community.20 Poole’s notion that once
proven the Index would acquire recognition and support (and therefore funding) from official
channels was incorrect.
This had arguably a greater impact on more than just funding of subsequent indexing projects. In
addition to setting a precedent for lack of support for multi-library projects, the creation of the
Index outside the boundaries of official library time meant that such design projects instilled
themselves as outside the scope of library work. Since the design of these tools were relegated to
“off hours,” those who had the resources to front them, like publishers, took over jurisdiction of
them, helping to set the course for library-vendor relationships throughout the twentieth century.
As an example, even though the intellectual content of Poole’s Index has become public domain,
Paratext LLC, a library vendor now sells that information back to libraries in database form.21
The participants in the XC project were explicitly aware from the start of the impact of and
desire to regain some of the design power ceded to vendors. Stanley Wilder, Associate Dean of
the University of Rochester River Campus Libraries at the time of XC, noted that “The most
important aspect of the XC project may be its potential to galvanize libraries to try once more to
‘build it ourselves,’ this time with networked communities and open source code.”22 Bowen also

noted the rise of interest in open source at the time and how the associated DIY mentality of that
community revealed the power struggle between libraries and vendors:
“…the Code4Lib community was really kind of instrumental in kind of developing that
kind of community of people who could, ‘well, we’ll just build it ourselves.’ You know,
wanting libraries to not be locked in to what commercial vendors were providing. So
yeah, we were collaborating with them as far as we could in just communicating with
them. I think there was a lot of spirit of ‘well, what are you doing, and what are you guys
doing,’ and sharing and comparing notes, which is of course not what you get with
vendors.”23
These examples demonstrate how librarianship has continually conceptualized design as outside
the purview of the field—it is something that other people and other disciplines do. And over
time, these other people and fields took up the design work needed by and for libraries, shifting
the balance of power, and making libraries and librarians depending on other sources, like
vendors, to provide much of this type of work. Bowen writes that XC was specifically and
explicitly positioned to address this power imbalance:
“While it may be tempting to wait and see what commercial vendors offer as their next
generation of commercial discovery products, such a passive approach may jeopardize
the future viability of library metadata…projects such as the eXtensible Catalog can serve
as a vehicle for moving forward by providing an opportunity for libraries to experiment

and to then take informed action to move the library community toward a next generation
of resource discovery systems.”24
But even with that understanding and the successes demonstrated by XC, this idea did not take
hold as strongly as perhaps the XC team anticipated, possibility due to the unconscious
externalization of many of the aspects of design. Even today, such delineations continue:
MacDonald’s 2015 interviews with user experience (UX) librarians found that most of these
professionals conceptualized their role specifically as a research role rather than a design one,
de-emphasizing design-related tasks and relegating them to other staff and departments.25 As
more libraries become increasingly interested in design methods and techniques (including UX),
the lack of incorporation of the epistemological foundations that underscore these techniques
only widen the theory/practice divide so commonly criticized in the field. Additionally, while
framing design work as research is a valid way of creating knowledge (see subsequent discussion
on this topic in this chapter), limiting design solely to this perspective threatens to continue the
power imbalance. While such research is beneficial to artifact creation, it is the designers
creating artifacts—not the researchers—who make the ultimate decisions about how things can,
will and should be.
5.1.3 Design offers a user-centered focus
Although contemporary discourse may equate design with a user-based perspective, there are
many approaches to design, of which user-centered design is only one. User-centered design
(also known as human-centered design) is a design approach that focuses on users, their needs,

166
and requirements, to create more useable and useful products and systems.26 This is in contrast to
other approaches, such as system-based approaches that consider the needs and requirements for
the system. Although many libraries of the distant past may have functioned in a more systemsbased environment, such as concentrating on books or collections as the main focus, American
librarianship is traditionally considered a user-based service.27 This idea is reinforced and
confirmed by the user focus in all three cases in this study.
All artifact deployment in these cases was based on user needs, either perceived or explicitly
identified. For instance, Poole consistently referred to his user base of the “very cultured general
student,”28 implying a specific set of needs for that user group. His focus on abbreviations and
alphabetical order were based on the idea that users needed quick and convenient access to
information about periodicals. However, Poole’s examples reflect assumptions made about user
needs and what would be convenient for users. Although Poole began the Index when he himself
was a student and therefore arguably familiar with students’ information needs and behaviors,
there is no evidence that he ever explicitly inquired or otherwise communicated with users about
their needs. Some of his conclusions are certainly based on observations and experiences, which
can be helpful in this regard, but much of his communication revolves around librarians
discussing among themselves what they presume best for users.
Titcomb too was motivated by user convenience. Even in the earliest days of her tenure as
WCFL librarian, she emphasized user convenience through the idea that the library service

would come to the user, rather than mandating the opposite. The 1904 Bulletin of the Washington
County Free Library stated that “Those living at a distance that it is not convenient for them to
visit the library will be promptly served if they will write the librarian given the subject upon
which information is desired.”29 Such early service set the tone of user convenience from the
outset. But even as the book wagon developed to continue such convenience, it was also directly
guided by user needs. For instance, the preliminary routes of the book wagon were chosen based
on responses from users requesting locations for wagon visits:
“Letters were sent to the county residents explaining bookmobile service at community
stops together with a post card to be filled in requesting service. On the basis of the
excellent response to this letter the bookmobile trips were planned.”30
Although often described in a general way, feedback from library users along the book wagon
routes was also clearly solicited, with many users expressing preferences for what kinds of books
or reading materials they would like to receive. These concrete and direct connections to users
provide an interesting contrast to Poole’s Index where much of the information about user needs
was presumed.
While Titcomb and the WCFL clearly solicited information from users about their needs, it was
considered part and parcel of the process and not a special approach or technique. In the case of
XC, the project was specifically framed around discovering user needs, with an explicit emphasis
on research to understand user needs.31 From the outset, XC proposed not only to draw on the

expertise of computer programming and metadata staff, but also anthropology, user-centered
design, and usability testing.32 This idea is carried further in the project through education and
training of all project staff about user-centered design techniques and methods.33 Foster
described the tight connections between decisions and user data to ensure that the direction of
XC is always connected to user needs: “we always need to go back to our raw data to be sure that
we really came up with user-inspired ideas and that we didn’t go off track and lose our
connection to the actual data.”34
The attention devoted to understanding user needs throughout the XC project was immense,
resulting in multiple publications (including a full book) about the information needs and use
behaviors of academic library users.35 But what is interesting about the XC case is that it not only
revealed a massive amount of in-depth information about library users, it opened up perspectives
on who those users are. As noted previously, XC set out to create a front-end interface for use by
library patrons, but evolved into a back-end tool for librarians and library staff. This meant that
the librarians and library staff were also users, with their own specific needs and behavior
patterns. This did not escape the notice of XC participants, who also spent time investigating the
needs of libraries and librarians. For instance, in 2007 XC released results from a survey of
librarians as users intended to gauge interest in the burgeoning system and identifying the types

of functions librarians desired in such a tool.36 Bowen began to delineate between “users” (i.e.,
librarians) and “end users” (i.e., patrons) in her publications about XC.37 As the project
continued to evolve from a patron-facing tool to one for back-end functionality, XC deftly
switched from patrons as the users to librarians and other internal library staff as users. With the
creation of the eXtensible Catalog Organization (XCO), a non-profit organization devoted to the
maintenance and improvement of XC, the shift included not only librarians, but other
implementers of XC: tool creators themselves, such as Carl Stahmer from UC Davis, who used
XC to create a number of digital humanities projects.38

5.2 Revelations about librarianship from a design perspective
Beyond this demonstration of implicit, passive, and externalization of design in American
librarianship, many insights are revealed when looking at librarianship from a design standpoint.
Analyzing these cases from the perspective of design offers insights about knowledge
construction, values, and the effects of materiality on librarianship that have gone mostly
unaddressed in previous applications based in more scientific perspectives.
5.2.1 Knowledge in librarianship
5.2.1.1 Knowledge from artifact making
Established forms of knowledge generation in design differ from those recognized by scientific
paradigms. Typical paradigms in librarianship conduct scientific research meant to inform
design, but often do not result in the creation of an artifact. For instance, Fidel is well-known for
offering design suggestions and guidance based on models developed from research. Her 1999

study of web-searching behavior of high school students offered suggestions for system designs
based on a model of user seeking and searching behavior.39 Another well-known researcher,
Bates examined alternative approaches to subject access in online catalogs to suggest a design
model superior to contemporary catalogs of the time.40 Rather than simply emulating the same
traditional card-catalog structure in electronic form, Bates completely re-envisioned online
subject access. She based her new suggested model of an online catalog not on technological
advancements alone but on philosophical and theoretical design principles of “uncertainty,”
“variety,” and “complexity,” insights gleaned from earlier research projects. She then offered not
only design features that should be included but ways to integrate these features into currently
existing systems, in order to save time and money by repurposing and reorganizing existing
information and structures.
These and other examples from librarianship offer models, suggestions, and implications for
design—but no actual creation of artifacts themselves. Whether for targeted, specific user groups
or broad, abstract applicability, the suggestions put forth in these articles were not taken up to
create functional artifacts, at least not by library scientists. Some of Fidel et al.’s suggestions
may have been folded into projects like CD-ROM and online encyclopedias, but not by libraries
and certainly not immediately.41 Bates’ design model still sits unfulfilled nearly 25 years later.
Yet all of the cases in this study demonstrate legitimate forms of knowledge generation in design
through artifact creation. That is, unlike the traditional examples of design artifacts being
informed by research knowledge, in design epistemology, research knowledge is created through

171
the actual creation and deployment of an artifact. The existence of a new artifact is, in itself, a
form of new knowledge, because something new that did not previously exist has now been
created.42 Each case in this study clearly demonstrates the creation of a new artifact. In addition
to being knowledge themselves, these artifacts create additional knowledge about the problem
situation and context. For example, the XC team used prototypes not just to test functionality, but
to learn: “By building prototypes, we have learned what really will be required to build
functionality such as faceted browsing and cross-schema authority control.”43 As the book
wagon evolved into automobile form, the artifact itself was used to determine the need for the
service:
“[The trustees] decided in November 1949 to use invested funds to buy a bookmobile and
put it in operation to determine the need for the service, and on the use made of it base
the request to the County Commissioners for the support of its continuance. The County
Commissioners were advised of the Trustee’s decisions and were favorably impressed.”44
By building and creating a bookmobile and putting it into service—the actual creation of an
artifact—they were able to determine and demonstrate the need for such service in the
community. This type of creative design-based approach differs from more typical contemporary
techniques of needs assessment or user experience research, such as patron surveys or focus
groups, as it purposefully opens up the design space for uncertainty and experimentation rather
than narrowing focus.45

The typical library user experience assessment techniques reflect the influence of social science
on librarianship, while the use of the book wagon to better understand patron experiences and
values clearly demonstrates a more design-based approach. It uses the creation of an artifact and
its deployment to reveal user needs, rather than a determination of user needs to determine how
and in what way an artifact might be created. Additionally, once an artifact is created, it can be
used to generate additional knowledge. The case of the WCFL book wagon does provide some
evidence that the creation of the book wagon itself generated knowledge about the county
patrons in addition to simply providing a service. This is not unlike the idea of design probes,
which are artifacts specifically intended to gather data about people’s lives, cultures, and
values.46 For instance, even though Titcomb certainly had ideas about what people should read,
interactions between library staff and rural patrons clearly revealed reading desires that were
previously unknown.
“The call for books of a practical nature has been constant, and often it has been
impossible to supply the demand. Everywhere the people are looking to the library for the
best and latest methods of truck gardening, fruit raising, agriculture in all its phases,
while the farmer’s wife welcomes any new suggestions in dairying, domestic science and
poultry culture.”47
This shows how the book wagon created an avenue for knowledge generation regarding the
previously unknown and not well understood information needs of the rural farmers. Interactions
with county patrons during book wagon service also exposed and upturned preexisting
assumptions about their reading habits:

“At the next house we find a lad of seventeen or eighteen who leaves his loaded wagon to
ask if we have anything of Shakespeare’s on our shelves. He says that he read one book
of his once, and that he “thinks he is a real good writer,” a tribute to the universality of
genius quite delightful to encounter. Happily we find a volume of the Rolfe edition
tucked away in one corner, and register again a vow to never forget that the best is none
too good for the country.”48
Such knowledge generation was not just useful locally. Although Titcomb was often called upon
to present at conferences and meetings about the book wagon in general, she also received
requests to specifically speak about the habits and preferences of rural readers.49
“But what sort of books do my people read? I hear you ask. I can only say that they read,
even as you and I, or perhaps more accurately, even as the people in Hagerstown with a
balance in favor of the country. The number of classed books [i.e., books that fall in the
classes of the Dewey Decimal Classification] borrowed is greater in the country, the
percent of fiction being only a trifle over 50. Of the classes, 200 [religion] and 300
[sociology] are especially popular. Colquhoun’s ‘Mastery of the Pacific’ went out with
the wagon a year ago, and has since never been returned, but goes from neighbor to
neighbor. One cannot always tell why a book is in demand, but it is probable in this case,
that it interested some man, who has talked it over with his friends. The taste in religious
books is catholic, with a preference for those of a devotional nature. When it comes to
poetry, we find much more time for it in the country than in the city. Seldom is a book of

poems sent out with the wagon, overlooked. American history, biographies of Americans,
‘good Christian biographies,’ and travel of all sorts are read. Of the fiction, fully 75 per
cent is juvenile, which means that the books are read by both parents and children.”50
The wagon also exposed a new group of people previously unassisted by library services: shutins and other invalids who were physically confined to their homes.51 Such patrons were
previously not on the radar of library staff, and so the wagon helped to generate knowledge about
this new aspect of clientele. Could this kind of knowledge have been acquired through more
scientific means? Surely the patrons of WCFL could have been surveyed, or some other
scientific investigation carried out to glean knowledge about their reading habits and needs. The
point here is not to demonstrate that this knowledge could only be generated through design, but
rather than in this case—a notable case in librarianship—it was in fact generated using design
rather than science.
In XC design was used specifically as a means of generating knowledge. For instance, Lindahl
described a participatory design activity, the ultimate goal of which was not to produce a design
artifact, but to produce knowledge. Teams of students were asked to design an app that would
assist them with group work. But Lindahl and the XC team were not interested in the app itself,
but rather knowledge about how students worked in teams and what they needed in terms of
support to succeed in teamwork.
“We didn’t want their app design, we wanted to understand the work that they needed to
be able to do through the ideas that they came up with in designing their apps. So that’s
what we, and that’s you know our anthropologist had a lot, had a big role in that but the

50

175
idea is all we care about is knowing the work they need to be able to do. And sure, their
apps had good ideas in them, but we weren’t building an app. We were learning about
their work. And we were learning about their work by having them do a creative design
activity that would create something to support their work.”52
This example clearly shows how design is used to generate knowledge. Interestingly enough,
although XC was often referred to as a participatory design project, the participatory design
aspects—that is, involving users in the actual creation of the artifact itself—were almost always
spoken about as part of the user research arm of the project. Participatory design techniques were
mostly used to understand user needs and gather user requirements, rather than in the actual
creation work on the XC schema or the software products. This is not to say that there is a
distinct segregation of these two contexts. After a trip to the design firm IDEO in 2006, Lindahl
notes that there are more similarities than differences:
“I was gratified to learn that much of what we do here at the University of Rochester is
similar to what they do at IDEO. We put more emphasis on work-practice study. They
put more emphasis on prototyping. Many of our methods are similar.” 53
This also demonstrates the use of design as knowledge generation in XC due to the emphasis on
understanding users’ work practices over creating artifact prototypes, reinforcing the idea design
as knowledge generation even more than artifact creation.
Because knowledge in design is inseparable from creation, knowledge is also generated in the
process of creation. Processes of artifact creation such as iteration, design experimentation, the

176
development of repertoire, and active reflection also constitute legitimate design knowledge in
addition to artifactual outcomes. Although as previously noted, minimal reflection was
observable in the selected cases, all three of the other forms of knowledge generation were
present.
Because wicked problems have no stopping rule, and approaches to them are constantly being
reframed, it makes sense that iteration plays a significant role in design. Although iteration is
commonly viewed as a method or a technique (i.e., a practical approach), it can be argued that
iteration is actually epistemological in design; that is, it serves to create knowledge, or at least
contribute to how knowledge is created. For instance, the knowledge that creating a periodical
index would take more than the work of a single person came from Poole’s iterations of the first
and second editions of the Index. Likewise, knowledge that standardization among indexers
would be necessary came through iteration and Poole’s previous work with Gilman. The WCFL
book wagon created knowledge regarding which routes best served the county book distribution
by constantly iterating on them. And XC learned through iteration not only that the massive
number of bibliographic records needed to achieve a goal of incorporating resources from
multiple sources caused immense slowdowns in processing time, but iterative, incremental ways
in which the processing might be sped up. Additionally, although all the cases in this study
demonstrate evidence of iterative processes, evidence from XC clearly shows how iteration was
viewed as an essential knowledge construct by at least one of the team leads. Lindahl specifically
speaks to the role of iteration in the process of design:
“I think people seeing the history, having it all documented, the pictures of the old
interfaces, the written results from doing heuristics testing and assessment usability tests
and the ways that we made changes and the ways that we came to the language that we

177
were using, people easily forget that it’s not about the absolute quality of the current
interface, it’s about the quality of the process, the design process you go through to get
from somewhere to some place better.”54
5.2.1.2 Experimentation other than scientific
In addition to repertory knowledge, Titcomb demonstrates other additional characteristics of
what today would be identified as designerly ways of thinking and knowing. For instance, on
numerous occasions, she refers to the book wagon as an “experiment”:
“Is not Washington County with its good roads especially well adapted for testing an
experiment of this kind, for the geography of the County is such that it could be
comfortably covered by well planned routes.”55
“Though we have had but six months in which to test this experiment, and three of those
embraced the time of greatest industrial activity in a rural community there can be no
hesitation as to pronouncing the wagon a successful venture.”56
“Some experimenting had to be done before the type of car could be found best suited to
the roads and to the convenience of those in charge. The first two, were too heavy,
requiring a chauffeur. The third a Dodge Business Car proved so satisfactory that when it
began to show signs of wear after five years continuous service, it was thought best to
replace it with another of the same make.”57

Although the connotation of the word “experiment” is typically associated with scientific
hypothesis testing, such as a controlled laboratory experiment, the word is also used by design
theorists like Schön to describe what designers do. Rather than leaving the definition limited to
the scientific meaning, Schön distinguishes among multiple types of experimentation, of which
hypothesis-testing (the kind of experimentation used in traditional scientific experimentation) is
only one.58 He also identifies the “exploratory experiment” (i.e., when action is taken only to see
what follows, without any predictions or hypotheses),59 and “move-testing experiments,” where
action is taken to produce an intended change.60 Schön argues that the practice of design includes
all three of these types of experiments, with move-testing being especially significant because
design practice is explicitly interested in change.
The same can be said of Titcomb and the book wagon. There is clear evidence that she was
interested in changing the situation: from illiterate farmers to literate citizens, from library
agnostics to educated lovers of reading. Titcomb did not conduct an experiment solely for the
discovery of knowledge, to see what would happen. She explicitly sought change.
“Miss Titcomb believed that giving out books to those who came for them was but a
small part of a library’s purpose. The important part was to popularize its wares and to
create a demand for them within the community.”61
She desired to create a new demand for books and reading in a community that did not
previously value literacy at the same level she did. The idea of seeking purposeful change is an

inherent characteristic of design epistemology, which rests in the idea of problem solving and
changing from current states to preferred ones.
5.2.2 Material constraints
Unlike some other approaches, looking at librarianship from a design perspective offers the
opportunity to consider materiality in very specific ways. All technological artifacts—physical,
digital, or even conceptual—contain embedded material properties that afford or constrain the
interpretation of that artifact. Inherent, essential properties of artifacts—material or intangible—
shape how they are used: this is the idea that function follows form.62 However, material
properties do not guarantee that artifacts will be interpreted in a single, predetermined way—
demonstrations of interpretive flexibility show us that properties of artifacts do not determine
use. Instead, these properties affect how artifacts can be interpreted, not how they will be
interpreted. Properties reflect affordances, or the possibilities that an object offers for action.63
Affordances are any and all of the possible ways an artifact might be interpreted or used.
Affordances do not prescribe or predetermine use, they simply offer possibilities. Affordances
are a suggestion rather than a command.
While Gibson’s definition of affordances is situated in the natural environment, Hutchby argues
that affordances can exist in other forms: artifacts, other humans, other species, etc.64 He further
fleshes out the definition of affordances as “functional and relational aspects which frame, while
not determining, the possibilities for agentic action in relation to an object.”65 Affordances are
relative to all manner of contexts, including social, cultural, political and economic contexts.

180
While Gibson’s original concept of affordances reflected the natural world, the idea is clearly
extendable to design artifacts, including physical devices, such as axes, shoes, or telephones, or
more complex creations, such as a network of telephone infrastructure or a bibliographic
classification system. Affordances are not limited to the physical materiality of objects, although
those are often the most easily illustratable examples. Just as an axe’s sharp metal blade affords
cutting and the long handle affords leverage, when those two properties are combined, they offer
a new, intangible affordance of splitting logs. It is not one single physical property that affords
this possibility, but the combination of factors that makes splitting logs possible. Similarly for a
telephone network: a telephone may afford the possibility of calling another person, but it is the
underlying infrastructure—not just the physical poles and wires but the structure of the telephone
companies, the standardization of circuits and switches and the number of other people
connected to the network that afford the possibility of global communication. Such complex
constructed concepts are still properties that afford possibilities despite their lack of physical
structure or tangible existence. Even digital media have materialities.66 While we may not
commonly think of digital documents, like web pages, as having materiality, they are certainly
shaped by material infrastructure—maybe fiber optic cable, or wireless routers—but also
infrastructures of standards like the http:// protocol and subscriptions to internet service
providers. It is in this sense that “materiality” refers to more than just physical materials with
embedded properties, but the properties of any artifacts.
In addition to materiality, all technological artifacts—tangible or not—share a common origin:
they were created by humans as opposed to naturally occurring phenomena.67 Therefore, the fact

that we create artifacts also means we can create their affordances. In addition to any naturally
occurring material affordances, affordances may also be instilled or ‘designed in’ to artifacts.68
Hutchby classifies affordances into two major types: functional (possible functions an artifact
allows) and relative (possible functions enabled by particular contexts).69 Overhill categorizes
affordances into seven loose and admittedly overlapping clusters: physical affordances
(comparable to Hutchby’s functional affordances), perceived affordances (physical affordances
visible to users), hidden affordances (physical affordances not visible to users), cascading
affordances (combinations of affordances that offer new possibilities), social affordances
(affordances that enable or thwart social interactions), designed affordances (affordances created
by humans rather than nature) and intellectual affordances (affordances for intellectual rather
than physical possibilities).70 These material and non-material affordances are constraints that
affect the outcome of artifact designs. Whether or not a particular material can be used or a
particular affordance is present ultimately shapes a design.
While affordances do not determine what actors will do with an artifact, they do set limits on
what is possible to do with an artifact. Because affordances are about actions and interactions—
about what we do with artifacts—an analysis of an artifact’s affordances offers better
understanding of social interactions: “they show old behaviors in a new light and illustrate how
new behaviors emerge.”71 Hutchby calls us to pay more attention to materiality and the

affordances that underlie and influence the many different possible courses of action related to an
artifact.72
Examining the material affordances of the artifacts in the three cases in this study reveals not
only a reinforcement of the presence of some of the elements of design epistemology, but also
additional interesting insights regarding innovation and values in librarianship. Although indexes
are intellectual constructs, they must somehow be materially embedded if they are to be
communicated and used. Evidence of materiality manifest in a variety of ways in the case of
Poole’s Index. For instance, the interleaving in the Newberry Library’s copy of the 1848 Index
(Figure 4-1; shown earlier) demonstrates that its material format—printed text on paper, single
spaced—did not leave room for additions or future information. Unlike the materiality of
contemporary periodical index tools, which utilize digital formats, printed text in a bound
volume could not be reordered or afford insertion of new entries. Although the
interconnectedness of materiality was present throughout all editions of Poole’s Index, it became
especially evident in the third edition. Letters between Poole, his colleagues, and publishers
demonstrate material concerns such as quality and durability of paper stock, effects of printing,
and size of the work.73 Still, despite such proactive consideration, the thin paper used in the first
printing of the 1882 index quickly wore out from use.74 The front matter, which included a
“Chronological Conspectus” of titles, volumes, and date ranges of periodicals indexed, was
especially prone to wear, prompting some users to contact Poole with suggestions for
improvement, like printing the front matter on thicker paper or vellum.75 Some suggestions were

implemented: the 1893 reissue was printed on heavier stock.76 However, the thickness of the new
paper across the entire work would make the book so large it would be difficult to bind, much
less use, due to its width (for reference, the 1882 edition on thinner paper measured 3 5/8” wide).
Therefore, the work was divided into two parts and reprinted as a set.77 The suggestions to print
the front matter of sturdier materials were prevented by materiality issues of publishing—it was
too difficult (and too expensive) for the printers to incorporate two different types of paper.78 In
fact, printing the front matter on thicker paper might have been a useful solution indeed, as many
copies from this printing suffered damage from use specifically in this area, prompting libraries
to undertake solutions in this matter for themselves, such as reproducing these pages on heavier
paper and inserting them in during rebinding (see Figures 5-1 and 5-2).

Evidence of materiality’s inseparable connection to access also appears in the fourth

because it would take far too much room, therefore increasing the bulk of the tome and,
correspondingly, the cost.79 Ultimately, material formats affected the publication of the Index
altogether: the final printing of Poole’s Index was in 1963, during an era spurring advances in
digital technologies. This shift in material focus presumably rendered further physical printing of
the Index on paper moot; and indeed when the Index was re-released in 1998 by Paratext LLC, it
was in a digital format.
The material construction of the WCFL book wagon inherently allowed for distribution of
library materials more directly to patrons in the rural outskirts of Washington County. However,
there are several specific examples that show how materiality specifically affected this book
distribution service, most notably in the destruction of the first book wagon. The material
construction of the wagon and its driving over rocky, rough roads meant that it made quite a loud
noise as it traveled. Many farm families knew of the book wagon’s approach because of the
sound, and would come out to meet it.80 But this same noise that worked to elicit interest and
attention from rural residents contributed to the wagon’s demise. On August 25, 1910, Joshua
Thomas left Hagerstown to deliver books when the wagon was struck by a southbound freight
train on the N. & W. railroad crossing at St. James.
“The accident occurred at the crossing, near the residence of Samuel Wroe. Mr. Thomas
left Hagerstown this morning with the team to deliver books in that section of the county
and was driving across the railroad tracks when the accident occurred. He could not see

the train approaching owing to trees along the track and the rumble of the train was
drowned by the noise made by the wagon.”81
According to the Daily Mail, he could not see the train due to trees along the track, nor could he
hear the approaching train over the immense noise of the wagon.82 Thomas suffered a broken rib
and slight abrasions.83 The book wagon was completely destroyed.
Subsequent iterations of the book wagon had material affordances and constraints that both
broadened and reduced service. For example, the adoption of automobiles as the vehicles for
book distribution allowed increased service. Automobiles reduced the time it took to traverse the
county: routes that had previously taken days in earlier iterations of the book wagon could now
be completed in a single day.84 However, the mechanical nature of automobiles—a reflection of
their material construction—led to accidents, breakdowns, and the inability to travel in bad
weather.
“Unfortunately the wagon is a victim of circumstances over which we have no control.
Even at best, but eight or nine months can be counted on, and wet days, wet roads and
repairs shorten the time of operation still more. This year has been no exception. After
the second trip in the Spring, the wagon was in the shop for one month for repairs. Again
this Fall—just at the beginning of our most profitable seasons—two more months were
lost for the same reason, and we were obliged to discontinue the work a month earlier
than usual for lack of a chauffeur.”85

The material nature and construction of the first two automobile versions of the book wagon
made them too “heavy and unwieldy” for the female librarians to drive themselves, and so
required a chauffeur. The material nature of the early automobiles meant that the library had to
hire more staff (and thus spend more money) to continue the book wagon service. But the third
automobile, the Dodge Business Car, did not require a chauffeur. It was light enough to be
driven by the female librarians themselves—as long as one stood on the running board to keep
the car from tipping over while the other drove86—another indication of how materiality shaped
the design of the book wagon service.
Materiality in XC manifested very differently than Poole’s Index or the WCFL book wagon. The
previous two cases dealt primarily with physical materiality, either in the artifact itself or
surrounding material conditions that affected the artifact. But with XC, both physical and digital
materialities affected the design outcomes.
To begin with, the primary goal of XC was originally motivated by a significant issue of
materiality: how to create a catalog interface that could search, browse, and display library
collections of diverse material formats. Previously, most library collections were described
differently based on material format. Even when the same content standards were used for
resource description, additions and alterations had to be supplied to address multiple material and
media formats. For example, even though the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, 2nd edition
(AACR2) ostensibly provided standardized rules for describing all library materials, it contained
separate chapters for describing books, maps, archival manuscript collections, music, sound
recordings, movies and video recordings, images, electronic resources, microforms, three-

dimensional objects, and so on.87 Thus resources of different physical formats are represented by
different metadata, both in terms of content standards but also by different schemas designed to
represent and transmit information. The purpose and function of the XC Schema and the
Metadata Services Toolkit was specifically to transform and standardize metadata from these
multiple disparate sources into a format that could represent all of these materials.
Like an index, a metadata schema is an intellectual product that must be somehow instantiated in
order to be used. Although the XC schema exists as a textual document with identified and
defined elements,88 each of these elements is also instantiated in digital form as a uniform
resource identifier (URI). A URI is a unique character string used to “distinguish one resource
from all other resources.”89 A URI may also specify the location of a resource, especially a
digital resource. This is often done in the form of a uniform resource locator, or URL, such as
typical web address.90 While the concept of URI is not inherently digital—for example, an ISBN
on a printed book may be considered a form of URI—it emerged in the context of digital
resources and thus is often discussed in that context. The URIs in the XC schema are digital, and,
as they take the form of URLs, are also intended as digital locators, either to a referenceable
element resource or to a conceptual XML namespace. However, because these element URIs are
digital, they are subject to the affordances and constraints of digital materiality. Materiality of
digital objects is well-established, both in terms of constraints specific to digital media as well as

being affected by physical infrastructure to support digital products.91 In addition to physical
limitations on digital materiality, like inability to access or use the schema without a computer,
electricity, and internet infrastructure, specific characteristics of digital material, like
ephemerality, come into play. Although it should be noted that according to the definition
document, the URIs for these XC properties are provisional, many of the schema element
URIs—specifically those located in the http://extensiblecatalog.info space—no longer resolve.
That is to say, the actual, digital, element reference no longer exists. This is presumably due to
the change in the top level domain from extensiblectalog.info to the current domain of
xcproject.org, possibly in conjunction with the hand-off of the project from the University of
Rochester to the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI). Attempts
to locate the elements by substituting the new top-level domain in the URI were unsuccessful—
the references did not resolve.
5.2.2.1 Lack of material innovation
It’s true that all design artifacts, in some form or fashion, are limited by material properties, be
they physical or digital. But one notable difference between other design domains and
librarianship is the innovation that emerges from pushing material boundaries based on problem
framing. By that I mean if the goal is truly problem solving, then sometimes the best way to
solve a problem is to develop or invent a new material that achieves your goals, rather than
building a solution limited by the constraints of existing materials. For instance, a fashion
designer charged with designing new police uniforms may create new bullet-proof textiles in the
course of his work. Even when materials do not yet exist, designers do not let themselves be

stifled. Techniques like mock-ups or “Wizard of Oz” prototypes help envision possible
directions for new material innovations.92 To offer a library-related example, the idea for what
eventually became the Google Books project fostered the development of new scanning
materials and technologies that significantly reduced the time necessary to digitize library
materials.93
In contrast, libraries seem resigned to work with existing materials rather than inventing new
materials or drawing from innovative sources. Poole took the physical book form for granted,
never questioning that it was the appropriate way to solve the problem. The XC team found
themselves constrained by MARC and other existing bibliographic standards that held them
back, and rather than develop new standards (which they discovered was ultimately key to
actually solving the problem), they worked within these material constraints, limiting their ability
to solve the original problem from the outset. The one contrast may be the book-wagon, as it
explicitly viewed the situation in terms of how to solve the problem of reaching rural citizens,
rather than “how to reach rural citizens with deposit stations” or any other pre-conceived
materials. Mary Titcomb wanted to get books into the hands of rural readers, and she examined
numerous possibilities for doing so, from deposit boxes to mail order and finally the book
wagon. The material was selected because it solved the problem, rather than the other way
around.

5.2.3 Embedded values
5.2.3.1 Divergence from stated values of librarianship
Unlike natural objects, design artifacts are not neutral, but rife with politics and values. By
offering some possibilities but not others, affordances enact values. Possibly the most notable
example of this is the bridge system designed by Robert Moses in New York. Overpasses were
designed at a height to prevent buses—the typical form of transportation for people of lower
socioeconomic classes—from traveling underneath en route to Long Island.94 Thus an inanimate
object (in this case, a bridge) enacted specific political and value perspectives (the idea that
lower classes were not welcome in the wealthy neighborhoods). This artifact ended up
controlling which people were allowed to travel where as well as determining that the current
system of social class was reinforced.
Although Moses’ values were purposefully embedded in his bridge design, artifacts always
reflect and enact values, regardless of whether or not the designers intended them to do so. We
can see this in tangible artifacts like Pinch and Bijker’s analysis of bicycles, where designs
reflected values like personal safety and femininity. 95 But various analyses of software and
information systems have shown that these artifacts also contain biases, assumptions, and or
worldviews that reflect specific value perspectives.96 Galloway goes so far as to argue that such

embedded determinations are inescapable and all objects are imbued with social power to the
extent that society cannot break free. 97
The creation of artifacts is a central component of design, and one of the things that separates
design from nature. Every artifact has inherent properties and characteristics that inescapably
affect how that artifact can be designed, considered and used. Thus design is a uniquely
positioned lens that allows examination of values in ways that other approaches cannot. Critical
analysis of artifact affordances in each of the three cases reveals insights about library values
regarding where they align with or diverge from established traditional values of librarianship as
well as additional new values not yet formally articulated.
Many values visible in these artifacts align with established values of librarianship. Although the
American Library Association’s statement of core values of librarianship was formally adopted
in 2004, the organization specifically notes that this set of stated values reflects both the history
and the ongoing development of librarianship.98 The stated values include the following:

195
Each of the artifacts considered in this study reflect some portion of the values of librarianship as
stated above. For instance, the first value on the list, access, is defined by ALA as follows:
“All information resources that are provided directly or indirectly by the library,
regardless of technology, format, or methods of delivery, should be readily, equally, and
equitably accessible to all library users.”99
Evidence of this value is present in all three cases. Poole’s Index enabled ready access to library
periodical materials by compiling bibliographic information in one single artifact. Patrons no
longer had to wade through multiple periodical indexes, nor did they need to consult the
librarian. Anyone who came into the library could use the Index, making it equally accessible to
all library patrons. Whether or not this was also equitable access is arguably colored by historical
context. Today we know that literacy levels, library anxiety, and other challenges mean that
access to an index does not necessarily equal access to the information within it; however, given
the zeitgeist of the era in which Poole’s Index was created, the value of access as perceived by
those of the time can be seen. The WCFL book wagon is a more progressive example, as it
explicitly undertook to create equitable access to library materials between urban citizens and
rural residents as one of its major tenets. Without the wagon, library materials would have been
inaccessible by most of the county residents. And through de-siloing of various material formats,
XC enabled more direct access to library materials from multiple sources and of various types.
XC also represents access on a deeper level by establishing the toolkits as open source software
products. This goes beyond equitable access to library materials and offers equitable access of
library tools to other librarians and library staff, which in turn could enable them to offer direct

196
access to materials in multiple formats. The open source nature of the artifact could also be
considered to reflect social responsibility in a way as open source software arguably ameliorates
societal issues surrounding copyright, licensing, and ownership of intellectual property regarding
software. Other examples of cases in this study aligning with ALA values include education and
lifelong learning, which is clearly evinced by Titcomb’s motivations for the book wagon service,
and the ALA value of service, which dovetails with the service orientation of design described in
previous chapters.
Other ALA values are not so clearly represented in the artifacts of this study. There are some
ways in which values may be reflected at an abstract level, such as democracy, which is stated as
a corollary to access in ALA’s code.100 However, the widely-held belief that an informed
citizenry is necessary for a dynamic democracy lends support to cases like Poole’s Index and the
WCFL book wagon. The former offered citizens increased access to periodical content, which
was increasingly the home for political and social writing.101 The latter increased both access to
and interest in information resources from the library. Even the XC may arguably support
informing citizenry through increased support for access to a greater variety of materials.
However, these connections are indirect. The same might be said for values like preservation and
intellectual freedom. There is neither evidence for nor against any strong positions regarding
these values in these artifacts.
A few examples from the artifacts in the three cases demonstrate contradictory values to those
stated by ALA. The most noticeable is the value of privacy/confidentiality, and it arises in the

197
case of the book wagon. A key aspect of the design of the book wagon service is that it visits
patrons’ houses directly. Although the library coming to the user certainly demonstrates a value
of convenience, it also does not afford the same levels of privacy or confidentiality that a patron
might experience when coming to a library space. Library staff working the book wagon routes
sometimes made comments regarding patrons, their residences, and their book choices.
“But as a rule a return trip to certain families is anticipated with much pleasure. One of
these lives near Garrett’s mill and consists of father, mother, a son, and two grown
daughters. They live on a small farm and raise poultry and market produce. Though they
subscribe to only one weekly newspaper they are deeply interested in the big world
outside. This fall they were found cutting corn, shelling beans and baking for a festival to
be held in the neighborhood that evening. Seated on the back porch steps, domestic
problems, the war, and the books they had so thoroughly enjoyed were discussed. Then
all went out to the car for more. Here is what they selected for their winter’s reading:

Other examples of diverging from the value of privacy and confidentiality include observations
and sometimes even intrusions by librarians into patrons’ health and medical situations.
“Many a mother has the wagon woman to thank for bringing her to the ministrations of
the public health nurse. Many a child has been saved from adenoids, weak eyes or other
ailments because of the observing eye and practical helpfulness of the county worker.
Confidence once established not only books for the children and adult education
progress, but in countless ways, the visit of the wagon becomes a blessing.”103
Clearly Titcomb felt that the action we would now construe as intrusive and in violation of
privacy were justified because of the benefit to patrons. There seems to be little recorded as to
patrons’ perceptions of these behaviors, only the opinions of the library staff. Not only did
library staff themselves observe private spaces and behaviors, and take actions based on what
they saw, but they apparently felt no qualms about publishing this information—including entire
lists of titles circulated to patrons—in the library’s annual reports, a violation of privacy that
would be considered anathema by today’s ALA code. But though these actions may be
considered intrusive and in violation of privacy according to the contemporary list of
librarianship’s core values, it should be noted that values are not static. They change over time
and in response to social, political, and other contexts. Viewing Titcomb’s marketing and
communications strategies through contemporary eyes overlooks the evolution of the value of
privacy in librarianship. Privacy was not articulated as a core value until 1939, twenty years after

199
the book wagon service began.104 When the lack of privacy became dangerous to users, privacy
became increasingly valued, such as in the mid-20th century in the context of the Red Scare, and
again in more recent years with the instigation of the Patriot Act.105 Although Titcomb’s
strategies may not have conflicted with the values of librarianship at the time—in fact, they
emphatically supported the contemporary values of education and literacy—examining the value
of privacy in this case offers an increased awareness of how values can change over time and
ideally lets us acknowledge that the values espoused by ALA today may also be different in the
future.
For instance, new values may be incorporated. Beyond the values currently stated by ALA, all
three cases in this study reveal additional values beyond the ones formally stated in librarianship:
notably a commitment to cooperation—a value that has served the field well in many instances
of diminishing resources and other constraints over the course of its history. The cooperative
plan for indexing that emerged from the third edition of Poole’s Index demonstrates the value of
cooperation—without it, the Index would likely have ceased to exist. Poole certainly would not
create another edition on his own; he explicitly stated as much.106 Titcomb notes in meeting
minutes and annual reports that much of the success in achieving the library’s mission is due to
the cooperation of the staff. Certainly the book wagon would not have prospered without the
cooperation of Joshua Thomas, who was officially on the payroll as the janitor and not as book
wagon driver or librarian despite performing tasks accorded to both of those positions. But
cooperation is probably most evident not within WCFL internally, but in Titcomb’s constant

dedication to sharing information about the project with other libraries and institutions wishing
to implement similar services. Regarding XC, cooperation was explicitly built in to the project
from the outset:
“Part of this project plan is to be technological, but an important component identifies
similar projects and then creates a framework for broad-based cooperation and
community-based code development.”107
Cooperation was actively solicited in a variety of areas, including user studies, development of
various toolkit components, implementation, and even in an advisory capacity.108 In addition to
institutional partners, XC also reflects cooperation through the long-established precedent in
libraries of working with students. Five undergraduates at the Rochester Institute of Technology
worked together with librarians at the University of Rochester to create a Name Access Tool
which was subsequently incorporated into the Metadata Services Toolkit.109 Cooperation in
libraries has been the norm since the beginnings of American librarianship. It is arguably one of
the strongest and longest held values in the field. However, despite its prevalence, it does not
appear in ALA’s list of core values. Cooperation should be officially added to the core values of
librarianship to reflect its well-established existence in the field and to support it as an overall
value in society, akin to the other stated values.
Cooperation in XC existed for many of the same reasons as the other cases, such as reduction
and deduplication of labor, standardization, and support for sharing information. However,

cooperation in XC notably demonstrates an additional aspect: a high level of value placed on
freedom and control. XC sought to empower libraries through the use of the DIY and open
source paradigms of the time. Demonstrating that such a powerful product could be developed
by a library (as opposed to a commercial vendor) was one way of asserting power and control.
Another was to accord power and control to other libraries that did not have their own product
development resources by offering XC as open source. Out of all the goals put forth over the
course of the XC project, the commitment to releasing any products as open source was the most
consistent and unwavering aim, as evidenced by the goals stated in various documents over the
course of the project timeline:


develop an open-source online system110



“XC is envisioned as an open-source system that libraries can download and install as an
alternative way for users to access their resources”111



design and develop a set of open-source applications that will provide libraries with an
alternative way to reveal their collections to library users112



Publish the XC code as open source, to be sustained by a community of contributors
bound by a funded governance structure115



Make it possible for libraries to implement an entirely open-source approach to the
discovery of library resources116



publish the XC code as open-source software117



provide libraries with open-source tools and software that will allow libraries to expand
their current roles118

The consistent and unwavering commitment to making XC open source, as well as the
articulated motivations for this move, including “providing libraries with alternative ways to
reveal their collections” and “making it possible to libraries to go entirely open source” and
“expanding library roles,” all speak to a greater aim of releasing libraries from their historical
dependence on commercial software products as well as empowering librarians to invent new
and innovative projects that would reshape the role of libraries.
Much of this was made possible through cooperation, by engendering a feeling of empowerment
in the community and by explicitly differentiating XC work from the work of commercial
entities, as Bowen describes:
“…the Code4Lib community was really kind of instrumental in kind of developing that
kind of community of people who could, “well, we’ll just build it ourselves.” You know,
wanting libraries to not be locked in to what commercial vendors were providing. So

yeah, we were collaborating with them as far as we could in just sort of communicating
with them. I think there was a lot of spirit of, well, what are you doing, and what are you
guys doing, and you know, kind of sharing and comparing notes, which is of course not
what you get with vendors.”119
Unlike many other library projects, XC explicitly demonstrated value of power and control
regarding library designs, and along with it, a form of empowerment.
A strong aspect of librarianship that has enabled cooperation over the course of the field’s
history is standardization. Standardization affords easier sharing of data and resources among
different groups or organizations,120 and even though it has not been formally stated as a
professional value, has been highly valued in librarianship. Poole lead the “central bureau” for
the cooperative indexing work on the 1882 edition, a position that included collating,
alphabetizing, and thoroughly revising all the submitted entries to bring them into a consistent,
standardized form.121 He furnished a “code of rules” for indexing periodicals to each cooperating
library so that all indexing slips arriving to the central bureau would be consistent and therefore
easier to organize and compile.122 The trajectory of XC clearly demonstrates that accomplishing
the lofty goal of bringing together and displaying resources from diverse collections and formats
hinged on standardization of metadata among said resources. XC toolkits were built on standards
like OAI-PMH because of the benefits standardization offered in terms of the ability to use the
tools across collections and organizational settings.123

But in addition to standardized metadata, XC embraced other forms of standardization to support
collaboration among multiple contributors, such as the document repository described by Lindahl
that afforded standardized forms of documentation and version control. Additionally, standards
in software development and open source licensing allowed XC to be shared and used by any
interested party. It is no surprise that Poole’s Index and XC both valued standardization highly,
since they are both projects related to information organization and access, for which
standardization has long been a central tenet. As a counterpoint, the WCFL book wagon offers
little evidence of explicitly valuing standardization; on the contrary, the wagon itself, as well as
its routes and collections varied depending on material availability and influences, community
needs, and other external circumstances.
Although the preceding discussion of values is framed in terms of concurrence or contrast from
the currently stated core values of ALA, it should be noted that values are never that clear cut.
Values—even those articulated together in a set, such as ALA’s list—are always in tension. For
instance, privacy and confidentiality may often come into conflict with other values like access
(such as demonstrated in the case of the WCFL book wagon), diversity (such as demonstrated in
recent cases of recording gender identity information in authority records124), and preservation
(such as preserving private or confidential information in archival collections125). These tensions
are not inherently problematic; however, identifying and acknowledging such tensions is critical
to understanding the discipline of librarianship as well as providing quality tools and services.
Additionally, this review of values also reveals that librarianship has traditionally framed its core
values in terms of services to patrons. This demonstrates the service focus of librarianship and a

focus on users. However, the cases in this study demonstrate values relevant to the practice of
librarianship itself, such as cooperation and standardization. Although these do subsequently
affect library patrons, they perhaps more strongly affect librarians and other practitioners of
American librarianship. This reinforces the idea that librarianship is comprised of two user
groups: patrons and librarians. These groups may or may not have overlapping sets of core
values, and possible value tensions may emerge between these two sets of users.
5.2.3.2 Disconnect between the universal and the ultimate particular
The disproportionate focus on standardization in librarianship may contribute to an ongoing
disconnect between what is referred to in design as the “universal” vs. the “ultimate particular.”
According to Nelson and Stolterman, the “universal” describes abstract ideas, absolute truths,
and overarching theories, while the “ultimate particular” refers to specific, concrete, highly
contextual instantiations. Specific artifacts (tangible or intangible), like a chair, a curriculum, or
a policy, are each an example of an ultimate particular. They are each unique—not the universal
chair, the universal curriculum, or the universal policy. They posit that unlike science, which
begins with ultimate particulars and extrapolates universal knowledge about the world, design is
the process of moving from the universal to specific artifacts (see Figure 5-4).126

206

Figure 5-4. Universal to ultimate particular. From Harold G. Nelson and Erik Stolterman, The Design Way, Figure
1.2, page 31.

Each of the cases in this study are, by their very nature, analyses of examples of particulars.
Poole’s Index was shaped by the specific affordances and constraints that arose from its context
of creation—it would not be the same if it had been, say, Dewey’s or Cutter’s Index, or if it had
continually been written by Poole alone as opposed to the cooperative plan. The book wagon
would be a different design if it had been created in California rather than Maryland, due to
differences in terrain and the diversity and spread of the population. Likewise it would be a
different particular had Joshua Thomas not been the original wagon driver, as his familiarity with
the territory allowed him to traverse the roads, and his rapport with the rural residents went a
long way in building trust and interest in the book wagon. XC might have stayed the course as a
user interface if different people with different knowledge and backgrounds and different
resources had been part of the team.

207
Yet rather than acknowledging the design perspective that particulars derive from universals,
American librarianship seems to have perpetuated the opposite idea. While the emphasis on
standardization and cooperation in librarianship has provided benefits in terms of sharing data,
workload, and resources, it has also left librarianship in a position of attempting to derive
universal particulars—artifacts that work across all contexts. But since design problems have
already been established as wicked problems, inherently affected by diverse contexts and
framings, creating any sort of universal artifact that works for all libraries is a quixotic task. The
focus on the universal level extends throughout the discourse of librarianship: the field often
talks and teaches about libraries in an abstract sense (what I call the “capital-L library”), or even
“public libraries” or “academic libraries” as broad units, even though those libraries may vary
vastly depending on size, geographic locations, and demographics of the clientele, among other
factors. Library tools are often referred to in a similar manner, talking about “library catalogs” or
“storytime” rather than specific instantiations of systems or events. To use a classification
analogy, one might say that librarianship mostly represents a “lumper” point of view, where the
tendency to see similarity puts everything into the same category. But design artifacts (ultimate
particulars) represent the “splitter” perspective, emphasizing differences unique to local and
individual contexts. Although identifying similarity can support cooperation among many
institutions, it may result in less successful design artifacts, as there is no one, universal index or
catalog, no single book wagon or storytime that can serve libraries at the “capital-L” level.

5.3 Summary
In this chapter, I discussed the ways in which elements of design epistemology manifest in
American librarianship based on a critical analysis of three major cases. No discussion can cover
every identifiable theme found in the case evidence, so this discussion has focused on interesting

208
topics pertinent to current topics in the field that emerged from my interpretation of the evidence.
While some points may seem negative or critical, it is not my intention to take away from the
many positive contributions these libraries and their designs have made. Rather, this is a product
of the critical analysis method that specifically seeks to change the status quo and critique the
current existing situation.
Discussion of elements of design epistemology from each of the three cases reveal that design
epistemology is often present, but implicit, in American librarianship. When design
epistemology is present, it may be relegated to external contexts, like other professions or fields,
and not considered part of librarianship. Elements of design epistemology present in
librarianship also help to concretely support the idea of librarianship’s focus on users. Beyond
these discussions, this chapter also reveals about knowledge construction, values, and the effects
of materiality on librarianship that have gone mostly unaddressed in previous applications of
more scientific perspectives.

209

Chapter 6 Reflection and Recommendations
I have previously shown that elements of design epistemology manifest in various ways in
librarianship, and that because of this manifestation, librarianship can validly be considered a
design discipline. However, the design epistemology that underlies these manifestations is
implicit throughout the field and/or externalized as the work of other fields and disciplines. In
this chapter, I turn to critical reflection to discuss some possible reasons for this implicit
externalization as well as implications for the field. Based on previous discussion and these
reflections, I then recommend ways that design epistemology might be more explicitly
manifested and embedded in research, education, and practice the field in the future.

6.1 Reflections
6.1.1 Why is design implicit and external?
If we acknowledge the potential power inherent in embracing design epistemology in American
librarianship, then why does design epistemology remain implicit and external? Some of it may
be due to the conceptual framing of librarianship: if the field has not been explicitly understood
as a design field, then there is no reason to believe that design elements and concepts would be
considered in any formal or explicit way. The historical evolution of the field, as discussed in
Chapter 2, certainly had a significant influence. The lack of available language may also be a
reason: since librarianship predates the formal articulation of design as epistemology, librarians
may not be familiar with this discourse with regard to discussing their actions.
In addition to these explanations, the evidence in this study reveals that lack of resource support
for design—both in terms of concrete resources as well as intangible resources like leadership
and intellectual grounding—may also contribute to the externalization of design in librarianship.

210
Poole’s Index clearly demonstrates a lack of support for design work through the absence of
funding for the project and the shifting of the work to outside of library time. Titcomb had
moderate success convincing the WCFL board of trustees to support the book wagon, but
support for the project varied over the years, leaving large blocks of time when no book wagon
existed. When the board did support the book wagon in terms of financial support, they were
supporting the idea of the existing service, rather than supporting a holistic approach to design in
librarianship.
Several examples from XC directly speak to a lack of support for design in libraries overall. For
instance, Lindahl mentioned wanting to incorporate elements of design epistemology from his
time at Xerox into his library work at University of Rochester. He made requests to the Dean to
hire an anthropologist full-time, and was denied because funding was unavailable. The Dean
suggested, however, that Lindahl secure grant funding to hire an anthropologist for a one-off
library project as a proof-of-concept, that might (and eventually did) help support his case for
hiring Foster full-time.1 Without that initial grant funding, many of the design elements in the
work of XC and other projects at the UR libraries would never have been supported. Thankfully
UR’s academic library setting supported the grant application process—a luxury that not all
libraries have, as many libraries, especially public libraries, face constraints like a lack of time to
devote to grant writing or lack of experienced mentors to guide a successful application. But
even grant-funded support is not enough in the long run, as Bowen notes:
“…at some point the sustainability becomes the issue, you know, because we were trying
to sustain things through grants, and eventually the grant money dries up. And if there

211
isn’t a large community that can support it—and you need a pretty large community of
users to be able to support something—you know, it’s just not a model that’s as
sustainable as we thought it was.”2
Foster also mentions the lack of sustainable financial support for innovative design projects in
libraries and contexts that support design epistemology:
“In the meantime, however, the library funding situation has deteriorated so badly.
Whereas at the time we started eXtensible Catalog, we had a software shop in our library
and a lot of other libraries did too. And now that’s rare. It’s disappeared from the
University of Rochester. It’s gone. So that project could never be done now. It’s
unthinkable. That’s over. And also at many of the other places that contributed
programming time and money, that’s dried up. And I think that it’s really, I mean this is
not what you’re asking me about, but it’s a really terrible backward step in academic
libraries because it makes academic libraries even more dependent on vendor products,
you know, commercial products. And there are a few of these projects that are just doing
really cool stuff that can amount to something, but you really, at some point you really
need a big investment to make a big system. And that’s just not available now. Nobody’s
making that kind of investment.”3
Support is often financial, but not always. Lindahl discusses additional infrastructure at
Rochester that allowed for design support, such as the use of a document repository to support
iteration:

212
“And you know, one of the challenges of academic libraries is there’s bigger, moreresource-rich ones, and there’s smaller ones, and most academic libraries don’t have a lot
of resources. So they’re challenged on what they spend their money on. But I think
academic libraries that want to do projects and don’t have a repository to manage their
documents are missing out a lot. So I would say that XC couldn’t have happened without
some way of having a robust management of documents. So we had version control, we
had the ability to share documents, collaboratively author them, to keep track of
requirements, to iterate on things. You know, iterate, iterate, iterate. To do usability
testing, to see the results, to write the results down, to be able to go back and see how we
progressed through versions of things. All of that is just basic and foundational. But I
think there’s a lot of libraries that don’t have any experience with having tools like that.
So they don’t know what they’re missing.”4
Foster and Lindahl both discuss more than just a lack of funding. Foster clearly alludes to the
power struggle that libraries still find themselves in because design is controlled by external
players (in this case, commercial software vendors). While Foster Spoke specifically in the
context of technology, beneath the surface her words allude to aspects of design epistemology
that underscore that software production, such as anthropological studies of work practices that
guide software design. What we see here is a lament about an increasing lack of fostering space
for forward-thinking, innovative design potential. Lindahl expresses frustration not just with a
lack of financial resources, but libraries’ lack of experience. Why would any library advocate for

4

Lindahl, interview.

213
funding for design resources or support if they’ve never experienced the benefits of such
approaches?
Yet libraries have been advocating for design resources and support—for patrons. For example, a
number of contemporary American libraries have successfully gleaned resources to create
“makerspaces” or “innovation labs” for patrons. But what Foster and Lindahl describe at
Rochester was an innovation lab for the library itself. Taking away this kind of makerspace
intended to serve the library (as opposed to one intended to serve library patrons) takes away
support for design in libraries and continues the externalization of design. Libraries are then left
to support the innovation of others without being able to support, understand, integrate and
design for themselves.
Like other forms of support, leadership can also play a make-or-break role. There is no doubt
that each of the cases in this study demonstrate strong leadership. Many well-known library
projects were only made possible by the existence of a strong figurehead ignited by passion.5 The
same can be demonstrated in these cases regarding Poole, Titcomb, and the combined leadership
of Bowen, Foster and Lindahl. Each had passion that drove their respective projects forward.
However, it is possible that in addition to mere passion, the “designerly way of knowing”
espoused by Cross and others also contributed to leadership support. For instance, Lindahl
clearly demonstrated a designerly way of knowing through his comments about many of the
elements of design epistemology, such as iteration. Is this because he is an innately creative
person? Or is it because he was trained in designerly ways of knowing during his time at Xerox
and subsequently sought to further his own education in this area through visits to places like the

214
IDEO design firm? We may never know,6 and these may not be separable binary concepts. But
whatever the reason, XC had at least one leader who explicitly espoused a designerly way of
knowing.
Evidence also reveals that Mary Titcomb may have also had a similar mentality. Although there
is no way to know for sure whether Titcomb explicitly considered herself a designer, she
certainly demonstrates many of the traits associated with what we identify as designers today.
Marcum comments on Titcomb’s user-centered attitude,7 and newspaper articles consistently
refer to her as “an innovator.”8 Beyond the many WCFL programs and services she created, she
was noted for designing and making all her own “wearables” 9 and even designing “Library
House,” the building in which she lived at 634 Summit Avenue: “It was built and given to the
Library by Mr. E. W. Mealey following Miss Titcomb’s plans.”10 Titcomb may or may not have
known that these traits were “designerly” ones, but by doing them she demonstrated how this
type of overall holistic designerly mindset that pervaded her whole life also influenced her
library work. To others, it may have been special or different, but perhaps Titcomb was not
acting as a designer, she was just acting as who she was, which happened to be designerly, thus
leaving design as an implicit component of her leadership.

6.1.2 Who are the users in librarianship?
Regardless of the varying epistemological influences over the course of its history, American
librarianship has traditionally considered itself to be a user-centered field. The user focus in all
three of the cases in this study is clear. Poole sought to connect library users to information
within periodicals, both through efficient collocation of information previously spread across
multiple sources as well as offering users direct access to the information, enabling them to find
resources themselves, without needing intermediary help from a librarian. Titcomb’s goals for
the book wagon were heavily rooted in reaching users who previously did not have access to or
knowledge of the benefits of the public library. Her user-centered focus can also be seen in her
desire to improve the rural citizenry through literacy and access to reading materials and
educative information. XC began with the intended goals of offering library users a new catalog
experience, one that presented bibliographic information for a variety of resource formats in a
single, unified presentation. Yet as the project progressed, the idea of the user also evolved, and
ultimately XC offered tools for a user group comprised of library staff and other related metadata
professionals.
This illustrates an interesting pervasive tension regarding user-centeredness in librarianship: the
idea that for any given library artifact there may be two general sets of users—patrons and
librarians.11 While the goals of these two groups often overlap, their frames and contexts of
needs and experiences will naturally mean that an artifact created to serve one group may not
fully fulfill the needs of the other.

11

Author’s note: Debate around the terminology used to describe library users has been contentious in recent years,
with advocates and opponents for terms like “library users,” “patrons,” and “customers.” In this section I use the
term “patrons” to describe non-library staff people who partake of a library’s goods and services. I use the term
“librarians” loosely to represent those employed by or otherwise trained in libraries and library services.

216
An artifact designed to serve two masters may end up serving neither. Although social science
approaches to librarianship have offered user-centered focus through methods such as needs
assessment and community analysis, design can offer a more nuanced understanding of the
tension among multiple user groups. Although design is often thought to be in service to users
(and indeed it is), design is also governed by the notion of a client. Nelson and Stolterman
delineate that a design client is not the same as a design user or consumer; rather, the client is
part of a balanced, symbiotic relationship with the designer.12 They emphasize the difference in
the two roles by saying that design is done with clients while design is something done to users.13
Drawing on the idea of the client inherent in design lets us look at the user focus of librarianship
from a new perspective. In the cases in this study, the intended users are often clear: all of the
artifacts were originally intended as tools or services of benefit to library patrons. In reviewing
each of these cases, however, identifying the client is murkier. In the ideal client-designer
relationship, the client and designer are separate entities, with the client offering desiderata to be
teased out and iteratively innovated on by a designer with alternative repertory experiences and
framing perspectives, ultimately resulting in an outcome that delightfully surprises both.14 In
both the cases of Poole’s Index and the WCFL book wagon, the designer and the client appear to
be one and the same. Poole observes his perceived problem of access to periodicals and proposes
and enacts a solution. Titcomb seeks to address her own agenda of educating the populace. This
reduces the potential for the “surprise of self-recognition,” or the provision of a solution to the
client that fulfills needs they could not articulate because they did not know they had them.15 I

217
suspect in both cases, and possibly many others in librarianship, the designers presumed that
library users were the clients. But clients are active participants in the design process, and these
examples of Poole’s Index and the WCFL book wagon are clearly situations of designs being
done to patrons, rather than with them.
If patrons are not the clients in librarianship, then who is? Librarians may assume they are clients
in the context of vendor-supplied services, perhaps because the word “client” is commonly used
to describe such a purchasing or licensing relationship. Yet here too I would argue that librarians
are actually users, having design done to them rather than with them. This lack of symbiotic
relationship in the design process was a large part of the underlying motivation for XC’s
commitment to open source principles. XC also demonstrates a more balanced designer-clientuser relationship through its evolution from patron tool to librarian tool, and the accordant
shifting of priorities. Being a client and thus having the ability to participate in the design
process is a more empowering role than that of the passive, receptive user. Empowerment of
libraries and catalogers is mentioned throughout the lifespan of the XC project.16
In addition to librarians shifting from users to clients, other perspectives on the idea of clients
may come into play. Simon suggests that as problems become increasing wicked, especially in
terms of complexity and interconnected social factors, society itself may serve in the role of
client.17 This perspective was added to the third and final edition of his seminal text after many
years of reflection and observation. He suggests that the power of the client in a client-designer

relationship rests not only in helping to shape the goals of the design, but also in reacting to
proposed and enacted designs. Since libraries face wicked problems are embedded in societal
contexts, it may be useful for libraries to consider the ways in which society might act as client.
6.1.3 Which values “should” be embedded?
The externalization and implicit treatment of design in American librarianship also reveals a
significant disconnect between the creation of library tools and services and the values those
tools and services embody and reflect. The idea of seeking purposeful change is an inherent
characteristic of design epistemology, which rests in the idea of problem solving and changing
from current states to preferred ones. While design is about solving problems, it offers two
differing yet complementary perspectives on problem solving: creating a solution based on what
could exist, or creating one that should.18 The former identifies possibilities while the latter
makes a judgment about the world. Although librarianship has a tradition of offering a neutral
and objective standpoint,19 values and perspectives about how the world “should” be are
embodied in library artifacts regardless of neutral intentions. Each of the three cases in this study
clearly show evidence that the designs were motivated not just by how the world could be, but
how the designers thought it should be. This demonstrates not only that particular values are put
forth over others, but also that librarianship is a design field because it adheres to this notion of
“should be.”
The case of Poole’s Index clearly demonstrates an emphasis on the value of service, a value also
acknowledged by ALA as core to the profession. However, Poole’s attitudes and actions clearly

reflect a particular interpretation of how service “should be” in librarianship. While ALA
emphasizes the value of service excellence through maintaining and fostering ongoing education
and professional development,20 the case of Poole’s Index clearly demonstrates a different
interpretation. To Poole, service meant that librarians should be willing to sacrifice their own
time and skills, and perform professional work off the clock and without pay. Such selfsacrificing labor is what drove the completion of the third edition of the Index and arguably
assisted in the externalization of design in librarianship. Poole’s idea of using off-hours labor to
create a product that he believed would demonstrate its own value—and thus what librarianship
should value—backfired.
In contrast, the WCFL book wagon is a prime example of seeking purposeful change through
design. From the outset, the book wagon was created to foster one particular perspective: that the
county residents should have library service equal to that provided to those in the town. This is
already a particular judgement about how the library should function, albeit based on the norms
of government in the state of Maryland. However, like many librarians of this time period,
Titcomb felt a strong pull towards progressive social change, especially regarding literacy and its
relationship to democracy and informed citizenry.
“Miss Titcomb believed that giving out books to those who came for them was but a
small part of a library’s purpose. The important part was to popularize its wares and to
create a demand for them within the community.”21

220
Creating a demand for books—especially the “best” books—meant that patrons were more
interested in reading and therefore increasingly educated and literate. Titcomb had an entire
list—nearly a manifesto—of what a county library “should” be: it should provide the best
reading, it should supply technical books, it should gather and arrange materials for Club and
Sunday School programs; it should supply reading material to local hospitals; it should maintain
a children’s story hour; it should maintain an expert to liaise with school system; it should
provide a network of service throughout the county.22 This was not just how she thought WCFL
should be, but all county libraries should undertake these tasks.23 Titcomb’s strong position
about how libraries should be reflects both the evangelistic perspective of librarianship at the
time as well as the purposeful state of change sought in design epistemology.
XC also explicitly and purposefully sought change, with a vision of how librarianship—or at
least library catalog software—should be. XC aimed to “provide better tools than the ones people
are currently using.”24 Not only does this demonstrate a value judgement (that existing tools are
unsatisfactory), but XC clearly delineates what comprises “better” (i.e., how it should be):

22



XC should specifically meet identified work practices and preferences



XC should be intuitive and innovative



XC should meet current and emerging needs25

XC presented not only a position on how catalog interfaces should be designed for library patron
use (including features like faceted browsing, user recommendations, tagging, etc.) but also on
how these systems should function for library professionals though the provision of a metadata
platform supporting interaction with multiple metadata schemas.26 XC claimed to offer the
potential to allow library users to “get more out of academic collections” and “give academic
libraries more control over how best to help people gather information,”27 clearly demonstrating
a value judgement by claiming to know what would be “best.” The XC team clearly had a vision
of how library catalogs should be: open-source, user-intuitive, congruent with the FRBR model,
locally customizable, interoperable.
This idea of creating normative designs partially stems from the idea that users can’t or don’t
always articulate what they want, therefore it rests on the designer to elicit desiderata to “give the
users what they didn’t know they wanted.”28 Library users did not come to Poole and ask for a
comprehensive subject index to periodical literature. But Poole understood, through problem
finding and framing, repertoire, and a dedication to user service, that some solution was
necessary, and that solution should take the form of a periodical index. The rural residents of
Washington County did not know they wanted or needed books and literacy. In fact, many stated
they would have preferred a mill or hospital to a library.29

spending it on ‘such foolishness’ as books and the book wagon. Now, however, public
opinion is sufficiently won to make them think it wise not to disapprove too openly.”30
But Mary Titcomb felt that the role of a library was not to satisfy the users’ stated needs, but to
show them why they should readjust their stated needs and desires.
“Furthermore, the work of a Library in a community is never solely to supply known
wants but ever and always to be on the alert to create a demand. The gospel of books is
like the gospel of eternal life for which the world has never hungered until it has been
brought to them by the zeal of its ministers. So with books. The time has passed when it
seemed all sufficient to open the doors with the invitation, ‘Here is a Library free as air to
all who wish to use it.’ The Librarian has learned that as far as lies within his resources, it
is his business to see that the right book reaches the right person, even if it involves
convincing that person that he wants the book.”31
Titcomb often described libraries and librarianship in relation to missionary work, reflecting the
evangelical and missionary spirit so prevalent in the discipline at the time. Even XC espoused a
viewpoint that library software should be cooperative and shared, that libraries should embrace a
DIY mentality and should not be beholden to commercial products and vendors. But over the
course of American librarianship, an increasing focus on technical skills and standards first put
forth by Dewey, as well as an increased commitment to scientific objectivity and neutrality that
emerged with the advent of formal education for librarianship, seemed an attempt to leave the

223
missionary mentality behind.32 However, it seems clear from these and other examples that the
prevalence of the “should” in librarianship only reveals a continued evangelical standpoint.
ALA’s motto, “the best reading for the most people at the lowest cost,” coined by Dewey in the
late 19th century,33 has been the subject of heated debate and criticism for being paternalistic and
condescending.34 Others continue to support and laud the admittedly judgement-laden motto.35
Despite motions to rescind it, it continues to represent the organization today, 36 demonstrating a
continued normative focus on what libraries should be. Likewise, the contemporary
#WeNeedDiverseBooks campaign touted by libraries and librarians also asserts judgement about
what kinds of resources should be published, distributed and read. Both the 19th century motto
and the 21st century hashtag make strong statements about how the world should be, and how
librarianship can help achieve that state.
My reason for bringing these examples is not to criticize them for being non-neutral. Instead, I
use them to demonstrate that no matter how strongly librarianship asserts itself as a profession
underscored by objective and neutral scientific approaches, these types of normative judgements
that rest solidly in the realm of design are present throughout librarianship. As such, these
powerful assertions about access, literacy, diversity, and intellectual freedom—the core values of
the field—may be considered a form of design desiderata. Perhaps the evangelical and
missionary nature of librarianship that some in the profession are quick to dismiss is actually a

feature, not a bug. Rather than fighting against the tide, and changing what the field is to fit the
scientific paradigm, a design epistemology that specifically allows and advocates for normative
perspectives may be a better fit.

6.2 Recommendations
Based on the elements of design epistemology revealed in this study as well as the critical
reflection, I turn now to recommendations for how design epistemology might be made more
explicit in American librarianship and ways in which a more explicit approach to design
epistemology might reflect the core values of the field in a proactive manner.
In this section, I recommend significant shifts in the cultures of research and publication in
librarianship; changes for education and training for the field; and supporting the reframing of
library practice as design. To anyone familiar with design, many of these recommendations may
seem minor. However, in the context of librarianship, recommending such a paradigm shift
challenges many established contexts and norms. Although these recommendations may seem
tame to those outside the field, within librarianship many of these suggestions could be
considered radical.
6.2.1 Shift the culture of research and publication
Research in librarianship is traditionally conceptualized according to established models and
norms of scientific epistemologies. Therefore, to make design explicit, new methods and
paradigms for library research are necessary. Design research in librarianship has traditionally
been defined in a very narrow way, and still in line with the paradigms of science. However,
paradigms for research based on design epistemology do exist, although they are known by
different names and may be defined slightly differently by different scholars and in different
fields. “Research through design,” “design-based research,” “design inquiry,” “design research

225
methods” (among many other phrases) are used to describe, in some form or fashion, the
application and incorporation of elements of design epistemology into research inquiry, either in
addition to scientific approaches or as distinct from them. Due to the spread across disparate
domains, numerous terms and phrases have arisen with regard to design research, and naturally
these different fields will harbor different definitions. Work to disentangle these terms and
definitions is ongoing, with inevitably divergent conclusions depending on disciplinary
perspectives and domains. The space needed to adequately explicate and synthesize the nuanced
differences across these myriad perspectives would constitute a dissertation in and of itself, and
thus that task remains far out of scope for this context. But in general, some definitions focus on
“design research” as a type of action research method, by designing, implementing, and
evaluating artifacts intended to solve problems through intervention.37 In addition to solving such
problems, goals of a design artifact may also include improved products or user experiences. For
example, in the field of information systems management, “[d]esign science research requires the
creation of an innovative, purposeful artifact for a special problem domain. The artifact must be
evaluated in order to ensure its utility for the specified problem. In order to form a novel research
contribution, the artifact must either solve a problem that has not yet been solved, or provide a
more effective solution.”38 Others propose related yet different models: “design-based research
goes beyond merely designing and testing particular interventions,” beyond simple evaluative
measures of success or failure, to look at human interaction with design artifacts to reveal new
knowledge about human behavior.39 The key difference lies in the intention to produce

knowledge rather than solely a problem solution artifact.40 Therefore, this model concerns itself
primarily not with the artifact and its function, but rather the use and interaction with said artifact
and what that might reveal. These are both different from the model of “design research”
intended to reflect the study of design itself, that is, research about design activities, methods,
techniques, and processes.41 Other similar phrases may be used to describe very different
notions, such as the difference between “research-oriented design” (meaning design that draws
on scientific research, such as user studies) versus “design-oriented research” (referring to the
gleaning of new research knowledge through the process of design).42
Some of these models of design research already exist in librarianship. A notable example is the
idea of design as form of action research, such as the method put forth by Bowler and Large.43
But the design-as-action-research model is still framed in a traditional scientific epistemology,
and therefore hinges on traditional ideas of research rigor, validity, and assessment. Alternative
models, such as the one articulated by the Design Research Collective above, focus less on the
evaluation of an artifact’s success and more on the human behavior that surrounds it. Although
myriad examples of research regarding human information behavior around artifacts does exist
in librarianship (for example, catalog use studies), I would hesitate to call these design-based
research in the same sense, because those artifacts were not made with the intention and purpose
of studying human behavior. The artifacts were created first and foremost to solve a problem;

understanding human information behavior surrounding them is secondary at best. The idea of
intentionally creating an artifact with the main purpose of studying library patrons’ behavior is
an intriguing one, and should not be ruled out as a possibility for research in librarianship. But
this model also often relies on social science methodologies, such as ethnographic investigation,
to surface knowledge about human behavior, and is therefore still shaped by scientific
epistemologies. Instead, I suggest that research fundamentally rooted in design epistemology,
and the forms of knowledge considered valid in design, is more appropriate to research in
librarianship. This aligns most closely with the models of “design-oriented research” or
“research through design,” which reflect epistemological perspectives based in design, rather
than applying scientific ones. To make design more explicit in librarianship, the field needs to
harness these methods instead of (or at least in addition to) scientific research approaches.
Such a paradigm shift may be easier said than done. How does a field even go about starting
such a major conceptual shift in research? One way might be to focus on the established idea of
design artifacts as knowledge. Although librarianship has a long history of making design
artifacts, when it comes time to share or disseminate that artifactual knowledge, traditional
venues reject or chastise such submissions because they lack scientific rigor. For instance, a
paper I was once assigned to review discussed a library’s creation of a new database of mural art.
Yet the paper was not published, one of the reasons being that the authors did not include a
section on assessment, like a patron use survey, to demonstrate some sort of improvement effect.
Projects like these from practicing librarians seeking to contribute knowledge to their field are
often chastised for what have come to be known as “this is how I did it in my library” projects.
But scientific methods cannot measure design success. Traditional forms of scientific assessment
assume a linear design process: assess needs, build, evaluate. But even though that model has

228
long been disproven in design, it continues to be applied in librarianship. As Lindahl noted, we
need to be explicitly cognizant of design as process-focused rather than product-focused.
Therefore the standard final scientific evaluations, like patron use surveys or pre- and post-use
comparison of web log data, are inapplicable. There is no final build to evaluate, because the
iterative nature of design means the design is never done.
Instead, the process of how an artifact is created—be it a tangible tool or intangible service—is
the epitome of design knowledge and is a legitimate form of knowledge in design. Rigor in
artifact making then comes from explicit rationale, expert critique, and reflection. “Whenever
practitioners describe their influences, discuss the rationales for design decisions, and articulate
their assessment of what they have made and its importance, they engage in a form of implicit
conceptual work by highlighting important issues, dimensions of similarity, and criteria for
choices and success.”44 In the case of the paper submission about the mural art database, the
component of scientific assessment should not have been a determining factor in evaluation of
rigor. Instead, if the discipline explicitly considered rigor in terms of design epistemology, then
the discussion of the artifact and its significance—the first database to tackle description of this
prevalent local art form—and the challenges faced and decisions made during its creation would
qualify as a legitimate contribution to knowledge in the field. Additionally, while a more
scientific-based user assessment component may have offered knowledge about local adoption
and needs, the discussion and reflection around challenges and decision rationale possibly offer
more universally applicable knowledge, and would therefore be more useful to other
professionals and researchers in the field. Thus, rather than being chastised, the “this is how I did

Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2010), 937-946.

229
it in my library” paradigm should be acknowledged as a valid contribution to knowledge in
librarianship.
For librarianship to support this artifact-based approach, the evaluative elements of design
epistemology—rationale, critique, reflection—that are currently implicit in tool and service
creation need to be made explicit through institutional support and structural scaffolding. For
instance, research outlets, such as scholarly journals, need to not only accept that these concepts
reflect rigor, but also help to communicate and support these concepts through reviewing and
mentorship of submissions. Publications should require sections on rationale and/or reflection as
mandatory inclusions for any submissions. If existing venues are not willing to support this
approach, new venues for sharing and disseminating information surrounding library designs that
acknowledge the legitimacy of evaluation methods based in design epistemology need to be
created. Other institutional structures, like ALA or similar organizations, should foster and
support expert critique for evaluating artifacts, using examples such as the annual video and
website critique sessions offered at conferences like Museums and the Web as springboards.45
Such critique sessions hinge on the idea that participants have expertise not only in the libraryrelated subject area, but also in giving and receiving critique, which requires explicit education,
training, and practice.
6.2.2 Change library education and training
Explicitly instantiating foundations of design epistemology into library research cannot emerge
from thin air. Rather, librarians must be educated about design epistemology, its principles and
tenets, and how to explicitly incorporate those ideas into the practice of librarianship. Much of

45

http://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/session/web-crit/

230
our epistemological understanding (be it conscious or no) stems from our educational
background. Yet a pilot study at the University of Washington Information School reveals a
significant lack of MLIS students with educational backgrounds and experience in design
fields.46 One way to increasingly incorporate design epistemology into librarianship is for library
education and graduate degree programs to specifically recruit students from design backgrounds
to counterbalance the myriad students coming from the humanities and social sciences and
bringing understanding of those specific paradigms to their work.
Additionally, I recommend re-envisioning library education to correspond more closely with
design education, which focuses on the central tenet of “learning by or through doing.”47 A large
component of education in librarianship in America is a graduate level degree still rooted in the
scientific epistemological focus established in the 20th century. Contemporary graduate level
education in librarianship has seen a shift to more practical, real-world, problem-based projects,
such as the increasing shift from research theses to capstone projects and other problem-solving
culminating experiences.48 Individual course projects may also be problem-based or related to
professional practice, which is also to be lauded in terms of offering hands-on experience to
students. Yet many of these projects occur at the culmination of a term or a degree, leaving little
space for iteration or reflection.
However, the “learning through doing” model of education in traditional design fields such as
architecture, product design, etc., extends beyond individual assignments to the entire

atmosphere of the educational environment. Schön explicitly calls out the difference between
practica in professional schools and his reflective practicum of the design studio:
“…it would not be organized to apply classroom knowledge to practical [i.e., real world]
problems. It would be studio-like in the sense that it would organize itself around projects
of simulated practice and would ask students to plunge into these before they know what
they need to be doing or learning. It would expose students to the demonstrations, advice,
and criticism of master practitioners. It would focus on the messiness of problematic
situations which need to be converted to well-formed problems before they can be solved
by the application of established techniques. It would pay attention to the strangeness of
unique cases that escape the categories of established theories. And it would engage the
appreciative, value-laden questions as well as the technical ones. It would not eschew the
use of research-based knowledge, but it would not assume that project tasks are only
done, or best done, through the use of such knowledge.”49
Exposure to the skills of idea generation, production, and critique is notoriously difficult and
elusive to convey in a traditional classroom environment.50 The model of the design studio—a
physical and intellectual space specifically created to support learning by doing—lets students
learn from the actual practice of designing itself, helping them internalize covert and implicit
elements of design epistemology can that cannot be adequately conveyed through other forms of
education like lectures.51 The contemporary model of the design studio sees students tackling
projects under the supervision of master designers and in close proximity with their peers, which

can foster camaraderie among students.52 Throughout the term, student work is evaluated by
classmates, the instructor, and/or panels of outside experts. These “crit” sessions not only
provide students with direct feedback on the project at hand, but they also prepare students to
give and receive constructive feedback as well as construct frameworks for evaluation (i.e., not
just “I like it” vs. “I don’t like it,” but the ability to see what a client needs and how well or
poorly any given design may address those needs).53 Students learn not only from their own
successes and mistakes, but those of other classmates as well, affording them opportunities to
witness other problem-solving approaches and alternative solutions within a short time frame.54
Schön explicitly argues that the design studio model of education should be the next liberal arts
mode of education.55 Design studio models of interaction have also been shown to offer a useful
approach and provide a necessary complement to more traditional scientific models underlying
professional technical education, especially in information science and technology.56 Given the
relevance of both liberal arts and information science to librarianship, it stands to reason that
studio-based education may also be useful and applicable to library education.
The concentrated interactions fostered in studios also help students build their repertoires of
knowledge. In addition to project outcomes, design education harnesses the ideas of iteration and
process. Students are often required to keep notebooks, sketchbooks, or journals, not just to
record ideas for future remembrance, but also to allow for the exploration of and experimentation

with new ideas. Such journals also represent an ongoing instantiation of a student’s burgeoning
repertoire of knowledge. Reframing education in librarianship as a foundation for repertoirebuilding not only reflects the field’s core value of lifelong learning, but it can also reduce the
pressure from the ever-increasing range of knowledge students expect library education to
provide. Currently students leave graduate library education programs complaining that they still
lack sufficient knowledge, and employers opine that students are under-knowledgeable in key
areas. Yet given double the time and resources, graduate library education could still not hope to
cover everything a professional librarian needs to know. Instead of trying to achieve a quantity of
knowledge, explicitly framing graduate library education as teaching students problem-solving
and repertoire building would better prepare them for the ever-changing situations they will face
in their professional careers.
The above suggestions are predicated on the current framing of library education as graduate
level education governed by a formal accrediting body (in America, the American Library
Association). However, much of the problem-based focus and integration of repertoire, critique,
and lifelong learning described above are not inherent to a graduate level education. I
recommend reconsideration of the mandate for library education to be offered at the graduate
level. Multitudes of programs for design education exist in both formal undergraduate education
as well as apprenticeship spaces, providing evidence that education in design techniques,
methods and epistemology does not require an advanced degree. While I acknowledge the many
potential political and professional ramifications, graduate education is becoming increasingly
less sustainable financially for many prospective librarians, and the prerequisites for graduate
level education may contribute to reducing diversity in the field. I am not recommending an
immediate disregard of existing graduate library education programs; however, careful

234
reconsideration of the purposes and benefits offered by graduate level education compared with
the goals of librarianship and advocacy for increased design epistemology can lead to new forms
of education that better serve both prospective librarians and the field at large.
6.2.3 Support the reframing of library practice
One of the major observed reasons of the lack of explicit design epistemology in librarianship
was a lack of support: intellectual, infrastructural, and individual leadership. The first of these,
intellectual support, ideally emerges from the previous recommendations for new approaches to
research and education in librarianship. So too might the third, as more and more designknowledgeable librarians move into managerial and leadership roles in the profession, both
within individual libraries and systems as well as larger supporting organizations like the
Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the American Library Association (ALA),
and the Library of Congress (which serves as the default American national library). In terms of
individual leadership, some libraries are already benefitting from strong guidance that embraces
design, such as Brian Bannon, Commissioner for the Chicago Public library system, who has
mentioned a focus on hiring librarians with design knowledge and mindsets.57 Bannon is
committed to hiring design thinkers at CPL, but in conversation his understanding of design was
limited to public services, and he seemed surprised—yet intrigued—to hear about the
conceptualization of other aspects of librarianship (such as technical services like cataloging) as
design. In addition to abstract recommendations that rely on design trickling down from research
and education into leadership and practice, one way libraries might explicitly acknowledge and
begin to incorporate design would be to re-examine and even revise job descriptions. This would
include both the reconceptualization of library work tasks as design activities, but also adjusting

57

235
the language used in position descriptions and advertisements to include design-related verbiage.
Qualifications, too, might be adjusted to attract people with design backgrounds, similar to
recruitment for education. Bannon himself mentioned that he might prefer to hire a non-librarian
with an understanding of design over a trained librarian without design knowledge.
Additional infrastructural changes need to be manifested through revision of articulated values
and ethics in the professional library community. Evidence from this study shows that additional
values beyond those currently articulated do influence library practice, and acknowledgement
and inclusion of these values will help reshape library work. Additionally, if librarians are to
explicitly harness their position as change agents, as design allows for, existing ethical guidelines
need to be reconsidered in this light. I recommend revisiting and revising both the ALA Core
Values and the Code of Ethics to better reflect additional values evidenced in librarianship, to
include consideration of values regarding both library patrons and librarians, and to reframe the
profession as an explicitly non-neutral one. Overall, in all three areas, a change in discourse
needs to occur to get librarians thinking of themselves as designers and their work in terms of
design.

6.3 Implications
6.3.1 Implications for Librarianship
I have spent the last 200 pages arguing for the conceptualization of librarianship as a design
field. But why? Most librarians perform their work every day with little conscious consideration
of the epistemological underpinnings of their field. Yet even if epistemological perspectives are
not consciously drawn upon by researchers and practitioners, they shape our worldviews and
approaches to knowledge. Understanding librarianship as a design discipline offers the potential

236
to address three major ongoing areas of contention that have pervaded the field since its
inception in America.
First, reconceptualizing librarianship as a design discipline offers the potential to empower
librarians as makers and creators of tools and services. American libraries and librarians ceded
the ability and power to create innovative tools and services to external providers, leaving
libraries on the trailing edge of technology. Given that tool and service creation is such an
integral component of librarianship, libraries and librarians need a way to regain creative power
if they are to remain relevant in the coming years. Librarians need to reclaim their professional
identity as makers—as creators, not consumers, of tools and services—and the accordant
methods, techniques, and conceptual approaches that underlie this kind of work.
Reconceptualizing librarianship as a design discipline offers the potential to empower librarians
as makers and creators of tools and services, rather than conceptualizing vendors and other
information service providers as the sole sources of library-related products. Such empowerment
is especially necessary if the field is to move toward enabling advocacy and positioning
librarians as change agents.
Second, understanding librarianship from a design perspective may help people to better
navigate the notorious professional vs. paraprofessional divide in the field. In the past the
dividing line between professional librarians and paraprofessional library staff was more clear
cut: for example, the American Library Association considers people with formal library
education to be professional librarians while those without serve in paraprofessional support
roles.58 As formal education for librarianship shifted to graduate-level education, the master’s

Studies (n.d.), accessed June 3, 2016,

237
degree became the default dividing line between professionals and paraprofessionals. But with
increasing incorporation of technology in library operations (as well as budget and other resource
reductions), paraprofessional support staff increasingly take on tasks that were once the purview
of professional librarians.59 Relying on an educational degree or a task-based interpretation of
delineating professionals is increasingly problematic and contentious. I propose then that design
might be used to help resolve this issue. Empowered members of the field who create tools and
services and are responsible for decision-making surrounding such creations, who have built up
repertoires of expert knowledge, might be considered the new form of professionals, while those
who carry out the day-to-day operations that enact and enable these designs are envisioned as a
new type of design support staff. This is not to say that one role is inherently better than the
other—both roles are necessary for library practice to succeed. However, it may help alleviate
confusion and contention, or at least add new and interesting consideration to the ongoing
debate. Ultimately, it may not be one’s degree, level of education, or job title that distinguishes
professionals from paraprofessionals, but rather the extent of one’s design repertoire.
Finally, reconsidering librarianship as a design discipline may also assist with another
contentious divide in the field: the ongoing tension between theory and practice. Librarianship
has increasingly struggled with this tension throughout the 20th century, to such an extent that
formerly notable schools of graduate library education such as the ones at University of Chicago
and Columbia University could not find means to serve both camps and, finding themselves with
reduced resources, were forced into closure.60 However, design by its very nature bridges the
perceived gap between theory and practice, because design theory stems directly from practice,

Scarecrow Press, 2005), 22-23.

238
and because knowledge stems from creation. Artifacts and knowledge cannot exist independently
of one another. Therefore, the challenge rests in connecting the outcomes of artifact creation—
“the creation of the particular”—with “the creation of the universal,” that is, overarching,
abstract, theoretical findings.61 It is this connection that lies at the heart of design-based research
and offers a bridge between communities of theoretical research and those of professional
practice. The previously noted disconnect between these levels—the universal and the ultimate
particular—in librarianship reflects a substantive theory/practice divide, as the role of theory is to
apply more universally, while context and particular artifacts are seen as instantiations of
practice. But embracing an understanding of the relationship between the universal and the
ultimate peculiar, as is inherent to design, can help librarianship overcome this divide and
ultimately create better particular tools and services and also come to improved understandings
of universal theory.
6.3.2 Broader Implications
Although elements of design epistemology are evident throughout librarianship, it is clear that
much of this evidence is interpretive, and not intentional on the part of the actors and artifacts
under analysis. Even in the case of XC, which reveals the most explicit examples of design
epistemology and intentional use of design methods and techniques, only parts of the project can
be said to have been intentionally informed by design epistemology. This raises the question:
does a discipline have to purposefully, consciously and intentionally harness design
epistemology to be considered a design discipline?

61

John Zimmerman and Jodi Forlizzi, “The Role of Design Artifacts in Design Theory Construction,” Artifact 2, no.
1 (2008), 41-45.

239
Additionally, the lack of observable intentionality of design epistemology in librarianship also
reveals a larger overall lack of intentional engagement with epistemology in the field. The
discipline of American librarianship reveals a dearth of self-reflection, understanding and
acknowledgement regarding its epistemological underpinnings, especially regarding practice.
That librarianship has gone so long without examination of its paradigms reveals a distressing
lack of self-reflection and a need for increased inclusion of epistemology and history of the field
in library education. Regardless of what epistemological perspectives are taught, be they sciencebased, design-based, or something else entirely, without intentional inclusion of epistemology
and history as part of library education, librarians lack both context for understanding and ability
to move forward.
Throughout this work, I have emphasized the differences between science and design. I have
treated them with a high degree of polarity to help clarify my points. However, science and
design do not exist in separate universes; indeed, they are often closely intertwined in a
symbiotic relationship. Design frequently harnesses scientific findings to help with problem
finding and framing and other decision-making throughout the design process. Scientific
knowledge contributes to a designer’s repertoire of knowledge, and it informs and shapes the
domains in which designers work.
On the other hand, science, like all epistemologies, is a human construct, and as such, it may be
considered an intellectual artifact. Many prominent scholars have argued that science itself is
socially constructed.62 Unlike early scholars of design, who attempted to understand design in
terms of science, I suggest that we might do the opposite—understand science in terms of design.

62

See for example seminal works like Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago, IL:
University of Chicago Press, 1962); and Bruno Latour and Steven Woolgar, Laboratory Life: The Construction
of Scientific Facts, 2d ed., (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press: 1986).

240
What is science, after all, but an intention to move humans from their current, ignorant state to a
preferred state of new knowledge? And indeed, while there are many epistemological choices
that could be harnessed by humans, the accord currently afforded to scientific knowledge reflects
the designerly standpoint of creating the way the world “should be.” To go out on a provocative
limb, I suggest that science and scientific epistemologies are the result of design, rather than vice
versa.

241

Chapter 7 Conclusion
7.1 Objectives of the research
This research sought to explore the role of design epistemology in American librarianship
through the following research questions:
1. In what ways does design epistemology manifest in American librarianship?
2. What is uniquely revealed about librarianship when examining the discipline from a
design standpoint?
3. What are the implications of reconsidering librarianship from a design standpoint, and
how might these implications be explicitly made manifest?
Following a broader discussion of elements of design epistemology and their relationship to the
library profession, this research subsequently examined three cases in depth, each one
representing a significant era of library history:




Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature (est. 1848)
The Washington County (MD) Free Library book-wagon (est. 1909)
The eXtensible Catalog (XC) project (est. 2006)

Critical inquiry and analysis allowed for opportunities to challenge the status quo of
epistemology in American librarianship as well as offer critique of elements of design
epistemology observed in the three cases. The cases were then examined in a broader context to
better understand what role design plays in the profession of American librarianship at large.

7.2 Summary of results
Examination of the three cases shows ample evidence that librarianship does harness design
epistemology and can be viewed as a design discipline. Much of librarianship aligns with

242
fundamental epistemological approaches and tenets of design, including wicked problems,
problem finding and framing, iteration, repertoire, service orientation, and evaluative approaches
to design like critique, rationale, adoption, and reflection-on-action. Other elements of design
epistemology, such as the use of representations, abductive reasoning, and reflection-in-action,
were not observed in the cases; however, the absence of evidence of these elements is not
equivalent to their actual absence in practice. Practical limitations of time distance and
recordkeeping contribute to an inability to concretely establish these elements as inherent to
librarianship, warranting further investigation in these specific areas.
In addition to the presence or absence of these elements, a critical examination of the ways in
which they manifested in these cases demonstrates that design epistemology tends to be implicit
and passive in American librarianship. Many notable elements of design epistemology are
evident in each case; however, they are not explicitly identified as such by participants in each
case, nor are they harnessed or enacted at the same levels as in other fields that explicitly identify
as design fields guided by design epistemology. Additionally, even when design epistemology is
explicitly considered or discussed in these cases, it is often done so in a context that renders it
external to librarianship—as something that other fields and other professions do. Elements of
design epistemology present in librarianship also help to concretely support the idea of
librarianship’s focus on users.
Three major themes are revealed when examining American librarianship from a design-based
standpoint that are often overlooked in other analyses. First is that many forms of library
knowledge not considered valid in a scientific context are in fact valid in design epistemology,
such as the creation of artifacts. Second, viewing librarianship from the perspective of design
allows for the consideration of materiality, which reveals new perspectives on affordances and

243
constraints regarding library artifacts. Previous lack of consideration of materiality also
demonstrates a possible limitation on innovation in library design. Third, an examination of
librarianship from the perspective of design epistemology reveals insights about values in
librarianship. While many core values of librarianship are innately embedded in library artifacts,
evidence of other values, notably cooperation and standardization, is clearly present, sometimes
even more strongly than other traditional values.
Finally, critical reflection on the cases in this study reveals that design may be implicit and
externalized in librarianship due to both lack of support and character of leadership. The
examination of values in the context of design also reveals that the normative agenda of
librarianship never really disappeared with the shift to an ostensibly neutral and objective
scientific epistemology. While this may present conflict and tension in a scientific epistemology,
looking at librarianship from a design perspective legitimizes the field’s evangelism.

7.3 Relevance of results to librarianship
Understanding librarianship as a design discipline offers the potential to address three major
ongoing areas of contention that have pervaded the field since its inception in America.
First, reconceptualizing librarianship as a design discipline offers the potential to empower
librarians as makers and creators of tools and services. American libraries and librarians ceded
the ability and power to create innovative tools and services to external providers, leaving
libraries on the trailing edge of technology.1 Given that tool and service creation is such an
integral component of librarianship, libraries and librarians need a way to regain creative power
if they are to remain relevant in the coming years. Librarians need to reclaim their professional

244
identity as makers—as creators, not consumers, of tools and services—and the accordant
methods, techniques, and epistemological approaches that underlie this kind of work.
Reconceptualizing librarianship as a design discipline offers the potential to empower librarians
as makers and creators of tools and services, rather than conceptualizing vendors and other
information service providers as the sole sources of library-related products.
Second, understanding librarianship from a design perspective may help people to better
navigate the notorious professional vs. paraprofessional divide in the field. Relying on
educational degrees or a task-based interpretations of delineating professionals is increasingly
problematic and contentious. Instead, design allows a reconsideration of what it means to be a
“professional”: empowered members of the field who create tools and services and are
responsible for decision-making surrounding such creations, who have built up extensive
repertoires of expert knowledge.
Finally, reconsidering librarianship as a design discipline may also help alleviate the ongoing
tension between theory and practice, since design by its very nature bridges the perceived gap
between theory and practice by connecting the outcomes of artifact creation with overarching,
abstract, theoretical findings.2 Embracing an understanding of the relationship between the
universal and the ultimate particular, as is inherent to design, can help librarianship overcome
this divide and ultimately create better particular tools and services as well as come to improved
understandings of universal theory.

7.4 Recommendations
Given these findings, the overarching recommendation for the field at large is to take steps to
incorporate design epistemology explicitly (rather than implicitly) into American librarianship.
Several broad recommendations are provided to offer ways to support the explicit manifestation
of design epistemology in librarianship in the future:
1. shift the culture of research to design-based research, and create publication outlets that
legitimize and support this shift
2. revise library education and training to include studio-based education, instruction in
developing repertoire and critique skills, and reconsidering the need for mandatory
education at the graduate level
3. support the reframing of library practice as design practice though education,
infrastructural support, and evolving discourse
Changing the publication and knowledge dissemination culture within the discipline, changing
educational curricula in librarianship, and changing the way professional practice is framed and
described may all assist in making design more explicit in the discipline. The first is
accomplished through new avenues for and models of publication of design products; the second
through not only revamping MLIS and graduate library education programs but even potentially
phasing them out in favor of alternative educational settings; and the third through change in
discourse around job descriptions, work tasks, leadership perspectives, and professional codes.
Additionally, the following recommendations for future work that outline a substantive research
agenda in this area may also offer support for making design explicit in librarianship.

246

7.5 Future work
To continue investigation and strengthen the argument for design epistemology in American
librarianship, more work is needed than can be addressed in the current research. Additional
work is needed, especially in the following areas:


Investigating elements of design epistemology not explored in this study, especially
reflection-in-action, abductive reasoning, and the use of representations



Development of new educational curricula grounded in design epistemology and
appropriate evaluation of said curricula



Building infrastructure to support design evaluation methods in library research and
practice, including new venues for and models of dissemination and communication
regarding library designs



Creation of new library artifacts that explicitly incorporate and reflect the core values of
librarianship

Some of this proposed work is research-based, while other necessary work involves pedagogical
or professional development. All are critical to moving librarianship forward in this area.
7.5.1 Investigation of elements of design epistemology not explored in this study
Further examination of elements of design epistemology not addressed in depth in this work may
reveal additional reasons for not conceptualizing librarianship as a design discipline as well as
additional suggestions and recommendations for supporting this paradigm shift. Although this
study demonstrates a major foray into understanding librarianship as a design discipline, several
elements of design epistemology—specifically the use of reflection in-and on-action, abductive
reasoning, and representations—could not be concretely identified in this work. It is unclear

247
whether these went unnoticed because they were not legitimately present in the course of the
work; they were present but not recorded in the artifacts or documents surrounding the design; or
they were recorded but records were subsequently lost. Given that the answer to this conundrum
is unknown, further research into areas of design epistemology not easily observable or not
observable ex post facto is needed.
Emergent work regarding assessment and evaluation in library storytimes reveals potential
evidence of both reflection-in- and on-action. The Valuable Initiatives in Early Learning that
Work Successfully (VIEWS2) project found that librarians implicitly rely on reflection as a
component of storytime assessment.3 In conjunction with members of the VIEWS2 team, new
research into the nature of reflection in- and on-action in library storytimes and explicit ways to
use reflection as a form of assessment in this area is underway. Other methods for recording
evidence of reflection-in-action, such as observation or think-aloud protocols, might also be used
to better understand reflection-in-action.
Rather than inductive or deductive reasoning, design epistemology relies on abductive reasoning.
Like reflection, this mental process is difficult to record, and nearly impossible to glean from
historical research. Instead, I propose contemporary projects that draw on existing methods for
understanding forms of reasoning, such as the use of established tests to determine individual
reasoning types. Such instruments vetted through previous use in fields like psychology can help
determine which types of reasoning strategies librarians use in the course of their professional
practice. For instance, the Ambiguous Reasoning Task, a protocol created to distinguish between

Library Quarterly (forthcoming).

248
respondents’ propensities for deductive and inductive reasoning,4 might be adapted to include
abductive reasoning and presented to librarians.
Although representations are an established element of design epistemology, they often emerge
from the creation and development of tangible, physical products. Drawings and prototypes act
as quick, informal instantiations of ideas for physical end results. Although the creation of
physical information tools certainly falls under the purview of librarianship, an increasingly large
portion of design in librarianship deals with intangible products, be they digital (like software or
computer interfaces) or intellectual (like services, events, or processes). This makes the
identification and examination of design representations challenging, to say the least. While
sketches and prototypes may exist for digital products, what, if any, design representations
emerge in the creation of intangible services? This is a research question worthy of investigation
not solely in the context of librarianship, but for the field of design at large.
7.5.2 Development of new educational curricula grounded in design epistemology
Education for librarianship requires substantial changes if it is explicitly to incorporate design
epistemology. Future work is needed in both the development of new curricular approaches as
well as evaluation of those approaches to understand their impact on the field.
Revamping library education to correspond more closely with design education requires reenvisioning library coursework in terms of a studio environment. While much hands-on
knowledge may currently be gleaned through internships and practica in the field, these
experiences lack the direct guidance and feedback of the kind offered by instructors in studio
environments. Efforts to evolve spaces for education into more studio-like spaces are already

249
underway.5 I anticipate taking this one step further to bridge the gap between design studio
situations that offer instructor support and feedback as well as in-situ real-world experience
through the development of a teaching library. Akin to a teaching hospital, a teaching library is a
functioning library staffed by future professionals under the supervision and auspices of trained
educators. Students are directly responsible for real patron services akin to an internship, but are
afforded ongoing supervision, feedback and critique. You could also think of this as akin to the
beauty academy model, where, for a reduced price, clients receive haircuts from students under
the watchful eye and interactive feedback of instructors.
Future work in pedagogy for library education also needs concrete means to support repertoirebuilding. Another proposed idea is to investigate the use of sketchbooks or other similar devices
for scaffolding repertoire-building in librarianship. What kinds of activities can help students
understand and foster repertoire both during their studies and throughout their professional
careers? Longitudinal studies tracking the use of repertoire throughout librarians’ careers can also
offer insights into techniques for scaffolding design epistemology in library education.

Additionally, epistemological foundations and the lack of design therein appear to be at least
partially shaped by the educational backgrounds of those that enter the profession. A pilot study
at the University of Washington Information School reveals that the majority of students
admitted to the MLIS program come from humanities and social science backgrounds, with less
than 6% coming from design and design-related fields.6 I am currently continuing research in

this area across ALA-accredited library programs to discover whether this trend is localized or
pervasive. Based on the results, I anticipate developing recruitment programs to attract potential
students from design backgrounds, and monitoring the outcomes and effects that may arise from
more diverse educational cohorts.
7.5.3 Building infrastructure to support design evaluation methods
Design offers legitimate alternative evaluation methods for assessing projects, yet most outcomes
in American librarianship are assessed according to social science criteria. Much of this is
embedded in infrastructure such as funding associations, professional organizations, and
publication venues. I anticipate two major areas of work to build new infrastructural support for
evaluation methods rooted in design epistemology.
First, I propose facilitating structure for expert critique by creating a professional forum where
librarians can bring design artifacts and ideas to share and receive feedback from experts and
peers. This may take the form of conference sessions, workshops, or other avenues, even perhaps
a specific themed meeting devoted to this and other topics related to design epistemology.
Second, new venues for sharing and disseminating information surrounding library designs that
acknowledge the legitimacy of evaluation methods based in design epistemology need to be
created. New journals or other alternative venues are critical. These new venues might be
modeled on ideas like Library Design Share,7 a website where librarians can upload, download,
and share graphic design artifacts like signage and posters. Or they might be embedded in a

7

https://librariandesignshare.org/

251
broader context, such as a section of the Journal of New Librarianship,8 which is actively
seeking to support alternative paradigms.
7.5.4 Explicitly advocating values of librarianship through artifacts
Finally, no future work in this area would be complete without including the actual design of
library artifacts. I intend to demonstrate the explicit use of design epistemology in librarianship
through the purposeful and systematic creation of new library artifacts intended to actively reflect the
core values of librarianship, such as privacy and diversity. Here I draw heavily on the idea of critical
design, a form of research inquiry that uses the creation of provocative artifacts to challenge
established assumptions. Proposed future projects highlight the ways in which artifacts can advocate
for diversity, such as library catalogs that return search results only from female authors, and a
descriptive taxonomy that represents a feminist perspective on video games. Ultimately, I hope to
combine aspects of critical design with storytelling and other arts-based research methods to foster
advocacy and support for the reconceptualized role of libraries in the 21st century as cultural
institutions and spaces for knowledge creation.

7.6 Contributions
This work provides several new contributions to both the fields of librarianship and design. First
and foremost, I have demonstrated that understanding the field of librarianship from the
perspective of design epistemology is a valid and legitimate interpretation. This is a completely
different and distinct way of viewing librarianship, both the work of librarians as well as the
fundamental epistemological constructs that support the discipline.

8

See http://newlibs.org/

252
Second, this work provides a more comprehensive synthesis and understanding of elements of
design epistemology across fields, disciplines, and scholarly perspectives. The elements of
design epistemology presented in this research are drawn from across many authors and sources.
Within the field of design, such scholars offer what may seem to be differing perspectives on
what constitutes design epistemology and which elements are essential to design. Here I present
a holistic, synthesized interpretation of these viewpoints.
Finally, I provide actionable recommendations to support progress in moving forward with
reconceptualizing librarianship as a design discipline. Proposals for future work, new
methodological paradigms for research, design-based approaches to formal education, and
alternative recruitment strategies are all recommendations that can be immediately harnessed to
foster change in the direction of design in librarianship.

7.7 Conclusion
American librarianship in the 21st century is at a crossroads. People increasingly rely on non-librarybased information tools and services to meet their information needs. Yet libraries are set apart from
these other information providers by a commitment to core values like democracy, diversity, privacy,
intellectual freedom, and lifelong learning. Libraries and librarians need a fundamental epistemology
that highlights and advocates this difference. Additionally, libraries and librarians are faced with

choices about how to support and advocate for these values through tools and services in the
midst of ever-changing technologies, ongoing funding reductions, and the fear of a greying
workforce, among many other challenges. The decisions made in librarianship today will have
significant consequences down the line. This dissertation has offered one possible solution to
address these challenges at a broad, fundamental level: to explicitly re-envision the field of
librarianship as a design field.

253
As with all research projects, this dissertation itself is a work of design. By reframing
librarianship in an alternative epistemological viewpoint, it makes the statement that not only
that librarianship can be viewed in this manner, but that it should be, in order to better meet each
and every one of these challenges—known and unknown—as they arise.
American librarianship has always been a service profession and, as the research in this
dissertation shows, a value-laden design field. Reconceptualizing librarianship based on explicit
design epistemology rather than the traditional “library science” is not only more closely related
and reflective of the goals and purposes of librarianship, but the way to empower libraries to
explicitly advocate for the values of the field, remain relevant in rapidly changing environments,
and be successful in the face of future challenges.

Chapter 9 Appendix: XC Interview Protocol
9.1 Opening
Personal introductions/small talk
Explain the purpose of the study:
 The purpose of this research is to better understand the role of design in American
librarianship. Design offers a different way of thinking and different approaches,
methods, techniques, and tools than the traditional social science approaches and methods
typically used in librarianship. By exploring design projects, I aim to better understand
the way design methods, techniques, and ways of knowing are (or are not) used in
librarianship.
Explain the interview structure
 We’ll start off with some basic demographics and information about you and the project
in general.
 The next part of the interview will ask you to jog your memory about the history of the
project and your involvement with it.
 Then we’ll go a little deeper into certain areas, specifically, the role of design in this
project and how you think about design.
 The second and third sections might overlap somewhat, but that’s okay.
Explain the process
 Ask for consent to audiorecord (even if they’ve already said okay by email)
 Transcription: After the interview, the recording will be transcribed. The audio recording
will be deleted and I will work from the transcription. If you like, I can send a copy of the
transcript to you for review and confirmation, at which point you can request changes or
deletions.
Explain the risks
 Because of the unique nature of the eXtensible Catalog project and because the reliability
and validity of this research hinges on provenance and demonstrable connection to source
materials, I will not be able to keep your responses confidential. What you say in this
interview may be summarized or quoted in my dissertation or any publications that result
from it. If I ask any questions that you either cannot or would prefer not to answer, just
tell me so, and we’ll move on.
Ask if they have any questions before starting.

How would you define the word “design”?
Were any formal design strategies used during the development process?
o Were some parts or phases of the project more design-related? I.e., were
processes limited to certain tasks/times, or was design pervasive throughout?
o How much of these design-related parts were you involved with?
The eXtensible Catalog has been called a “participatory design” project. Can you tell me
what that means?
o How did you learn about participatory design?
o What parts/phases of the project drew on participatory design? Which did not?
