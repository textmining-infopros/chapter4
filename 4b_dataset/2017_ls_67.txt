DEDICATION

Everything I’ve accomplished I owe to my God, and His wonderful gift of my family, who
never stopped believing in me, even when I sometimes did. This work is dedicated to:
My husband, David,

We made it, hon.

My children, Erin and Michael, You are my inspiration.
My grandchildren: Noah, Brandyn, and Izabella,
My father, Roy Asher,

I love you all.

Thank you, Dad. I am done.

My mother, Mary Mears, and
My sisters: Alisia Asher, Annette Henry, April Asher-Sadahiro, and Amy McBride.
I am finally ‘out of school’.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to offer my deepest gratitude to everyone who has helped me
throughout this process. I sincerely apologize to any I have overlooked; it is my hope that
you will forgive me if I have neglected to acknowledge your assistance. I truly am
grateful to all who have contributed to my work.
First, I would like to thank all of the subject specialist librarians at the University
of Missouri, Columbia. I would like to specifically thank Dr. Paula Roper for your
suggestions and recommendations. Cindy Cotner and Marie Concannon, I would like to
thank for so much including asking and listening, without the glazing over of your eyes,
to my topic. Sandy Schiefer, the items you forwarded on to me were of great use. Rhonda
Whithaus, my former supervisor and dear friend, you have helped and supported me in
ways too numerous to put here.
The Reference Librarians and student workers at Oral Roberts University Library
have made this work possible. I would like to thank all of the student workers who helped
gather information for my work, especially Danielle Glover, Rebecca Bennett, Scott
Simonton, Angie Reyes Matamoros, Dadiva Maldonado, Sarinporn “Yam” Chaivisit,
Supavida “Yim” Chaivisit, Hwasong Ryu, Ayumu Ano, Samantha “Sam” Bruner,
Cassandra “Cassie” Van Dam, Sara Bennett, Jasmine Forrest, Kaitlyn Gustin, Kayla
Campbell, and Sarah Hanson. Without your assistance and diligence helping me to gather
background documents, making sure my files were OCR, and even scanning in a few
items, this work would still be in progress.

ii

Dr. William Jernigan, Dean of the University Library, Oral Roberts University,
Jane Malcolm, Assistant Director for Public Services, Oral Roberts University Library,
and Annette Villines, Head of Reference Services, Oral Roberts University Library, a
‘thank you’ is not adequate to express my debt of gratitude for all you have done to
support my work, and allowing the student workers to assist me, and for your love,
friendship, support, encouragement, and prayers.
A special ‘thank you’ to Mary Ann Walker and Dana Higeons, Oral Roberts
University Library Technical Services for your prayers, friendship, and support during
this process.
Dr. John Budd, thank you so much for your support and encouragement and all
the times you had to tell me to just stop gathering information. To you, and the rest of my
committee, Dr. Jenny Bossaller, Dr. Denise Adkins, Dr. Lisa Dorner, and former
committee member, Dr. Peggy Placier, thank you for your patience throughout this
process.
While it is customary to acknowledge family and spouses in the Dedication,
without the efforts of my dear husband, David, in scanning numbers of articles and even
entire books, and proofreading my drafts, not to mention all of the lunches, dinners,
taking over the move from Columbia, Missouri to Oklahoma in the middle of this
process, and handling literally everything else, I would still be at work. You have been
my everything throughout this process, and I cannot thank you enough.

ABSTRACT

In early 2015, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL, a
division of the American Library Association (ALA) released the final version of the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework). With the
Framework, the ACRL sought to conciliate and address long-standing contentions of
varying conceptualizations of information literacy (IL) based on the Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (Standards) which had been critiqued since
its adoption in 2000. The purpose of this work is to explore the existence of, in the
context of Library and Information Sciences (LIS) undergraduate education in the United
States, differences in definitions of information literacy (IL) by academic librarians,
scholars, and the ACRL. Differing definitions in LIS by these three groups hold
significant importance, not the least for pedagogy, practice, and the IL skills of
undergraduate students.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

Overview
Information literacy is a popular topic in higher education. Since the adoption of
the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (Standards) in
2000 by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the
American Library Association (ALA), there has been a steady increase in the number of
articles published in Library and Information Science (LIS) journals on information
literacy (IL), with academic librarians writing about IL and information literacy
instruction (ILI), scholars and faculty of Library Science programs discussing their
research on IL and ILI, and national LIS organizations publishing guidelines, standards,
and other literature regarding IL. Currently more attention to IL has arisen due to the
recent work of the ACRL’s Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education Task Force (Task Force) in revamping the Standards with the Task Force’s
release of the final Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(Framework) in early 2015.
With so many people with various interests talking about IL in LIS, it can be
expected that differing conceptualizations of IL exist. Although more detail on
conflicting definitions of IL is provided in the review of the literature in Chapter 2 and is
also examined in the discussion of the research undertaken in this project, a brief
introduction to some of the major divergent definitions is provided here. As early in the
IL movement as 1985, Breivik presented IL as a set of skills combined with a knowledge
1

of tools and resources, a view which the ALA supported (Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009).
Doyle (1994) expanded the ALA’s definition of IL and described a list of attributes of an
information literate individual. Bruce’s (1997) research into how higher educators
conceived IL found seven different conceptions of information literacy. While many see
IL as a set of skills, others such as Wiebe (2016) see IL encompassing a much broader
realm, and have even described IL as a liberal art. Still others have advocated redefining
the basis of libraries’ instruction efforts from the “skill and competency-oriented
foundations” (Budd, 2009, p. 34) of IL and proposed alternative approaches to
instruction, such as Budd’s phenomenological cognitive action. Others have explored the
theoretical underpinnings of IL, such as the findings of O’Connor (2009a) who found
both liberal-pluralist and economic-functionalist assumptions within the LIS discourse on
information literacy. Although some even debate whether differing definitions of IL do
exist, as Owusu-Ansah concluded, “these debates often create impressions of potential
conflict when there are truly none” (2005, p. 367), it seems clear that differences in
definitions exist as demonstrated by the uproar on the ILI-L Listserv over the decision of
the ACRL to rescind the Standards in late June 2016. Much of the discussion over the
decision to rescind the Standards centers on questions of how to adapt the Framework to
Standards-based instruction programs and assessment efforts already in place. The
opponents’ concerns appear to echo previous differences in definitions of “IL as a set of
skills, a way of thinking or a social phenomenon” (Foasberg, 2015, p. 699).
If such differences in definitions of IL exist, what factors could explain the
differences? One pre-assumption in embarking upon this research project is that the

2

differences may reflect the roles of the participants. As Budd (2009) suggested,
differences in conceptions of learning and thinking can exist between faculty and
librarians. While research on IL in LIS within the context of higher education (and indeed
in relation to virtually every context) is voluminous, to date there has been little or no
research published comparing how LIS academe and librarians define IL in the discourse
on IL. Are academic librarians, LIS researchers, and national LIS organizations talking
about the same thing when using the term IL? Is there consensus or disagreement in the
definition of IL among these various participants in the LIS IL discourse? Furthermore,
do the definitions of either or both groups reflect the published discourse of national LIS
organizations, namely the ALA and the higher education division, the ACRL? The focus
of this analysis is to explore in-depth how the concept of IL is discussed in the United
States by academic librarians, LIS academe, and at the national level through statements
published by the ACRL and ALA. Although IL in K-12 is a topic of great interest in the
United States, this analysis is limited to U.S. higher education IL. The release of the
Framework was preceded by the beginning of work by the Task Force in March 2013,
with three drafts published before the final version was filed by the ACRL in February
2015. Many respondents to released drafts of the Framework appeared to see the
Framework as “a step in the right direction,” but voiced concerns including how to
convince stakeholders to replace the Standards and potential harm to the acceptance of
existing IL programs based on the Standards (Wilkinson, 2014, para. 3). With the latest
decision of the ACRL to rescind the Standards, addressing the lack of studies on this

3

topic becomes even more significant as LIS professionals seek to apply the new
Framework’s Threshold Concepts to their praxis.
Bridging this gap will provide valuable insight for the profession in a number of
ways: a foundation for future research, assistance for IL curricula development aligning
instruction to the Framework’s Threshold Concepts, and also a basis for future
comparisons of the discourse of these participants on topics other than IL, as well as any
number of aspects related to pedagogy and praxis within the field of LIS.
Information Literacy Instruction in Library and Information Science in Higher
Education
Libraries of every sort, and especially academic libraries, have a long history of
providing instruction to users. Salony noted:
Bibliographic instruction dates back to the 1800s in the United States … The
United States was not unique or first in providing library instruction. For example,
there is evidence that library instruction was given at German universities in the
17th century in the form of lectures about reference books, study techniques, and
how to use the library. (1995, pp. 32-33)
In the United States, Helen E. Haines is known as one of the earliest influential library
instructors (Crawford, 1997).
This instruction has been performed under many names, including library
orientation, library skills instruction, bibliographic instruction (BI), research skills
instruction, information use instruction, and in various formats, such as tutorials, one-shot
sessions, and semester-long courses, face-to-face and online, synchronous and

4

asynchronous, to name a few. With the advent of the Internet and digital technologies, a
new term, information literacy (IL), began to appear in the LIS discourse beginning in the
late 1970s with the origination of the term by Paul Zurkowski, followed by the definition
by the ALA in its 1989 Final Report. Soon, academic libraries incorporated IL into their
pedagogic offerings as another form of instruction.
The teaching of IL skills at the undergraduate level can take a variety of formats.
Most often ILI is done through one-shot sessions taught by librarians rather than by
faculty. As Oakleaf noted, “virtually all academic library reference and instruction
departments provide some level of education for students in the form of face-to-face
teaching, tutorials, subject guides, tip sheets, tool kits, reference interactions, online
course support, and so forth” (2011, p. 63). Although librarian-taught one-shot sessions
are the most common method of ILI, the number of for-credit IL classes offered has
increased. The amount of credit offered in for-credit IL classes ranges from one to three
credit hours. Some credit classes are offered as stand-alone courses, while others are
designed and offered, at times as a requirement, to be taken with other freshman level
courses, such as freshman English or History classes. The level of education and
expertise of the instructors of these IL courses may vary as well. For-credit IL courses are
taught by librarians or Master’s level graduate students; or more rarely, by LIS faculty
holding Master’s or doctorate degrees. Although no estimates of the number of for-credit
IL courses offered in U.S. universities and colleges were found in the review of the
literature for this project, the Primary Research Group 2014 survey of 110 institutions in
the U.S. and Canada found that of the slightly over 43% of respondents who reported

5

their institutions required formal IL training to graduate, only 13.64% offered a one- or
two-credit IL course (Primary Research Group, 2014, pp. 137, 139).
Background and Issues Related to Information Literacy
Definitions and significance to higher education. In the 1989 Presidential
Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report (Final Report), the ALA defined IL as
the ability to “to recognize when information is needed and … the ability to locate,
evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (American Library Association,
1989). Eleven years later, in 2000, the ACRL, a division of ALA, created and approved
the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (Standards). In the
Standards, the ACRL emphasized the significance of IL to higher education with the
assertion that “information literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning. It is common to
all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of education. It enables
learners to master content and extend their investigations, become more self-directed, and
assume greater control over their own learning” (American Library Association, 2006, p.
2). Also, within the Standards, the organization asserted that:
Developing lifelong learners is central to the mission of higher education
institutions. By ensuring that individuals have the intellectual abilities of
reasoning and critical thinking, and by helping them construct a framework for
learning how to learn, colleges and universities provide the foundation for
continued growth throughout their careers, as well as in their roles as informed
citizens and members of communities. (American Library Association, 2006, p. 4)

6

Although the question remains whether this is achievable, for the ACRL, IL skills are not
merely important for successful academic achievement, but are transferrable and
important to all aspects of life.
The Standards are seen by the ACRL as highly significant to the acceptance of IL
throughout higher education. In the second Draft Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (Draft Framework), the Task Force stated, “The Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education, adopted by the Association of College and
Research Libraries (ACRL) in 2000, have [sic] become an essential document related to
the emergence of information literacy as a recognized learning outcome at many
institutions of higher education.” (ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards
Review Task Force, 2014, June 17, para. 1). The Standards were approved by the Board
of Directors of the ACRL on January 18, 2000 and endorsed by both the American
Association for Higher Education in October 1999 and the Council of Independent
Colleges in February 2004 (American Library Association, 2006).
For LIS, the Standards “cited thousands of times … are the de facto definition of
information literacy (Bell, 2013, para. 1). Drabinski concurred and further described the
influence of the Standards on IL within American higher education and on the work of
academic librarians:
This set of performance indicators and measurable outcomes, first adopted in
2000 …, structures the way information literacy programs are organized,
delivered, and assessed in American colleges and universities. The Standards have
productively enabled librarians to define for themselves a teaching location within

7

the academy: librarians define and take pedagogical responsibility for information
literacy learning outcomes and their assessment. (2014, p. 480)
Indeed, as Drabinski pointed out, since the adoption of the Standards, LIS higher
education and academic libraries have increasingly assumed the responsibility of
developing students’ IL skills with many seeing IL as a natural extension of the library
use or BI skills that have long been taught by academic librarians. As early in the IL
movement as 1984, Oberman, an academic librarian, noted the relevance and significance
of skills taught by librarians to learning: “The concepts which are needed for effective
information gathering replicate the cognitive concepts essential to learning: knowledge,
analysis, and synthesis. Library instruction can provide students with the conceptual
framework for applying these concepts to research” (Fisher, Morton, Oberman, &
Schwartz, 1984, p. 61).
Legitimate endeavor or legitimation. Proponents of ILI have maintained that
“Librarians have a particular responsibility to produce students who understand the
importance of information and have the competence to locate, evaluate, and manage it”
(National LOEX Library Instruction Conference, Mensching, & Mensching, 1989, p. 9).
Whether ILI is a legitimate endeavor of librarians or a legitimation of the profession was
a question O’Connor explored through her discourse analysis of the emergence of the
concept in LIS, in which she found evidence of legitimation, while she also noted that her
investigation did “not suggest that the historical context of its emergence nullifies its
value or relevance” (O’Connor, 2009b, p. 506; see also O’Connor, 2009a, 2009c).
Researchers such as Bruce have explored the perceptions of higher education regarding

8

IL. Bruce’s research of higher educators at an Australian university found seven
conceptualizations or faces of IL (1997). Many scholars have noted other aspects of the
unique historical contexts contributing to the emergence of the concept in LIS, including
the rise of information technologies, the move from an industrial society to that of
information as a commodity, calls for education reforms, and the fiscal constraints
resulting from economic downturns as factors in the rise of IL in LIS (American Library
Association, 1989; Behrens, 1994; Foster, 1993; O’Connor, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c;
Ridgeway, 1990).
Even relatively early in the IL movement in LIS, proponents asserted that “people
who do not educate themselves – and keep educating themselves – to participate in the
new knowledge environment will be the peasants of the information society” (Cleveland,
1985, p. 21). Those involved in the IL movement in LIS have maintained that academic
libraries are in a unique position to assist the development of IL skills of their students
(American Library Association, 1989; MacDonald, Rathemacher, & Burkhardt, 2000;
Palmer & Ford, 2000; Cowan, 2014).
Origination of concept in Library and Information Science. The origin of the
term information literacy has been attributed to Paul Zurkowski in 1974 (Behrens, 1994;
Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009). Zurkowski defined IL as the competency of an individual
to use information sources in problem-solving in the setting of a work environment
(Zurkowski, 1975). Owusu-Ansah described the adoption of the term in LIS as the result
of “an ensuing preoccupation [with] and commitment” to the phrase which “culminated
in the American Library Association’s seminal definition of the concept” in 1989 (2005,

9

p. 367). According to the ALA in comparison to Zurkowski’s definition, the definition of
an information literate person is one who has the ability to:


Determine the extent of information needed



Access the needed information effectively and efficiently



Evaluate information and its sources critically



Incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base



Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose



Understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of
information, and access and use information ethically and legally. (American
Library Association, 2006, pp. 2-3)

Since the ALA’s definition of IL in 1989, the concept in LIS has become, for many in
academia, synonymous with any activity related to instruction (Snavely & Cooper,
1997b), including reference transactions both in person and via chat and email (Avery &
Ward, 2010).
Ambiguities in the term. This conflation of IL with other library instructional
activity is one reason that many scholars in LIS have blamed for the confusions and
ambiguities in the term (Ariew, 2014; Budd, 2009; Snavely & Cooper, 1997b). Others
have argued that confusions over the meaning of IL are due to the ambiguity integral
within the phrase itself (Foster, 1993; Isaacson, 2003; Purdue, 2003; Snavely & Cooper,
1997b; Stahura, 2014; Verdesca, 2008) or have asserted that the perplexities and
obscurities with IL that have been often voiced in the literature of the discipline are the
result of the numerous published definitions (Snavely & Cooper, 1997b). Others have

10

argued that no discrepancies in meaning are inherent in the discussions of IL, but
contentions over the meaning of IL point to deeper issues within the profession:
There exists a sufficient enough mass of understanding on what constitutes
information literacy. The controversies and uncertainties surrounding the
conceptual delineation of information literacy therefore suggest a deeper
professional dilemma, one that concise definitions and elaborate standards have
failed to resolve. That dilemma involves not definitional uncertainties but rather
difficulties of execution, arising within the dynamics of the educational
environment, the deliberations of its power brokers, and the influence and results
the relative image and power of the participating interests allows disagreement.
(Owusu-Ansah, 2003, p. 226)
Thus, with the disputes over what IL means, or over the question of whether there are
differing definitions, it is no surprise that other challenges related to teaching and
assessing IL have arisen.
Difficulties of assessment and teaching. A working definition of IL might
include “both the directly observable behavior and those less directly observable,” as
Grassian and Kaplowitz noted, but as they also pointed out, some aspects of IL are
difficult to measure; one difficulty of which would be due to the “less directly
observable” nature of the attributes associated with IL (2001, p. 8). Later, Grassian and
Kaplowitz revised this stance by stating that it is up to individual librarians “to reach out
to others in your communities in order to formulate a definition of IL that is personally
meaningful and that works in your specific environment” (2009, p. 8).

11

However, others have suggested the difficulties academic librarians face in
teaching and assessing IL are due to the lack of formal training in pedagogical practices
in LIS graduate programs (Montgomery, 2015; Moreton & Conklin, 2015; Mullins,
2014). Indeed, there is a wide variety in the level of experience and education of
instructors of IL courses. Furthermore, few if any LIS graduate programs require
coursework in ILI or general instruction pedagogies for program completion or rarely
offer such courses as electives, leaving most ILI instructors with no background or
training in best instructional practices (Montgomery, 2015; Nutefall, 2012). However, a
recent review of 51 ALA accredited LIS programs found 47 offered such courses. While
some have pointed out the negative aspects of the lack of pedagogical training for
Master’s degree holding ILI instructors, others have countered that few professors
holding doctorate degrees have formal pedagogical education (Austin, 2002; Gardiner, et
al., 1994). For example, Austin reported findings from a study of graduate students in a
variety of disciplines who reported the lack of preparation for teaching; noting such
issues as the lack of required teaching experience in many PhD programs, the lack of
progressive development of instructional activities (e.g., “moving from grading for a
faculty member, to managing a lab section under guidance, to running a course alone”)
(2002, p. 105), and even the “mixed messages about teaching – the most obvious being
public statements by institutional leaders about the importance of teaching contradicted
by institutional policies and faculty behaviors emphasizing research” (p. 108). Yet, while
this may be the case for many graduate and post-graduate students in other disciplines,
and while perhaps in LIS programs required coursework in pedagogical preparation may

12

be limited, as noted above a recent review of ALA accredited LIS programs found that 47
of 51 offered pedagogical IL courses.
Although the training and preparation of ILI instructors is not the topic under
consideration in this work, this inconsistency can help to illustrate the variety in
perspectives that currently exist in the participants of LIS IL discourse in the United
States. Another difficulty in measuring aspects of IL, however, would inevitably arise as
an outcome of the ambiguity in the definition of the term.
Other similarily defined terms. Indeed, not only does assessment of some
aspects of IL present challenges, along with possible differences in how it is defined, but
other issues appear to further complicate the matter. For instance, there are other terms in
use that appear to describe the similar cognitive processes. Additionally, there is a further
difficulty with distinguishing between what is meant by IL that could not be described as
learning, or skills, or knowledge acquisition. As previously mentioned, “The concepts
which are needed for effective information gathering replicate the cognitive concepts
essential to learning: knowledge, analysis, and synthesis” (Fisher, Morton, Oberman, &
Schwartz, 1984, p. 61). In addition to replicating the “cognitive concepts essential to
learning,” other terms are also similarly defined. For instance, in her 2011 book,
Envisioning Knowledge: Building Literacy in the Academic Disciplines, Langer described
a cognitive process she called academic literacy as “the kind we learn at school” (p. 2).
How do we learn to build academic literacy? …. Through informational
experiences – be they oral, written, electronic, or kinesthetic, … – people learn to
focus on a topic, to narrow in on what is relevant as they search for and consider

13

ideas and evidence pertaining to that topic. They make judgments about what is
critical to weave together a conceptual construct that they can fine-tune, build
upon, or even disagree with at a later time. Through this process of focusing,
narrowing, searching, considering, questioning, judging, tuning, and rejecting,
they learn not merely to receive knowledge, but to own it. They make sense. And
if they probe deeply enough and connect wisely enough, they create knowledge.
That knowledge is theirs, available to them for whatever purposes they wish in
whatever experiences they encounter. If they are students, they become the
literate thinkers we need to shape the knowledge and world of tomorrow – young
people who think clearly and learn well. They can seek answers, ask probing
questions about things as they are, and construct new ideas and paradigms.
(Langer, 2011, p. 2)
As this excerpt shows, many of the themes and behaviors that Langer attributed to
academic literacy appear to be synonymous with the definitions of IL by the ALA and
Grassian and Kaplowitz discussed above. Indeed, as Langer said, “Each field involves
multiple acts of knowledge building as we seek data and use them to go beyond the
information given in ways that are appropriate to the field. In this sense, knowledge is
much deeper than simply getting information. Information counts, of course, but what
you do with it and to what end creates knowledge” (p. 2).
Contrasting this definition of academic literacy by Langer with the characteristics
of an information literate person as defined by the ALA raises the question of just what is
the difference between learning, academic literacy, knowledge, or the ability to “use

14

information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose” (American Library Association,
2006, p. 3). Indeed, the ACRL stated, “information literacy forms the basis for lifelong
learning” (American Library Association, 2006, p. 2). A few opponents of IL have raised
similar contentions that IL, as Langer’s description of academic literacy, is an iterative
process and one that can vary depending on “disciplinary traditions and conventions”
(2011, p. 2). One disciplinary context-specific example is the difference in what
constitutes a primary source, which varies widely depending on whether the context is
history, biology, or psychology (Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011, p. 864). Similar
concerns with the widespread acceptance of IL in the discourse of LIS have been raised
virtually since the inception of the concept.
In addition, the majority of studies base definitions of IL and academic success on
the meanings assigned by the researchers and/or instructors of IL courses. Within many
of these studies, evaluations of the claims that the IL skills taught in support of academic
success are limited to the outcomes of students’ assignments. Often, the bases of these
claims are limited to a single assignment or a single course; claims based on the results of
longitudinal research are rare. It is hard to understand how claims that IL curriculum
supports academic success, much less critical thinking or lifelong learning, can be
substantiated from such limited evidence.
This leads us to the conclusion that there are currently significant issues regarding
instruction in IL skills. Because the discipline is relatively small and close-knit, it may be
that there is consensus in the field regarding what is taught in IL courses despite
discrepancies in defining the term. However, at the heart of all scholarly inquiry is the

15

need to establish, empirically if possible, all assertions. Thus, it is important to establish
what common aspects of IL skills such classes purport to teach. Prior to this is the need to
distill what is meant by the term itself by looking at the uses of IL by three of the
dominant participant groups in the LIS discourse.
Critiques and opponents. Notwithstanding the widespread acceptance of both
LIS academe and academic librarians of the importance of IL skills to lifelong learning
and academic performance and the discipline’s assumption of responsibility for ILI, there
have been some critics of IL within the profession. One of the more famous criticisms
was the 2005 Chronicle of Higher Education piece by Stanley Wilder, entitled
“Information Literacy Makes All the Wrong Assumptions,” which generated much
discussion among LIS professionals. Although many respondents agreed with some of his
criticisms, the overall consensus seemed to be most were under institutional mandates to
teach IL. Wilder’s main criticism of the IL movement within LIS was that IL is a
response to an imaginary problem; that students are overwhelmed with information when
in fact, they are quite content with the information they can find online. One UK librarian
disagreed with the premise of Wilder’s article that students are not overwhelmed.
However, this librarian expressed much dissatisfaction with the IL movement, including
disapproval for the claims in the UK and Europe which tout IL as a panacea for many
social ills, and charged that such claims
conflate information literacy with lifelong learning and appropriate the rhetoric
leading to the sort of statements … endemic throughout the literature. This is not

16

the only problem with the discourse of IL. It is an article of faith amongst its
advocates that information-seeking is a generic skill. (Williams, 2006, para. 5)
Although Williams was referring to the conditions in LIS within the UK and Europe,
many critics from the United States have voiced similar concerns.
Aside from Wilder’s objection that IL is based on misguided efforts to solve a
non-existent problem, most of the criticisms and objections that have been raised center
around two major themes: objections to the term and what IL should include. Most
criticisms in LIS leveled towards the IL movement raised various objections with the
term. In their overview of the then to-date disagreements over the term, Snavely and
Cooper proposed that due to the lack of “a perfectly descriptive, unambiguous” (1997b,
p. 12) alternative, LIS should accept the use of IL, “using it carefully and with clarity” (p.
13). Budd (2009) offered phenomenological cognitive action as an alternative approach
for libraries’ instruction efforts, citing his objections to skills-based IL as deficient in
many regards including lacking relevancy and meaning for students.
A much smaller group of critics questioned whether IL should reside within the
purview of professional LIS responsibilities. Snavely and Cooper suggested, in one of the
earlier discussions over where the responsibility for teaching IL should lie, that “an
information literacy program should be integrated into existing courses in an across-thecurriculum fashion” (1997a, p. 53). Cowan voiced the opinion that IL is no longer a valid
programmatic aim of academic libraries and ILI librarians, but should be redirected to
“how do we hand the keys over, as it were, to the faculty and administration?” (2014, p.
29). Others have published their contention that ILI is not instruction, but rather is

17

marketing (Ardis, 2005; Stover, 2007). An earlier article posed the view that librarians
should not teach IL skills, but focus on their traditional work of collection development
and management (Isaacson, 2003). A very recent article noted that IL “has gained
ascendency in the reference world to the detriment of the practice of reference
librarianship itself” (Verdesca, 2015a, p. 67; see also Verdesca, 2015b). In perhaps the
most succint summation of the problems with teaching IL, Walker and Pearce stated
“Indeed, the notion that information literacy can be taught in one session is preposterous
for most librarians” (2014, p. 281).
Metaliteracy and threshold concepts. In more recent years, some in LIS have
proposed an expansion of the concept of IL to metaliteracy. In this section, only a brief
introduction on metaliteracy and threshold concepts is covered, with a more in-depth
review provided in the following chapter’s literature review. These scholars view
metaliteracy as a broader framing, building from the concept of IL with inclusion of
multiple literacies that the expansion of online technologies have brought. Thus, these
scholars see metaliteracy as a broad framework encompassing IL, digital literacy, media
literacy, visual literacy, and information technology fluency. Proponents of metaliteracy,
including the ACRL, view metaliteracy as conceptualized by key components, or
threshold concepts, rather than the former Standards as the crucial attributes and
activities that meta-literate individuals would possess and exhibit. (Jacobson & Mackey,
2013; Jacobson & O’Keeffe, 2014; Mackey & Jacobson, 2011).
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. This section
introduces the Framework; a more detailed discussion is provided in the literature review.

18

One of the stated reasons for the Framework was that the ACRL sought to address
concerns and critics of the Standards, which the Task Force noted in the first Draft
Framework, as “limitations of this skill- and individual-attribute-based conception”
(ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards Review Task Force, 2014, February
2, p. 4). The Task Force built the new Framework incorporating threshold concepts by
drawing “significantly upon the concept of metaliteracy” (American Library Association,
2015, p. 2). However, if the ACRL sought to engender consensus within the profession
with the Framework, their efforts were unsuccessful as with each release of the drafts and
the publication of the final version, LIS professionals voiced their dissent to the new reframing of IL. In one of the more notable critiques, a group of New Jersey LIS
professionals in an “Open Letter Regarding the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education” (Open Letter) voiced their concerns that the Standards should not be
supplanted by the Framework, but should be revised, viewing the Framework as a
document that establishes a theoretical basis for information literacy … [which
although] filled with jargon … can provide a catalyst for instruction programs to
have a more cohesive approach to curriculum mapping or scaffolding yet, because
of the jargon and the removal of the standards, it actually sets librarians back to
square one where we will need to re-educate our faculty with new terminologies
and thus lose the momentum that was gained with the standards. (Berg et al.,
2015, para. 2)

19

The criticisms charged by the authors of the Open Letter illustrate the dissensions within
LIS regarding definitions of IL. It is these differences in definitions that this study
explores.
Research Questions
Research assumptions and interest in information literacy. The basic
assumption in beginning this study is that there are discrepancies in how LIS
professionals (namely, academic librarian IL instructors of undergraduate IL), LIS
scholars and academe (researchers and professors), and national organizational
statements (by the ALA and ACRL) define IL. Initially, this researcher was intrigued by
O’Connor’s 2009 contention that the emergence of the term was the result of attempts on
the part of the LIS to legitimize the profession (O’Connor, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c) and her
explanations as to why that might have occurred. In this researcher’s observations of
academic librarians and LIS academe and in readings of ACRL and ALA IL policy
statements, it appeared there are discrepancies in definitions or in the ways of describing
IL that could well be related to the roles of the participants in the discourse. In addition,
this study is aimed at exploring how the discourse on IL contributes to reinforcing the
hierarchy of roles of these three participant-groups.
Therefore, in order to address the need for understanding IL, this study
investigates the discourse within LIS regarding IL in higher education. Specifically, this
work focuses on exploring texts in the hopes of answering three specific questions:
1) What are the content and contexts of the definition(s) of IL in LIS in higher
education? In terms of content, the intent of this project is to discover whether definitions

20

of IL differ in what is included in those definitions, including the type of skills or whether
the definitions significantly differ on philosophical bases. For instance, is there evidence
for the view that IL is conceptualized in a variety of philosophical approaches to IL as
noted in Addison’s and Meyers’s framework of IL definitions as skills-based, attitudinal,
or social constructions? (2013; see also Foasberg, 2015)
2) In which definitional category from Addison’s and Meyers framework of IL
definitions do authors’ definitions and discussions of IL fit, compared with whether
authors’ definitions and discussions of IL aligned with the Standards or the Framework?
It is hoped that the alignment of authors’ definitions and discussions with the ACRL’s IL
policy documents in comparison to IL definitional category will shed light on the
reproduction of ACRL’s IL policies in the context of the authors’ professional work.
3) What factors lie behind any discrepancies in definitions of IL in LIS? By
examining discrepancies, this project looks at the differences in skills and philosophical
distinctions, and if found, seeks to determine if these variances are in any way related to
the contexts in which the concept of IL is discussed. Thus, one aim of this project to learn
if either or both IL skills taught and philosophical contexts can be linked to the roles the
discourse participants fill in their professional work.
In other words, is there evidence of discrepancies and/or ambiguities in the
definitions of IL and what is taught as IL skills, and if so, are these differences related to
the roles of the participants? Does the discourse further stratify the roles of the participant
groups and what effect does this have for students? The hope is that the findings of this
study will provide some assistance for LIS in higher education to clarify its position on

21

IL in order to frame ongoing discussions on IL, particularly in view of the recent release
of the new Framework.
Delineation of the scope of project. This project is an examination of the LIS
discourse on IL, and is confined to that discourse within the scope of higher education at
private and public four-year degree-granting institutions within the United States. This
study does not include published work regarding elementary or secondary school
libraries, community colleges, special libraries, or academic contexts outside of the
United States. The published literature on these contexts is quite voluminous, particularly
within the United Kingdom, especially in Australia, and increasingly recently within
Asian and Middle Eastern countries. This study is also confined to undergraduate ILI and
does not include the numerous studies of ILI to graduate and post-graduate students. In
addition, this study includes only a small number of articles discussing IL in disciplinary
contexts, with the bulk of these confined to general education or first-year seminar
courses.
Another restriction on the scope of this project is that articles from two years only
are examined. Using Fairclough’s selection strategy, moments of crises, defined as
“moments in the discourse where there is evidence that things are going wrong” (1992, p.
192), the articles examined were published in 2011 and 2015. In July 2011, the ACRL
Information Literacy Competency Standards Review Task Force began work on revision
of the Standards, and in January 2015, the new Framework was filed by the ACRL.
Because the Standards has been the basis of IL definitions and ILI efforts for much of
U.S. higher education (Bell, 2013, para. 1), these two years can be seen as moments of

22

crisis within LIS. More detailed explanation regarding the application of Fairclough’s
principles of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is provided in Chapters 3 and 4.
Research Methods
A brief introduction on the methods used in the analysis of this project is provided
here. Articles from 2011 and 2015 will be analyzed using Fairclough’s (1992) CDA
methodologies. Fairclough’s (1992) CDA provides analysis of texts in three dimensions,
analysis of the social practice, analysis of the discourse practice, and analysis of texts.
After categorizing articles by the role of the author or authors, texts will be examined in
these three areas. Textual analysis will be directed to discovery of the authors’ IL
definitions and the contexts of IL discussions. Further details regarding research methods
are covered in Chapter 4, with discussion of CDA and CT in Chapter 3.
Definitions
At this point, it is helpful to define terms as used in CDA prior to further
discussion. This section also includes explanations as to the relation of these terms to
aspects of this project. Although alternate definitions have been provided by other
discourse analysts, only those used in this project are included here.
Discourse has been defined as “an institutionalized way of talking that regulates
and reinforces action and thereby exerts power” (Link, 1983, p. 60, as cited by Jäger &
Maier in Wodak & Meyer, 2010, p. 35). Discourses can take any form of semiosis,
including language, body language, or visual images (Fairclough, 2003, p. 207).
Fairclough also noted three ways discourses are enacted in social practices: 1) “as a part
of a social activity within a practice,” 2) as “representations of other practices,” and 3)

23

“in the constitution of identities” (p. 206). Within this project, each of these enactments
of discourse is examined. As Jäger & Maier point out, discourses do not merely function
as social practices, but also exercise power as they “institutionalize and regulate ways of
talking, thinking, and acting” (in Wodak & Meyer, 2010, p. 35).
Ideologies are defined by Fairclough as societal ideals which a society uses as
“ways of representing aspects of the world … that contribute to establishing or sustaining
unequal relations of power” (2013, p. 7). CDA is focused on the ways ideologies are
employed in the “service of power … [or] on the grounds that they represent or explain
aspects of the world inadequately” (p. 8). There are many ideologies which may be
present in any social environment. Several critical theorists, including Paulo Freire, have
noted the tendency of education to reproduce society’s dominant ideologies. Freire stated,
“the main task of systematic education is the reproduction of the ideology of the
dominant class” (Escobar Guerrero & Freire, 1994, p. 31). According to Fairclough
(2013), in Western societies such as the United States, a theory which describes power,
class, and state is needed. Fairclough followed Gramsci’s theory in which capitalist
societies base power on domination and hegemony (p. 128). Domination refers to the
power of “control over the forces of repression and the capacity to use coercion,” and
hegemony refers to “intellectual or moral leadership” (p. 128). Budd defined ideology as
“being grounded in efforts at domination – the ascendance of some ideas over others”
(2001, p. 498), which “raises the question of whose interests are being expressed, and to
what end” (p. 499). Budd also noted the importance “that any investigation of discursive

24

practice be based in the language and the motivations that are identified as ideological”
(p. 504).
Fairclough defined a method of text selection based on the use of “‘cruces’ or
‘moments of crises,’” which he defined as “moments in the discourse where there is
evidence that things are going wrong” (1992, p. 192). In the LIS IL movement in U.S.
higher education, two years can be viewed as moments of crisis, 2011 and 2015. In July
2011, the Task Force convened to work on revision of the Standards, and in January
2015, the new Framework was filed by the ACRL. Because the Standards has been the
basis of IL definitions and ILI efforts for much of U.S. higher education (Bell, 2013,
para. 1), these two years can be seen as moments of crisis within LIS.
Conclusion
The IL movement within educational spheres in the United States can trace its
origination from LIS, particularly in undergraduate education. The birth and development
of IL has not been without challenges, difficulties, or opponents, but IL also has strong
advocates. This project examines the discourse within LIS of ILI academic librarians, LIS
academe, and compares the discourse of these two participant groups to the Standards in
order to determine variances in definitions between these three groups. This project
attempts to add some clarity to the definition of IL within LIS, which should be of
interest to the discipline, particularly with the recent release and formal adoption of the
Framework.
The content of the following chapters roughly follows the general sections of
published journal articles. A literature review is provided in Chapter 2. Theoretical

25

frameworks and the methodology that guide this study are covered in Chapter 3. Chapter
4 discusses data collection and analysis. Chapter 5 covers a discussion of the findings, an
overview of current LIS discussions on the Framework, and concludes with
recommendations based on the findings of this project.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

Introduction
This chapter provides a selective review of the LIS published literature on
information literacy in United States undergraduate education. Following a brief look at
the background of IL in LIS, the review follows a chronological development of three
major IL definitions based on Addison’s and Meyers’ (2013) framework of IL
definitions. Next the use of critical theory in the LIS literature is covered, with an
overview of the use of critical discourse analysis in LIS in Chapter 3. The chapter
concludes with a discussion of the limitations to use of Addison’s and Meyers’ (2013)
framework of IL definitions.
During the selection process for this review (and texts for analysis), this
researcher found an article by Addison and Meyers that presented a categorization of IL
definitions which they stated was “concerned with the interpretations of information
literacy that stem from the library and information science field…. We are using this
organizing schema not to set up binaries or oppositional arrangements but to illustrate
how values, goals and institutional priorities play a part in defining (and reifying) who is
“information literate” (2013, para. 2, 3). This paralleled what this researcher was already
seeing in the categorization of articles into varying definitions so their categories were
used as the means of grouping articles.
A combined search of LIS and education databases was limited to undergraduate
IL education in the United States between 2000 to 2015. This initial pool of over 2,300
27

articles was further narrowed to first-year seminar and freshman general education IL
instruction. Of the remaining 322 texts, representative articles were selected to review the
literature using Addison’s and Meyers’ categories.
Background of Information Literacy in Library and Information Science
In early 2015, the release of the final version of the Framework prompted a flurry
of activity on LIS discussion forums and weblogs. The release of the final version of the
Framework was the culmination of the efforts of the ACRL Task Force’s reassessment of
the ACRL’s Standards. The Task Force was established in July 2011. In 2013, the Task
Force was comprised of 17 members; 12 academic librarians, one LIS professor, one
member of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, and three others in
various information professional roles (ACRL Information Literacy Competency
Standards Review Task Force, 2013). The Task Force sought with the Framework to
address increasingly raised concerns within LIS regarding ambiguities and varied
definitions of IL, as well as dissensions with the Standards (ACRL Information Literacy
Competency Standards Review Task Force, 2012; American Library Association, 2012).
However, throughout 2014, with the release of each draft version of the Framework, new
criticisms were posted online. At least one member resigned from the Task Force because
of misgivings over the Framework (Wilkinson, 2014), and in January 2015, a group of
librarians from New Jersey voiced their disagreements regarding the new Framework in
their Open Letter (Berg et al., 2015). Most recently, in apparent disregard for the charges
of many librarians regarding the inadequacies of the Framework, on June 25, 2016, the

28

ACRL Board of Directors rescinded the Standards in favor of the Framework (ACRL
Board of Directors, 2016).
Discussions and debates over the definition of IL are not new, having been raised,
although infrequently, virtually since the term first entered the LIS discourse. Paul
Zurkowski is credited with coining the term in 1974 when he used the phrase to describe
the information use skills of individuals in their work environments (Owusu-Ansah,
2005; Zurkowski, 1975). It was not long until the term took hold in LIS as scholars and
professionals assimilated the term into the jargon of the field. Although tacitly
acknowledged within the LIS community to include information use skills in work
environments and in normal daily life, since the concept first began to appear in LIS
literature on IL in higher education, LIS scholars in academe have extended the meaning
and typically discuss IL as information use skills in academic and research contexts. The
majority of works on IL in higher education in the literature published prior to 2015 refer
to the ACRL’s Standards which delineated guidelines built off the ALA’s 1989 definition
of IL (Bell, 2013).
In addition to critiques that have appeared throughout the years in the LIS
literature, IL has been studied in relation to a number of topics. Because the investigation
in this study explores definitions of IL in the discourse of LIS within the context of
undergraduate higher education in the United States, the following literature review
covers professional LIS journal articles that have discussed IL in higher education in
four-year degree-granting institutions in the United States. While IL has also entered the
LIS discourse in other contexts of ILI for undergraduates within higher education,

29

including community colleges, as well as internationally, those settings are beyond the
scope of this study, and the literature investigating IL in these environments is not
included in this review.
This study seeks to explore definitions of IL in LIS used by academic librarians
and LIS scholars in comparison with the Standards, within the context of higher
education in the United States. The number of articles discussing IL that have been
published in LIS journals is voluminous; a keyword search for “information literacy” in
three library science databases (Library Literature & Information Science Full Text
(H.W. Wilson); Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts, and Library,
Information Science & Technology Abstracts with Full Text) resulted in over 13,000
articles1 published since the year 2000. Limiting the scope to undergraduate education in
four-year institutions in the United States, the volume of articles is still immense,
numbering over 2,300. Because the focus of this work is a comparison of how academic
librarians and LIS academe in the United States conceptualize IL in the context of firstyear and freshmen undergraduate ILI in comparison to the Standards released by the
ACRL in 2000, this literature review focuses on definitions in LIS literature since 2000,
with some dated prior to 2000, dealing with undergraduate IL education in the United
States as related to the first of the three research questions of this project, specific
definitions of IL discussed in the literature. The other two research questions regarding
alignment of IL definition with ACRL policy documents in comparison to IL definitional
category from Addison’s and Meyers’ (2013) framework of IL definitions, and any

30

discernable factors behind the variations and discrepancies of IL definitions are addressed
in the following chapters’ discussions of the analysis and findings of this project.
This review not only includes published research studies, but also covers
theoretical articles and, in a few cases, opinion pieces, that discuss IL and ILI regarding
undergraduate higher education. While many authors from around the world have
discussed IL within LIS in higher education and have influenced thought on IL in U.S.
higher education, including such well-known LIS scholars as William Badke and
Christine Bruce, it is beyond the scope of this review to include these authors’ works
outside of a brief discussion of significance to U.S. thought, unless directly discussing IL
in United States higher education, since the objective in this study is to compare IL
definitions of LIS faculty and librarians in relation to the definitions of the ALA and
ACRL.
Definitions and Context of Information Literacy
As noted previously, questions regarding how to define IL have been often
discussed within the LIS literature. The 1989 ALA Presidential Committee on
Information Literacy: Final Report formally defined IL as attributes of an individual, “To
be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed
and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (para.
3). Soon after, in 1990 Arp asked:
Are information literacy instruction and bibliographic instruction the same? In
some ways. Neither term is particularly well defined by theoreticians or

31

practitioners in the field, and so a great deal of confusion will occur unless we
continue to articulate the parameters of this question. (p. 49)
Perhaps ambiguities in the term arise due to the inherent nature of IL as situated
and contextual, as many scholars have now recognized (Farrell, 2013; Farrell & Badke,
2015; Jastram, Leebaw, & Tompkins, 2014; Nichols, 2009; Roldan & Wu, 2004; Seeber,
2015). In addition, as many have observed, there have been various influences on
definitions of IL. Behrens noted the effects of societal and technological factors on the
term; “… by the middle of the 1980s the advancing information technology (IT) had
begun to affect the information handling requirements for information literacy” (1994, p.
312). In addition to the influence of advances in technology, Behrens also described the
introduction of the belief in a democratic, productive society to the term. As early as the
late 1970s, IL was seen as necessary to promote an egalitarian society.
Information literacy differs from context to context. All men are created equal but
voters with information resources are in a position to make more intelligent
decisions than citizens who are information illiterates. The application of
information resources to the process of decision-making to fulfill civic
responsibilities is a vital necessity. (Owens, 1976, p. 27; see also Behrens, 1994)
In order to deal with the proliferation of the information available in the new digital
technologies at use with information production and access, in conjunction with the
literacy movement of the early 1990s, following publications such as A Nation at Risk:
The Imperative for Educational Reform. A Report to the Nation and the Secretary of
Education in 1983, discussions of IL continued to include ideological contexts, including

32

lifelong learning (Behrens, 1994, p. 312). For example, the ideologies of IL and
democracy helped shaped early events in the IL movement:
Information literacy was one of the issues focused on at the Second White House
Conference on Libraries and Information Services (WHCLIS) in 1991, where
national attention was drawn to the contribution made by libraries and
information services to a literate, productive and democratic society. One of the
recommendations of the second WHCLIS calls for the U.S. government to
establish a National Coalition for Information Literacy (including schools,
libraries, labor and industry, government, parents and the general public), with the
intention of developing a strategic plan for the general development of skills
required for information literacy. (Behrens, 1994, p. 319)
International models of IL have also significantly influenced conceptualizations
of IL in the United States. As Gibson (2007) noted, one of the most influential has been
Christine Bruce’s 1997 book, The Seven Faces of Information Literacy, which took a
phenomenographic approach to a study of the information experiences of academics,
rather than relying on experts to create normative conceptions of the information
literate student or individual…. Bruce organized this relational model around
seven faces or aspects of information literacy: information technology;
information sources; information process; the information control; knowledge
construction; knowledge extension; and wisdom. This model has enriched the
understanding of information literacy for librarians as a construct that transcends

33

traditional computer literacy or library literacy into a far more pervasive,
knowledge-building, creativity-fused aspect of learning. (Gibson, 2007, p. 24)
Also influential on United States LIS’ definitions of IL in higher education was
SCONUL’s Seven Pillars of Information Literacy published in their 1999 Information
Skills in Higher Education: A SCONUL Position Paper which ordered
the major elements of information literacy into seven major strands: recognizing
an information need; determining ways of addressing the information gap;
constructing search strategies; locating and accessing information; comparing and
evaluating it; organizing, applying, and communicating it; and finally,
synthesizing and creating new products based on it. (Gibson, 2007, p. 24)
Gibson noted that while Bruce’s Seven Faces model particularly resonated with LIS
academe in the United States with “opportunities for deepening pedagogical engagement”
(p. 24), SCONUL’s Seven Pillars answered the call of the National Research Council’s
FITness report of 1999 for increased focus on education in IT in conjunction with the
efforts of the National Forum on Information Literacy. Also, echoing the focus on
information technology skills in combination with IL skills, the National Forum on
Information Literacy and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills conceived Information
and Communication Technology Skills (ICT), based on which the Educational Testing
Service (ETS) developed the ICT Literacy Assessment for higher education. ICT literacy
was similarly “organized into seven categories (define, access, manage, integrate,
evaluate, create, and communicate)” (p. 24).

34

Recently other LIS scholars have conceptualized definitions of IL in terms of
categories. Foasberg (2015) has cited Addison’s and Meyers’ (2013) conceptualizations
of IL within the LIS discourse in largely three distinct ways; as a set of skills, a way of
thinking, or a social phenomenon. However, as Addison and Meyers pointed out other
ways of viewing IL have been described such as the three theoretical perspectives of
Limberg, Sundin, and Talja (2012) or Lupton and Bruce’s (2010) divisions of IL as
generic, sociocultural, or critical (2013, para. 2). Addison’s and Meyers’ posited that their
perspective offers a relevant
interpretation [that] is unique from these as it is more concerned with the
interpretations of information literacy that stem from the library and information
science field, and less about either the theoretical underpinnings (Limberg,
Sundin, and Talja, 2012), or the relationship to information (Lupton and Bruce,
2010) that characterize these other views ….
We are using this organizing schema not to set up binaries or oppositional
arrangements but to illustrate how values, goals and institutional priorities play a
part in defining (and reifying) who is “information literate.” (para. 2, 3)
Using these categories, the following provides an overview and discussion of definitions
or conceptualizations of IL that have appeared within the published literature of the field.
In addition, as will be shown in this chapter, Addison’s and Meyers’ framework of IL
conceptualizations within LIS can be linked to a historical context of IL definitions
within LIS and U.S. higher education.

35

Addison and Meyers saw IL definitions in use within LIS as fitting into one of
three categories: 1) a set of skills, 2) a way of thinking, or 3) a social phenomenon or
practice. Even prior to reading Addison’s and Meyers’ (2013) article or the Foasberg
(2015) article that cited their framework of IL definitions, early during the course of this
review of the literature, a pattern of the development of IL definitions in a historical
context emerged. Addison’s and Meyers’ IL categories confirmed these early suspicions
and provided a useful framework to review the historical context of the evolution of IL
definitions within the profession. The earliest definitions were obviously predominantly
skills-based, but were soon followed by the introduction of cognitive models which
heavily influenced the shift from skills-based definitions to IL as a way of thinking. The
more recent trend of inclusion of critical theory in conjunction with social constructivist
theories in IL definitions can be seen in the definition of IL as a social practice. Each of
the approaches has strengths and weaknesses which are detailed in the sections below.
However, there are some limitations to using Addison’s and Meyers’ categories of IL
definitions which are discussed at the end of this chapter.
Information literacy defined as a set of skills. The skills-based view holds that
IL is a set of skills, abilities, or behaviors which are exhibited by individuals in their
information seeking within digital environments (Addison & Meyers, 2013). A
characteristic of this approach is the view that IL is quantifiable and can be measured
based on the individual’s performance in relation to the experts, i.e., information
professionals such as librarians.

36

For much of ILI within the United States higher education, the primary definition
of IL has been that of the ACRL’s Standards which describes the information literate
individual as able to successfully perform a set of skills:


Determine the extent of information needed



Access the needed information effectively and efficiently



Evaluate information and its sources critically



Incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base



Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose



Understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the
use of information, and access and use information ethically and
legally. (American Library Association, 2006, pp. 2-3)

Given the background of the national discourse from which the Standards emerged, it is
not surprising the Standards were developed as a set of skills. As the dominant skillsbased definition for United States higher education, the Standards have shaped IL
pedagogy in American undergraduate education since adoption in 2000. Although the
Standards were rescinded June 25, 2016, adherents continue to base ILI on the
competencies and outcomes provided within the document, which provides a readily
available foundation for lesson content and assessment measures.
Strengths, weaknesses, and challenges. One of the greatest advantages of the
skills-based view is its facility of assessment. This ease of assessment affords libraries
and ILI librarians a straightforward means of communicating value to various
shareholders. In addition, skills-based definitions offer a clearly identifiable set of
37

outcomes for teaching. However, these strengths also represent weaknesses to the skillsbased conceptualization of IL, which are discussed below.
A common approach to the Standards’ skills has been to divide them into lowerand higher-order thinking skills based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, with determining the
extent of information needed and searching and accessing that information as lower-order
cognitive skills, and positioning evaluation and incorporation of information as higherorder skills (Cameron, Wise, & Lottridge, 2007; Chalmers, 2008; Choinski, Mark, &
Murphey, 2003; Gendron & Sclippa, 2014; Hayes-Bohanan & Spievak, 2008; Lacy &
Chen, 2013; Maughan, 2001; Menchaca, 2014; Morgan, 2015; Nentl & Zietlow, 2008;
Purdue, 2003; Saunders, 2008; Shane, 2004; Sharkey & O’Connor, 2013; Sonntag, 2008;
Whitmire, 2001). However, the view that searching is a lower-order skill has been
challenged by those who maintain that “the act of ‘searching’ is not the subordinate,
lower-order operation or activity it is often reduced to” (Wiebe, 2015, p. 55; see also
Bodemer, 2012; Morgan, 2014), but rather “is an integral, concurrent component of a
situated whole” (Bodemer, 2012, p. 336).
Significant drawbacks stem in part from the conceptualization of IL as a linear
sequence of acts based on the ordering of the Standards, but may also have roots in
development of instruction by librarians from BI to ILI. The sequential view of the
process of research based on the ordering of the Standards has been challenged by those
who see research and writing as an iterative process. Bodemer pointed out that:
The ordering of the first four Standards suggests a temporal sequence that is
simpler than the reality of research-writing. If one imagines these intellectual

38

operations unfolding in real time, it is easy to see how such delineations begin to
fail. Determining “the extent of information needed,” accessing “the needed
information,” evaluating “information and its sources critically,” and using
“information effectively” are not discrete and sequential, but cyclical, often
simultaneous, and mutually influencing. (2012, p. 338)
This view of research as a sequential and discrete set of steps further results in several
negative effects.
When IL is viewed as a series of sequential steps, those steps are often taught in
order. However, as Saunders (2008) noted, librarians seldom have time to teach IL
concepts beyond searching and accessing information; thus, skills such as evaluation of
resources and the ethical use of information are infrequently taught by ILI librarians in
one-shot sessions, the most common venue of instruction. The application of information
skills, including incorporation of information into the individual’s knowledge base, the
effective use of information, and critical thinking skills are even more infrequently
covered by ILI one-shot sessions (Cody, 2006; D’Angelo, 2001; Deitering & Jameson,
2008; Grafstein, 2007; McGuigan, 2002; Saunders, 2008; Simmons, 2005).
The fallacy that research can be accomplished by a set of sequential IL skills leads
to other misconceptions and issues. Several have observed that conceptualizing IL as a
set of generic skills that can be easily transferable to all other information-seeking
contexts lacks solid basis. IL as a set of generic skills is a view which has not been fully
supported by studies (Lloyd, 2010; Manuel, 2004), and is belied by the creation of
subject-specific disciplinary standards (Foasberg, 2015). While Lacy and Chen (2013)

39

posit that the failure to transfer IL skills by students may be due to ILI librarians trying to
cover as much material as possible in one-shot sessions, others contend the lack of
transferability results from teaching IL skills as generic, rather than contextual or
disciplinary (Crouse & Kasbohm, 2004; Grafstein, 2002; Head, Van Hoeck, Eschler, &
Fullerton, 2013; Hicks, 2013; Hofer, Brunetti, & Townsend, 2013; Hunt & Birks, 2004;
Macklin & Fosmire, 2004; Manuel, 2004). Gross & Latham (2013) suggested transfer is
better supported by students’ engagement in the research process; their study found IL
skills were transferred more often by students’ self-generated queries for their personal
information seeking rather than imposed queries, such as assignments. Others, seeing the
lack of instruction on higher-order skills, have proposed alternatives such as teaching the
use of discovery tools in order to allow librarian instructions to “mov[e] beyond simply
teaching techniques for retrieving information to teaching critical thinking skills” (Buck
& Steffy, 2013, p. 77).
Although many within the LIS higher education community may agree with
academic librarian Rebecca Jackson’s view of the importance of communicating to
“students the authority of librarians with whom they may interact” (2007, p. 31), Addison
and Meyers observed that teaching IL as a set of skills “both reinforces the authority of
librarians and also undermines it” (2013, p. 4), as the main objection to librarians’
authority is instruction librarians’ lack of subject or disciplinary expertise which many
perceive as critical to conducting research in subject-specific knowledge domains
(Farrell, 2012; 2013; Farrell & Badke, 2015; Grafstein, 2002).

40

Wilder, in his contentious piece “Information Literacy Makes All the Wrong
Assumptions”, also observed along outsiders’ views of librarians’ authority, the fallacy of
teaching IL skills apart from disciplinary research:
information literacy would have librarians teach students to be more like them.
The problem with that approach is that librarians are alone in harboring such
aspirations for students. As Roy Tennant noted in the January 1, 2001, Library
Journal, “only librarians like to search; everyone else likes to find.” Any
educational philosophy is doomed to failure if it views students as information
seekers in need of information-seeking training. Information-seeking skills are
undeniably necessary. However, librarians should view them in the same way that
students and faculty members do: as an important, but ultimately mechanical,
means to a much more compelling end. Information literacy instead segregates
those skills from disciplinary knowledge by creating separate classes and
curricula for them. There is no better way to marginalize academic librarianship.
(2005, para. 5)
In this piece, Wilder advocated his view that students are mistakenly perceived as
information seekers in the IL-as-skills approach when the appropriate approach would be
to see them as involved in subject-specific scholarly discourse. Although several of
Wilder’s views in this piece were challenged, most of LIS concurred with his views on
the error of separating IL skills from subject-specific contexts; this agreement can be seen
by proponents of IL-as-a-way-of-thinking and IL-as-a-social-practice.

41

Another problem with the IL-as-skills approach is that the student is invariably
seen as deficient in IL skills (Addison & Meyers, 2013, p. 5; see also Agee, 2005;
Elmborg, 2006; Foasberg, 2015; Haider & Bawden, 2007; Harris, 2008; Isaacson, 2003;
Lin, 2010; Mani, 2004; Peterson, 2010; Stahura, 2014). By ignoring the contextual,
iterative nature of research, students may feel information illiterate when research is not
accomplished easily on following the steps, and may have no idea how to remedy. At the
very least, this view may be one culprit contributing to the superficial research conducted
by students which has been often lamented in the literature, as students may well believe
research is and should be completed upon one iteration of the steps. Addison and Meyers
observed the perception of students as inherently deficient in IL skills arises from the
view that IL is measurable, which in turn leads to a number of other problems. For
example, when students are seen as deficient in IL skills, the natural progression is that
the deficiency can only be remedied through instruction “from experts, namely librarians
[…However,] because these experts’ skills are often based in bibliographic information
systems…” (Addison & Meyers, 2013, para. 11), it is not surprising that the skills
assessed and taught are most often limited to tests of Boolean logic, construction of
search queries, and the like. Furthermore, Addison and Meyers pointed out:
skills instruction, particularly when it is rooted in specific behaviours rather than
conceptual structures, may fail to account for the rapid changes in digital
technologies. It may also lead to information literacy instruction as a series of
platitudes in practice contexts, such as restrictions on the use of Wikipedia. (2013,
para. 11)

42

Following up on this critique, Addison and Meyers also pointed out the tendency for
proponents of skills-based definitions to conclude that students lack IL skills because
“that they lack the drive to attain them or, in some cases, they overestimate their abilities”
(Addison & Meyers, 2013, para. 11; see also Agee, 2005; Gross, 2005; Gross & Latham,
2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013; Gross, Latham, & Armstrong, 2012; Latham & Gross,
2008, 2013).
Information literacy defined as a way of thinking. Addison and Meyers
described this conceptualization of IL as “cultivating habits of mind” (2013, para. 12).
Characteristic of this approach to IL is an emphasis on cognitive models and a focus on
the individual’s mental processing of information, including reflective thought and
motivation. Addison and Meyers placed process models, such as Kuhlthau’s Information
Search Process and Dervin’s Sense Making, and learning models, such as problem-based
learning (PBL) within this perspective. The definition of IL-as-a-way-of thinking quickly
followed the adoption of the Standards, which in this review of the literature began to
appear frequently in the LIS discourse in the mid-2000s, with a few references as early as
the late 1990s (White, as cited in Snavely, 2012, p. 95; see also Day, 1998; Ercegovac,
1998; Kenney, 2008; Kim & Sin, 2007; MacMillan, 2009; Maybee, 2006; Nahl & Bilal,
2007; Pawley, 2003; Robinson, 2006; Schiller, 2008a, 2008b; Spackman & Camacho,
2009; Woodard, 2003; Xiaomei & Loomis, 2009). Although the user-centered approach
in education has been dated to the 1980s (Fisher & Landry, as cited in Nahl & Bilal,
2007, p. 211; Kim & Sin, 2007), the shift from skills-based ILI to a constructivist
approach gained momentum with Bruce’s Seven Faces of Information Literacy

43

(MacMillan, 2009). The rise of adherents to user-centered educational efforts and
quantitatively measurable assessments can be linked to the marketization of education
(Fairclough, 2013, p. 101).
Strengths, weaknesses, and challenges. Adherents of this view, particularly those
who support the use of PBL techniques in ILI, claim that transferability of IL skills is
supported by the ill-structured real-life problems used. The transferability of IL skills is
particularly significant to claims that IL supports lifelong learning (Williams, 2006; see
also Birmingham et al., 2008; Eisenberg, 2008; Hayes-Bohanan & Spievak, 2008; Orme,
2004; Ormsby & Williams, 2010; Owusu-Ansah, 2004a, 2004b; Pan, Ferrer-Vinent, &
Bruehl, 2014; Stevens, 2007). However, Addison & Meyers noted this claim represents a
weakness of this approach as assessment of IL is based on students’ ability to “apply
cognitive frameworks to academic and everyday situations … A key challenge is that
they rely on users to transfer knowledge and procedures among contexts and problems,
something users are notoriously poor at doing” (2013, p. 7). Addison and Meyers further
pointed out that while adherents of PBL claim the PBL approach scaffolds such
transference, others have noted “the failure of such problem-based lessons to include the
wide range of problems and behaviours found in schools and workplaces,” as well as
dissension within adherents regarding the “extent to which information literacy must be
contextually situated” (p. 7).
While, indeed, the above-mentioned are issues with this definition, other issues
with the IL-as-a-way-of-thinking approach also exist. The limited time most ILI
librarians have to teach is further exacerbated under this approach by the depth of PBL

44

lessons, both in terms of preparation and in terms of how much can be covered in the
one-shot sessions. While many see embedded IL and ILI as a means of addressing this
concern, this entails both buy-in from and collaboration with instructors, which are not
always easy to obtain. In cases where instructors are not willing to collaborate with ILI
librarians, some or many students may not be reached. While advocates of disciplinary IL
see the importance of context in teaching IL, librarians such as Farrell (2012, 2013) saw
the importance of teaching both generic, transferable and disciplinary-specific IL skills.
Finally, as early forerunners to the conceptualization of IL as a social practice pointed
out, this approach focuses on an individual’s cognitive processes and may omit the sociocultural constructed aspects of IL (Montiel-Overall, 2007) and focus on peer-review and
omit other information sources (Fountain, 2013) or other disciplinary sources (Dold,
2014; see also Doherty, 2007; Doherty & Ketchner, 2005; Elmborg, 2006; Leckie, Given,
& Buschman, 2010; Simmons, 2005; Tewell, 2015).
Information literacy defined as a social practice. According to Addison and
Meyers, adherents to IL as a social practice see IL as highly contextual and socially
constructed. The focus of this perspective is on “general capabilities … for living,
learning, and working in an information-rich society … [within] the constantly changing
nature of technology and the evolving expectations we have of citizens” (2013, para. 19).
Multiliteracies are placed within this perspective. This view arose in popularity following
continued voiced concerns with students’ failure to transfer IL skills and has gained
momentum in relation to the Open Access movement in response to criticisms of peer
review and the rise of critical thought within LIS. Representing the latest iteration of

45

conceptualizations of IL within LIS in U.S. higher education, the Framework is the
guiding document with the rescission of the Standards on June 25, 2016. Although the
Framework was officially adopted January 11, 2016, the importance of definitions of IL
to encompass socio-cultural constructs of information and knowledge in IL has been
espoused for some time (Burkholder, 2010; Buschman, 2009; Elmborg, 2006; Fields,
2001; Foasberg, 2015; Gregory & Higgins, 2013; Hicks, 2013; Kraemer, 2007; MontielOverall, 2007; Mitchell & Hiatt, 2010; Mitchell & Smith, 2009; Norgaard, 2003;
O’Connor, 2009a; O’Connor, Bowles-Terry, Davis, & Holliday, 2010; Oakleaf &
VanScoy, 2010; Ragains, 2001; Simmons, 2005; Woodard, 2003).
Metaliteracy, threshold concepts, and Framework for Information Literacy in
Higher Education. In more recent years, some in LIS have proposed an expansion of the
concept of IL to the broader concept, metaliteracy. Metaliteracy is viewed by proponents
as a broader framing, or as an umbrella term under which several literacies fit including
digital literacy, media literacy, visual literacy, and information technology fluency,
compared to the skills-based Standards definition of IL. Proponents of IL as a
metaliteracy see IL as comprised of key components, or threshold concepts, rather than
the skillsets in the former Standards, as the crucial attributes and activities that
information literate individuals would possess and exhibit (Jacobson & Mackey, 2013;
Jacobson & O’Keeffe, 2014; Mackey & Jacobson, 2011).
The concept of metaliteracy began to appear more frequently in the published
literature of LIS around 2011. Early proponents of metaliteracy referred to the need to
broaden the definition and teaching of IL to encompass metaliteracy and transliteracy

46

(Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; McBride, 2011). Transliteracy has been defined as “the
ability to read, write and interact across a range of platforms, tools and media from
signing and orality through handwriting, print, TV, radio and film, to digital social
networks” (Thomas, et al., 2007, para. 3; see also Dunaway, 2011; Mackey & Jacobson,
2011). Metaliteracy is seen as a much broader term, as “an overarching and selfreferential framework that integrates emerging technologies and unifies multiple literacy
types” (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011). Because of the strong emphasis on the social aspects
of information, proponents of metaliteracy-based or Framework-based IL definitions fit
solidly within Addison’s and Meyers’ IL as a socio-cultural practice definitional
category.
Threshold concepts have been used as a way to broaden IL from a skills-based
definition to that of a metaliteracy. In LIS published literature, Meyer and Land are often
credited with the definition of threshold concepts, which they defined as:
a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something
without which the learner cannot progress. As a consequence of comprehending a
threshold concept there may thus be a transformed internal view of subject matter,
subject landscape, or even world view. (2003, p. 1)
For many proponents of a broader definition of IL, threshold concepts have been viewed
as a way to escape the difficulties in defining IL, provide a means to incorporate
changing information formats, and foster development of individuals’ IL skills in the
increasingly social information environments of the global age. The ACRL’s Framework

47

is based on a view of IL as a metaliteracy and presents six threshold concepts, which the
ACRL sees as central to IL:
•

Authority Is Constructed and Contextual

•

Information Creation as a Process

•

Information Has Value

•

Research as Inquiry

•

Scholarship as Conversation

•

Searching as Strategic Exploration. (American Library Association, 2015,
p. 2)

Strengths, weaknesses, and challenges. Although the IL-as-a-social-practice
approach to defining IL has several strengths, there are weaknesses and challenges as
well. This section focuses on critiques of the Framework, as this is ACRL’s replacement
for the Standards and as such will influence (and already has influenced) IL and ILI in
U.S. higher education, and because critiques of the Framework often include criticisms of
many of the core concepts of IL defined as a social practice such as threshold concepts
and metaliteracy.
The incorporation of the term, metaliteracy, in the Framework was not well
received by all (Witek, 2014). One respondent noted frustration with the contradiction of
teaching authority while simultaneously undermining authority, while other voiced
concerns with the (then potential) loss of the Standards cited the clear outcomes, ease of
assessment, and institutional and accrediting agency buy-in of the Standards as benefits
lost with the adoption of the Framework (Berg, et al., 2015; Witek, 2014). Others have

48

criticized the misuse of threshold concepts in the Framework, charged the Framework
with overreaching by placing IL as a separate discipline, and noted the difficulty in
assessment of IL based on threshold concepts (Bombaro & Watstein, 2016; Wilkinson,
2014). In fact, as Bombaro & Watstein noted, “an inherent contradiction arises: we have
been asked to adapt the Framework locally by writing our own outcomes, while using a
document based on a theory whose authors reject outcomes-based assessment in its
application” (Bombaro & Watstein, 2016, p. 555). Bombaro and Watstein also pointed
out the seeming disregard or misunderstanding by the ACRL in the Framework and its
adherents of the work librarians do. This charge was underscored by an interview with
Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe prior to the ACRL’s decision to rescind the Standards, in which
she stated she believed there was still a need for the Standards. The authors included
Hinchliffe’s response to a question posed after the interview, in which she stated that if
ILI librarians “decide that those Standards-based outcomes are still the best choice for
your program, you no longer have the authority of ACRL behind them and ACRL will no
longer be offering any training and support for libraries who are working in that mode”
(Bombaro, Harris, Odess-Harnish, & Mitchell, 2016, p. 551). (This additional question
was posed after the interview, but prior to publication and after the Standards were
rescinded.)
Critical Theory and Information Literacy in Library and Information Science
Because the theoretical framework, Critical Theory (CT), is used in this project, it
is useful to look at the use of theory in LIS on IL. The following provides an overview on
studies or other published articles in which CT has been discussed in the literature in

49

relation to IL and ILI. Although a number of articles have been published on CT and IL,
this review focuses on those that examined class or status, and/or power in the context of
IL and ILI for undergraduate students. Several articles discuss CT, IL, and reference
work or cataloging; these articles are not included in this review. More information on
CT is provided in Chapter 3. A review of the published literature in LIS on DA is also
provided in Chapter 3.
Although librarians may feel they lack status, a few articles looked at the power
wielded by ILI librarians and opportunities to empower students through ILI librarians’
praxis. The reproduction of hegemony through library instruction was critiqued by
Pawley (1998). Later Pawley (2003) used a CT lens to demonstrate the inherent
contradiction between the claim of IL to promote participation in a democratic society
and the privileging of ‘quality’ information. Doherty and Ketchner used a critical lens to
examine the ways librarians have historically “privileged positioning of their expertise in
relation to the users they serve” (2005, p. 1). Simmons (2005) proposed the application of
genre theory to ILI. Doherty critiqued ILI as a practice “that continues to reify… a
hegemonic, traditional way of looking at information” (2007, p. 1).
Doherty later noted the need for librarians to engage in reflective praxis in order
to overcome the hegemonic nature of librarians’ work, particularly in “the inherent
privileging of information” (2008, p. 111). Jacobs (2008) also pointed out the need for
reflective praxis. Elmborg (2006) used critical literacy theory to argue that ILI librarians
should focus less on transfer of information. He stated, “librarians and library educators
can better engage the educational climate on campuses by defining academic

50

librarianship through the scholarship of teaching and learning in general, and the
scholarship of literacy in particular” (2006, p. 193). O’Connor (2009a, 2009b, 2009c)
explored through a CT lens the ways LIS has legitimated the profession through the IL
movement. Bossaller, Adkins, and Thompson (2010) also critiqued the reproduction of
hegemony within IL and librarianship. Mark (2011) discussed the privileging of peer
review in ILI. Cyberfeminism was the critical theory Schlesselman-Tarango (2014) used
for her suggestions on teaching IL. Pagowsky (2015) discussed the ways the using CT
and Framework can help ILI librarians with pedagogy. In 2016, Tewell published an
article using CT to critique Google Scholar and find ways to teach critical reading of
information in ILI.
Schroeder and Hollister (2014) reported on a study of ILI librarians’ knowledge,
views, and application of CT in their praxis. In another article, Tewell (in press) reported
the findings of a survey of librarians teaching critical information literacy (CIL).
Several authors saw the application of CT to ILI as a means to empower students.
Swanson (2004b) discussed the use of CT in an IL course. Ward described the use of CT
to expand the definition of IL and application in a specific IL course. Broidy (2007)
discussed the application of feminist theory to an IL course. Elmborg used CT to explore
ways to better assist adult learners in IL development (2010). Reale (2012) discussed the
application of CT in order to decentralize the power in traditional classrooms and
empower students. Beilin and Leonard (2013) also saw the need to apply CT to ILI in
order to empower students. Weaver and Tuten (2014) discussed the application of CT in
a specific IL course.

51

A few authors critiqued the Standards or the Framework through application of
CT. Swanson (2004a) and Lilburn (2007) each examined the Standards using CT. Beatty
(2014) and Beilin (2015) each used CT in critique of the Framework.
Conclusion
This literature review was fundamental in establishing the categories of IL
definitions used by authors and reveals a gap in the contemporary literature. Recent
research has overlooked exploration of any correlation between IL definition used and the
role of the author, or any other factors. In the selection process of articles for this review,
it was found that authors were predominantly concerned with supporting particular
definitions, adding skills to established IL definitions, or research focused on how a
method, technique, or tool supported IL development rather than examining IL definitions
and factors underlying IL definitions used. Two articles, Mark (2011) and Gross and
Latham (2011), were included in this review and were also texts analyzed in in this
project.
Limitation of Addison’s and Meyers’ framework of information literacy
definitions. While Addison’s and Meyer’s framework of IL definitions is useful to
analyzing the myriad of discussions on IL within LIS, there is a limitation to this
approach. This weakness stems from their admission that in comparison with the other
approaches they name, their approach focuses “less … [on] either the theoretical
underpinnings … or [on] the relationship to information” (Addison & Meyers, 2013,
para. 2). Indeed, the omission of these aspects tends to make placing an authors’
approach within their approach somewhat difficult at times. However, as they stated,

52

their approach is “not to set up binaries or oppositional arrangements but to illustrate how
values, goals and institutional priorities play a part in defining (and reifying) who is
‘information literate’” (para. 3), it parallels the critical approach taken in this project and
offers a means of grouping the texts under investigation in this project. As seen, their
approach offers a look at the historical context of IL in U.S. higher education which is a
critical component of the critical theory framework used in this project.

CHAPTER 3: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND
METHODOLOGY

Introduction
This project is a comparison of how academic librarians, LIS scholars, and the
ACRL define IL in the published LIS literature regarding undergraduate education in the
United States. One pre-assumption in beginning this study is that there are differences in
the uses and/or definitions of IL by these groups. Because this study seeks to show these
differences are due to a reinforcement of traditional stratifications in the discipline
between participants of varying social stratification, a perspective based upon the work of
Pierre Bourdieu provides a direction to the Critical Theory framework to describe the acts
of the participants in the discourse. Critical Discourse Analysis is an appropriate method
to disclose the existence and reenactment of these stratifications within the published LIS
literature.
Theoretical Framework
Definitions. Critical Theory (CT) is an orientational qualitative inquiry which
“focuses on how injustice and subjugation shape people’s experience and understandings
of the world” (Patton, 2002, p. 130). Other orientational qualitative inquiry approaches
include feminist inquiry and queer theory, but all orientational qualitative inquiry seeks to
describe particular manifestations of social inequities from a predetermined theoretical
framework. The orientation of any individual researcher’s inquiry can be of any intensity,
as it is the reflection of the researcher’s personal agenda; it is the addition of critical that
54

implies the commitment of the researcher to use findings to support change in the social
phenomena under study (Patton, 2002).
CT emerged from the work of theorists from the Institute of Social Research,
founded in Frankfurt in 1923. Held (1980) described two branches of CT. One branch
was comprised of the Frankfurt school’s founding critical theorists, in particular, Max
Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse, and the second branch stemming
from the work of Jürgen Habermas. As Held noted “Critical theory … does not form a
unity” (1980, p. 14) [emphasis in original]. In Held’s description of these two branches,
he noted differences even among Horkheimer, Adorno, and Marcuse, underscoring the
disunity of thought among critical theorists. However, he saw the theories espoused by
these earlier members of the Frankfurt school as distinct from the theories of Habermas.
The Frankfurt school theorists, the founders of CT, originated from and preserved
German idealism; “concern[ed], for example, with the nature of reason, truth and beauty
– but [these theorists] reformulated the way in which these had been previously
understood. They placed history at the centre [sic] of their approach to philosophy and
society” (Held, 1980, p. 15). Of primacy to CT,
Each of the critical theorists maintained that although all knowledge is historically
conditioned, truth claims can be rationally adjudicated independently of
immediate social (e.g. class) interests. They defended the possibility of an
independent moment of criticism. They also all attempted to justify critical theory
on a non-objectivistic and materialistic foundation. The extension and
development of the notion of critique, from a concern with the conditions and

55

limits of reason and knowledge (Kant), to a reflection on the emergence of spirit
(Hegel), and then to a focus on specific historical forms – capitalism, the
exchange process (Marx) – was furthered in the work of the Frankfurt theorists
and Habermas. They sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of
all social practices. (Held, 1980, pp. 15-16)
While Held described the positions of the critical theorists in relation to political
economy, aesthetics, and psychoanalysis, it is the Frankfurt school theorists’ approach to
CT that holds much value for this investigation, which is discussed following an
introduction of the Frankfurt school theorists’ and Habermas’ approach to CT.
Frankfurt school theorists’ and Habermas’ approach to Critical Theory. A
truly comprehensive overview of the foundations of CT and the nuances of thought of
each of the Frankfurt school’s theorists and that of Habermas is well beyond the scope of
this project. What is covered here is limited to a brief overview in broad terms of each of
these approaches to CT as it relates to this project.
According to Held, the Frankfurt school theorists’ purpose in CT was a reform of
social philosophy with a focus on the “forces which moved (and might be guided to move
society) towards rational institutions – institutions which would ensure a true, free and
just life” (1980, p. 15). Their approach was not only to analyze and critique obstacles to
rational institutions, but also to engender change in society. At a foundational level, they
held a “non-objectivistic and materialistic” (p. 16) belief that “all knowledge is
historically conditioned” (p. 15), with which they sought to base social philosophy. In
addition, and to varying degrees, Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse each believed that

56

social philosophy should be established through interdisciplinary study of philosophy,
economy (political), sociology, psychology, aesthetics, and history. Of significance to the
approach of these theorists was a belief in a gap or break between the promised outcomes
of a society’s ideology and the actuality of the lives of the working classes. While, for the
most part, they saw the work of CT as a means to promote awareness of social
contradictions which would in turn lead to societal change, they were increasingly
pessimistic of society attaining the eventuality of a direct democracy.
Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse were first generation Frankfurt school critical
theorists; Habermas is the leader of the second generation of Frankfurt school critical
theorists. Habermas’ work has been to reshape CT, with a major focus on “the spread of
instrumental reason to many areas of social life” (Held, 1980, pp. 253-254), which he has
focused upon in the levels of social theory and the theory of knowledge. Habermas’
approach to CT is quite different. For Habermas, CT begins with analysis of discourse.
While the Frankfurt school theorists’ saw the exposure of the gap between a society’s
ideology and actuality as the goal of CT, Habermas believes the aim of CT is the
unveiling of distorted communication, based on his theory of communicative
competence. Habermas’ theory of communicative competence is the idea that all speech
is aimed at a real and un-coerced consensus. Consensus achieved in any other way is
distorted and is “in his view, the contemporary formulation of ideology” (Held, 1980, p.
256).
Although each of these approaches to CT is much more detailed than described
above, the general basis for CT is the theorists’ beliefs in the necessity of a social theory

57

to examine societal practices to illuminate the gap between a society’s ideology and
actuality. The Frankfurt school theorists believed only an interdisciplinary approach to a
social theory could uncover this gap. In his chapter “On the Concept of Philosophy” in
Eclipse of Reason, Horkheimer discussed the inability of singular approaches to
determine truth. He addressed the failure of philosophy, idealism, naturalism, and
positivism to adequately uncover truth. The necessity of an interdisciplinary approach
was emphasized by Horkheimer:
What is called philosophy, together with all the other branches of culture,
superficially bridges the chasm and thus adds to the dangers. An underlying
assumption of the present discussion has been that philosophical awareness of
these processes may help to reverse them. (Horkheimer, 1947, p. 162)
The way to this philosophical awareness of social practices was a critical approach to the
study of objective and subjective reason. In Horkheimer’s perspective, the prioritization
of one type of reason over the other was the cause for the failure of theoretical
approaches to uncover truth.
The task of philosophy is not stubbornly to play one against the other, but to
foster a mutual critique and thus, if possible, to prepare in the intellectual realm
the reconciliation of the two in reality. (Horkheimer, 1947, p. 174)
Linguistic analysis, in concert with the historical context, lay at the core of critical
analysis; the way to discover truth was to look at the language of a society, as
“definitions acquire their full meanings in the course of a historical process” (p. 165). He
went on to say:

58

Philosophy is the conscious effort to knit all our knowledge and insight into a
linguistic structure in which things are called by their right names. However, it
expects to find these names not in isolated words and sentences…but in the
continuous theoretical effort of developing philosophical truth. (p 180)
Thus, an interdisciplinary approach to social philosophy was inescapable.
Held summarized Horkheimer’s view:
Social phenomenon cannot be deduced from material being, that is, from the
economy …. they should ask: what interconnections exist in definite social
groups, in definite periods of time and in definite countries, between the position
of the group in the economy, changes in the psychic structures of its membership
and other relevant factors which condition and affect the group’s thoughts and
practices.” (1980, p. 33)
To achieve this interdisciplinary approach, they drew from Marx, Kant, Hegel, Webber,
Nietzsche, Heidegger, Fromm, and Freud, among others. They examined political
economy, aesthetics, psychoanalysis, and philosophy of history. They particularly
emphasized and defined rationality and the centrality of historical context in their work.
Specific concepts from their work, in particular, those of Adorno and Horkheimer, that
are most applicable to this project are discussed next.
Frankfurt school theorists’ approach to Critical Theory in regards to
philosophy of history. In their preface, Horkheimer and Adorno noted their goal in
Dialectic of Enlightenment “was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of
entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism” (2002, p. xiv). Held

59

noted the work as central to the Frankfurt school thought with their exploration of “one of
the school’s most central concerns – the rise and domination of instrumental reason”
(1980, p. 148).
In the Dialectic of Enlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno described two aspects
of reason, of which one part is:
Reason as the transcendental, supraindividual self contains the idea of a free
coexistence in which human beings organize themselves to form the universal
subject and resolve the conflict between pure and empirical reason in the
conscious solidarity of the whole. The whole represents the idea of true
universality, utopia. At the same, however, reason is the agency of calculating
thought, which arranges the world for the purposes of self-preservation and
recognizes no function other than that of working on the object as mere sense
material in order to make it the material of subjugation. The true nature of the
schematism which externally coordinates the universal and the particular, the
concept and the individual case, finally turns out, in current science, to be the
interest of industrial society. Being is apprehended in terms of manipulation and
administration. Everything – becomes a repeatable, replaceable process, a mere
example of the conceptual models of the system. Conflict between administrative,
reifying science, between the public mind and the experience of the individual, is
precluded by the prevailing circumstances. The senses are determined by the
conceptual apparatus in advance of perception; the citizen sees the world as made
a priori of the stuff from which he himself constructs it. (2002, p. 65)

60

As the above excerpt shows, these theorists, drawing from Kant, Hegel, and Nietzsche,
saw two facets of reason: the first, the universal, which provides all with ideals and
legitimations, and the second, instrumental, which “has generated the structure of
conventions which have actually conditioned day-to-day practice” (Held, 1980, p. 151),
those conventions which result in domination. The Frankfurt school theorists were
concerned with the spread of instrumental reason, but did not ascribe society’s
contradictions to this spread. “Rather, it is the mode in which the process of
rationalization is itself organized” (Held, 1980, p. 66). These theorists believed the
structures of capitalist production in modern society were “threaten[ing] the spirit and
today even the material survival of mankind, and not technological progress itself”
(Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, 1973, pp. 94-95; see also Held, 1980, p. 66). In
order to understand the mode in which the process of rationalization is organized, only an
interdisciplinary approach would suffice. All aspects of a society, its history, including
historical context, the psychological development of the society’s individual members,
the political influence of the economy and economic conditions, and the influences of
cultural artifacts such as art and music as well as popular media messages, are
components of and contributors to the spread of instrumental reason and as such must be
analyzed in relation to that society’s ideology in order to discover and critique
domination in that society.
Critical theory aims to assess ‘the breach between ideas and reality’ The method
of procedure is immanent criticism. Immanent criticism confronts ‘the existent, in
its historical context, with the claim of its conceptual principles, in order to

61

criticize the relation between the two and thus transcend them.’ (Held, 1980, p.
183)
Bourdieu’s habitus. As Shannon (2011) noted in his text, Reading Wide Awake:
Politics, Pedagogies, & Possibilities, Bourdieu offers a middle ground between
deliberate choice and social conditioning as an explanation of social acts of participants
in a social phenomenon. As Bourdieu stated, “The habitus, the durably installed
generative principle of regulated improvisations, produces practices which tend to
reproduce the regularities immanent in the objective conditions of the production of their
generative principle…” (2009, p. 78). Social practices tend toward reproduction:
In short, the habitus, the product of history, produces individual and collective
practices…. The system of dispositions – a past which survives in the present and
tends to perpetuate itself into the future by making itself present in practices
structured according to its principles…– is the principle of continuity and
regularity … (Bourdieu, 2009, p. 82)
Shannon noted that for Bourdieu “agency does not guarantee change within social
structures, but offers its possibility” (Shannon, 2011, p. 68). Thus, Bourdieu’s perspective
offers the opportunity to CT to explain inequities in social practices in manner that is
temperate.
Application to this project. CT is an approach used as “confirmation and
elucidation rather than discovery” of social inequity with an aim to move beyond mere
study and understanding to “critique and change society” (Patton, 2002, p. 131). This
study seeks to show that the differences in the ways academic librarians, LIS scholars,

62

and the ACRL Standards conceptualize IL are due to a reinforcement of traditional
stratifications in the discipline between participants of varying social position. CT serves
as an appropriate structure to examine this phenomenon. CT provides the foundation for
this study’s presupposition of the varying definitions (or levels of interaction with IL) of
these three groups of participants. CT also offers a means of examining the presence of
ideology within the claims of IL, and the actuality of praxis within the field of LIS in
U.S. higher education.
A Bourdieusian perspective is employed as a theoretical framework for this study.
Bourdieu defined habitus as
systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to
function as structuring structures, that is, as principles of the generation and
structuring of practices and representations which can objectively “regulated” and
“regular” without in any way being the product of obedience to rules, objectively
adapted to their goals without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an
express mastery of the operations necessary to attain them and, being all this,
collectively orchestrated without being the product of the orchestrating action of a
conductor. (2009, p. 72)
Bourdieu’s habitus provides the view of a middle ground between external
coercion and unconscious acquiescence, and as such offers a means with which to
examine explanations of any existing discrepancies between the participant-groups in this
analysis. Bourdieu stated that “habitus is the universalizing mediation which causes an
individual agent’s practices, without either explicit reason or signifying intent, to be none

63

the less ‘sensible’ and ‘reasonable’” (p. 79). Using this Bourdieusian principle of habitus
and the aim of CT, the intention of this study is to show that rather than any extrinsic
motivation, each of the participant-groups reenacts the social practices as a part of an
existing environment and the varying specific role[s] within LIS they have chosen to fill.
Bourdieu saw habitus as acting within participants “as the organizing principle of their
actions, and … this modus operandi informing all thought and action (including thought
of action) reveals itself only in the opus operatum” (p. 18). Thus, the work of Bourdieu
provides a direction to the use of the CT framework to describe the definitions of and
levels of interactions with IL of the participants in the LIS discourse. In addition, CT
offers a further explanation of the effects of instrumental reason which underlie the praxis
of these participants.
Addison’s and Meyers’ framework of information literacy definitions. As
noted in Chapter 2, Addison’s and Meyers’ categorizations of IL definitions offer a
relevant “interpretation … [that is] concerned with the interpretations of information
literacy that stem from the library and information science field …. to illustrate how
values, goals and institutional priorities play a part in defining (and reifying) who is
‘information literate’” (2013, para. 2, 3). Addison’s and Meyers’ basis for framing their
three conceptualizations of IL within LIS shows, as demonstrated in Chapter 2, a
historical development of definitions of IL. Establishment of a historical context of the
evolution of IL phenomenon within U.S. higher education and within LIS in the United
States is a crucial component for the application of CT in this project.

64

Limitations. CT is an orientational approach to qualitative research, beginning
with the pre-assumption that some inequity or imbalance is at play in the social sphere
under study, and because of this pre-assumption, some critics have charged objectivity
within CT is not possible. Frankfurt school critical theorist, Horkheimer, believed that as
“objective reality is not identical with …. [nor can be fully apprehended by] man’s
thought….an isolated and completable theory of reality is simply inconceivable”
(Horkheimer, 1993, p. 189; see also Held, 1980, pp. 178-179). Not only is there an
assumption of social imbalance, but an orientational approach also begins with the
orientation, or theoretical framework, that explains that imbalance. Held noted from the
Frankfurt school theorists’ viewpoint, and in particular that of Adorno, that “societal
objectivity [is] the embodiment of all of the conditions, institutions and forces within
which human beings act” (Adorno, 1976, p. 70; see also Held, 1980, p. 204). In addition,
the Frankfurt school theorists believed “the illusionary nature of modern science’s claim
to neutrality …. [wherein] social facts are given the status of natural facts …” (see also
Held, 1980, pp. 167-168). As Adorno noted, “empirical methods, whose power of
attraction lies in their claim to objectivity, favour [sic] the subjective” (1976, p. 71).
Thus, traditionally viewed objective methods are seen to be incapable of
objectivity, as most are based on the positivistic concept of the separation in science
between fact and value, because in “this dichotomy science can judge the efficiency of
means for given ends but it cannot contribute to the formation of an objective basis for
values … The dichotomy is untenable … [as] the ideals of objectivity and value-freedom
are themselves values” (Held, 1980, p. 169). Because the goal of CT “is to be able to

65

judge between competing accounts of ‘reality’ and to expose realms of ideology” (Held,
1980, p. 173), the use of CT in this project offers an avenue to study the claims of IL and
the actuality of those claims. The application of Bourdieu’s habitus offers a means to
further elaborate upon the rationale of CT. The rationale in using this approach is based
upon the pre-assumption that the actions and discourse of each of three participant-groups
are enacting and re-enacting normative practices that were already in existence prior to
the participants’ entry into their respective roles. This study seeks to describe this
reinforcing of disciplinary normative practices.
Methodology
Definitions. An excellent and concise definition of Critical Discourse Analysis
(CDA) has been provided by Teun A. Van Dijk:
Critical discourse analysis (CDA) is a type of discourse analytical research that
primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are
enacted, reproduced, and resisted by text and talk in the social and political
context. With such dissident research, critical discourse analysts take [an] explicit
position, and thus want to understand, expose, and ultimately resist social
inequality. (Schiffrin, Tannen, & Hamilton, 2006, p. 352)
In addition, Van Dijk noted that discourses, “especially scholarly discourse, are
inherently part of and influenced by social structure, and [are] produced in social
interaction” (p. 352). However, it might appear from Van Dijk’s definition of CDA that
CDA is limited to exposure of significant social issues, although critical discourse

66

theorists take a position in embarking upon analysis of discourse and discursive practices.
Wodak and Meyer note:
CDA is therefore not interested in investigating a linguistic unit per se but in
studying the social phenomena which are necessarily complex and thus require a
multidisciplinary and multi-methodical approach [emphasis in original]. The
objects under investigation do not have to be related to negative or exceptionally
‘serious’ social or political experiences or events – this is a frequent
misunderstanding of the aims and goals of CDA … Any social phenomenon lends
itself to critical investigation, to be challenged and not taken for granted.” (2010,
p. 2)
Wodak and Meyer also stated that all approaches of CDA are problem-oriented.
Fairclough described CDA as comprised of “three basic properties: it is relational,
it is dialectical, and it is transdisciplinary” (2013, p. 3). The relational property of CDA
denotes the focus of the approach on social relations rather than on individuals or entities.
The social relations under investigation are dialectical, which Fairclough explained as
“relations between objects which are different from one another but not … discrete” (p.
4). Fairclough used ‘power’ and ‘discourse’ as an example of concepts which are
dialectic in nature. Finally, the transdisciplinary characteristic of CDA arises from the
foundations of CT, which the Frankfurt school theorists termed interdisciplinary.
Fairclough, however, made a further distinction in that he sees even the
objects of research … [as] constructed in a transdisciplinary way on the basis of
theorizing research topics in terms of the categories and relations of not only a

67

theory of discourse … but also other relevant theories … [which] may be,
depending on the topic, political, sociological, political-economic, educational,
media and/or other theories (p. 5).
The transdisciplinary nature of CDA results in “translation” of, or connecting, the
concepts of CDA with other theories or frameworks. Fairclough used the example of
analyzing power relations in which theories and concepts from discourse theory would be
connected to concepts and theories, such as power, hegemony, ideology, and legitimacy,
from political theory (p. 6). Fairclough defined CDA as critical, with its focus on righting
wrongs “from a particular normative standpoint” (p. 7), discourse, as “a complex set of
relations including relations of communication between people … but also … describe
relations between concrete communicative events” (p. 3), and analysis as being two-fold:
interdiscursive, what particular discourses, genre and styles have been drawn upon and
“how they are articulated together” (p. 7) and linguistic or multimodal analysis.
It is within these definitions of CDA by Wodak and Meyer and, primarily,
Fairclough that this study will analyze the use of IL in LIS literature. More information
regarding this point follows a brief overview of the use of CDA in LIS.
Critical Discourse Analysis in Library and Information Science. Discourse
analysis (DA) (and CDA) has become an increasingly popular method of research in LIS.
This section provides an overview of the discussions on DA and CDA in LIS that have
the most bearing and influence on this project.
Bernd Frohman, in his work on discourse analysis as a research method in LIS, is
credited with first introducing Foucauldian (or Foucaultian) DA in LIS (Haider &

68

Bawden, 2006; Haider & Bawden, 2007; Powell, 1999). According to Frohmann, DA is a
qualitative research method “that draws from the quantitative approaches of several
disciplines” (1994, p. 119). DA examines texts that are “serious speech acts” by
“institutionally privileged speakers” (p. 119; see also Powell, 1999, p. 107).
Although Foucauldian DA has been proposed by a few authors as an appropriate
research method for LIS (Budd, 2006a; Budd & Raber, 1996; Frohmann, 1994; 2001) and
offers a great deal of potential for the study of IL, it has been relatively underused as a
method of research in the discipline within the United States. It has been gaining in
popularity as a method of inquiry in more recent years. This rise in the popularity of the
use of DA by LIS researchers has coincided with the interest of critical theorists within
the LIS scholarly community in the use of CDA.
According to Budd (2006a), there are two general branches of DA, the formalist
linguistic branch and the culturally or socially based branch, each of which would be
used to analyze written texts such as articles. However, as Martínez-Ávila, Smiraglia,
Lee, and Fox (2015) noted, there is no prescribed way of performing this method of
research. While there is no formalized process of performing Foucauldian DA, Frohmann
noted,
Three key ideas of Foucauldian discourse analysis offer useful analytical
resources for LIS: (1) the shift of theoretical attention from interpretation to the
existence of statements, sets of statements, texts, and documents; (2) the study of
overt, public, disciplined, and, in particular, institutionalized practices with
statements, sets of statements, texts, and documents; and (3) the study of how

69

specific statements, and sets of statements, achieve sufficient stability to
constitute authoritative and legitimate knowledge of persons, objects, processes,
and events. (2001, p. 16)
Within the United States, LIS scholars who have employed the use of DA or CDA have
examined a wide range of topics and applications of DA to their research. While DA and
CDA have been used by LIS scholars for a number of research questions, the articles
covered here are confined to only those studies related to IL for undergraduate education
in the United States, even if only indirectly related to IL in higher education.
Day (1998) analyzed discourse of academic LIS on transformational
organizational change in academic libraries. Thomas (2001) analyzed ALA promotional
posters using DA. Budd (2006b) examined the use of rhetoric and argument in LIS
discourse. Three separate research studies used DA to examine chat transcripts (BerndtMorris & Minnis, 2014; Koshik & Okazawa, 2014; Westbrook, 2007). Adler (2012) used
DA to examine the discursive practices of the Library of Congress, particularly in regards
to the Library of Congress subject headings, to evidence the marginalization of the
discourses of the humanities and social sciences, as well as marginalizing the general
public. Fleming-May (2014) used concept analysis from nursing scholarship as a
methodology for DA of LIS discourse on usage of library resources. James and Nahl
(2014) provided information from a DA on students’ information seeking behavior. Knox
(2014) described findings from a DA on the discourse of book challengers. MartínezÁvila, Smiraglia, Lee, and Fox (2015) discussed conceptualizations of authorship from
their DA research.

70

Application to this project. With the opportunities for describing social
phenomena as LIS scholars have advocated (Budd, 2006a; Budd & Raber, 1996;
Frohmann, 1994, 2001), CDA is an appropriate research method for examination of
definitions of IL by the participant-groups, academic librarians, LIS scholars, and the
Standards. As Powell noted, DA offers LIS opportunities to examine
such questions as the definition of information as affected by new technology;
how professional and corporate discourse constructs information so that it
becomes the object of professional expertise, administrative structures, or
corporate strategies; how information is constructed in the discourse of Melvil
Dewey; and the ways in which the identities of information users are constructed
in LIS theories (1999, p. 107).
The use of CDA offers the advantage over DA because in CDA both of the branches of
DA described by Budd (2006a), 1) the formal linguistic branch and 2) the socially based
branch are combined. Fairclough described CDA as the “analysis of dialectical relations
between discourse and other objects, elements or moments, as well as analysis of the
‘internal relations’ of discourse … [which] cuts across conventional boundaries between
disciplines (linguistics, politics, sociology, and so forth) … [and] is an interdisciplinary
form of analysis, or … a transdisciplinary form” [emphasis in original] (2013, p. 4).
Fairclough further noted that for critical discourse analysis, the focus is “on what
is wrong with a society (an institution, an organization, etc.) … [or] assesses what exists,
what might exist and what should exist” (2013, p. 7). The critique can be either positive,
which focuses on how people attempt to right societal wrongs, or negative, with a focus

71

on “how societies produce and perpetuate social wrongs” (p. 7). Ideologies, in the sense
of those societal ideals which a society uses as “ways of representing aspects of the
world.… that contribute to establishing or sustaining unequal relations of power,” (pp. 78) figure largely in CDA, and critique of those ideologies can be focused on the ways
ideologies are employed in the “service of power …. [or] on the grounds that they
represent or explain aspects of the world inadequately” (p. 8).
As the objects of study under CDA are on the ways inequities are perpetuated
throughout a society, texts form one major object of study. According to Fairclough
(2013), analysis under CDA focuses on three dimensions or aspects: texts, discourse
practice, and social practice. Within the dimension of social practice, examination in this
project is focused why the discourse practice is as it exists and what impact the discourse
practice has on the social practice in which the discourse resides by a focus on the social
matrix of discourse and orders of discourse. Within the dimension of discourse practice,
this study explores how the texts under analysis are created, disseminated, and consumed.
Fairclough’s (1992) method provides for several dimensions in which analysis of
discourse practice can be focused; in this project the dimensions of interdiscursivity and
manifest intertextuality, and intertextual chains, are examined. The first dimensions will
provide useful insight into how the profession has been influenced by and has reproduced
the ACRL’s definition of IL. Within the dimension of text analysis, this study focuses on
dimensions of modality and overwording, both of which are provided through
Fairclough’s approach. The use of modality and overwording are particularly useful to
uncovering an author’s degree or level of commitment to a concept. Although

72

Fairclough’s approach does not provide a specific dimension, the analysis also examines
the contexts of discussions of IL and the Standards, which, given the focus of this project
on locating definitions of IL and the contexts in which these participant-groups discuss
IL, examination in this area is relevant to analysis.
Further discussion and definitions of these dimensions and particular application
to this project are provided in Chapter 4. The application of CDA in this project will
focus on exploring these dimensions in the LIS discourse. One premise in this project is
that the ACRL’s definition of IL as expressed in the Standards has been a means of
norming hierarchical roles within LIS higher education, and this means of norming has
shaped the definitions of IL of ILI librarians and LIS professors in U.S. higher education
as well as provided the context in which IL has been discussed by ILI librarians and LIS
professors. For example, one pre-assumption of this research is that LIS professors and
especially librarians have drawn their IL definitions from the Standards, and librarians,
particularly, have used assessment measures of outcomes based on the Standards to
demonstrate the value of their IL programs. While these librarians demonstrate the value
of their IL programs to their institutions, they simultaneously undermine their calls for
increased inclusion in academic programs. With the demonstrated value of one-shot 50
minute sessions, there is little incentive for the host institutions to expand IL programs
beyond that format.
This project should offer several insights on the LIS discourse surrounding IL in
the United States. In addition to the numerous discussions over definitions of IL, it is
anticipated that this project will bring additional insight into how those definitions have

73

been shaped by the ideologies present in the Standards. Although other researchers have
critically examined the LIS discourse on a number of topics including IL, this is the first
that compares the discourse from the roles of the LIS professors and librarians, and offers
a look at the ways the Standards have normed the discourse and the ways the discourse of
these two participant groups has reproduced this norming.
Data Collection and Method of Text Selection
The goal of this study is to examine and compare the definitions of IL by the three
participant-groups in the discourse, the ACRL, LIS academe (professors and scholars),
and academic ILI librarians. This section provides an explanation of the selection of texts
used in this analysis. At the top level, the ACRL, a subdivision of the ALA, publishes
various LIS policy statements. The primary document used in this analysis is the ACRL’s
Standards, mainly due to its long-standing influence on the IL movement within the
United States undergraduate education in LIS since its adoption in 2000. The Standards
represents the ACRL’s earlier conception of IL and the specific skills the ACRL deemed
necessary for IL during the time period most of the articles under analysis in this project
were written and published. The second document used is the ACRL’s Framework which
is the publication of the ACRL’s current thought on IL, from which a few documents
under analysis drew upon for IL definitions.
At the next tier, LIS academe, professors and scholars, also create a wide variety
of documents within the discourse on IL, as do academic ILI librarians, at the final level.
The texts selected for this project were peer-reviewed research articles and one
theoretical article written by LIS academe and ILI librarians. While many of the

74

documents created by LIS academe and ILI librarians could reflect the conceptualizations
of IL of these two participant-groups, published articles reflect these participant-groups’
perceptions of IL as they engage in the discourse with the LIS community. Although blog
postings and books authored by LIS academe and ILI librarians would also offer insights
into their publicized perceptions of IL, these formats were omitted, as explained in the
next section. The Standards and published articles written by LIS academe and ILI reflect
their intent to persuade the other groups to accept their definitions of IL and include the
rhetoric each has used to convince the other groups, and the ACRL’s documents and the
published literature will shape future discourse within LIS about IL. At issue is whether
these definitions of IL and ILI are in agreement or if differences in definitions of IL exist
within these three groups. Because this research is about how IL is defined by these three
groups and the implications for the profession and for undergraduate education,
examination of the discourse enacted in the social setting of the LIS literature is relevant
to understanding the influence of these participant-groups on their professional praxis and
on students’ education.
As described previously, Frohmann (2001) defined the three main ideas of
Foucauldian CDA as texts, institutional practice through discourse, and how particular
discourse is imbued with authority. CDA investigates social phenomena from an
analytical position. As cited above, Wodak and Meyer noted, regarding CDA, “Any
social phenomenon lends itself to critical investigation, to be challenged and not taken for
granted” (2010, p. 2). What distinguishes CDA from other forms of DA is the researcher

75

takes a particular issue or social occurrence to examine from a critical perspective.
Foucauldian DA focuses on four questions:


What is valid knowledge at a certain place and a certain time?



How does this knowledge arise and how is it passed on?



What functions does it have for constituting subjects?



What consequences does it have for the overall shaping and development
of society? (Jäger & Maier, in Wodak & Meyer, 2010, p. 34)

These questions form the basis of the analysis of the texts in this project.
The issue under examination in this study is the IL movement within higher
education within the LIS community in the United States. In particular, this study
examines how the ACRL’s definition of IL has been interpreted by LIS academe and ILI
librarians by examination of published articles written by LIS academe and ILI librarians.
One premise is that the ACRL’s definition of IL as expressed in the Standards has been a
means of norming hierarchical roles within LIS higher education. Thus, this project
examines the Standards and published research written by LIS academe and ILI
librarians using CDA to illustrate this phenomenon.
Rationale and Explanation of Texts and Methods of Analysis
The original intention at the beginning of this study was to examine a variety of
texts, including books, journal articles, syllabi, and blogs, because of this researcher’s
belief that examining such a broad spectrum of items would enable a more accurate
determination of variances in the use and definitions of IL by academic librarians, LIS
scholars, and the ACRL. However, because of both the immensity of the project and the
76

many obstacles to obtaining many of the formats desired, the decision was made to base
the project on an analysis of published research articles.
The first step was a search of library and information science and education
databases for articles on information literacy in U.S. undergraduate education. Limiting
to research articles published since 2000 resulted in over 2,300 articles as candidates for
analysis. The next step was to sort these articles into categories of authorship: written by
academic librarians, written by LIS professors, co-authored by academic librarians and
LIS professors, and co-authored with professors of other disciplines. The information
provided on most of the articles was used to determine the role within LIS that authors
filled, supplemented by Google searches of institutions listed on by-lines with author
information, when necessary. Because the number of articles was still too numerous for
the detailed analysis of Fairclough’s approach to CDA, a method of selecting a smaller
number texts recommended by Fairclough was used.
The focus of CDA on discourse is, according to Fairclough, “especially relevant
to detailed analysis of a small number of discourse samples” (1992, p. 230). Fairclough
(1992) proposed one selection strategy as the use of cruces or moments of crises in a
large corpus. He defined these moments of crises as “moments in the discourse where
there is evidence that things are going wrong” (p. 192). For the U.S. IL movement in
higher education, two separate years stand out as such moments. In July 2011, the ACRL
Information Literacy Competency Standards Review Task Force convened to work on
revision of the Standards, and in January 2015, the new Framework was filed by the
ACRL. As the Standards had been for many in higher education the “de facto definition”

77

(Bell, 2013, para. 1) of IL, these two years can be viewed as moments of crisis within the
discipline. Because the Task Force did not convene until mid-2011, viewing items
published throughout this year can also offer the advantage of the perspective of the
discourse of librarians and academe prior to the engagement of LIS professionals into
discussions of what revisions should be made to the Standards.
Limiting to the years of 2011 and 2015 narrowed the number of articles to 322.
The documents were imported into the qualitative software application, NVIVO, which
was used to code the text of documents in order to determine the number of occurrences
of IL in the articles. Any articles that were tagged with the key phrase, information
literacy, but did not contain the phrase in the text of the article were then eliminated. Also
eliminated were articles that discussed IL or ILI in contexts other than first-year students.
As a result, the sample size contained 57 articles: three written by LIS professors, 45
written by librarians, one article co-authored by librarians, LIS professors, and other
disciplinary professors, seven co-written by librarians and other disciplinary professors,
and one article written by two professors outside of LIS. Table 1 shows the breakdown of
articles in authorship role and year. (See Appendix A for the list of articles used.)

Coding for phrases allowed focus to be placed first on the broad themes of the
articles. After this initial phase of coding, next began the process of more granular coding
by closely reading each article and coding for other themes that were present. (See
Appendix C for the second listing of phrases.) These themes provided insights into the
actual usage of IL by the various authors.
81

Conclusion
Although a relatively unused research method, CDA affords the opportunity to
examine the discourse of academic librarians, LIS scholars, and the Standards. The
application of Bourdieu’s habitus to CT and the use of CDA as a method allows
distillation and provides a framework to describe the differences in definitions of the
participant-groups. Not only should this approach offer insights into the LIS discourse on
IL in higher education, but should also help build the burgeoning trend of discourse
studies in the discipline.

CHAPTER 4: DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

Introduction
Examining the articles in comparison with the Standards and Framework using
CDA allows both a broad view of the social practices of the discipline and a focused view
of each participant-groups’ perspectives of IL, their self-identities, and how the social
practices and norms are re-enacted. The following provides an overview of the data
collection and selection methods used in this analysis.
Findings
There are many methodological elements to CDA, dependent upon the
researcher’s perspective and theoretical framing (Fairclough, 2007; Wodak & Meyer,
2010). This project drew from Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework approach to
CDA, which is a method of analysis that examines three aspects of discourse: analysis of
discourse practices, analysis of texts, and analysis of the social practice in which the
discourse resides (2013, also 1992). Although there is no prescribed linear path to this
approach, and indeed it is an iterative process, in the following description of this project
for the sake of simplicity and comprehension, each aspect in each of these three areas is
discussed in a linear fashion moving from the macro level and moving to the micro level
where appropriate, rather than the cyclical process followed in the analysis. As
Fairclough noted, “in any particular analysis some of the categories are likely to be more
relevant and useful than others, and analysts are likely to want to focus upon a small

83

number of them” (1992, pp. 231-232). Thus, the following description of findings also
includes the categories that were most relevant to this project.
Analysis of the social practice. In this dimension of CDA - analysis of the social
practice - the researcher examines why the discourse practice is as it exists linguistically
and socially and what impact the discourse practice has on the social practice in which
the discourse resides. Fairclough provides no checklist of questions for this dimension of
analysis. This analysis concentrates on the social matrix of discourse and orders of
discourse.
Social matrix of discourse. Within this area, the researcher identifies the
dominant social relationships and structures within the discourse practice in which the
texts under analysis reside, in order to identify both how the analysis texts are placed in
the discourse practice and whether the analysis texts conform and reproduce, or transform
the social practice (Fairclough, 1992, p. 237). In this project, analysis in this dimension
was on the relational and impact aspects of Fairclough’s (1992) CDA. In terms of
relational aspects, all but three of the articles participated in the discourse in ways that are
normative and reproduce existing social practices of reenacting and reinforcing
conceptions of IL aligned with the ACRL’s official IL policy documents, the Standards
and the Framework. Of the remaining three articles, arguably the text authored by
Townsend, Brunetti, and Hofer (2011) also presented views in line with the ACRL, as
Townsend was a member of the Task Force.
The article by Mark (2011) stood in opposition to the traditional view of the
privilege of peer-review in higher education as a signal of the quality of information

84

contained in information sources. However, Mark continued to reinforce the ACRL view
of IL as foundational for critical thinking and lifelong learning (2011, p. 7). Thus, in the
context of IL, Mark’s article also reproduced the ACRL’s perspectives on IL.
The final article of the three was written by Critten (2015). Critten presented the
view that the Framework does not adequately address the concept of critical selfreflection or “understanding the social, political, and cultural forces that shape and filter
information is a means of empowerment” (p. 146). While she critiqued the Framework in
these areas, Critten appeared to support the use of the Framework in her conclusion:
If educators wish for students to meaningfully internalize the concepts outlined in
the Framework, those contexts and concepts of research should be the focus of
instruction rather than a side note in an instruction session focused on the tools
and mechanics of research (Critten, 2015, p. 155).
Therefore, this analysis concluded that Critten, as with all the texts in this analysis, also
reproduced the ACRL perspective of IL.
Analysis of discourse practice. In this area of analysis, the researcher seeks to
identify how the texts under analysis are created, disseminated, and consumed.
Fairclough (1992) noted these dimensions in which analysis of discourse practice can be
focused; interdiscursivity and manifest intertextuality, and intertextual chains.
Interdiscursivity. In Fairclough’s approach, examining the interdiscursivity of a
discourse practice is accomplished by identifying the discourse types which were drawn
upon in the texts under analysis and describing how those discourse types were drawn
upon. Fairclough identified the following example questions in which to examine

85

interdiscursivity:
Is there an obvious way of characterizing the sample overall (in terms of
genre)? (if so, what does it imply in terms of how the sample is produced,
distributed, and consumed?)
Does the sample draw upon more than one genre?
What activity type(s), style(s), discourse(s) are drawn upon? (Can you
specify styles according to tenor, mode, and rhetorical mode?)
Is the discourse sample relatively conventional in its interdiscursive
properties, or relatively innovative? (1992, p. 232)
The most obvious way of describing the texts under analysis is that of scholarly
discourse. All of the texts were articles published in LIS journals, and all but three
underwent the peer-review process typical of this genre. The mode of the articles is
written. Intended for other professionals within LIS, the tenor is predominantly formal,
with one article taking a somewhat more conversational tone. The rhetorical mode of
these texts varies depending upon article type; the studies and case studies were
predominantly descriptive and the theoretical article was expository and at times
argumentative. (See Appendix F for article types and style elements.) Within the texts,
however, authors often shifted in the use of rhetorical mode. For example, studies and
case studies generally have several sections including introduction, literature review,
methodology, theoretical framework, methods, findings, and conclusion. While the case
studies and studies took a descriptive rhetorical mode in the literature reviews, methods,
and findings sections, the introductions and conclusions were more often rhetorical or

86

persuasive, with theoretical framework sections most often expository. The sample texts,
without exception, conform to the scholarly genre within its interdiscursive
characteristics.
Manifest Intertextuality. Fairclough described manifest intertextuality as the
“grey area between discourse practice and text” (1992, p. 233). He noted that within this
aspect of analysis the researcher looks to determine what other texts have been derived
from, and he proposed examining discourse representation and presuppositions within the
texts as means to establish what other texts have been drawn upon.
The discourse most often drawn upon in the texts under analysis is that of the
Standards. Approximately half of the texts directly referenced the Standards. Fairly early
into analysis of the articles, it was clear that most of the articles, including both those
written by academic librarians and LIS academe, drew their definitions either directly or
indirectly from the Standards. Indeed, out of the 45 articles authored by librarians, 22
articles referenced the Standards – ten of the 16 articles authored by librarians in 2011
cited the Standards. Of the 29 articles published in 2015, 12 mentioned the Standards,
with four of these 2015 articles discussing both the Standards and the Framework. Two
of the three articles, one from each year, authored by LIS professors referred to the
Standards. Of the remaining nine texts, five also mentioned the Standards. Of the 2015
articles, a much smaller percentage referenced the Framework, only a total of four
librarian-authored articles out of the total 38 articles published in 2015. Given that the
ACRL filed the Framework in February 2015, this may not seem surprising, but with
drafts of the Framework released periodically after the convening of the Task Force in

87

mid-2011, it is interesting to note that 18 of the 2015 articles referred to the Standards.
(See Appendix C for article references to the Standards and Framework.) The 2015
article written by outside disciplinary professors was actually a reprint of a 2003 article,
in which the Standards were referenced. Although originally this article was retained as it
might have been revised or updated in the second publication, it was eventually removed
because there were no changes made in the second printing. Table 4 shows the references
to the Standards and Framework in 2015 published articles by all authorship categories
other than librarian only authored articles.

Other obvious discourses drawn upon within all of the texts are direct quotes,
paraphrases, and summaries of previous scholarly discourse. All of the texts contain some
form of a literature review. While the studies, overviews, and case studies contain a
special section for a literature review, the theoretical article drew upon previous scholarly
89

discourse throughout its entirety. That all these texts drew upon the ACRL documents
and previous literature is not surprising as this is conventional for the scholarly genre.
Another item of interest within the aspect of manifest intertextuality is the
discussion of threshold concepts by Townsend, Brunetti, and Hofer, published in 2011.
They proposed a shift of the conceptualization of IL from a skills-based pedagogical
approach to that of a theoretical construct based on such threshold concepts as format as
process, authority as constructed and contextual, information as commodity, primary
sources and disciplinarity, and library as part of the research process. Many of these
concepts can be traced to the later Framework threshold concepts, of no surprise as
Townsend, a data librarian, served as a member of the Task Force, and this article is one
cited in the Framework as a text drawn upon in the creation of the document.
Presuppositions were defined by Fairclough as constructs which the author
presents as established fact (1992, p. 120). In this examination, at least one of three
presuppositions was present in all but 12 of the texts: definition of IL, importance of IL
skills, or importance of lifelong learning. In 35 articles, the authors did not provide any
discussion or evidence for the importance of IL. Twenty-seven articles did not define IL,
and seven merely referred to lifelong learning, without providing evidence or discussion
regarding the significance of this construct. For example, the excerpts below show how
authors drew upon these constructs to support teaching IL with claims of IL supporting
lifelong learning (underlined in excerpts below for clarity). Appendix E displays the
occurrences of these presuppositions in the articles analyzed.

90

The 1989 ALA Presidential Committee on Information Literacy defines
information literacy as the ability “to effectively locate, evaluate, and use
information”. Information literacy instruction is the process of teaching students
how to develop cognitive skills for use in their college studies and throughout
their lives. It is the latest incarnation in the evolution of library education and
differs from bibliographic instruction because it focuses on evaluation skills
instead of the mechanics of retrieving information in a library environment.
(Gustavson, Whitehurst, & Hisle, 2011, p. 726) [Librarian authors]
If librarians and other teaching faculty change their approach of
privileging peer review to a student-centered approach and include student views,
information literacy will become more relevant to students, leading them more
willingly to critical thinking skills and life-long learning. (Mark, 2011, p. 7)
[Librarian author]
… One of the mission statements of Orientation Services is “preparing
students for lifelong learning”, with the goal of “connecting students to valuable
support resources”. This coincides with the University Library’s mission of
“responding to the need of all members of the University community to be library
and information literate.” (Cal Poly Pomona, “Mission, vision and values”, 2015,
as cited by Hottinger, Zagami-Lopez, & Bryndzia, 2015, p. 469) [Librarian
authors]
The attainment of information literacy skills continues to be emphasized
as critical to support academic achievement, lifelong learning, and to prepare

91

students for the workplace. Information literacy is seen as vitally important, but
investigations show that many students enter college without these skills. (Gross
& Latham, 2011, pp. 161-162) [LIS professors]
Information literacy (IL) is a critical 21st century skill which empowers
students to think critically when locating, evaluating and using online information
sources. While these skills are universally seen as crucial to student success in
academics and professional life, as well as forming the basis for lifelong learning,
research repeatedly shows that many of today’s university students enter the
university without having received any IL training. (Markey, Leeder, & St. Jean,
2011, pp. 46-47) [LIS professors]
Intertextual chains. Within the dimension of intertextual chains, the analyst
identifies the distribution of the text under analysis and describes “the series of text types
it is transformed into or out of” (Fairclough, 1992, p. 232). One aspect within
Fairclough’s approach in examination of this dimension is to consider the type of
audience expected, as well as to look for indications that more than one type of audience
is expected (p. 233).
In the texts analyzed, the general target audience is the community of LIS
professionals within higher education. All of the texts were published in LIS academic
journals. Within the target audience, LIS academe and academic librarians in higher
education are two main subgroups. These authors expected their audience to be
conversant with library jargon and especially interested and active in IL and ILI. In
addition, it is expected that the authors anticipated various discourses to draw upon their

92

work, including influencing the instruction of others in LIS and potentially influencing
future national organizational policy statements (e.g., future iterations of the Framework)
or local institutional and/or state IL policies.
Analysis of texts. The next step in the project was an in-depth analysis of each of
the texts. Fairclough’s approach provides a number of dimensions in which to examine
texts. In analysis of the texts, focus is on the dimensions of modality and overwording.
Within analysis of the texts, attention was also directed to examination of the contexts of
discussions of IL and the Standards. While Fairclough’s approach to CDA does not
provide a specific dimension for this aspect, given this study’s focus on locating
definitions of IL and the contexts in which these participant-groups discuss IL,
examination in this area is relevant to the textual analysis.
Modality. Fairclough (1992) defined modality as a way to determine the degree to
which the author or authors of a text align themselves to or disassociate themselves from
concepts under discussion in their text. Fairclough’s method of examining modality, or
the author’s degree of affinity to a concept, is to look at the texts for the use of modal
auxiliary verbs, such as would, will, could, can, may, etc., as well as tense of verbs. This
project focused on the use of modal auxiliary verbs by a search of each text for the
authors’ use of this grammatical element. (See Appendix G for number of occurrences of
modal auxiliary verbs.) Tables 6, 7, and 8 list some examples of parts of speech
indicating modality examined in this analysis of the texts.

After locating the uses of modal auxiliary verbs for each article, attention was
directed to the use of the pure modal auxiliary verb “must.” With the use of must, authors
were signifying their perceptions of the importance of the concept under discussion. The
use of must by the authors adds a feeling of gravity and significance. In the following
excerpts, with the use of must (underlined for clarity here in the excerpts below), these
authors indicated their advocacy for collaboration with faculty to teach IL skills.
… If searching for information becomes an end rather than a means,
students are likely to lose interest in and motivation to discover more about the
subject. To minimize this outcome, the librarian and faculty member must
collaborate to help students see that when they are doing research, they should not
be exclusively focused on hunting for information, but rather they should
conceive of the research process as way to contextualize and organize meaning.
(Paterson & Gamtso, 2011, p. 120) [Co-authored by librarian and outside
professor]
As assessment of student learning outcomes continues to be a growing
focus for institutions of higher education, librarians will be integral to the
assessment of information literacy among college students. To be successful, the
literature shows, librarians must build strong collaborative relationships among
teaching faculty and university administrators, and be active participants in design
and assessment of learning goals, outcomes, and curriculum. (Luetkenhaus,
Borrelli, Johnson, 2015, p. 51) [Librarian authors]

97

… Librarians must answer Norgaard’s call and work to place the
information literacy of the library into praxis with writing-intensive ﬁrst-year
seminars, thereby moving ahead the discussion, and building upon research paper,
information literacy and ﬁrst-year writing legacy studies and scholarship. Unless
librarians heed this call, they and information literacy will continue to be
marginalized. By examining student research and resources, we hope to change
this paradigm and move the conversation forward on our campus. (Ludovico &
Wittig, 2015, p. 37) [Librarian authors]
In the following excerpt, the author both opposed the prominence of peer-review
journals in ILI, and also advocated librarians take on an expanded role in education.
Librarians must stop teaching purely within the academic frame and
instead assist students in their intellectual growth and understanding though [sic]
critical practice that more resembles a journey with the student. From a critical
pedagogical approach, information literacy librarians should recognize that
students have their own experiences with information, even if it is not valued in
the scholarly world. In order to assist students in achieving information literacy
skills, librarians should understand student perceptions of information. (Mark,
2011, p. 7) [Librarian author]
As these examples demonstrate, librarians see their role as integral to ILI, but also
acknowledge the limitations of their current role in higher education. These examples
also demonstrate the importance librarians have assigned IL. Students are positioned as in
need of the assistance that librarians are uniquely qualified and situated to fill.

98

Overwording. According to Fairclough, overwording, defined as the number of
different wordings in a discourse domain, indicates a preoccupation that points to ways a
group conceptualizes a particular idea (1992, p. 193). In this dimension, examination
looked at the various terms also used for IL and ILI, including bibliographic instruction,
library instruction, research skills, library skills, critical thinking, and threshold concepts.
Analysis did not find any significant differences in how librarians or LIS professors refer
to IL or ILI (see Appendix B).
Information literacy definitions and context of discussion of information
literacy. In the analysis of IL definitions, the focus was on two questions: 1) what
definition(s) of IL are present within the articles, and 2) to whom definitions are
attributed. A total of 22 articles out of the 57 texts analyzed either cited or drew from the
definition of IL from the Standards or the definition from the ALA’s 1989 Final Report,
which the Standards used as the definition of IL. However, while one of these, a 2011
article written by librarians, quoted the Final Report definition, the context of this article
was threshold concepts. No definition of IL was provided in 30 articles, but three of these
drew from the Standards. The Framework was used in five articles, all published by
librarians in 2015. (See Appendix F.)
The analysis of the contexts in which IL was discussed in the texts focused on
comparing the overall themes of LIS professor-authored articles with librarian-authored
or co-authored articles (see Appendix F). This study’s examination also drew from
analysis of modality and overwording (see sections above) to base findings. In this area,
findings showed, not surprisingly, that while librarians and LIS professors may have

99

discussed the same Standards, the approach to those discussions differed, although the
distinction was subtle at times. For example, several articles written by librarians and one
by LIS professors examined IL games. In many of these articles on IL games, librarians
focused on assessment of students’ learning, how to incorporate IL games into one-shot
sessions, and how IL games can increase students’ engagement and motivation in ILI.
While the professor-authored article discussed these topics, the articles authored by
librarians tended to focus more on implications for their pedagogical practice, while the
professor-authored article focused more on implications for future development of
games. In addition, as the discussion of the analysis will show, predominant themes of IL
and political ideologies as well as preoccupations with the importance of IL, and the
importance and status of librarians and libraries, emerged. These themes were included as
each theme serves to demonstrate the context and influences upon the participant groups’
IL definitions.
At this point, another analysis of the texts was performed with a more expanded
category of modality. Fairclough’s approach allows for an expansion in this category
(2003, p. 170). In the reanalysis, the texts were examined for direct or indirect indications
of ideologies. The following provides highlights of the analysis of IL definitions, with a
focus on the context in which IL and ILI is discussed. This discussion is provided within
each of the categories of authorship, and then within the category of IL definition under
Addison’s and Meyers’ framework of IL definitions. The term “outside professors” refers
to professors of disciplines other than LIS. It should also be noted that while each of
Fairclough’s dimensions of modality and ideologies were found within these texts, the

100

excerpts used here are drawn mostly from the introductions and conclusions of the
articles as these areas within the texts provided the most frequent and direct occurrences
of the dimensions. Because introductions of texts within this genre typically set the tone
for the article and conclusions sum up findings in conjunction with authors’ commentary,
the richest examples of Fairclough’s dimensions often occurred within these sections of
the texts. The following presents an overview of the findings of texts in each authorship
and IL definitional category, with discussion of the results in Chapter 5. At this point, one
category, the article authored by outside professors, was eliminated from this analysis
because it was a reprint of an article published in 2003. The article was reprinted with no
explanation or indication that it was a reprint or why it was reprinted.
Library and Information Science professors. My analysis of articles written by
LIS professors was limited to a total of three articles; two published in 2011 and the other
in 2015. This analysis of the definitions of IL espoused as presented in the articles
revealed that only one of Addison’s and Meyers’ framework of categories of IL
definitions was represented by one of the articles. As discussed in the previous chapter,
Addison and Meyers presented three conceptualizations of IL within LIS; IL as skills, IL
as a way of thinking, and IL as a sociocultural practice. Each of the three LIS professorauthored articles analyzed fit within the IL as a way of thinking definition. In each of the
excerpts below, bold font has been added to all modalizations considered in the analysis.
The items considered within the dimension of modality includes modalized verbs (see
Appendix G), adverbs, phrases, and modalized clauses (see Fairclough, 2003, p. 170).

101

The first article examined in this category was the study authored by Gross and
Latham (2011) which examined first year students’ experiences with and perceptions of
information. The study’s focus on students’ perceptions of information was the aspect
used to place these authors’ definition of IL in the category of IL as a way of thinking.
The analysis found that the authors placed a significant importance on IL as noted by the
opening paragraph. In the excerpt below, bold font has been added to indicate modality,
and phrases have been underlined to indicate ideologies. The use of both these
dimensions underscore the authors’ level of commitment to IL:
The attainment of information literacy skills continues to be emphasized as
critical to support academic achievement, lifelong learning, and to prepare
students for the workplace. Information literacy is seen as vitally important, but
investigations show that many students enter college without these skills. (Gross
& Latham, 2011, p. 161)
According to Fairclough, levels of commitment can be discerned in the use of epistemic
(truth) and deontic (obligation) clauses and modal adverbs. The examination of modality
from adverbs and verbs was expanded to other phrases and clauses, based on
Fairclough’s argument that “it is possible to take a very inclusive view as what may mark
modalization” (2003, p. 170). In this excerpt, the modalizations are bolded and the truth
claims or indications of ideology present in the statements are underlined. Further
examples of modalization and inculcation of ideologies, whether direct or implicit, can be
seen in the following excerpt:

102

The importance of achieving competence in information literacy is an area of
great concern in higher education in the United States. Increasingly, this is
evidenced by the inclusion of information literacy in the college and university
accreditation process. Given the emphasis on achieving competence in
information literacy, it seems logical to investigate students’ own perceptions of
their competence levels. Studies of people without competent information literacy
skills have revealed a phenomenon in which individuals who lack skills in a
domain tend to believe, contrary to negative feedback, that they have the ability
to perform at an above-average level. (Gross & Latham, 2011, p. 164)
According to Fairclough, what is not said can also reveal insight into a text. In the
above excerpt, the premise of IL being of great importance to higher education is
substantiated by its inclusion in accrediting processes, but no mention of why it has been
included in accreditation is indicated. The focus in the Standards on the importance of IL
to lifelong learning is seen in the second paragraph of the Standards: “Information
literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning. It is common to all disciplines, to all
learning environments, and to all levels of education” (American Library Association,
2006, p. 2). The Standards were built from the ALA’s Final Report, which noted the
significance of IL to democracy, one of the ideologies looked for in the texts:
To say that information literacy is crucial to effective citizenship is simply
to say it is central to the practice of democracy. Any society committed to
individual freedom and democratic government must ensure the free flow of
information to all its citizens in order to protect personal liberties and to guard its

103

future. As U.S. Representative Major R. Owens has said: Information literacy is
needed to guarantee the survival of democratic institutions. All men are created
equal but voters with information resources are in a position to make more
intelligent decisions than citizens who are information illiterates. The application
of information resources to the process of decision-making to fulfill civic
responsibilities is a vital necessity. (American Library Association, 1989, para.
15)
Thus, the societal ideology of IL as necessary for participation in a democratic society is
overtly stated.
In the analysis of the second 2011 LIS professors-authored article, by Markey,
Leeder, and St. Jean, the findings were similar. The authors’ definition of IL also fit
within the definition of IL as a way of thinking given the PBL aspect of the IL game they
discussed. Markey, Leeder, and St Jean positioned their discussion of IL within the
findings of their study of undergraduates’ IL game play. Their opening paragraph is also
replete with ideology:
Information literacy (IL) is a critical 21st century skill which empowers
students to think critically when locating, evaluating and using online information
sources. While these skills are universally seen as crucial to student success in
academics and professional life, as well as forming the basis for lifelong learning,
research repeatedly shows that many of today’s university students enter the
university without having received any IL training. Academic IL programs have
ambitious goals; however, only a minority of institutions feature first-year

104

experience programs where information literacy content is mandatory. Although
faculty delegate teaching students information literacy skills to librarians, faculty
are primarily concerned with disciplinary coverage, and are therefore reluctant
to cede valuable in-class time to librarians. Students are intent on reaping the
rewards faculty and library staff give them for mastering the core concepts of the
academic disciplines and focus on their coursework rather than on information
literacy skills and concepts. Librarians fight an uphill battle, trying to reach as
many students as they can through a wide range of venues such as workshops,
short courses, virtual reference assistance, web-based instruction pages, and walkin assistance at information desks. (Markey, Leeder, & St. Jean, 2011, pp. 46-47)
As the bolded modalizations above show, these LIS professors position IL as
critical, crucial, and lacking. Another revelation from this excerpt, shows that although
some attention is devoted to the plight of students’ lacking IL skills, the librarians are
positioned as the primary victims, struggling to reach students and seizing and creating
any opportunity they can.
One answer these authors proposed was IL games. In the excerpt below, the
authors discussed an IL game BiblioBouts which taught students IL skills such as citation
creation as evaluation of sources.
Along with the IL content and activities that are the core of BiblioBouts, students
also benefit from gaining experience in 21st century skills such as collaboration,
communication, networking, and peer feedback. Reviewing the work of other
players is a crucial element of the game, as students become members of a

105

learning community through practicing their critical evaluation skills both on
their own sources and on those of their classmates, and through exposure to a
broader array of research sources on their topic than they might have found on
their own. Through assessing their own ratings, tags and comments as well as
those of other players, students practice giving constructive feedback as well as
receiving it. While playing BiblioBouts, students take on the role of a researcher
by practicing the skills and habits of expert researchers. These new techniques
and strategies will help students both in their college and professional careers.
(Markey, Leeder, & St. Jean, 2011, p. 50)
Here the ideology of IL as the solution for college and professional life in the 21st
century is placed in the foreground, while the actual IL skills supported by game play are
not named within the text of this paragraph.
The third article analyzed within this category was a study published in 2015 by
Kim and Shumaker, which explored the perceptions of students, faculty, and librarians of
ILI in a first-year experience (FYE) program. The definition of IL discussed within this
article similarly fit within the IL as a way of thinking category. Again, the authors’
opening paragraph contained the ideology of IL, although it was moderate in tone
compared to the previous two articles analyzed.
In recent years, many institutions of higher learning have created “first year
experience” (FYE) programs. These programs are specifically designed to create
an engaging learning experience for students, and to improve both student
academic success and retention. As these programs have grown, academic

106

librarians have found them to be hospitable forums for information literacy
instruction. Information literacy, or its siblings information fluency and critical
thinking, are widely agreed to be essential for students’ success in undergraduate
programs and beyond. Librarians have thus delivered instruction in information
skills in the context of FYE programs using a variety of methods and approaches.
(Kim & Shumaker, 2015, p. 449)
In addition to the inclusion of the IL ideology and implied ideology of democracy in the
above excerpt, IL and librarians were positioned by these authors as the primary foci of
discussion, with students positioned secondary to institutions of higher learning, FYE
programs, IL and librarians. Later in the article, librarians again play a leading role:
At the same time that higher education has increased its attention to FYE
programs, another trend has been the increased emphasis among librarians on
their teaching role. As instructors, librarians take responsibility for educational
objectives that are closely related to the objectives of FYE programs. Librarians
foster knowledge of the institution’s library resources and how to use them,
which is related to the broader goal of orientation to campus resources and
services. They teach information literacy skills, which are inextricably bound up
with the development of academic skills and critical thinking skills. Thus it
stands to reason that many librarians have sought out, and been encouraged
to participate in, opportunities to teach various aspects of library use,
bibliography, and information literacy, in the context of FYE courses. (Kim &
Shumaker, 2015, p. 450)

107

In the conclusion, the authors further emphasized the role of librarians and the
centrality of IL:
Second, librarians and instructors must communicate and collaborate to
effectively integrate information literacy instruction into courses. The survey
results show that instructors, as well as librarians, see themselves as having a role
in information literacy instruction. If the two groups fail to engage with each
other, the results are likely to be some combination of unnecessary duplication,
gaps in coverage, the librarian being seen as having nothing unique to add, and
even librarians being marginalized or left out entirely …
The fourth and final conclusion is that this study offers further support for
other research that shows a positive relationship2 between information literacy
skills and academic performance. Here, student grades on assignments and
student self-assessments of information literacy skills were significantly3
correlated. This study recommends that continued assessment of this relationship
be done, and shared with incoming students, as a further method to impress upon
them that information literacy truly is a critical 21st-century skill that is
essential to their success. (Kim & Shumaker, 2015, p. 456)
Librarians, Library and Information Science professors, and outside professors.
Only one article co-authored by librarians, LIS professors, and outside professors was
analyzed. The study reported by Douglas, Van Epps, Mihalec-Adkins, Fosmire, and
Purzer (2015) compared beginning and advanced engineering students’ descriptions of IL
skills, and their definition of IL falls within IL-as-a-way-of-thinking. The following

108

excerpt shows this article confirms the pattern of the opening text containing ideologies:
With the vast amount of information readily available to current students on the
open web and through library resources, the skillset necessary to navigate
through information and use it appropriately is arguably one of the most
important factors for educational success. All students, both undergraduate
and graduate, need to possess information literacy skills to manage the rapidly
changing technological environment. In particular, future and current
engineers are challenged to be adept at information literacy as rapid research
and technological advances in their fields generate new and changing
information that directly impacts their daily work. Throughout their careers,
engineers must stay current within their field and incorporate new information to
inform their own professional development. Innovation and future technology
are, at least in part, influenced by information literacy skills. (Douglas, Van
Epps, Mihalec-Adkins, Fosmire, & Purzer, 2015, p. 128)
Here IL ideology is evidenced through the imagery of a view of IL being the solution to
students combating information overload and the necessity of IL for a successful career.
The third paragraph continues the authors’ attention to the IL ideology of lifelong
learning:
Information literacy skills are an important part of undergraduate and graduate
education. For example, the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL) standards state an information literate person should be able to
effectively search for, identify, evaluate, use, and document information. In

109

addition, the document Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, created
by the body which accredits engineering programs, ABET (Accreditation Board
for Engineering and Technology), includes a requirement that students
demonstrate life-long learning skills. As we prepare future engineers, it is
necessary to cultivate habits of information literacy that will serve as the
prerequisites for life-long learning. According to a 2006 report, 91% of
responding engineering employers rated life-long learning as either essential,
highly important, or moderately important. Yet, Lattuca and colleagues note
that in the years since this criterion was originally released, growth in preparing
engineering students in life-long learning skills has been relatively stagnant.
(Douglas, Van Epps, Mihalec-Adkins, Fosmire, & Purzer, 2015, p. 129)
Life-long learning is the focus within the context of the field of engineering, which adds
to the strength of the premise, further legitimating the claim.
Librarians and outside professors. A total of seven articles were analyzed with
this category of articles authored by librarians and outside professors. Four of the articles
were published in 2011 and the other three were published in 2015. The following section
discusses highlights of the analysis of these articles, discussing first the articles which fit
within Addison’s and Meyers’ IL definition of IL as skills.
Although the study reported upon by Ferrer-Vinent and Carello (2011) explored
perceptions of students, because the focus of the research was on students retaining IL
skills, this article fit best within the IL as skills definition. The article reported on the
findings of a study of first-year biology students who had embedded ILI within a general

110

biology class. As with the other texts, the analysis found attention devoted to establishing
the importance of IL:
The National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) (2008) recently issued
guidelines for evaluating undergraduate programs in biology. As part of those
evaluation criteria requirements for biology curriculums, NABT states the need
for students to learn how to do library research. The importance of information
literacy for science and engineering students is also recognized by the Science and
Technology Section (STS) Task Force on Information Literacy for Science and
Technology, Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), and
American Library Association (American Library Association) (2006). In
addition, the National Research Council (2003) report of proposals to improve
undergraduate training of future researchers in biology underscores the value of
learning library research skills. Logically, an ideal time to initiate good research
skills is early in a career. First-year biology students need to begin learning how
to find and evaluate information so they can adequately utilize it when
researching topics of interest in their biology courses. They should expand their
initial skills throughout later courses. These lifelong library research skills help
students through undergraduate and graduate programs and in their professional
careers. (Ferrer-Vinent & Carello, 2011, pp. 254-255)
The excerpt above also shows the conflation of the ideology of lifelong learning with the
library in the phrase “lifelong library research skills.” This phrasing positions library
research skills as IL skills, and signifies the authors’ definition of IL is primarily the

111

research conducted in library holdings. While relatively moderate in tone in their opening
paragraph, these authors conclude with stronger language:
Developing strong library research skills is a necessary component to becoming
a good scientist. However, most academic programs do not have first-year,
discipline-specific training in these research skills with the requirement of using
those skills over the course of a semester. We have shown that an embedded
library instruction program with weekly reinforcement of skills resulted in
students who take a more scholarly approach to their studies in both advanced
biology courses and nonbiology courses. Upperlevel students who had
participated in the GBL2 library instruction made better library database choices,
a very important aspect of library research. In addition, students who had taken
GBL2 expressed more confidence in their library research skills and were more
likely to use the library databases in their current courses than their counterparts
who had not taken the discipline-specific instruction. … Clearly, students who
had GBL2 were more likely to meet the faculty’s expectations. Overall, biologyspecific library research instruction had lasting value, but we also believe that the
skills should be revisited and scaffolded in upper-level courses so that our
graduates have the tools to develop into biology scholars and can succeed in
graduate school and their professional careers. (Ferrer-Vinent & Carello, 2011, p.
263)
One message is that IL through librarian-led instruction is necessary for academic and
professional success.

112

Similarly, in an article in which the definition of IL fits solidly within the IL-asskills definition, business students benefited from first-year embedded ILI as reported by
Kelly, Williams, Matthies, and Orris (2011) in their concluding remarks:
The results from this research investigation suggest that IL knowledge and skills
taught in an introduction to business course can be learned and applied in a
subsequent introduction to financial accounting course. Furthermore, students
receiving this instruction in the earlier business course performed significantly
better than students who had not received this training. Some evidence suggests
that repetition may be helpful for specific concepts, such as acronyms used for
industry classification; and students, once reminded, are able to show retention
of knowledge that extends beyond the current semester. These findings
encourage the inclusion of course-integrated library instruction in business core
classes early in the curriculum because students can retain this knowledge over
an extended period of time for application in subsequent coursework.
Furthermore, targeted reinforcement of particular library resources later in the
curriculum can be helpful in achieving student learning. (Kelly, Williams,
Matthies, & Orris, 2011, pp. 345-346)
Although moderate in tone in comparison to many of the other articles, the ideology of IL
and its promises of long-term benefits is present. The position of these authors is that IL
is best developed through progressive, iterative ILI which would better support students’
retention beyond a single semester.

113

In the McClure, Cooke, and Carlin (2011) report on an ILI online tutorial, the
authors’ definition of IL also fits within IL-as-skills:
Delivering information literacy instruction has been a driving force in the library
profession for more than twenty years. As early as 1989, the American Library
Association defined an “information literate person” as one who “must be able to
recognise [sic] when information is needed and have the ability to locate,
evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.” (American Library
Association, 1989). A decade later, the (American) Association of College and
Research Libraries developed the “Information literacy competency standards for
higher education” to further guide academic librarians in helping their students
achieve performance indicators such as defining the information need,
recognizing information is available in different formats, identifying and using
appropriate search terms, retrieving information, and citing sources (Association
of College & Research Libraries, 2000). (McClure, Cooke, & Carlin, 2011, p. 26)
The authors established the definition of IL from the authority of the ALA and the
ACRL. These authors took a subtler approach by posing the importance of libraries in ILI
as their opinion:
Despite the possibilities suggested by the use of the Skunk Ape online
information literacy tutorial in English Composition, we believe that online
instruction will never fully replace face-to-face information literacy instruction at
our institution. In fact, we find it difficult to ever see a time when in-person
individual consultations will disappear given the complexities and the

114

changing nature of research in the digital age. Further, the face-to-face
approach may be the best way to deliver instruction to upper-division and
graduate courses, as these students have increasingly specialized research needs.
It is safe to say, though, that online information literacy tutorials have value for
both students and libraries and that they are here to stay. It is also safe to say that
technological advances will help to improve online instruction over the years to
come, perhaps allowing libraries to strike a perfect balance between online and
in-person delivery of information literacy programmes. (McClure, Cooke, &
Carlin, 2011, p. 40)
These concluding remarks demonstrate the authors’ ambivalence with the necessity and
value to students of online IL with an unstated concern in the future of librarianship. The
authors are conflicted with the evidence from their findings that the tutorial provides
support for IL development in students with their fears of being replaced.
The final article in which the authors’ definition of IL fit within the IL-asskills definition was a study co-authored by a librarian and an English professor. The
report by Rinto and Cogbill-Seiders (2015) focused on the development of English
composition students’ IL skills in relation to whether students received ILI and on
whether instruction was based on a theme. In the following excerpt from the
introduction, the authors positioned ILI as a natural integration with English
composition.
On many college and university campuses, English composition holds the dual
distinction of being both a gateway course for academic writing and research as

115

well as a requirement for graduation. The high impact nature of these courses
makes them a focus for many academic library instruction programs, and the
information literacy literature is filled with case studies of collaborations between
the library and English composition. Due to the natural partnership between
information literacy and first-year writing programs, it is important to continue
to evaluate how these programs work in tandem and can best support one
another. (Rinto & Cogbill-Seiders, 2015, p. 14)
In the above excerpt, the combination of ILI and English composition is positioned as
typical. By emphasizing the importance of English composition courses, linked or
embedded ILI takes on additional significance.
In their conclusion, the authors further emphasized the significance of the link
between English composition and ILI:
The results of this study suggest that the variables of library instruction and
section theme have significantly positive2 and marginally positive3 impacts,
respectively, on annotated bibliography score.
In particular, student work from sections of ENG 102 that attended a
library session scored significantly higher2 on the topic development criterion on
the Proposal rubric, as well as the relevance and authority evaluative criteria on
the Annotated Bibliography rubric. Section theme had a significant positive3
impact on the topic development criterion on the Proposal rubric; on the
Annotated Bibliography rubric, theme had only a marginal positive3 impact.
These results indicate that library instruction contributes to information literacy

116

skill development as evidenced by a course assignment, and point toward the
possibilities of section theme as a contributing factor. If information literacy
instruction programs and English composition continue to partner in teaching
students research-based writing skills, a combination of targeted library
instruction and well-developed themed courses has the potential to deeply
impact student learning. (Rinto & Cogbill-Seiders, 2015, p. 20)
While the authors noted the specific IL skills evaluated and promoted by ILI, in the last
sentence in the excerpt above, the phrase “deeply impact” implies benefits beyond these
specific skills as long as the partnership between academic libraries and English
departments continues, with the implication that the potential advantages to students
would be diminished if the partnership ceased.
The other three articles co-authored by librarians and outside professors provide a
look at the contexts in which IL was discussed from a perspective of IL as definition IL
as a way of thinking.
The study reported by Paterson and Gamtso (2011) fits within the IL as a way of
thinking category with IL skills described as transferable:
As teaching faculty and librarians at the urban branch of a New England public
university, the authors collaborate across faculty, librarian, and student
constituencies to teach students the information literacy skills they need in
college and in the workplace. Despite attempts to develop students’ critical
thinking expertise, students often continue to have difficulty understanding
the acquisition of knowledge as a lifelong process; this is a misunderstanding

117

exacerbated by the tendency of the different constituencies of faculty and
librarians to emphasize information retrieval rather than knowledge creation in
the library instruction context. This can have negative consequences, as
stressing the tool of information retrieval runs the risk of distracting the
student from learning the process of generating knowledge from retrieved
information, a process crucial to teaching lifelong learning skills.
Moreover, faculty and librarians’ own approaches to and attitudes
toward library tools, and their assumptions about student research practices,
impede students’ ability to view learning as a recursive, creative, and ongoing
inquiry. The authors have tried to overcome these impediments by
collaborating to craft a Freshman English Composition library instruction
session that moves beyond developing students’ information-gathering
expertise by focusing on the development of transferable knowledge and
critical thinking skills. (Paterson & Gamtso, 2011, p. 118)
On a cursory look, it seems from this excerpt that librarians are depicted as coresponsible with faculty in creating impediments to students’ acquisition of IL skills, as
seen in the statement, “Moreover, faculty and librarians’ own approaches to and
attitudes toward library tools, and their assumptions about student research practices,
impede students’ ability.” However, the authors also positioned librarians and faculty as
the means to overcoming those obstacles, which indicates the perspective that librarians
are instructors as well as faculty. Collaboration is key for IL development as the authors
made clear in their conclusion, shown in the excerpt below:

118

The authors anticipate that the institutional initiative – which encourages
faculty, librarian, and student collaboration in the teaching of core information
literacy competencies – will prove as fruitful as this small-scale classroom
venture. The multiple voices in the classroom – teacher, librarian, mentor, and
students – led to an educational environment in which all of the participants
learned from one another and reminded all stakeholders that education is a
cooperative enterprise. By together asking students to examine their own
assumptions, pose serious questions about an important civic issue, and seek
after knowledge by engaging in scholarly research, the authors invited them to
become active participants in the scholarly discourse and set them upon the road
to information fluency. (Paterson & Gamtso, 2011, pp. 124-125)
In addition, the authors pointed to the unstated benefits of being “upon the road to
information fluency.” Although not defined or even referred to elsewhere in the article,
the phrase information fluency denotes another IL ideology in which implies a higher
level of competency as “information fluency is envisioned … as the optimal outcome
when relevant computing skills are combined with information literacy and critical
thinking skills” (Zhang, 2002, p. 358). Lombard noted some including Mani (2004)
claimed the adoption of the phrase information fluency by many may have been due to
the positive rather than the negative connotations of illiteracy associated with the use of
IL (2016). As in virtually all of the articles examined, another point is revealed in this
excerpt in which IL as taught by librarians (or librarians and faculty) is necessary for
“scholarly” or academic research. This demonstrates a point made by others, especially

119

proponents of CIL, in which the ideology of capitalism is revealed in the discourse with
education viewed as a form of capital which allows greater participation in the dominant
society, which can be viewed by the marketization of education (Fairclough, 2013).
Battista, et al. noted the influence of ideologies including capitalism on IL:
The Framework is essentially describing normative academic research and
knowledge practices. In other words, it describes the culture of academic research.
Although these academic cultural practices are always fraught and contested, they
are historically largely shaped by cultures of dominance (i.e. European
colonialism/imperialism, white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism,
heteronormativity, ableism, etc.). (2015, p. 117)
Although Battista, et al. were commenting on a draft of the Framework, their comments
are applicable to the Standards as well, as the Standards also described normative
academic research.
Moore, Black, Glackin, Ruppel, and Watson (2015) described their research on
the use of team-based learning and Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning
(POGIL) elements using iPads in ILI for first-and second-year students. Focused on
ILI in a collaborative learning environment, their definition of IL also fits within IL
as a way of thinking. The library was positioned as central to students’ development
of IL skills as shown in the excerpt from the conclusion below:
As a result of the Library’s collaboration with the University’s Foundational
Studies Program, the Library and the UF information literacy curriculum has
become an integral part of the educational experience for all incoming students

120

and had a positive impact on student learning. The information literacy
instruction, linking learning activities directly to student assignments, was
advantageous to skill mastery, retention, and transference. Strategically
scaffolding these information literacy skills throughout the students’ educational
experience provided a platform for student success. The desired outcome for
providing consistent library instruction to 1st and 2nd year students in the UF
Program is that librarians are able to teach higher level information literacy skills
to students in their 3rd and 4th year subject-speciﬁc courses, resulting in students’
increased ability to effectively gather, evaluate and use information. (Moore,
Black, Glackin, Ruppel, & Watson, 2015, p. 162)
In the final article analyzed in this category, Rapchak’s and Cipri’s (2015)
research on ILI in learning communities of undergraduate students, their definition of IL
fits within IL as a way of thinking with their attention on critical thinking and service
learning. This excerpt from their introduction depicts librarians as central to ILI:
Graduating information-literate students – students who understand how to
navigate information resources and evaluate their findings – remains a major goal
of many colleges and universities. While information literacy instruction
occurs throughout the curriculum, many institutions rely on their librarians to
provide the bulk of this training. Academic librarians often struggle to make
information literacy instruction relevant and meaningful to students, especially
first-year students. For those teaching stand-alone, for-credit courses, engaging
students remains a perennial challenge. At Duquesne University in Pittsburgh,

121

the reference and instruction librarians, along with several part-time faculty
partners, face this challenge because most students are required to take a onecredit research skills course in their first semester. To better link information
literacy skills to other courses, instructors of the Research and Information Skills
Lab have tried to work with other faculty when possible. For example, one
librarian found a section of the course to have many pharmacy students, so she
contacted a faculty member in pharmacy to collaborate on some assignments.
However, most efforts at such collaboration were ad hoc and not sustained until
Duquesne experimented with incorporating information literacy into one of its
learning communities. (Rapchak & Cipri, 2015, pp. 661-662)
In this excerpt, librarians are positioned as the champions of IL and at the mercy
of reluctant faculty and even students, who “are required” to take a research skills course.
Implied within this excerpt, the librarians were responsible for originating the idea of
integration with the learning community, which the authors confirmed later in the article
(p. 666), also implied here as successful. In their conclusion, they affirmed this success:
For libraries striving to show the value of their role in their university, working
with learning communities provides an excellent opportunity to highlight the
essential nature of libraries; the instruction, support, and assistance that they can
provide; and how these can relate to improved student grades and persistence.
(Rapchak & Cipri, 2015, p. 673).
Again, the authors’ underscored the challenges librarians face in promoting ILI. The
phrase “can provide” implicitly underscores the reluctance of faculty as the message

122

implied shows libraries as willing and able but at the mercy of faculty. This excerpt
shows another aspect of IL ideology, in which ILI benefits students’ academic
performance and retention rates.
Librarians. By far the largest category of texts analyzed was a total of 45
librarian-authored articles. Rather than discuss each article as in the previously covered
categories of authorship, the following provides the highlights of articles published in the
years 2011 and 2015 which are representative of the main findings from librarianauthored articles in each of the three categories of Addison’s and Meyers’ framework of
IL definitions. Also of interest is that several articles were authored by the same author or
authors (Archambault, 2011; Archambault & Masunaga, 2015; Dennis, Murphey, &
Rogers, 2011; Dennis & Dees, 2015; Angell, 2015; Boss, Angell, & Tewell, 2015;
Tewell & Angell, 2015).
Librarians: Information literacy as skills. Most of the librarian-authored articles
examined in this project IL fit in the category of IL as skills, with 27 articles presenting
IL as skills-based as in Addison’s and Meyers’ framework of IL definitions. This
conceptualization of IL sees IL as a set of discrete skills. A total of eleven were published
in 2011. The context of the articles published in 2011 were reports of assessment based
on various aspects which ranged from ILI for freshmen English (Archambault, 2011),
impact of ILI based on the findings of a citation analysis of students’ research papers
(Cooke & Rosenthal, 2011), the use of clickers in an ILI session (Dennis, Murphey, &
Rogers, 2011), multi-year assessment of students’ IL skills (Fain, 2011), an analysis of
communication textbooks for IL concepts (Gains & Stoddart, 2011), IL skills of students

123

developed from use of an IL tutorial (Gustavson, Whitehurst, & Hisle, 2011), an IL
course created in collaboration with a computer science professor (Loesch, 2011), the
collaborative ILI by a cataloger and a reference librarian (McCallum & Collins, 2011),
pre-and post-ILI test results (Swoger, 2011), impact of an IL workbook (Walsh, 2011),
and students’ perceptions of an IL tutorial (Weiner, Pelaez, Chang, & Weiner, 2011). The
following discussion of one librarian-authored article published in 2011 illustrates the
findings of the analysis of these 11 articles.
While the richest data in most of the articles published in 2011 was found in the
conclusion or other internal sections, the following excerpt from the introduction of the
article by Swoger (2011) is illustrative of the findings in this analysis of librarianauthored articles in which the definition of IL was skills-based:
While many librarians are making excellent progress toward embedded library
instruction, many sessions are still traditional one-shot instruction sessions. The
ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education have
proved very useful for providing overall program guidance, but only a small
subset of the outcomes can be explored in these single class sessions. Distilling
from the standards what is necessary and possible for students to learn in a 50minute session can be difficult.
Determining what to teach in a one-shot library instruction session for a
freshman writing and critical thinking class can be daunting – librarians would
like the students to learn enough to prepare them for college level research, but
time is very limited. Traditional “library orientation” sessions can focus on the

124

building, the library web site, the web online public access catalog (OPAC), or
other basic concepts.
Librarians at SUNY Geneseo’s Milne Library used pre-and postassessment results to evaluate and revise the goals and objectives for the one-shot
library instruction sessions taught in many sections of a freshman writing and
critical thinking class. The assessments helped the librarians focus on student
learning outcomes and to prioritize the knowledge and skills we hope for
students to learn in these sessions. (Swoger, 2011, p. 244)
Couched in relatively optimistic terms, the authors presented an attitude of
friendly concern for the difficulties and challenges faced by librarians. Although the
authors use of modalized phrases such as “but only a small subset”, “can be difficult”,
and “can be daunting”, presented the challenges as significant, the use of “can be”
moderates the challenge to a scalable obstacle. The challenges faced by librarians were
given primary attention with students presented as passive possible recipients of the
benefits of librarian expertise and guidance. In this excerpt, direct reference to IL
ideology was omitted; it was implied in the reference to the Standards in the second
sentence of the first paragraph.
There were 16 librarian-authored articles in which the IL definition fit in IL as
skills published in 2015. The context in which IL was discussed in these articles ranged
from assessment of the effectiveness of a rubric to evaluate students’ IL skills (Angell,
2015), the use of curriculum mapping to plan ILI (Archambault & Masunaga, 2015), the
impact of a discovery tool on ILI (Azadbakht, 2015), various aspects of library

125

orientations (Boss, Angell, & Tewell, 2015; Dennis & Dees, 2015; Giles, 2015;
Hottinger, Zagami-Lopez, & Bryndzia, 2015), embedded librarianship (Caminita, 2015),
ILI for student athletes (Caniano, 2015), the use of Google Forms in ILI (Djenno, Insua,
& Pho, 2015), use of crowdsourcing to market ILI (Ellis & Peña, 2015), the use of
flipped classrooms (Gibes & James, 2015) or iPads (Gibeault, 2015) in ILI, assessment of
ILI programs (Holliday, et al., 2015; Luetkenhaus, Borrelli, & Johnson, 2015), and
assessment of the use of an IL game in ILI (Tewell & Angell, 2015).
Analysis of the 2015 librarian-authored articles in this IL definitional category
showed, similar to the 2011 librarian-authored articles, that the richest data was found in
the conclusions, although stronger levels of commitment was found in modalizations
used. Several made only minimal references to the Standards, while others did not
directly reference the Standards. The following excerpt from the concluding paragraphs
of one article demonstrates findings typical in the analysis of these articles:
This pilot was successful in introducing librarians and instructors to the idea of
using D2L and a flipped approach to enhance classroom instruction and building
enthusiasm for the continued use of D2L as a home for supplemental library
instruction. Yet it is also clear to us that the ultimate value for students in
interacting with a librarian comes from personal contact, and digital learning
objects must be seen as a means to that end rather than a substitute for it.
Connecting librarians to courses through the integrated librarian program
cemented the library as an integral piece of the learning process, and the bulk
of feedback from both students and instructors focused on the value of the

126

connection to a librarian, with particular appreciation for the consistency of
having a single librarian.
For librarians, the greater collaboration with instructors and the
systematic inclusion in the courses improved the quality and depth of our work
with students and our satisfaction with the process. The scalability of this model
seems to have worked without trouble, and we will continue to partner with
FYE instructors in this way.
In some ways, what we did is not revolutionary. In other ways, the
approach has vastly shifted the partnership between the libraries and the English
Department and has changed our impact on the campus to a degree that we’ve
only begun to measure. (Gibes & James, 2015, p. 13)
Typical of the examined articles published in 2015, attention to collaboration with
faculty and focus on the success and importance of librarians’ involvement in ILI are the
dominant themes. No direct or implied reference to IL ideologies, including IL-as-skills
are present in these paragraphs. The omission in these paragraphs indicates the authors’
confidence in the audience’s knowledge and acceptance of dominant IL ideologies.
Specific IL skills were mentioned sporadically and infrequently throughout the text.
Librarians: Information literacy as a way of thinking. The definition of IL of
twelve librarian-authored articles examined in this project fit within Addison’s and
Meyers’ category, IL as a way of thinking. In this category definitions of IL are
cognitivist in approach as adherents see IL as an attitude of mind. Four articles were
published in 2011 (Battles, Glenn, & Shedd, 2011; Detmering & Johnson, 2011;

127

Karshmer & Bryan, 2011; Mark, 2011) and another eight were published in 2015 (Booth,
Lowe, Tagge, & Stone, 2015; Brier & Lebbin, 2015; Debose & Miller, 2015; Fabbi,
2015; Keener, 2015; Lowe, Booth, Stone, & Tagge, 2015; Ludovico & Wittig, 2015;
Pashia & Critten, 2015).
The analysis of most of the 2011 published articles in this category stood out
more for the somewhat diminished degree of overt modalization and ideologies present
than seen in other authorship and definitional categories. The contexts in which IL was
discussed in these varied from the development of an IL game (Battles, Glenn, & Shedd,
2011), the positive impact on ILI of a university’s Quality Enhancement Plan focused on
critical thinking (Detmering & Johnson, 2011), the redesign of a one-shot ILI session
(Karshmer & Bryan, 2011), and a theoretical article arguing against privileging peerreview articles in ILI (Mark, 2011). The highlights of the analysis of two articles
published in 2011 (Karshmer & Bryan, 2011; Mark, 2011) are presented below. A
discussion of the implications of these findings will be discussed in Chapter 5.
Drawing from models including Bruce’s Seven Faces and Bloom’s taxonomy,
Karshmer and Bryan (2011) defined IL as constructivist process, which fits within the IL
as a way of thinking category, as seen in the below excerpt, which appears in the section
of the article in which the authors discussed theoretical models:
An earlier study by Seamans, which looked at the process of first-year student
information acquisition in terms of designing instructional programs for this
specific group, offered some interesting insights that might be useful in creating
meaningful instructional scenarios. Similarly, Orne agrees that information

128

literacy is “contextual and depends on particular characteristics of an information
seeker, an information need, and an information environment.” Taking the
discussion a step further, Orne mentions Christine Bruce’s work, Seven Faces of
Information Literacy in Higher Education, and describes how Bruce’s
“conceptions” of information literacy illustrate progressive categories that help
explain how information literacy is a component of lifelong learning. Orne also
suggests that different learning taxonomies and frames of reference (Bloom,
Perry) might allow librarians to develop lessons that are not only constructed
around first-year students’ experiences and points of reference, but that they apply
information literacy skills in terms of the familiar and everyday occurrences that
first-year students encounter. This “constructivist” approach will allow librarians
to build foundations that will support “the type of lifelong learning that
information literacy advocates have promised.” (Karshmer & Bryan, 2011, p.
256)
The location of this excerpt in the original text demonstrates a departure from other
articles examined in this project. The richest examples of ideologies and other
dimensions of analysis as proposed from Fairclough did not appear in the introductory or
concluding sections, but within internal sections of the text. The moderate aspect of
modalizations, such as “some interesting”, “might be useful”, and “might allow”, contrast
with the more overt expressions used in the other articles examined in this project.
Fairclough noted modalizations indicate levels of commitment by the authors of the
particular discourse (2003, p. 170). The ever-present IL ideology is presented in support

129

of the concept of IL as a way of thinking in departure from the more widely accepted
skills-based definition.
The theoretical article by Mark (2011) also defined IL as a way of thinking as can
be seen in the excerpt below:
How does the ability to locate, read and incorporate peer review journal articles
improve undergraduates’ critical thinking skills? Teaching faculty have noted that
peer reviewed articles are a shortcut to ensure that students are “not just using
Google” but accessing reliable articles. It is also a method that librarians use to
measure the efficacy of library instruction sessions through citation reviews. Does
the ability to locate, read and incorporate peer reviewed articles necessarily aid
students in their ability to determine the reliability of sources and improve their
critical thinking skills? I suggest that we are privileging peer review literature out
of ideals rooted in academic culture more than for pedagogical reasons.
Undergraduates would find greater benefit in the opportunity to search and
critique the sources related to their personal and creative interests as well as
relevant to academic research projects. This is something that many peer review
articles are too narrow in scope to accommodate. (Mark, 2011, p. 5)
In contrast to most of the other articles examined in this librarian-authored and IL
definitional category, the author used high levels of commitment within the
modalizations and indirect IL ideology in the introduction of the text in a challenge to the
existing practice. The references to the students’ “personal and creative interests”
indirectly invoke the lifelong learning ideology in the Standards which the author also

130

drew from in the phrases “the ability to locate, read and incorporate,” and “ability to
determine the reliability of sources and improve their critical thinking skills.”
The eight articles published in 2015 which were examined in this combination of
definitional and authorship categories also discussed IL in a variety of contexts. Two
articles by the same group of librarian authors discussed the positive impact on students’
development of IL skills with progressive librarian involvement (Booth, Lowe, Tagge, &
Stone, 2015; Lowe, Booth, Stone, & Tagge, 2015). Brier and Lebbin (2015) discussed the
use of drawing pictures of IL concepts in ILI to assist students’ development of IL as a
way of thinking. The article by Debose and Miller (2015) discussed the collaboration
between disciplinary faculty and librarians in the creation of a FYE course. Fabbi (2015)
discussed factors from students’ high-school experiences which may impact
undergraduates’ level of IL. Fostering students’ understanding of copyright issues was
the focus of Keener’s (2015) article. The findings of a citation analysis study which
examined the types and incorporation of sources as well as accuracy of citation style
employed by students’ incorporation of sources was the context of discussion of IL in
another article (Ludovico & Wittig, 2015). Pashia and Critten (2015) described the use of
an ethnographic approach to ILI to develop students’ IL as a way of thinking. Similar to
the 2011 librarian-authored articles examined in this definitional category, in the 2015
articles the richest data appeared in later sections. However, in the 2015 articles rich data
was absent from introductions, but appeared in conclusions with more direct drawing
from ideologies and higher levels of commitment apparent in the analysis of
modalizations used. The following discussion highlights the analysis of two articles

131

published in 2015 (Lowe, Booth, Stone, & Tagge, 2015; Pashia & Critten, 2015), with a
discussion of the implications of these findings addressed in Chapter 5.
The richest data in the analysis of the text by Lowe, Booth, Stone, and Tagge
(2015) appeared in several paragraphs of the conclusion. The excerpt below shows
several items of interest from one of the concluding paragraphs:
Instruction librarians experience varying levels of buy-in among faculty in many
walks of course-integrated IL teaching practice. As a result, it is profoundly
important to determine the student learning effects of varying levels of
engagement to target our own efforts and advocate for effective course
integration scenarios. In the context of the present research, it is important to
note that a great deal of librarian pedagogical development underlies the IL
instruction program at CCL. The program is committed to the consistent
cultivation of a “community of practice” that encourages best practices,
confidence in peer-to-peer collaboration with faculty, meaningful assessment,
and consistency in engaging students with IL habits of mind reflected in our
institutional definition of IL. These strategies are discussed at greater length in
the publication of our pilot results. (Lowe, Booth, Stone, & Tagge, 2015, p. 500)
In contrast to analysis of other articles, the challenges of faculty buy-in faced by
librarians are presented in a moderate statement of fact. The importance of librarian
involvement in ILI is underscored by the phrase “profoundly important”. Somewhat
unclear in this paragraph is the phrase “varying levels of engagement”, which in the
context of the article is a reference to the level of faculty buy-in and involvement in ILI.

132

Collaboration with faculty is the primary item of focus in this paragraph as underscored
with the two sentences, the first of which begins “In the context of the present research.”
Students are given only a cursory reference.
Unlike most of the other 2015 librarian-authored articles that defined IL as a way
of thinking, the use of higher level of commitment in modalizations appeared in the
introduction of the article by Pashia and Critten (2015), as shown in the excerpt below:
The emerging field of critical IL recognises these dimensions, and advocates that
librarians eschew what critical pedagogue Paulo Freire has called the “banking
concept of education” in order to create more meaningful and transformative
learning experiences for students … We recognised that much of our traditional
instructional curriculum fell within this banking concept of education and so we
sought new ways to make learning more impactful for students. We found that
especially paradigmatic instructional models like one-shots and orientations did
not allow for extended interaction or meaningful relationship-building. In
particular, we identified an acute need to revise our curriculum for UWG 1101,
the university’s freshman seminar. Our sessions for this course were ostensibly the
students’ library orientation and our traditional curriculum very much fell within
the banking model of education. We wanted to create a critical introduction to the
library space for students that allowed them to, as Elmborg writes, “read, interpret
and produce ‘texts’” within their new-found academic (if not yet disciplinary)
community. (Pashia & Critten, 2015, pp. 84-85)

133

At first glimpse, traditional IL ideology is not present, which indicates the authors’
advocacy of a departure from the traditional skills-based IL definition to a more critical
way of thinking and interacting with information. However, the phrase “read, interpret
and produce texts” draws from the Standards skills-based definition.
Librarians: Information literacy as a social practice. In six articles, the authors’
definitions of IL fit within the IL as a socio-cultural process definitional category.
Adherents to this definitional approach perceive IL as highly contextual and that ways of
interacting with information arise within the social practice. One article was published in
2011 (Townsend, Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011), and the other five in 2015 (Bryan &
Karshmer, 2015; Christensen, 2015; Critten, 2015; Hosier, 2015; LeBlanc & Quintiliano,
2015). The following provides highlights from articles representing the discussion of the
context and definitions of IL in this category.
The article by Townsend, Brunetti, and Hofer (2011) represents the earliest
publication of articles analyzed in this project of espousing an IL definition that fits
within IL as a social practice. In their article proposing what they call a “theoretical
framework” (p. 867) of IL based on threshold concepts, their opening paragraphs
demonstrated their view of the need to move from Standards-based definitions:
What do we teach when we teach information literacy in higher education? There
is certainly no shortage of published guidelines, standards, teaching strategies,
and advice awaiting the motivated instruction librarian. The literature abounds
with the profession’s collective efforts to improve teaching by searching out
meaningful instructional content.

134

Yet while information literacy program statements and policies generally
espouse goals of critical thinking and lifelong learning, research on the practice of
information literacy instruction finds that it is often taught as a kind of
enhanced bibliographic instruction. This dissonance between espoused theories
and theories in-use suggests that while many innovative approaches have been
theorized, librarians in the trenches sometimes struggle to relate theory to
practice. We, the authors, began our exploration of improving information literacy
instruction because we felt that our own teaching was not as effective as it could
be.
This paper aims to advance the conversation around this issue by
introducing threshold concepts, a pedagogical strategy designed to help
instructors in higher education identify and teach foundational disciplinary
concepts. It provides an overview of threshold concepts, looks at how they are
already being applied to the field of information literacy instruction, and
addresses related questions of disciplinarity and existing standards … (Townsend,
Brunetti, & Hofer, 2011, pp. 853-854)
The authors posed IL as a construct developing from “the conversation” and not limited
to the “enhanced bibliographic” skills based on the Standards. Instruction librarians are
positioned as potentially “motivated” and “in the trenches.” Posing IL as a social
construct positions the concept as socio-cultural practice which the authors see as a new
opportunity for instruction for motivated librarians.

135

Also seeing IL as a socio-cultural practice, Christensen (2015) drew on the
definition of IL from the Framework, as seen in the excerpt below:
These frames redefine an information-literate student as one who is self-directed,
collaborative, and capable of comfortably participating in a rapidly changing
information ecosystem. In updating the essence of an ideal information-literate
student, the Framework offers an opportunity for librarians to do the same for
themselves and their instructional tools and tactics. An ideal information literacy
session will engage students while fundamentally changing their perspective on
the information ecosystem. Although the Knowledge Practices and Dispositions
are not prescriptive, they may be interpreted as the skills students should
acquire and the learning outcomes that should frame information literacy course
design. (Christensen, 2015, p. 99)
The author positioned the Framework in optimistic terms;”ideal”, “offers an
opportunity”, “not prescriptive”. The Framework is lauded as the chance for librarians to
break from the outdated Standards; a promise which is also seen in the author’s opening
paragraph:
The release of the first version of the Association of College and Research
Libraries (ACRL) Draft Framework in February 2014 became a catalyst for
finding new ways of providing information literacy instruction at the University
of Virginia. A task force to develop information literacy instruction for
undergraduate students began work on designing learning opportunities that do
not rely on the methods of traditional bibliographic instruction. A review of

136

learning theories in education and rhetoric contributed to the initiative to engage
students and enhance their grasp of core threshold concepts outlined in the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Association of
College & Research Libraries, 2014). (Christensen, 2015, p. 97)
IL ideology is apparent through the further emphasizing of the bright future for IL with
the Framework, with the Standards denoted as “traditional bibliographic instruction.”
In their article, LeBlanc and Quintiliano (2015) discussed adapting the mnemonic,
C.R.A.P., to relate to threshold concepts from the Framework. They drew their discussion
of IL from the definition of IL in the Framework. Contrary to concerns voiced by other
librarians over the Framework, such as those who authored the Open Letter, in their
abstract the authors demonstrated their acceptance of the new way of conceptualizing IL:
In 2015, the American Association of College and Research Libraries jettisoned
its longstanding set of Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education and
adopted the richer, more flexible Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education. Composed of core concepts rather than prescriptive
objectives, the Framework more closely mirrors the complexity of the rapidly
evolving academic environment and encourages engagement on the part of
students. However, many instruction librarians find that the framework’s
flexibility also poses pedagogical challenges. The authors describe how
instruction librarians at one university library have adapted and used a popular
mnemonic device when presenting the frames, thus promoting greater student
reflection and interaction. (LeBlanc & Quintiliano, 2015, p. 115)

137

The authors positioned the Standards negatively by the use of the verb “jettisoned” and
the phrase “prescriptive objectives”, and prioritized the Framework as “richer”, “more
flexible”, etc. Familiar IL ideology can be seen in the phrase “complexity of the rapidly
evolving” and “promoting greater student reflection and interaction”. The weight given to
these statements was further emphasized by the appearance in the original document, in
which the paragraph is set out from the other text with a background of a bordered and
shaded box. The authors further emphasized their advocacy with the Framework by their
opening paragraph:
The recent introduction of the Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education has redefined
information literacy standards and shifted them from “a set of standards,
learning outcomes, or any prescriptive enumeration of skills” to a broader
“cluster of interconnected core concepts, with flexible options for
implementation” (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2015). While
much has already been written about how the framework has changed the way
instructional librarians will deliver and assess information literacy outcomes, the
current challenge is how to introduce these advanced concepts into research
classes. Instructional librarians at Villanova University’s Falvey Memorial
Library have repurposed a popular mnemonic acronym, C.R.A.P., to introduce
these new concepts to undergraduate students and elevate the instructor’s
pedagogical goals in information literacy instruction. (LeBlanc & Quintiliano,
2015, p. 115)

138

These authors framed the “current challenge” facing librarians in a positive manner with
the opportunity for librarians to teach “advanced concepts” and “elevate the instructor’s
pedagogical goals.” Not only does this offer librarians opportunity, but the challenges can
be faced by using a mnemonic acronym, implying the Framework will ease the burden on
librarians.
To further emphasize the benefits of the Framework and the use of the acronym,
the authors’ concluding paragraph summed up:
Based on these initial assessments, the new C.R.A.P. acronym has broadened
and enhanced our students’ overall understanding of advanced research. During
the class sessions, instructors have found that specific questions about nuts-andbolts searching are now being augmented by weightier questions about
intellectual property, the ongoing research process prior to and after forming a
thesis, and the acceptability of blogs and online news resources in modern
research. Most of all, the new C.R.A.P. acronym has challenged us as instructors
to shift toward a broader conceptual pedagogy in our introductory information
literacy class sessions; a welcome change from a traditionally skills-based
classroom experience. (LeBlanc & Quintiliano, 2015, p. 120)
Students are the beneficiaries of the new approach; gaining a greater understanding of
research and thinking at a higher level. Instruction librarians also benefit by being able to
work with broader concepts, even in introductory IL sessions. Discussion of these
findings are provided in Chapter 5.

139

Reflection on the Analysis
In summary of the findings of this study, this discussion returns to Jäger’s &
Maier’s (Wodak & Meyer, 2010) four questions that guided the examination of the texts:
1) what is valid knowledge at a certain place and time, 2) how does this knowledge arise
and how is it passed on, 3) what functions does it have for constituting subjects, and 4)
what consequences does it have for the overall shaping and development of society.
Within the field of LIS, it is clear from the results of this project that the ACRL’s
conceptualizations of IL have been the principal shaping of definitions of IL for both LIS
academe and ILI librarians. The work of the members of both participant-groups is
significantly influenced by the ACRL. The ramifications of the ACRL’s influence are
widespread: influencing accreditation standards, as well as national and state IL policies,
and extending to disciplinary academe outside of LIS. The ACRL is, however, made up
of members of these two participant-groups, which does provide some empowerment to
those who are in agreement with the prevailing ACRL policy. As librarians typically
perceive they are viewed at the lower level in LIS in relation to LIS academe, drawing
from the ACRL likely provides acquiescent librarians a sense of enfranchisement.
While the ACRL has no power of enforcement of the Standards or the
Framework, the majority of the members of these participant-groups reinforce the
policies of the ACRL both in their work with students and in the published discourse,
which serves as a norming of the ACRL’s IL policy statements. Although the review of
the literature in Chapter 2 discussed some in disagreement with the Standards, with the
published literature within LIS regarding first-year freshmen IL comprised predominantly

140

of ILI librarians advancing views of IL aligned with the ACRL, those voices of dissent
become marginalized. This has a tremendous impact on what is viewed as credible
instruction in IL to students. When dissenters with the ACRL’s IL conceptions are
essentially silenced, valuable insights are lost, with potential of loss to students, to society
as a whole, and for future higher education. More details on the findings are provided in
Chapter 5, including the specifics on differences found between the 2011 and 2015
articles and differences found in relation to authorship roles.
Limitations to this Study
This analysis was directed to an examination of the context and conceptions of IL
within first-year programs in the United States at four-year institutions; thus, findings do
not represent conceptualizations, definitions, or instruction in IL in other levels of higher
education or in other collegiate organizations (e.g., community and technical colleges).
Analysis is also limited in the number of texts, years examined, and type of documents
used. While other conclusions may be drawn from analysis of texts such as blogs, syllabi,
and institutional IL policy statements, these findings represent the context and definitions
of IL for first-year students at U.S. four-year institutions in the years 2011 and 2015 is
prevailingly shaped by the ACRL. Another area not represented in this analysis is the
impact, deficiency, or lack of ILI in high school, an area which several of the texts under
analysis mentioned as a factor in students’ IL skills. Further research in these other
contexts would provide valuable insights into IL within United States’ higher education.

141

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION

Introduction
This final section summarizes the findings of the analysis, followed by a look at
the current discussions within LIS on the Framework. The chapter concludes with
recommendations for LIS as a result of the findings.
Summary of Findings
This analysis did not find evidence that definitions of IL differ substantially
between LIS academe and librarians, but did find support that most of the IL definitions
of these two participant-groups tend to reflect the full definition of IL from the
Standards. While the number of articles authored by LIS professors in this study were far
too few to draw generalizations, the contexts of discussions of IL in the LIS professorauthored articles support claims that LIS academe tend to focus on IL theory, even within
a study focused on assessing lower-order IL skills such as finding and accessing
information.
Initially, the second research question was framed as “What skills are taught or
assessed as IL skills by LIS in higher education?” because in examining the IL skills
taught or researched, the intent was to determine whether the skills (and/or attitudes)
taught or assessed reflect the definition of IL presented by the author or authors, how
those skills or attitudes relate to the ACRL’s definitions of IL, and how those skills,
attitudes, and/or definitions presented by the authors relate to philosophical context of IL
presented. However, while gathering documents for the literature review and texts for
142

analysis, and in the early stages of analysis, the focus of this question was modified.
While what skills taught or assessed was examined (see Appendix E), the second research
question shifted to an analysis of the definitional category from Addison’s and Meyers
framework of IL definitions in which authors’ discussions of IL fit in conjunction with
whether authors’ definitions and discussions of IL aligned with the Standards or the
Framework, in order to evaluate the existence of a link between authors’ professional
work, IL definitional category used, and tendency to reproduce the ACRL’s IL policies.
The analysis of articles written by librarians solely or articles co-authored by
librarians and professors from other disciplines displays similarities. In both of these
groupings of authorship, librarians demonstrate their understanding of and desire to
develop students’ higher-order IL skills, such as critical thinking, ethical and legal use of
information, and integration of information in their papers; however, many cite the
constraints of what can be covered in their limited classroom time with students as a
factor necessitating a focus on lower-order skills such as finding and accessing
information in their ILI. The analysis of these articles shows a shift in the focus of
librarians from lower-order IL skills to higher-order IL skills. A small number of articles
published in 2011, only four articles written or co-authored by librarians, discussed
critical thinking and various aspects of evaluating sources to over half of the 2015
published articles authored or co-authored by librarians which discussed higher-order IL
skills, including critical thinking, threshold concepts from the Framework, evaluation of
information, and use of information in students’ work (see Appendix C).

143

Definitions. A finding of interest in this analysis of definitions was in the
breakdown of articles among the three IL definitional categories. For example, of the 22
articles analyzed which were published in 2011, 14 articles contained definitions of IL as
skills, seven were IL as a way of thinking, and one fit within IL as a social practice. In
both years, librarians were far more likely to define IL as skills. Librarian-authored
articles in both years were at least twice as likely to define IL as skills than IL as a way of
thinking. In 2011 librarian-authored articles, 11 or 59% defined IL as skills, four (25%)
defined IL as a way of thinking, and one (6%) defined IL as a social practice (see Figure
1 and Appendix H).

In the other six articles published in 2011 in which professors were authors or coauthors, they were equally likely to define IL as a way of thinking or as skills. The two
2011 articles written by LIS professors defined IL as a way of thinking as did one

144

librarian and outside professor author-team. The other three 2011 articles co-written by
librarians and outside professors defined IL as skills (see Appendix H).
The 33 articles written by librarians which were published in 2015 also displayed
a tendency of librarians, 16 (55%), to continue to define IL as skills. Of the other 13
librarian-authored articles published in 2015, eight defined IL as a way of thinking and
five defined IL as a social practice (see Figure 2 and Appendix H).

Overall, of the 45 librarian-only authored articles, 27 or 60% defined IL as skills,
12 (27%) defined IL as a way of thinking and six (13%) defined IL as a social practice
(see Figure 4 and Appendix H).

In articles written by librarians only, librarians were more likely to define IL as
skills. However, in articles published in both years which were authored or co-authored
by professors, professors were more likely to define IL as a way of thinking (seven or
64%) compared to four (36%) which defined IL as skills (see Figure 5 and Appendix H).
Librarian-only authored articles were the only ones to define IL as a social practice.

IL as skills

IL as a way of thinking

In addition, in the co-authored articles, the definitions of IL broke down as
follows: four articles co-authored by librarians and outside professors defined IL as skills,
three articles co-authored by librarians and outside professors defined IL as a way of
thinking, the one article co-authored by librarians, LIS and outside professors also
defined IL as a way of thinking.
While all three IL definitional categories can be seen to draw from the ACRL’s
definitions present in the Standards and Framework, this analysis found that the

147

categories of IL as skills and IL as a social practice more closely mirror the definitions of
IL from the two documents, respectively. From this analysis, in these years of change
within LIS, librarians tended to be more likely to respond to and reproduce ACRL’s
definitions in comparison to LIS professors. This is a subtle distinction perhaps, and
given the limited numbers of articles analyzed in this project, by no means generalizable.
In the cases where authorship of articles was a combination of librarians and professors,
IL as skills and IL as a way of thinking were equally represented. No articles were found
that were co-authored by librarians and LIS professors, and it would be of interest to see
how this authorship partnership would define IL. From these limited findings, a probable
definition would be IL as a way of thinking, given the lack of deviation from this
definition in all cases of articles analyzed in this project in which LIS professors were
authors or co-authors.
In 2011, librarians were somewhat more likely to define IL as skills than in 2015;
however, in both years, the predominant definition of IL by librarians was IL as skills. In
this study, the view is taken that the more direct interpretation of the Standards definition
is that of IL as skills in comparison to a definition of IL as a way of thinking, although
arguably, both can be seen as Standards-based. The definition of IL as a social practice is
more strongly aligned with the Framework, although the 2011 librarian-authored article
was published prior to the adoption of the Framework and subsequent rescindment of the
Standards. As noted earlier, the article by Townsend, Brunetti, and Hofer (2011) also
presented views in line with the ACRL, as Townsend was a member of the Task Force.

148

In their critique of the Framework, Bombaro and Watstein (2016) argued that
debates over the Framework had revealed, among other issues, a division within LIS
between “philosopher librarians” who support the Framework and “practical librarians”
who advocated retaining the Standards. By way of explanation of the division, they noted
supporters of the Framework “generally had PhDs or other advanced degrees along with
the benefits often associated with large institutions, including faculty status, tenure and
sabbatical options. They were teachers of for-credit classes at universities” (Bombaro &
Watstein, 2016, p. 555), in contrast to the practical librarians who “may not have had
terminal degrees or any other advanced degree besides a master’s in library science” (p.
556). Lacking the professional status and perks enjoyed by philosopher librarians,
Bombaro noted practical librarians taught one-shot IL sessions, and “expressed concern
about marketing information literacy, ensuring continuity in existing programs, managing
collections and assessing their services” (p. 556).
Although this project did not explore nor was directed to determining educational
level or faculty status of librarian authors of texts analyzed in this project, there is
evidence from analysis of definitions present in the articles that a division among
librarians as to how IL should be defined exists. However, findings support a three-way
division among IL definitions. Analysis of the context of definitions confirms Bombaro’s
and Watstein’s observations to the extent that in articles in which authors defined IL as
skills and some in which authors defined IL as a way of thinking, attention was often
directed to assessment measures and the need to provide their institutions with such data
supporting IL programs. Other common themes of articles authored by librarians

149

included marketing IL programs, the need for institutional and disciplinary faculty levels
of buy-in of IL, and often included commentary on the lack of time in one-shot IL
sessions.
In an attempt to determine what factors might relate to IL definition used by the
authors, this project looked at whether a discussion of disciplinary IL might impact IL
definitional category present in articles. The analysis of context and IL definitional
category did not reveal any correlation between IL definitional category to the context of
IL for specific disciplines, most likely because of the limitation of this project to firstyear ILI. This is an area in which further research could help determine whether such a
correlation exists.
Modality and overwording. The findings from the textual analysis in the
dimensions of modality and overwording support the conclusion that librarians may feel
constrained within their limited opportunities for engaging students’ in IL and that they
increasingly look for ways to expand their teaching role. However, given the broad range
of avenues discussed in their articles, librarians are inventive and creative in their ILI
efforts. Most of these librarians appeared to see the Standards, with some now espousing
the Framework, as the best way to teach students how to engage with scholarly
communication and succeed in their academic endeavors.
Social practice. The analysis of the social practice found the ways the discourse of
the two participant-groups serves to norm the ACRL’s conceptualization of IL. While
one possibility proposed in Chapter 4 was that LIS professionals might reinforce and
reproduce the ACRL’s perspective on IL, there is no evidence from the findings to

150

explain the reasons for this phenomenon, aside from an explanation based on Bourdieu’s
concept of habitus. The best example of habitus in this analysis is the evidence of
librarians’ continued reference to and reproduction of the ACRL’s IL definitions, even in
the face of their disagreement with the decision of the ACRL to rescind the Standards.
Some of these librarians have even moved on to advocate the Framework and to seek
ways to accommodate their institutions’ requirement of assessment data, further
indicating their acceptance and reproduction of ACRL’s IL definitions. The interpretation
based on this analysis is that librarians perceive the backing of the ACRL supports and
legitimates their ILI efforts. Another piece of evidence supporting this argument is the
continuance of ILI programs, even though librarians voice their limited efforts in oneshot sessions. Librarians accept and reproduce ACRL’s IL ideologies (e.g., life-long
learning, participation in a democratic society, necessity of IL for participation in a global
society) in contradiction to their admission that most ILI in one-shot sessions does not
advance much, if any, beyond BI.
Other evidence supporting the norming of ACRL’s ideologies was the results
from the analysis examining presuppositions present in the articles. Librarian-authored
articles were heavy in references to the importance of IL and IL skills, but did not support
these claims. References to lifelong learning without support were far less frequent
appearing in only four librarian-authored articles, and this presupposition was present in
both 2011 LIS professor-authored articles. Articles that were co-authored were largely
absent of these presuppositions (see Appendix E).

151

Overview of Current Library and Information Science Discourse on the Framework
This section provides a brief overview of the most recent published literature on
the Framework. This section presents this summary of the LIS literature on
undergraduate IL to provide a context for these interpretations and for concluding
recommendations for LIS based on these findings and the Framework.
The rounds of discussions in the LIS literature on undergraduate IL and ILI have
begun again with authors now focused on application of the Framework to ILI. As with
earlier discussions in the literature on application of the Standards to ILI, the focus of
articles on the Framework covers a broad range of topics. Some authors have already
begun providing overviews, including Robinson’s summation of the changes in the
definition of IL to encompass metaliteracy, defined as “critical self-reflection crucial to
self-directed learning” (2015, p. 91) and threshold concepts, defined as “those
transformative ideas in any discipline that are portals to understanding the ways of
thinking within that discipline (p. 91). Thus, the intention of the Framework is to address
claims that IL skills can be and often are disciplinary-specific. However, Kuglitsch noted
that the divergence between IL as “a generalizable skill” or as disciplinary-situated skills
as conceptualized within the Standards has not been addressed with the Framework, but
can be reconciled through “teaching for transfer” pedagogy (2015, p. 457). Jacobson and
Gibson (2015) have also offered pedagogical techniques to use in teaching ILI in light of
the Framework, and Seeber (2015) stressed the need for situational-contextual ILI. Other
authors have begun with publication of literature reviews (Lohmann, 2015), and
application to specific courses, such as art (Garcia & Labatte, 2015), or in conjunction

152

with specific products, such as ProQuest Research Companion (D’Amato & Kruy, 2015).
Still others have pointed out the use of the Framework to promote critical dispositions,
(Kelly, 2015) and how to apply established teaching tools, such as the mnemonic
C.R.A.P. in ILI based on the Framework (LeBlanc & Quintiliano, 2015).
While some have critiqued the Framework, including the lack of connection in
the Framework to social justice (Battista, et al., 2015), Foasberg (2015) noted various
critiques of the Standards which the Framework addresses. Others praised the salient
aspects of the Framework’s threshold concepts for students’ IL skills (Christensen, 2015)
or the usefulness of the Framework’s “big ideas” (Pagowsky, 2015, p. 136) contrasted
with the skills-based Standards. Ragains (2015) discussed the implications of the
Standards and the Framework for ILI. Dempsey, Dalal, Dokus, Charles, and Scharf
(2015) voiced their concerns with the future of IL in LIS with the adoption of the
Framework and offered suggestions for using the Standards and Framework together in
ILI; although as Bombaro and & Watstein (2016) noted, this will now be without the
support of the ACRL. Hess noted the need to “incorporate transformational learning
theory, use principles of social learning theory, and consider learners’ goal orientation
and motivation” (2015b, p. 771, see also 2015a) in professional development for ILI
librarians and in ILI to students.
Implications. The aims of this study were to determine if differences in IL
definitions exist with LIS undergraduate IL education in the United States, and if so, what
factors underlie differences, as well as to determine the influence of the ACRL on the
roles of LIS professors and librarians, with the end goal to determine the effect on

153

librarians’ status and undergraduate IL education.
Based on this analysis, LIS professor-authors of the texts analyzed defined IL as a
way of thinking, tend to focus on theory, and are less apt to reflect the ACRL’s IL
definitions. Librarians, on the other hand, vary on IL definitions used. In order of
preference, librarians may define IL as skills, as a way of thinking, or, more recently, as a
social construct. Librarians tend to respond to and reproduce the ACRL’s IL definitions.
This study found evidence for the considerable influence of the ACRL on these librarianauthors, particularly in view of the inclusion of the Framework’s IL definition in articles
published in 2015. This evidences the power the ACRL has in its IL policy documents,
with inclusive IL definitions and IL ideologies, on shaping the discourse, praxis, and
status of librarians, as well as shaping the IL education of undergraduates in the United
States. Librarians are the primary IL instructors in undergraduate IL education, and due
to their need to account to their institutions, rely on the ACRL’s IL documents as support
for their IL programs. Although librarians are dependent on the ACRL, the organization
has not been responsive to the need to support librarians’ work, as evidenced by the
removal and replacement of the Standards with the Framework.
Next Steps for Library and Information Science
If LIS practitioners believe claims regarding the importance of IL, then the
discipline should consider the direction the IL movement needs to follow for the future.
Our current pedagogical IL model has each researcher and ILI librarian approaching
instruction in IL skills in whatever manner deemed best suited, with the ACRL’s
approval as stated in the Framework. While flexibility and adapting to students’ needs is

154

a great strength as a pedagogical method, if we accept the premise that knowledge is a
process (McInerney, 2002), then it follows that in order to teach students IL skills, we
need an educational program that would foster the progressive development of IL skills.
However, in light of the disagreements voiced (Berg, et al, 2015) with the release and
approval of the new Framework, the ACRL has moved in the opposite direction by
removal of “a set of standards or learning outcomes, or any prescriptive enumeration of
skills” (American Library Association, 2015, p. 2) to a theoretical framework based on
threshold concepts. The Framework further states:
Neither the knowledge practices nor the dispositions that support each concept are
intended to prescribe what local institutions should do in using the Framework;
each library and its partners on campus will need to deploy these frames to best fit
their own situation, including designing learning outcomes (American Library
Association, 2015, p. 2).
This seems counterintuitive to the aim of promoting lifelong learning. Indeed, opponents
of the removal of the Standards and replacement by the Framework stated
The Standards are broader in their aim of articulating information skills for
lifelong learning, are clearly and simply written, and are easy to communicate to a
wide range of stakeholders (e.g., other librarians, co-teachers, disciplinary faculty,
administrators, and accreditors). The Framework explicates a deeper level of
understanding of academic research using the language of scholarship and is
intended for an expert audience. (Dempsey, Dalal, Dokus, Charles, & Scharf,
2015, p. 165)

155

While a theoretical framework is necessary for the areas of research, scholarship, and
pedagogical advancement, there is a need to build from that theoretical basis a curriculum
that can educate students in IL. Several librarian authors of articles analyzed in this
project believe the Framework offers a new direction for ILI in U.S. higher education;
however, for many other librarians, the loss of both the Standards and support of the
ACRL for Standards-based ILI means, at the very least, additional work in determining
how to provide their institutions assessment data on their IL programs. Each of the three
IL definitional categories, as well as the Standards and the Framework, holds value for
ILI efforts, and efforts within the discipline should be directed to finding the balance
between these as a means for further developing what exactly IL means and what our
students need to know.
Several texts used in the analysis of this project noted the importance of
progressive ILI for students’ learning and retention of IL concepts (see Booth, Lowe,
Tagge, & Stone, 2015; Ferrer-Vinent & Carello, 2011; Holliday, et al., 2015; Karshmer
& Bryan, 2011; Lowe, Booth, Stone, & Tagge, 2015). Critten (2015) noted the need for
extensive instruction devoted to Framework concepts. Given the evidence found in this
analysis for the influence of the ACRL especially on the definitions of IL presented and
work by librarians, the ACRL should back their IL policy document, the Framework,
with efforts to encourage higher education policy makers to incorporate more extensive
IL programs within undergraduate education. Rather than sidelining critics such as the
authors of the Open Letter (Berg, et al., 2015), the ACRL should acknowledge the current
ILI situation as one of primarily one-shot instruction based on the Standards, and seek to

156

assist librarians with developing a fuller, richer IL curriculum within higher education.
Individual librarians and institutions have already made steps in this direction, with the
use of embedded librarians, and IL embedded into the curriculum, learning communities,
and linked courses. However, if the Framework is to be beneficial as more than a
theoretical document, a more expanded IL curriculum should be the goal of the ACRL
and proponents of IL. Critiques of IL should not be sidelined, but should be valued. The
ACRL is not the only LIS entity with insights into what should comprise IL and what
knowledge students need to interact in today’s information world.
Further research should be directed to covering those contexts of IL in the United
States higher education not investigated in this analysis. Additionally, other venues of
publication including blogs, syllabi, and institutional policy statements would yield
valuable information for LIS, as would analysis of other years not covered by this project.
Future work should also include examination in a similar vein on the influence of the
Framework on ILI for students. Other areas of future work that might help explain the
differences in librarians’ definitions of IL include examination of educational level
attained by librarians and subject specialty or specialties of librarians in order to discern
whether the prior education of librarians influences their IL definitions. This line of
research might also look at the disciplinary context of IL discussions, as many librarians
hold positions of subject specialists in areas related to their education. Faculty status of
librarians is yet another area in which research might provide insight on librarians’
affinity for one IL definition over another.

157

Finally, one other research topic that would add significantly to the fieldwork on
IL would be an investigation of the reasons the discourse of LIS academe and librarians
reproduce ACRL’s definition of IL. In final thought, it is hoped that the findings from
this project will assist others in their work on IL and IL-related topics.

1. A search of three databases Library Literature & Information Science Full Text
(H.W. Wilson); Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts, and Library
Information Science & Technology Abstracts with Full Text limited to scholarly journals
and a beginning date of January, 2000 resulted in 13,424. This search was performed on
March 20, 2016.
2. This term, although used in part as a modalization, is also a statistical term and
is therefore not bolded.
3. Another statistical term, that although used in part as a modalization, is not
bolded. These and similar phrases appear throughout the excerpts of texts used, but will
not be noted from this point forward.
