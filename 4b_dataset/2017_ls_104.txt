ABSTRACT
SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS ON WISCONSIN ARCHIVAL FACEBOOK COMMUNITY
by
Jennifer A. Stevenson
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2017
Under the Supervision of Professor Jin Zhang

The purpose of this study was to understand how Wisconsin archives are using Facebook
(Wisconson archives Facebook community, WAFC). Few archive studies use quantitative
measurements to draw conclusions from social media application use. Quantitative data is needed
in order to identify the various ways that social media is being used in an archive. Without the
data behind the assumptions, it is impossible to improve service and outreach to the archive users.
This study proposed a mixed methods approach to aid in the process, using social network
analysis, inferential statistics and thematic analysis. This study measured the effects of
implementation of social media in areas of archives in order to begin to identify and evaluate
social media for future use by the archive community. These methods provide a better
understanding of archives’ use of social media, thus enabling researchers and practitioners with a
foundational point to continue research. Social networks allow individuals to connect with
individuals and groups with whom they share common interests either personally or
professionally. Four research questions and six hypotheses were developed to determine the main
actors, the role of the actors, content of each online activity (‘tagging’, ‘sharing’, ‘commenting’,
and ‘liking’), and post characteristics. Unique findings of this study were found regarding the
information flow of the WAFC and the content. For instance, the research questions determined
that archives are a central hub within the WAFC; however, other affiliations like cultural
ii

institutions and universities are other contributors to the information flow. Four different themes
were discovered by the thematic analysis: archive story, communication, information, and
outreach. These findings have theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Archivists communicate in a number of ways. Within the archival community, archivists
use a plethora of different forms of communication from face-to-face interactions, online forums,
and social media to discuss issues in the profession. Traditional interaction with archive patrons
used face-to-face discussions, phone, mail, websites, and email. In the past decade, social media
became a part of the communication channel. However, unlike the slower addition of email and
websites, the use of social media has quickly become a part of the communication spectrum.
Embedded in our communication and daily interactions is social media; some generations have
never been without it. In addition, the access to social media is constantly and quite literally right
at our fingertips with the widespread access to mobile devices and cheaper computing machines.
Understanding how the archive community uses social media will help the profession to have a
better perception of their user base, and thus aid in the development of outreach programs and
provide better services to the users and to the profession as a whole. The purpose of this study is
to analyze how the Wisconsin archive community uses Facebook.
An archive is an institution that works for the long-term storage and retrieval of records. It
is important for records to be accessible. Records can be all different types of media, such as
paper, electronic, audio, and/or video. No two archives are alike. Archives differ in both the
patrons they serve and collections they house. For instance, a corporate archive may have limited
accessibility for the public but provide an array of access for the employees. Items in the
collection may include the day-to-day documents like meeting agendas and items pertaining to the
history of that entity, whereas a historical society may provide the public records that were once a
part of the records center of the city, and the patrons of the historical society may include
genealogists.
1

Archivists are the trained professionals that are in charge of maintaining, preserving,
collecting, and storing of the records. Archives provide a service to patrons and part of being an
archivist is being able to articulate the purpose of one’s institution to the people the archive
serves. The development of digital archives and libraries has opened a completely new way for
archivists to permit users access to collections. Some of the software used for digitization has
social media capabilities or permits the overlay of outside social media applications like Facebook
and Twitter. Although archives differ dramatically, there are some similarities of their overall
purpose to preserve and provide access to collections. For this reason, the rationale behind this
study is the analysis of Wisconsin archives use of Facebook; while not representative of the whole
archive community it does permit some basic foundational-shared characteristics among archives.
This is because despite the uniqueness of archives, there are similarities, and there is a need to
measure the different levels of social media use by an archive. The discovery and understanding
of how archives are using social media is a way to have a better understanding of how to serve
archive patrons.
In the early 2000s, the archival community, just like the rest of the world, began to
integrate social media into daily practices. The increased usage and accessibility of new
technology influenced cultural institutions and their user communities in many ways. It was
recognized that the first time many users would “meet” the archive was through a web interface.
Now, a user can “meet” an archive through any number of social media applications. To make
matters more interesting, a user could stumble upon an archive through the facilitation of another
user without the archive ever knowing, thus creating the online version of word of mouth
advertising. The addition of social media to the archive happened organically, meaning there were
no official guidelines suggested. Instead, archivists often added social media applications that
many were familiar with from their personal lives. There is limited research regarding tracking of
2

different social media posts made by archives. The social media statistics recorded by archivists
are frequently not shared outside of a specific archive, however, social media connects individuals
and institutions and it is important to study the online community as a whole.
Social media is a means of communication through the internet that enables social
interaction and sharing of media. Users establishing their own social networks facilitate
interaction within the applications. Social media allows users to communicate and connect, and
creates a participatory community. Huvila (2008) described a participatory archive as, “notions
[of] decentralized curation, radical user orientations in a both broader and deeper
contextualization of records and the entire archival process” (p. 30). This proposed online
community had already become mainstreamed by the late 2000s (Bishop, 2007). Archivists
continue to work toward increasing online user engagement (Mason, 2014).
The user is central in social media; the organization must be sure to display information
that is of interest to its user community or else no one will notice. Schrier (2011) discussed how
digital librarians are at the cusp of integrating social media into digital collections and proposed
general principles regarding implementing social media into a digital library setting. These
suggestions included: listening, participation, transparency, policy, and strategy. Similarly,
Solomon (2011) pointed out two major factors that prevent social media from being effectively
used in library settings: one being the lack of followers and second the lack of social capital.
Solomon equated social capital as “having credibility in a selected online community” (2011, p.
19). Establishing credibility in an online community is a matter of becoming a part of that
community. The fact that the social media environment is digital does not make it any less
credible than a tangible written source. Although similar, libraries and digital libraries are not
archives; which is why archives need research about archives.

3

Few studies discuss the archives’ use of social media and its impact, but the necessity of
these studies is evident. There is research that discusses a discovery barrier to archive collections
(Schaffner, 2009; Southwell, 2002; Krause & Yakel, 2007). However, the majority of literature
focuses on social media usage in cultural institutions (libraries, digital libraries, and museums) but
not archives specifically. While the focus is not directly on the archive community, there is
important information from these studies as, “the social ties between contributors are vital to the
success of the enterprise” (Eveleigh, 2015, p. 78,). In order to provide a thorough summary of
social media technologies in archives, this research provides examples from existing social media
and archives as well as from museums, digital libraries, and public libraries found in Chapter II
Literature Review.

Problem, Research questions, & Hypotheses
This section lays the foundation for the research problem, questions, and hypotheses.

Each one builds upon the other. This section addresses the research problem followed by the
research questions, and finally, the hypotheses derived from the research questions are discussed.
1.1

Research problem
The primary research problem was the investigation of the information exchange within

the Wisconsin archive Facebook community (WAFC), the roles of both Wisconsin archives and
their followers within the online community, discussion content and characteristics of online
activities that attribute to the sharing of information and connectivity of the social network.1
Facebook is a multidirectional way of communication. Participants can exchange ideas and
knowledge simultaneously. Once an archive makes a post to Facebook, little is known of how that
information moves through the network. For this reason, the movement of information is the

Collection.

foundational point of the research problem. Information can be a wide array of content and media.
Facebook allows users to share photographs, videos, and hyperlinks. In addition, within the
media, Facebook users can ‘tag’, ‘like’, ‘share’, and ‘comment’. The content can provide both
context and characteristics of those participating in the network. Archivists need to know how
information is exchanged so that better communication channel patterns can be formed and
potentially more access to collections can be obtained if these channel patterns are uncovered.
Likewise, archivists need to have a better idea of what kinds of posts did well. The term
‘well’ is up for interpretation and is dependent on what is important to that archive. For instance a
post that receives two ‘likes’ and a ‘comment’ might be considered a success; whereas, another
archive might want to have X number of interactions during the week instead of looking at each
post. In addition, understanding the information movement will permit the finding of who is
exchanging the information. Understanding who is exchanging the information could open doors
to new avenues of users. For instance, in one scenario two Wisconsin archives (Lawrence
University Archive and Staubitz Archive) have Facebook pages and each creates posts regularly
for their users. Each archive has its own unit of users; however, information posted by one archive
might be of interest to the other user group and vice versa. Therefore, if both archives ‘friend’
each other on Facebook and the archives ‘share’ information posted by the other, each user group
will see posts from both archives, thereby each archive will then open the door to potentially gain
more users, and their ‘reach’ on Facebook could be extended.
The study investigated three different areas. The first area of investigation was the
exchange of information in both the content and interactions in the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community, both areas (content and context) provide a deeper understanding of the WAFC. The
second area uncovered the role of the actors involved in the network. Not only is it important to
know how the information is being exchanged albeit with different types of online activities on
5

Facebook, but it is also essential to know who is exchanging this information. It was necessary to
sort out potential other cultural institutions, local businesses, and individuals that participate in the
network. However, it is not enough to understand the information exchange patterns and those
who are generating the information; the exchanged content is equally important.
As a result, the third area of this study was the evaluation of the content and the
characteristics of the content. The material that is ‘liked’ by a Facebook user is a way for that user
to demonstrate an aspect of their personality. The more information gathered about positive
characteristics will provide suggestions to archivists for improvement of their social media use.
Social media is important. Entire marketing programs are creating campaigns around it. A
significant portion of society uses social media with 79% of Americans reaching for their mobile
device within the first 15 minutes of waking (IDC Research Report, 2013). However, archivists,
unlike large companies, do not have the quantitative evidence and marketing teams working to
uncover the interworking of online community communication.
1.2

Research questions
The research questions addressed information flow, the role of the actor, content

information, and the characteristics of archives, thereby illuminating the nature of the online
structure of the Facebook network of Wisconsin archives. Each research question builds upon the
next question, and all of the questions have relationships to one another. Each research question
corresponds to a hypothesis. This section articulates each specific research question as generated
from the research problem, and a general discussion of the necessity of each question is included.
The following section (1.3) discusses the related hypotheses.
1.2.1 Research question 1 (RQ1)
RQ1: Who are the key actors/players in the Wisconsin archival community when they
exchange and share information on Facebook?
6

The first research question analyzed who were the major players in the WAFC, and how
the players exchanged and shared information. The determination of the major players was able to
be discovered through the analysis of different online activities in Facebook, i.e. ‘tagging’,
‘sharing’, ‘commenting’, and ‘posting’. The data from these interactions provided the quantitative
evidence necessary to examine the information exchange within the WAFC.
The lack of known pathways that information travels is what is often missing in archival
science and social media research. Many archivists have perceptions derived from their
observations of how certain information is received by their Facebook friends, and some large
institutions share those statistics like the National Archive Records Administration (NARA,
2017). However, the analytics behind Facebook interactions remain largely unexplored. Facebook
does provide a very general overview of their most popular posts for a group, however, there is
little known of how the information travels from one Facebook friend to another within an archive
social network and if a particular post attracts new Facebook friends to the archive’s Facebook
page.
To extract information pathways which connect different types of interactions, it was also
necessary to analyze the WAFC participants. In this case, the participants are the actors of the
Wisconsin archive Facebook network. The actors are the social structure of the network - the
foundational pieces of the community. The community within the context of this study is defined
as those who participate in the WAFC. In other words, if a Facebook user ‘likes’, ‘shares’,
‘comments’, or ‘tags’ with any of the archives defined in the study, then that Facebook user is a
part of the WAFC.
Here the actors can be archive institutions, other types of institutions like businesses or
libraries, or individual people. Actors propel information through the social network. The role of
the actor in the context of information exchange depends on several factors like the actor’s social
7

position in the network, centrality, relationships with other actors, and the importance of social
identity. Understanding the interactions allows for the framework of the social network to be
constructed. Most importantly, information exchange relationships structure the flow of
information among actors (Haythornthwaite, 1996). The role of the actor is highly linked to the
social structure and the interactions that dictate the relationships that the actors have with one
another; however, the role of actors will vary in different environments, particularly social media
applications.
Within any organization, knowledge sharing is a part of the community. For some,
anonymity is a variable when linked to some social media applications, like Reddit; other social
media applications, like Twitter, use a ‘handle’; while others, like Facebook, use a full name. The
participation values, non-confidential and confidential information, and expressive language are
significant to that organization (Fan & Liau, 2014). These are the cultural pieces or social norms
of the online community. The actor serving as a social structure for the network regulates the
knowledge sharing that occurs. The sharing is directly related to the connectedness of the actors
of a network, and the more connected some actors are, the potential for more sharing of
information greatly increases.
Actors that share a significant amount of information are key pieces or central units of the
social network. Borgatti (2006) identified two potential problems of identification of key network
players: connectedness of the players and network cohesiveness. He added that for many
interactions that take place within a network, the true measurement of centrality may be difficult
to determine as a stand-alone. For this reason, additional research questions and measurements are
necessary. Some research specifically aims at measuring the network in terms of information
exchange. For instance, Fatalian, Nayeri, and Azadnia (2009) applied social network analysis
(SNA) to analyze decentralized structures of organizations and developed a semantic framework
8

around the structure to discover that the semantic social network structure was beneficial to
knowledge gain. Consequently, both the actors’ role and context of the information need to be
analyzed.
1.2.2 Research question 2 (RQ2)
RQ2: What is the role of the actors within the Wisconsin archive Facebook community?
The actors are the backbone, the foundational piece of the social network. This research
focused on the affiliation of the actors; in other words, actors were grouped into affiliations like
‘archive’ or ‘university’ instead of keeping the focus on individuals. Little research in archival
science exists regarding the users of social networks. Understanding the actor is a key factor in
determining who is significant to information exchange. For example, an archivist is most likely
aware of a ‘super user’ amongst the archive’s Facebook friends, but may not be aware that one
‘like’ made by the public library may have provided five additional ‘likes’ from outside the
archive’s, primary network of friends.2 This is because the role of the actor in a social network
depends on a number of variables.
Within the social structure, the actor can have many different roles. For instance, in an
egocentric network, the role of the actor may be central to the flow of information throughout the
entire network. In other words, is the archive perpetuating information to other archives or is there
a strong user base that is creating new information? The central actors are where the information
stems and flows to other actors. The non-central actors use the central actors as their main avenue
to new information. For example, Archive A makes a Facebook post. A friend of Archive A,
Friend 1, makes a ‘comment’ to that post made by Archive A. Then a third entity, a local business
who is a Facebook friend of Friend 1, sees the ‘comment’ made by Friend 1 and as a result, also

2

A super user in the context of social media is referred to as someone who is incredibly active in the participation of
that network.

9

sees the post made by Archive A. The business then ‘likes’ both the ‘comment’ made by Friend 1
and the Facebook post made by Archive A. Consequently, the local business is now a part of the
community but not a central actor.
The overall structure of the network is another role variable. The structuring varies upon
the actors and the information exchanged between that data set within the network. The structure
can differ depending upon the environment and will influence how information travels through
the social network.
1.2.3 Research question 3 (RQ3)
RQ3: What does the content of each online activity (tagging, sharing, liking, and
commenting) reveal about the Wisconsin archive Facebook community?
Due to the interactive nature of social media, there is, even more knowledge gained from
understanding the content that is traversing the communication channels in the network.
Information sharing on Facebook has many different online activities: ‘liking’, ‘tagging’,
‘sharing’, ‘posting’, and ‘commenting.’ As with any online activity, certain types of information
connect to interactions that fit and subsequently enlist certain responses. For example, Archive A
makes a Facebook post and ‘tags’ Archive B. Archive B is then notified by Facebook that Archive
A has ‘tagged’ them in a post. Archive B then has many choices. One option is to do nothing.
Other options are to ‘like’, ‘share’, or ‘comment’ on that post. There are then two factors to be
analyzed, one being the content of the actual post and the second being the interaction mechanism
through which the information was shared. Without understanding the assessment of behaviors
behind the actions or the information shared in the network, the whole picture is largely unseen.
As a result, it is important to understand what is linking actors together and to develop a
deeper understanding of the relationships fostered in the social network. One way to explore these
relationships on a deeper level is to analyze the content of what is being shared; in other words,
10

what kind of information are actors identifying and interacting? The thematic analysis provided
information regarding insight into the user’s interests.
1.2.4 Research question 4 (RQ4)
RQ4: How do the post characteristics (use of pictures, use of embedded hyperlinks, and use of
digital collections) influence the online activities of the Wisconsin archival Facebook
community?
Individuals in an online setting, such as a social network, seek to display unique aspects
and to develop a network around them that displays those features or characteristics. Adding one’s
favorite books to a profile page, uploading a profile picture, or adding a link to one’s blog
provides an aspect of one’s personality.
There are many measurable characteristics that have the potential to influence one’s
perception within a social network, like measuring whether a post that has a picture or hyperlink
has more interactions (i.e. ‘comments’, ‘likes’, ‘tagging’, and ‘sharing’), than a post with no
picture. Another factor is the existence of a digital collection. The type of media associated with a
post is a huge aspect of online networking. It is not just what is stated or shared in a post, but how
that post is articulated. These characteristics when added to a post add information regarding the
identity of the entity that created the post and subsequently make the post more interesting. The
more interesting the post, the more likely users will engage and want to interact.
1.3

Hypotheses
Social networks are complex because as human behavior is involved and there are multiple

levels of communication. As a result, the human behavior component yields a high connectivity
level amongst social network participants. The research questions generated for this study are the
result of aiming to evaluate as many aspects of Wisconsin archives and their use of Facebook. The
11

research questions generated six different hypotheses and three sub-hypotheses, which are used to
measure and understand the necessary components of the Wisconsin archive Facebook network.
The hypotheses discussed demonstrate their relation to the other hypotheses and to the
research questions themselves. Here H01 and H02 (and sub-hypotheses H02a, H02b, H02c) are about
the information flow and the role of actors. H03 examines the thematic analysis, and finally, H04,
H05, H06 evaluate the Facebook post characteristics. The relationships between these research
hypotheses build a level of knowledge with one another. The following sections restate the
research questions and are followed by the hypotheses that originated from each question. This
study addressed and grouped hypotheses based upon their connections and relationships.
1.3.1 Hypothesis Group 1
H01

There are no significant differences among key players in the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community (WAFC) in term of centralities (degree, closeness, and betweenness).
H01, derived from RQ1, focused on the information patterns, specifically how the

interactions influence and facilitate movement throughout the network. This was done to uncover
the major players of the WAFC. The foundational framework of a social network is the flow of
information whose patterns build up the chain of information flow throughout the network. RQ1
was concerned with actors involved in the social network and the exchange of information.
Therefore, the hypothesis derived from RQ1 needed to break down those components.
H01 focused on uncovering the major players in the WAFC by analyzing the actual
interactions of the actors in the network (‘share’, ‘tag’, ‘like’, and ‘comment’; which are
combined in the Mega Matrix). This was done by using SNA and finding the top players for each
centrality measurement: betweenness, closeness, and degree. More specifically, H01 discovered
not only the major players but also the top categories. The categories refer to the association of

12

each player that was articulated by this study (for instance, archive, business, cultural institution,
people, and university).
Understanding this information is the key to providing a framework of general principles
for archivists to develop an online community that matches the behaviors of their followers. It
will also provide a context for potential expectations of Facebook and the realistic reach that the
tool is capable.
1.3.2 Hypothesis Group 2
H02

There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of interactions on
the Wisconsin archive Facebook community.

H02 (a) There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of degree on the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community.
H02 (b) There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of closeness on the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community.
H02 (c) There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of betweenness on
the Wisconsin archive Facebook community.

H02 is the manifestation of RQ2, which focused on the roles of actors. The online activities
refer to the SNA measurements: degree, closeness, and betweenness in conjunction with Facebook
interactions: ‘like’‚‘tag’, ‘share’, and ‘comment’. H02 identifies which actors within the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community are the most active. All actors have unique
characteristics and these characteristics are apparent in online communities just as in face-to-face
communities. It is extremely important to know the members of one’s community.
H02 took the original interaction identification premise of H01 and added in an important
aspect: the characterization of the actor, particularly, whether the actor is a cultural institution,
business, university, or an individual person. While the isolation of one element of a category

13

does not provide a concrete decision, it does provide a starting point for archive communities to
build certain assumptions about their online communities.
H02 analyzed whether there are unique interactions that occur among individual people.
The user groups of archives are difficult to peg because all archives have unique materials but
people’s interests vary greatly. Consequently, public information available from profiles was
gathered and then grouped into categories like university, business, cultural institution, and
archive.
Overall, H01-H02 provided a link to the major players within Wisconsin archive institutions
who use Facebook. The focus of H02 was to gather and measure the interaction levels and the
actor that was doing the interacting. The more specific the measurement of the actor and the
interaction, the more information can be learned about the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community. This provides archivists with the knowledge which can possibly improve interactions.
1.3.3 Hypothesis Group 3
H03

The online posts made by the Wisconsin archive Facebook community revealed no
significant differences among the revealed subject schemas.
RQ3 focused on the content of each post. H03 was built upon H01-H02 and the information

flow patterns. The patterns revealed the actors that are involved in the information sharing
interaction process; however, the content of what is being shared is equally significant. RQ3 built
upon the RQ2 and RQ1 in a number of ways. For example, the purpose of RQ2 was to provide a
general identity about the actor’s role within the Wisconsin archive Facebook community. While
RQ1 compartmentalizes the components of online activities and RQ1’s relation to the actors in
the network, RQ3 focused on the content of the information shared within the network.
H03 was the first step to breaking down the content. Here H03 used the schema that were
developed from the thematic analysis, which aimed at the discovery of posts made within the
14

WAFC. This was important because it is significant for archivists to find what created the most
interactions about certain posts. The knowledge gained from having a better understanding of the
popular Facebook posts and different interactions will enable archive institutions to make a better
online space for all those involved in the network.
1.3.4 Hypothesis Group 4
H04

There is no significant relationship between using a picture in a post and not using a
picture in a post in terms of online activities on the Wisconsin archival Facebook
community.

H05

There are no significant differences between posts with embedded hyperlinks and posts
without embedded hyperlinks in terms of their online activities on the Wisconsin archival
Facebook community.

H06

There is no significant difference between posts by WAFC with digital collections and
posts by those without digital collections in terms of their online activities on the
Wisconsin archival Facebook community.
H04 – H06 were derived from RQ4, which focused on the characteristics of Wisconsin

archives. This final group of hypotheses built upon the other hypotheses which focused on the
understanding of the information patterns and actors of the archive community. H04 – H06 was an
important aspect of understanding the content generated in a social network, along with who is
creating the information. H01 - H02 measured the different actors of the Wisconsin Facebook
network, but there is more information needed to understand the actors. The purpose of H04 - H06
was to measure the different characteristics of Wisconsin archive institutions.
Identity and the idea of marketing or the branding of an online image of an individual or in
this study’s case, archive institution, is incredibly important in an online setting. Images say a lot
about a social media post (Kietzmann, Hermkens, McCarthy, & Silvestre, 2011). H04 measured
the influence of an image attached to a post, and the subsequent interactions that take place. H05
measured the influence of a hyperlink attached to a post, and the subsequent interactions that take
15

place. H06 built upon H04 and H05 by factoring the existence of a digital collection at the archive.
The purpose of H06 aimed to discover if the existence of more digital collections leads users to
have more interactions in the Wisconsin archive Facebook community.
The research questions and hypotheses of this study aim to gather as much information as
possible about the Wisconsin archive Facebook community. The full extent of the hypotheses is
addressed in the methodology in Chapter 3. Figure 1 is a listing of all of the hypotheses of this
study. Figure 1 also provides a visual representation of the research problem, research questions,
hypotheses, and the relationships between them.

Rationale of research
Social media has become a dominant way to share information. At its essence, social

media is a platform for people to exchange and share information. According to a 2016 survey
from the Pew Research Center, 62% of adults in the United States use social media as a news
outlet. It is just as important for an organization to use social media as it is to use a website,
particularly organizations that provide services to people.
16

Archives provide a service to people. While the levels of service and access to information
depend, to various degrees, upon whom the archive is serving; at the core, the scope of many
archives is to retain and provide access to information. Archives that are open to the public are a
part of the community, and oftentimes many of these archives will have community records stored
in their facilities. Communicating with the public is often referred to as outreach. With the
addition of social media, archives have already begun to use social media applications to connect
with their communities.
The basic functionality of Facebook and social media, in general, is an exchange of
information in an open space. Archives need to reach out to their community and social media
provides archives with that means. Like any institution, it is important to communicate with an
audience, and doing so increases awareness of one’s existence. This is marketing. Consequently,
there is a strong need for a greater understanding of the interworking of the archive social
network, but the issue is that there are few resources and studies that have been conducted that
analyze the use of Facebook and the archive community. There is a need to utilize research
methods to gather information regarding the nature of archives, as well as understanding their
communities’ social media patterns and exchange of information. There is no research on this
front that focuses on archives, SNA, and inferential statistics. Few significant studies employ the
use of SNA and inferential statistics in conjunction with the subject of archival research. The
rationale of this research is threefold: the importance of social media, the nature of archives, and
the sophistication of the research methods used in this study.
Social media has played an important role in enhancing and improving services of
institutions like archives, museums, and libraries. In one study, all 23 archivists interviewed
recognized the importance of social media in achieving their professional aims (Hager, 2015).
Hager asserted that “archivists should examine the reach and virality [how widely circulated an
17

item is online] statistics to determine their viability as a metric for “success”” (Hager, p. 35).
Asking these questions will later help answer outreach and donor questions, as well as, guidelines
and data for other social media applications. This research addressed the circulation of an item
and information with SNA.
Mangold and Faulds (2009) maintain that one should not underestimate the power of
today’s users, “consumers’ ability to communicate with one another limits the control companies
have over the content and dissemination of information” (p. 359). Taking advantage of how users
are already using social media makes the transition even swifter for an organization. Hager’s
research was only qualitative in nature, “no quantitative data exist to corroborate the reports of the
respondents, each one who mentioned event promotion said that attendance has increased due at
least somewhat to social media activity” (2015, p. 28). This demonstrates the importance of the
need for more quantitative work.
More evidence is found in the Library of Congress and their involvement with the addition
of a Flickr account to showcase their digital collections in a social media environment. In 2008
just 24 hours after the launch of the Library of Congress’s Flickr account, Flickr reported 1.1
million total views, a week later 3.6 million views and 1.9 million visits. By October 2008, the
Library of Congress photographs were receiving 500,000 views a month (Springer et al., 2008).
What small to medium sized archives can take away from these statistics is the realization that
there are many online user groups who love and connect with archival material for any number of
reasons.
1.5.1 Social media
Social media applications like Facebook permit the exchange of ideas as well as
information. In addition, the actors involved with Facebook can range from people to cultural
institutions like archives, libraries, museums, and even businesses. Businesses may choose to
18

share information on Facebook to promote their organizations, whereas, a single person may
choose to share what they watched on television that night. Information is not limited to a news
event; Facebook allows users to share different ideas.
The purpose of this research was to focus on one social media application, Facebook. This
is due to Facebook’s significant and wide use among the archive community. After 10 years,
Facebook has over 1.23 billion active users and remains one of the most popular social media
sites (Facebook, 2016). Among the general population, a survey conducted in 2011 at Pew
Internet: An American Life Project found that two-thirds of online adults (66%) in the United
States use social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, or LinkedIn. Facebook
remains the most popular, and the growth of the overall usage has only increased. For archive
institutions, it is the most popular social media site. National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) reported in June 2016 that Facebook had a ‘reach’ of 4,457,470, which
was by far the largest number of people on one application; the second was Twitter with 444,062
followers. One of the most recent reports of social media use in archives comes from an OCLC
Research survey (2013) of archive users to learn more about their habits and preferences with a
focus on social media. The survey found that e-mail and word of mouth continue to be the
primary ways archival researchers share information about the resources they discover, and that
features such as tags, reviews, recommendations, and user comments are viewed as useful by
fewer than half of those responding (Washburn, Eckert, & Proffitt, 2013).
However, this viewpoint stems from the records center approach to interaction. The users
who participated in the study were heavy archive users. There is much more to the online archive
community than heavy users. Social media has allowed for any type of person, regardless of their
understanding of an archive to go online, see a historic photograph, become interested and then
maybe even decide to follow or become friends with an archive on that platform. Theimer (2011)
19

noted that Archives 2.0 is a user-centered approach. When an archive becomes a part of a familiar
space, it allows all different kinds of people to interact (Sherratt, 2009). This study provides
suggestions of how an archive can improve these interactions.
Facebook ‘friends’ have a way of influencing one another. Unlike other social settings,
Facebook permits users to add information to the network through different avenues. For
example, Facebook users have the option to ‘tag’ other users when information is shared, thus
greatly expanding the potential size of a social network. Nam and Kannan (2014) noted that
information contained in social ‘tags’ provides new opportunities for practitioners to manage and
improve brand performance and can generate an expansion of associations through tagging. New
ways of interacting and exchanging information within the network also open the possibility to
share information from outside one’s egocentric network.
Opinions of individuals are what help society form groups and networks, especially when
people share opinions in various forms. Using social media, people can seamlessly share
information and similar opinions in a very open format. For an archive institution, this can mean
different things. For instance, an archive may be able to use social media to expand their outreach
programs or an archive may want to raise awareness to the public about their existence. There
have also been instances when social media has been used by an archive to help describe archival
collections (Cianci & Schutt, 2014). The goal and success of archive’s use of social media are
dependent upon how the archive implements and creates strategies around social media.
With social media sharing tools, the effects of social power and opinion formation in
social networks on sites like Facebook can dramatically shift hub nodes to more influential and
central nodes (Jalili, 2013). In other words, the more connected the actors become through sharing
of opinion driven posts, the more social power and central the actors become in the network. For
example, Vanwynsberghe, Boundry, Vanderline, and Verdegem (2014) analyzed the distribution
20

of information on social media, specifically how librarians deal with social media as an
organization and on an individual basis. Vanwynsberghe et al. found that librarians would often
use their personal accounts to bolster or share information from the library. The inclusion of
social media in society gives rise to the importance of SNA. The motivations behind these actions
ranged from interaction and belonging to creativity and fostering relationships. The characteristics
of those using social networks provide a huge insight into overall use, which makes the inclusion
of social media even more important.
The statistics demonstrate the growth of social networking. However, there remains the
need to evaluate those online resources, like social media, to determine connections and which
sources are utilized the most by users. Social media applications have different purposes of
communicating information. There are news sources like Reddit, special interest sites like
Pinterest, and social networks sites like Facebook. One of the best ways to evaluate these online
communities is through the analysis of the social networks. Fortunately, the framework of SNA
provides the theory needed to conduct the research.
1.5.2 Social media & Archives
Social media makes it seem possible for an institution, no matter the size, to reach a
potentially limitless number of users seemingly overnight. Archives have been working toward
social media integration as another level of service offered. The evolution of analog records to
digital counterparts in the archival profession has added a rapid change to how archivists can
present information to patrons (Gelfand, 2013). Bearman (1989) argued that due to MARC AMC
(MAchine-Readable Cataloging, Archival and Manuscripts Control Format), archivists were at
the cusp of having a huge role in how archives become part of a network, and social media
provides another opportunity. Research in more recent years has begun to identify how archive
institutions have adjusted to the influx of new technology. Yakel (2006) noted that the role of the
21

archivist is changing in part due to the incorporation of the variety of technologies into the culture
and the types of information generated. With these changes, the users are changing and requiring
different types of information. An exploratory study conducted by Samouelian (2009) found that
archivists are moving in the direction of incorporating social media tools into their digital
collections and websites and those archivists who had implemented social media had done so with
little to no plan done prior to implementation. The repositories, however, did receive positive
feedback from users.
In addition, Crymble (2010) surveyed a selection from the archival community to
determine usage patterns of institutions using Facebook and Twitter among individual and
institutional users. Crymble specifically focused on archival organizations and their use of Twitter
and Facebook. The study demonstrated that archival organizations promote content they
generated and archivists promote content on Twitter that they find useful to their followers.
Within the context of Crymble’s study, promotion was used simultaneously as sharing. The
survey consisted of 104 archival organizations with Facebook pages, 64 with Twitter, and 27
archivists using Twitter; all the accounts were analyzed separately. The study found that there was
no correlation between the frequency of posts and the growth of the number of fans/followers;
however, Crymble found that the greatest success in maintaining a substantial user community
was the Library of Congress, which has a huge number of fans and followers. Gosselar, Nye, and
Theisen (2015) and Werner (2016) have argued at their perspective archive and library
conferences that social media is key to reaching users in any format possible.
Many cultural institutions also recognized how their user groups were changing and began
to incorporate different types of outreach. For example, the Vancouver Public Library began
slowly integrating social media into their library services. The Vancouver Public Library
implemented Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, and FourSquare to connect “with users in the
22

spaces of their choosing, rather than always expecting the library’s website to be a destination in,
and of itself” (Cahill, 2011, p. 261). The library was able to understand that their user group was
changing and decided to modify the image of the library in order to meet the changing needs and
wants of their users.
In an additional related area, the California Digital Library (CDL) incorporated Twitter
into its toolkit in 2009 after discussing how Twitter would enable the library to expand its
audience (Starr, 2010). With the implementation of Twitter, the library also had a complete
website designed to meet the needs of their user community. The staff developed new links to
other social media sites as well. CDL realized that becoming involved with social media had
multiple possibilities, “social bookmarking in other words, is now an integrated part of how we
interact with the communities we serve and also the wider world of people we don’t know yet”
(Starr, 2010, p. 27). The internet has a world of potential unknown users; that idea can make the
implementation of social media exciting and overwhelming all at the same time. However, the
popularity and widespread use of social media applications rest upon the user community.
Typically, the larger the user population, the more successful was the application due to the
collaborative online communities and peer production systems (Taraborelli & Roth, 2008).
Success is dependent upon the goals of an institution, however having a smaller user base does
not mean failure; it simply depends on how that institution defines ‘success’ for them. Likewise, a
social media plan or goals should be constantly re-evaluated, especially as the incorporation of an
interactive system development around the user encourages participation, which continuously
changes.
Archives are user-centered; therefore, it is fitting that participation becomes community
driven. This encourages the transfer of knowledge to audience engagement (Russo, Watkins, and
Groundwater-Smith, 2009). Many archivists have embraced social media to harness technology,
23

improve outreach and share collections with a wider audience (Theimer, 2011). Social media has
the potential to do many great things for archives as, “…it [social media] empowers, offer ways to
help us share our mental landscapes, our memories, and identities, our heritage and culture”
(Giaccardi, 2012, p. xvi,). It is important for archives to continue to change and adopt outreach
strategies, but it is important to remember to have a strategy when implementing social media. As
Nogueira (2010) noted, while many social media applications are free (Facebook, Twitter,
YouTube), the implementation still requires time and effort.
Typically, small- and medium-sized archives have smaller staff and less time to allocate to
different activities. When time and budgetary constraints are present, it is even more pertinent to
explore the full implications of what social media will do for an archive’s online potential, as well
as for the personnel’s daily routine in the archive. A common misconception associated with
social media is that one simply needs to post and post often. Social media is not just plain and
simple promotion. It is a two-way street of communication practices. Griffin and Taylor (2013)
analyzed special collections libraries that had incorporated social media and found that rather than
an increase in interaction, “social media profiles tended to serve as one-way information
conduits” (p. 266). The context of messages is important; users should want to respond to a post
and organizations should respond to their users. As Russo, Watkins, and Groundwater-Smith
(2009) stated, “social media are in a sense self-editing, as audiences decide who they will share
experiences with and on what terms” (p. 161). This is a challenge in participatory communities to
ensure the sustainability of the group (Jenkins, 2006). The movement to online communication
makes the establishment of creating an online space important. It therefore becomes critical to
find the strong tie amongst user groups as doing so will enable improvement of connections and
communication within the group.

24

Boyd and Ellison (2007) note:
Some sites [social media] cater to diverse audiences, while others attract people
based on common language or shared racial, sexual, religious, or nationally-based
identities. Sites also vary in the extent to which they incorporate new information
and communication tools, such as mobile connectivity, blogging, and photo/video sharing.
(p.1)
The point of social media is to engage and facilitate connection. Few studies have
measured the discrete outcomes of social media in archive environments. The lack of evaluation
by archivists and the outcomes of social media make it difficult to build a strong foundational
point to move forward with interaction technologies.
1.6

Definitions & Concepts
The primary focus of this study was to examine how archive institutions in Wisconsin are

using Facebook. The study used SNA to measure the structure of the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community. There are terms that need to be defined from the following areas: archives, social
media, and SNA. The concepts described are gathered from the research problem, research
questions, and hypotheses.
Actor
Actors are a part of the social network and are visually represented by nodes in SNA. The
edge is the representation of the tie between two nodes. In SNA, points represent nodes and lines
represent the edges. Together they are the visual representation of a social network. When
describing the analysis of relationships between the nodes and edges, the terms actors and ties are
used as descriptors. The nodes can be abstract or physical and are representations of individuals or
institutions.
Actor affiliation
Actor affiliations identified in this study are people, archive, cultural institution (museums
and libraries), business, and university. The affiliation data was gathered by identifying the actor
25

from profile information provided on Facebook. SNA can measure different perspectives of actors
and their affiliations; by developing the affiliation network, relationships between affiliations and
online activities will be measured and weighed. This permits classification of actors into subsets
rather than ties between pairs of actors, thus providing a deeper perspective of the overall
network.
Archive
An archive is an institution that works for the long-term storage of records. Records can
be all different types of mediums: paper, electronic, audio, and video. Archive repositories are
very diverse and can contain a variety of materials from different subjects. Depending upon the
scope and mission of the archive, access to materials may be a part of the operation. Archives can
be stand-alone entities like a historical society or can be a part of a larger parent institution, for
instance, an archive that is a part of a university library. Archives can be public and may provide a
service to the local community; or an archive can be private and provide a service to its
organization - but some records may not be available to the public for viewing. Archives are
managed by archivists; however, some archives are volunteer-run and have no official archival
science training. Archives involved in this study are required to have an official archivist on staff.
Archive Facebook community
The archive Facebook community is the phrase used to describe those who are part of the
online archive community who use Facebook. Individuals and organizations are a part of the
community. To be involved, members have to interact and/or be a ‘fan’ of an archive page.
Presumably, these members have a shared interest in archives and/or in the subject matter of the
archive or a variety of archives. Members of the archive Facebook community interact online via
Facebook, but members of the community may know each other or interact in face-to-face
situations.
26

Archivist
An archivist is the professional in charge of maintaining and preserving the documents for
long-term storage in an archive. The archivist provides physical and intellectual control over the
archive collection. The archivist will select records, process the records, and arrange and describe
the materials accordingly. Using archival best standards and practices, archivists will provide
summaries of each collection, referred to as a finding aid. Archivists work to create outreach
programs to inform the community of the purpose of the archive and provide assistance in
accessing information.
Business
Business refers to businesses that are a part of the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community. A Facebook user can search for different categories of potential interest by enlisting
the use of searching for various fan pages. Entities on Facebook can classify themselves in
different ways. There are sub-classifications in Facebook. For instance, Pepsi will appear with the
sub-classification of ‘Food/Beverages.’ This is a classification of ‘Company, Organization, and
Institute.’ In order to simplify the classification progress, this study will identify entities like
‘Food/Beverages’ or ‘Company’ as a ‘Business.’ For example, businesses can include restaurants,
gyms, and stores, thus streamlining the process but still permitting classifications to be known and
analyzed.
Comment
The ‘commenting’ is an important feature of many social media sites. The ‘comment’
feature discussed in this study is concerned with the usage of ‘commenting’ on Facebook. The
‘commenting’ function in Facebook allows users to make ‘comments’ on a post that a Facebook
friend has made or permits ‘comments’ to ‘comments’, thus allowing for a great amount of

27

engagement amongst users. ‘Commenting’ allows for an exchange of ideas that begin with an
original post and can generate additional responses, thus mimicking a face-to-face conversation.
Community
Within the context of this study, community is a prominent term. Community is used to
define the archive community, more broadly than the archive Facebook community. The
community stretches to those who are archivists, archives, and those interested in archives and
related events. The connection that binds the different individuals and organizations together is
the archive identity.
Cultural institutions
A broad description of cultural institutions refers to organizations that strive to preserve
and promote culture. There are different variations of cultural institutions like libraries, museums,
and universities. These organizations can be nonprofit, for-profit organizations, and or public
entities. Cultural institutions are referred to as LAMs (libraries, archives, and museums).
According to OCLC, LAMs are, “institutions [that] have a vested interest in being able to share
their holdings of unique and rare materials from their various archives, museums, and special
collections in a unified way with their community of researchers and learners” (Waibel, 2011).
Oftentimes LAMs have a scope that incorporates being a part of the larger community, thus
enabling the organization to engage and ensure that important information is being collected and
stored.
Digital collection
A digital collection is a digitized set of information that stems from a physical collection.
The digital collections typically are of cultural significance. A digital collection may consist of
manuscripts, historic maps, photographs, documents, audio, and video. The purpose of a digital
collection may be to provide access to materials or provide a digital surrogate of the material. A
28

digital collection may also be due to preservation purposes, or a combination of these areas.
Digital collections refer to a larger body, such as a digital library or digital archive. Different
entities, like cultural institutions (libraries, archives, and museums), have digital collections.
Edge
An edge is a term used in SNA to describe the tie or link in between two actors or nodes.
An edge is the relationship of those actors. Different measurements in SNA analyze the
importance of that edge. Each edge can be associated with a different type of communication. For
example, on Facebook, an edge could be any of the different interaction functions, ‘like’, ‘tag’,
‘comment’, or ‘share.’ An edge acts as a bridge between all the different relations that occur
within the social network.
Facebook
Facebook is an online social networking site created in 2004. Facebook allows users to
build their own social network by creating their own profile, and then connecting with other
Facebook users, which are referred to as ‘friends.’ Facebook ‘friends’ can share status updates,
send messages, post photographs and videos, and can interact with these various items in a
number of ways. For instance, users can ‘like’, ‘comment’, ‘share’, and ‘tag.’
Organizations can join Facebook as well and build a profile similar to the way that an
individual Facebook user creates a profile. Organizations have the same interaction capabilities as
individuals and interact with their Facebook friends. The profile of an organization is referred to
as a ‘page.’ The intention of the organizations may differ from individuals as organizations have a
desire to promote and bolster the entity. Organizations also have the option of paying for
advertisements on Facebook. The ads can appear in newsfeeds of any Facebook users.
A distinction of Facebook as compared to other social networking sites is that to build
one’s friendship network, the other person has to reciprocate that relationship. If Friend A wants
29

to follow Friend B, Friend A will need to send a ‘friend request’ to Friend B. Then only when
Friend B approves Friend A’s request can Friend A interact with Friend B.
Facebook community
The Facebook community refers to the users of Facebook as a whole; more extensively it
refers to the online community that uses Facebook. Only with online communities, as opposed to
face-to-face communities, is there the potential for members of the community to interact only
online. To be a part of the Facebook community, one must have a profile page. Once a profile
page is created, the user is then allowed to ‘add friends’ with whom they can interact in different
ways and built their network. Members of the Facebook community can interact as much or as
little as they wish, there are no character restrictions on posts.
Facebook membership
A person or organization that uses Facebook and has a profile page, thereby allowing
interaction with other Facebook members, has a Facebook membership. Facebook membership
refers to the length of time that institution or individual has been using Facebook. Facebook was
created in 2004, and since that time, any individual or organization can interact with the
application. Although details regarding how organizations listed in Facebook have changed, the
overall concept has remained the same, which is that the organization is permitted to have a
profile and interact amongst fellow Facebook members.
Facebook newsfeed
A Facebook newsfeed exists for both individuals and organizations. When a Facebook
user logs into Facebook, the members of their social network will appear with the latest or most
popular interactions that have occurred on Facebook since the user’s last login. A notification will
appear if any of the user’s Facebook ‘friends’ have conducted an interaction and ‘tagged’,

30

‘commented’, ‘liked’, or ‘shared’ any post and have related that post to the user. Any activity that
has happened is available for the user to view.
Facebook page
There are two different types of Facebook pages: a community page and an official page.
An official page is the organization’s version of an individual’s profile. An organization can
develop a page that illustrates all the important information that describes that organization, much
like the Facebook profile of an individual person. The difference between a profile and a page is
that a Facebook user can become a ‘fan’ of that organization’s page, thus ensuring that when that
organization posts new information it will appear in that fan’s newsfeed. The page setup allows
organizations to pay Facebook if they want their page promoted and advertised. The other kind of
page is a community page. A community page is for non-business type topics, for instance, ‘Fans
of Arrow the TV show’ page.
Fan page
A Facebook Fan Page is similar to an individual’s profile, but for a public entity.
Organizations like businesses or public figures use a fan page on Facebook as a base to build a
network. However, instead of ‘friends’ followers of a fan page are ‘fans.’ Thus, users of a fan
page will build a network of ‘fans’ rather than ‘friends.’ Facebook users can become ‘fans’ by
‘liking’ the fan page. A user who has ‘liked’ a fan page will receive updates and notifications
whenever the entity has made a new update. Unlike an individual’s profile page, the administrator
of the fan page can pay to guarantee updates will appear at the top of the fan’s newsfeed upon
login, thus ensuring that the fan will be aware as much as possible of new information.
Followers
Members of an individual’s Facebook network are ‘friends.’ A follower is a Facebook
‘friend’ who subscribes to receive your updates. By default, all ‘friends’ become ‘followers’, but
31

the user is permitted to change the settings of their ‘followers’ by creating sub-groups, like ‘close
friends’, thereby, allowing the user to allow only certain groups of their ‘friends’ to view certain
posts. This means that those ‘friends’ who do not ‘follow’ will not receive updates about that
person or organization in their newsfeed. ‘Friends’ who do choose to follow a ‘friend’ are also
referred to as ‘followers.’ Facebook has a setup that once an individual ‘friends’ a person or
becomes a ‘fan’ of an organization’s page, information that is created by those friends and
organizations will appear in the user’s Facebook newsfeed.
Friends
Members of an individual’s Facebook network are ‘friends.’ Users can create a user
profile and add other users, ‘friends.’ Once a user has ‘friended’ someone, that user can exchange
messages with that other user, share status updates, photos, and videos. Facebook users receive a
notification when a Facebook ‘friend’ has made a change to their profile; these notifications
appear in the user’s newsfeed upon logging into Facebook. Facebook ‘friends’ may have face-toface interactions, thereby extending their friendships to an online space or ‘friends’ may only be
known online.
Interaction
The interaction refers to the relationship between individual nodes and the entirety of the
network. The interaction can be measured by centrality measurements, including degree,
closeness, and betweenness. Measuring the interactions permits the ability to extract
characteristics of the connections and the entirety of the network. For instance, interactions
examine the information flow and role of actors within the network.
Like
The ‘like’ feature in Facebook allows users to interact at a basic level with fellow
Facebook friends. ‘Likes’ are a part of any post made to Facebook (This includes photographs,
32

videos, textual posts, and ‘commenting’) and is another interaction feature. In addition, a ‘like’
can be made on any additional comments derived from the original post. ‘Likes’ serve as a
reactive interaction tool for Facebook users, and the amount of effort it takes to ‘like’ an item is
very minimal when compared to other interaction features.
Node
A node represents an actor in SNA and is the visual point in the social network. The use of
nodes permits the capability for a wide array of data visuals. The visual representation of the
social network is a huge aspect of SNA. Nodes visually represent different variables of different
actors, which can be modified to show various colors and sizes to increase the visual appeal.
Nodes can be representations of any type of actor, which may include individual people or
institutions. Nodes can group together depending on the types of measurements that occur.
Online activities
Online activities are the social interactive tools provided by Facebook, i.e. ‘like’, ‘tag’,
‘share’, and ‘comment.’ The online activities that the social network engages in are different ways
for Facebook users to connect to be part of a larger social network. Online activities on Facebook
mimic face-to-face interactions; an example would be commenting on a photograph that was
posted by a fellow Facebook ‘friend.’ Online activities may encourage additional interaction from
fellow Facebook ‘friends’, for instance, an ongoing discussion on a particular post. These
interactions are all ways of connecting with various members of the Facebook community. This
includes both individuals and organizations, and to interact with the social community means that
the user is an active participant.
Online community
An online community is a virtual community whose members interact with each other
primarily via the internet. To be a part of an online community, the community member must
33

have an internet connection. People can interact in a variety of social networking applications,
like Facebook. The social interactions that take place depend on the medium used and different
applications will have different features that cater to the community. Certain online communities
form around a subject (thus bringing the community together due to like-minded thinking) or
form around an issue.
Original post
An original post is the first post of a thread submitted by a user. On Facebook, a user can
edit or delete their post. The original post is the first in a series of posts. For instance, if Staubitz
Archive makes a post of a photograph from their digital collection, Staubitz is the original poster
of that information. Any subsequent post that appears after the photograph is referred to as a
thread. Threads are discussions of the original post.
Outreach
The Society of American Archivist’s defines outreach as, “the process of identifying and
providing services to constituencies with needs relevant to the repository's mission, especially
underserved groups, and tailoring services to meet those needs” (2016). Examples of outreach
include workshops, educational programs, and exhibits. In terms of social media, outreach can
also be used to promote workshops, education programs, and digital collections. Some archives
have used social media to have a live version of the program available as it is happening. For
instance, if an archive invites a speaker to talk on a topic, someone from the archive may stream a
live video of the talk on Facebook.
People
People refer to the individual people who participate in the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community. People were considered to be a part of the community if they had one or more
interactions (‘liking’, ‘sharing’, ‘tagging’, and/or ‘commenting’) with posts that were extracted
34

for this study. The WAFC has both individuals and organizations that are active; the people who
are members of the community may have stronger or weaker connections to the other members in
the network. People can have different motivations than organizations to participate in a social
network. This is part of the reason why it is important to separate them.
Share
The ‘share’ feature is an interactive tool in Facebook. ‘Sharing’ allows Facebook users to
take an existing post made by a Facebook friend, and ‘share’ it with friends on their network.
Within the archival Facebook network, there are a few different examples of how this interaction
can take place. For instance, an archive can ‘share’ a post made by anyone using Facebook, like
another archive or an individual who has ‘liked’ their fan page, or a person or another
organization can ‘share’ a post made by an archive. ‘Sharing’ is an interactive tool that has the
potential to move a significant amount of information because once a post is ‘shared’ by a
Facebook user, that information is now available to view by that person or organization’s entire
network. This feature has the potential for new members to become ‘friends’ of other friendship
circles quickly.
Social media
Social media is a means of communication through the internet that enables social
interaction and sharing of media. Users of social media will engage with one another through
different social networking sites. Social media allows the sharing of different information and
ideas through types of media, like, videos, images, and music. Social media brings together
different types of online communities built on different platforms, thus allowing the opportunity
for different relationships to form amongst various online groups.

35

Social network
Social network is a network of social interactions that take place via a website or other
application that enables users to communicate with each other with posted information,
comments, messages, images, etc. The network can consist of close friends, colleagues, and many
other types of personal contacts. Social networks can be built based on relationships that are
known in non-online situations, can only exist online, or a mix of both. A variation of a social
network is social networking, which is the action of developing new relationships within the
network.
Social network analysis (SNA)
SNA is a method of taking a social network and breaking it down by various variables,
depending on what the researcher wants to measure, and then conceptualizing the network
mathematically in a matrix. The social network can then be studied in a measurable way. This
research used a specific SNA method that includes the centrality measurements: betweenness,
closeness, and degree. The centrality measurements were used to discover interactions of the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community (WAFC) in terms of social structure, information flow,
and archive institution characteristics.
Subject schema
A subject schema enables controlled values created to permit the analysis of a set of data.
Subject schemas are keywords that are developed to represent data in a meaningful way. The
classification of subject schemas will aid in the development of the data’s framework. The
thematic analysis will use subject schema to measure the content of the Facebook posts. Then the
identity of various ideas and constructs from the text will be able to be analyzed. The schemas
provide structure to the data analysis.

36

Tag
The ‘tag’ function in Facebook gives users the ability to tag a friend in a post (which could
be text, a link, video, or photograph), comment, or share. The ‘tag’ provides a link to that person
or organization’s profile or fan page. When an individual or organization has been ‘tagged’, they
will receive a notification of the activity. That tag will also appear in that person or organization’s
timeline, thereby allowing a number of new opportunities for the growth of different individual’s
or organizations’ social network.
Thread
A thread is a discussion that occurs after a post is made to social media applications. On
Facebook, users are permitted to ‘comment’, ‘like’, and ‘tag’ in the thread. Facebook users can
also ‘share’ the entire thread with their Facebook ‘friends’, and can start a new thread once the
original post has been shared.
Tie
A tie is the visual representation of a connection between two nodes or actors in a social
network. The measurement of connections is very important in SNA. A line represents the
relationships between different nodes, a tie. Different ‘strength of tie’ measurements conducted in
SNA represent different ways to display variables. The various ties between nodes can be strong
or weak or somewhere in between. A general analysis of the ties in a social network will provide
the details of both the primary social network and secondary social network.
Timeline
A timeline is a feature in Facebook that is a part of an individual or organization’s profile
or fan page, respectively. The timeline features all interaction activities that are a part of the user’s
social network from when they began using Facebook. For different Facebook members, a few
days, months, or years of activity is accessible. The user and their network are permitted to
37

browse past activity. The timeline includes key points about the user; for instance, for an
individual a birthday, and for an organization, the date founded could be a feature.
Wisconsin archive
A Wisconsin archive collects and maintains records in all different types of mediums
(paper, electronic, audio, and/or video) about the history of Wisconsin, the United States, and
their individual institutions. The geographic location of Wisconsin archives is in Wisconsin. The
archive can be a part of a parent institution, like an archive being a part of a university library, but
must be an active archive with a professional archivist on staff. Each Wisconsin archive has a
different scope and mission, but the underlying commonality is the location.
Wisconsin archive Facebook community (WAFC).
The Wisconsin archive Facebook community consists of individuals and organizations,
which are interested and/or partake in Wisconsin archive interactions either online, face-to-face,
or a mix of both. The virtual community consists of members, some in Wisconsin, who interact
with each other via the internet or more specifically, Facebook. The entirety of the community is
much more than Wisconsin archives; it includes other organizations like businesses, cultural
institutions, and individuals, some of whom may be archivists and others may be teachers or
journalists. The underlying commonality of the Wisconsin archive community is the interest in
Wisconsin archives and the shared interactions that take place on Facebook.
1.7

Significance
The significance of this study is in three main areas: theory, practice, and methods. Social

media is a prominent means of communication and connecting. A focal point of archives is to
provide a means of outreach from the collections to patrons, and as social media now dominates
the culture, understanding how archives can better utilize this tool is critical. Consequently, there
are practical implications of this study. First, the production of solid evidence of the Wisconsin
38

archive Facebook communities’ social network. The quantitative evidence provides guidelines
and suggestions to practicing archivists and researchers, which will help to facilitate future
practices and social media applications.
The research method is unique in three distinct ways: SNA, inferential statistics, and
thematic analysis. These measures are all great tools to utilize when investigating the existing
structure of a social network, particularly when it is necessary to understand the interworking of
the complexities that are a part of an online community. In this study, the network was an online
network, specifically Wisconsin archive Facebook community. SNA is rarely applied to research
within archival science. Social media has been used as a communication tool in different
capacities in the past decade. Few studies have measured archives’ use of social media, which is
troubling and puts the profession behind in making strides to incorporate a sound use of the tool.
This section provides a discussion of this study’s theoretical, practical, and methodological
significance.
1.7.1 Theoretical significance
Social media is an important part of culture as a means of information sharing, and at the
same time, it has always been an important aspect for archives to communicate with users.
Consequently, it is necessary to understand how archives are using social media. The lack of
research regarding archives’ use does not mean that the archive community has not been using
social media. The theoretical significance lies in the uncovering of emerging patterns and
information exchange among WAFC. Understanding the makeup of the social network permits
the discovery of major players of the WAFC and of the exchange of information. In addition,
understanding the placement of archives within the entirety of the community is also highly
significant. For example, if archives have a better understanding of their network placement, this

39

would provide them with key insight into how to increase the number of Facebook friends, which
in turn could help to increase awareness of the archive.
The discovery of the major players within Wisconsin archive Facebook community
provides a framework for growth. Knowing the major players in the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community is a key aspect to understanding how archives can foster relationships within the
community. Currently, archivists may not be aware of key allies within the community by which
information is shared and exchanged. Understanding key allies and various levels of connectivity
and types of interactions can create pathways to additional networks outside of an archive’s main
social network. This study is the beginning of making these observations into a framework that
can be used to work toward the expansion of relationships within archival communities and learn
how information travels through different connections.
1.7.2 Methodological significance
The secondary layer of significance lies in the research design of this study. The
theoretical layer is the groundwork for the development of the key problem: understanding the
information exchange of the Wisconsin archive Facebook network and the players of that
network. In order to gather and analyze this important data, this study employs a mixed research
method with the use of SNA, thematic analysis, and inferential statistics; all of which aim at
solving the lack of awareness of archive social media use. The contribution of this study is the
combination of these strong methods to gain access to a whole area of information not fully
known by the archival community. None of these methods have been previously combined in this
manner to unlock the necessary social network structuring within archival science.
This study’s sample is unique. The identification of a subset of archives in a confined
geographic area that uses Facebook and has unique characteristics is a group that is seldom
explored but needs to be better understood. This sample, Wisconsin archive institutions that use
40

Facebook, permits the ability to investigate thoroughly the many different intricacies that are
unique to social networks. In addition, both thematic analysis and inferential statistics are used in
conjunction with SNA. This permits the measurability of different elements within the network
and unique identifiers of archival institutions. Social networks are complicated; the combinations
of human behavior set in an online setting create a matrix of overlapping and sometimes unknown
relationship patterns. Inferential statistics is a way to analyze relationships of information
patterns, exchanges, players, and the content of the online activity.
In order to begin to understand and measure the information behind it, SNA provides a
method to take the existing network and then compartmentalizes and measures the distinct social
structures - done through the basic measures of density and centrality. To measure the social
structure, a matrix was built. A matrix creates an algebraic expression of the social pieces of the
network. Using a soundly established interaction tool, like Facebook, permitted the ability to
break down all the information exchange pathways of the network, thus, being able to provide a
thorough insight into the interworking of the connectivity. In addition, the application of a
thematic analysis of the posts made on Facebook identified the themes of the information
exchanges. Case studies exist on how social media implementations have been conducted, but no
quantitative research exists that examines the entirety of an online network.
The framework laid out by SNA permits the ability to learn and gather important
information regarding the connections made by individuals and institutions within online
communities. One of the major reasons behind the push for implementation of social media is due
to the number of opportunities that suddenly seem possible. That level of integration seems
impossible to ignore, especially when the purpose of an institution is to establish connections with
patrons. Archive institutions need the insight into the interworking of the mechanics behind social

41

networks. Consequently, this study focused on a specific geographic area, Wisconsin, to
thoroughly evaluate archive institutions using Facebook.
1.7.3 Practical significance
The strategies employed in this study provide contributions that will enhance the archive
profession’s use of social media. For instance, this study measured the effects of implementation
of social media in different areas of archives to begin to identify and evaluate social media for
future use by the archive community. The study also analyzed the numbers to provide quantitative
evidence of what is going on “behind the scenes,” and the correlation to the content of the post
and the number of responses. One of the results being the identification of factors that affect the
information exchange and sharing of archive information on Facebook, additionally, the findings
can enhance an effective information exchange on Facebook. The more information provided to
archivists about archive network connectivity, the better the profession will be able to market and
create outreach programs via social media. Connectivity information provides archivists with the
insight of user interests and knowledge of which archives, businesses, universities, or people
might be advantageous to connect on Facebook.
Historically, archives have not provided a selection of research that analyzes or assesses
social media. Until assessment begins to occur, it is difficult to provide suggestions for moving
the field further. There are social media guidelines that exist for libraries, but no such guidelines
exist that cater specifically to archives. Archivists have provided case studies about how they have
implemented social media at their archive, which are all great ways to begin a social media
program. However, there is little data to demonstrate what happens one or two years after
implementation. Archivists who do want to evaluate their social media use do not all have the
tools or resources to do an effective test of their network outreach. However, if archivists can

42

grasp a better understanding of overall user behavior and social media integration, the profession
will be able to promote archival collections in a completely new way.
Archives are not as easy as public libraries for people to relate. Most of the general
population have been to a public library and understand a library’s basic function, but not nearly
as many people have been to an archive. Showcasing archival collections in a space, like
Facebook, permits archives the ability to reach out to potential users. The purpose does not have
to necessarily be for that user to one day enter the archive, but if the user ‘likes’ a photograph and
then begins to ‘comment’ and ‘share’, even ‘tag’ friends on Facebook about the photograph, this
creates a way for archive institutions to begin to make the archives more ‘user friendly’ and less
intimidating, thus permitting the archives the ability to grow awareness.
The use of quantitative measurements and the selection of a social media application,
Facebook, result in a real-world appreciation for the results. The benefit of using a mixed research
method is that applicable data will provide much-needed insight into archives’ social media use.
In addition, the research design can be replicated for other social media applications. This means
as technology continues to change, the tools utilized in this study are adaptable with social media
applications, thus ensuring that archivists and researchers can evaluate social networks moving
forward; there are no other studies that employ the same methods in archival science. In addition,
archives that have not yet implemented social media will have a better understanding and
practical guidelines to aid in the process of beginning a social media program.
Currently, within the archival profession, many aspects of social media are considered
ephemeral. No guidelines, acquisition, or arrangement and description frameworks are going to be
able to be suggested for the profession until more is learned about what goes on in the archives
social networks. It is already happening that community groups, local artists, and businesses use
social media as a main way to communicate. Conversations need to be occurring that discuss how
43

social media is handled in the archive. The first place to start is with archives and their own use of
social media. By better understanding one network, it opens the door for more information and
knowledge that is shared by the entire profession, thus continuing the archivist’s duty to ensure
documentation of culture.

Research design
The purpose of this research was to explore how archives are using Facebook. The sample

includes archive institutions located in Wisconsin. Each archive institution is required to have a
Facebook page that is representative of that institution, meaning that the archive institution must
have a lone social media page or account outside of the parent institution. If an archive is a part of
a larger institution or a historical society that has many different departments, such as, a museum
or library, but has its own Facebook page, that archive is included in the study. This study
analyzed Facebook data from different archive institutions in Wisconsin. In the context of this
study, an archive institution is defined as having a professional archivist on staff. In other words,
‘archives’ that are community or volunteer run are not included. The data extracted from the
institutions includes six months of Facebook use. In order to use the data, the archive institution
must have used Facebook by the time the study took place (beginning in January 2014 to June
2014). In addition, the archive institution must have been using Facebook for at least 6 months.
The design included three major areas for analysis: SNA, inferential statistics, and thematic
analysis. This section will discuss all three of these areas.
1.8.1 Social network analysis
In the large context, networks are a made up of relationships and connections. The purpose
of analyzing a social network is to determine, “constraints and opportunities, that he or she will
encounter, and therefore identifying that position is important for predicting actor outcomes such
as performance, behavior or beliefs” (Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson, 2013, p. 1). SNA is a method
44

of taking a social network and breaking it down by various variables, depending on what the
researcher wants to measure, and then conceptualizing the network mathematically. Using SNA, a
structure will be constructed to build the social network nodes and ties which will be used to
identify the relationships and create the measurements for the various weights which will connect
different ties. Countless studies have been conducted that analyze various networks using SNA
(Guo, 2012; Hambrick, 2012; Hoppe & Reinelt, 2010; Salah, Manovich, Salah & Chow, 2013;
Zhao et al., 2012).
SNA defines nodes as the actors (people, institutions, or objects) and the relationships that
join them together as the ties. The measurements in between those ties illustrate how strong or
weak the relationship is within the social network. The removal of social media data from its
original environment increases the likelihood that the interactions or ties amongst the users
(nodes) will be compromised. However, due to the ability of SNA to evaluate social networks,
data from social media can be analyzed by SNA’s ability to break down and then reconstruct the
network to enable analysis while keeping the measurements of the variables intact. UCINET
software is used to conduct SNA. In this study, in order to figure out how to gather the ‘likes’,
‘shares’, ‘tagging’, and ‘commenting’ made on Facebook, a series of different matrices was
created.
1.8.2 Thematic analysis
A thematic analysis of the content shared amongst archive users of social media provided
a rich description of what is going on in the network. As few archival social media studies have
utilized features of thematic analysis on social media posts; open coding will serve as the means
of analysis of the social media functions (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Theme development is an
important approach when analyzing the construction of content (Aronson, 1994; Benner, 1985;

45

Boyatzis, 1998; Vaismoradi, Jones, Turunen, & Snelgrove, 2016). In addition, on a network level,
the thematic analysis will characterize the various ideas diffused and terminology used.
The main purpose of the thematic analysis was to provide a broad overview of the
interaction contents. It is for this reason that an additional level of analysis took place in this
study. The first level of analysis took place on an original Facebook post. For example, think of
an interaction when you meet a new person. The communication could go, “Hello, my name is
Jennifer. I like cats.” This same concept applies online. In the case of an archive institution, the
interaction that specifically involves social identity may go, “Today at the Lawrence University
Archive, a class of visiting 4th graders learned about archives.” A portion of the main purpose of
this interaction is to show a facet of the archive’s identity. The name of the archive was involved,
and an activity (education about history to students) was added to demonstrate a part of the
archive’s purpose, their identity.
The entirety of the post needs to be analyzed for the context as delivered to the Facebook
users. Without the context of the post, the purpose of that post cannot be interpreted. To provide a
rich analysis of the Facebook posts, the words used in the Facebook posts were also be analyzed
to understand the context. The purpose of the additional layer of analysis on the words used
within the posts was to have a deeper understanding of the archive’s perception and overall
identity online. The analysis of the words used within the posts revealed patterns and added
context to the entire post that was coded previously, thus providing archivists and researchers with
a better understanding of the use of the social network from the context of what is being discussed
via Facebook.
1.8.3 Inferential statistics
In addition, inferential statistics was used to provide more insight into the Wisconsin
archive Facebook community. Inferential statistics allow the examination of differences and
46

similarities between different groups and subgroups. These statistics are the key to analyzing a
social network, especially an online network. Social media is so important in our lives that
businesses have whole groups devoted to social media marketing campaigns. Archives do not
have this capability but are reliant on social media as an outreach and communication tool. The
use of statistical analysis for the Wisconsin archive Facebook community characteristics was
foundational to understanding the network. Inferential statistics have been used to aid in the
understanding of the complexities of social media use (Sharma & Kaur, 2016; Riffe, Lacy & Fico,
2014; Vaughn & Gao, 2016).
Consequently, the captured data was analyzed using a series of T-test and ANOVA tests
on the previously stated hypotheses. The following factors were evaluated and compared: online
interactions, actor types, actor affiliations, subject schema, and various characteristics of archive
institutions, for instance, use of a digital collection, easy access to Facebook, and size of the
overall friend group.
1.9

Summary
Many archivists have already integrated social media into their daily routine in the

archive, changing the way that outreach was traditionally conducted. Archival outreach and
advocacy have always shifted with the influx of new technology - for example, electronic findings
aids. Social media is the next step in technology integration. Archivists are conscious of their
users and the issues involved with social media.
Outreach is a key part of archives. Through outreach, archives can spread the mission of
the archives, provide a service to their user community, and build relationships from records
gathered for the archives. A new branch of outreach and communicating with the public is social
media which has established a stronghold in society; however, how archives and cultural
institutions can foster these applications has yet to be decided.
47

More research is needed to learn about the hard evidence behind how archive institutions
have implemented Facebook. Information learned from enlisting SNA techniques, inferential
statistics, and thematic analysis can provide the parameters necessary to discover the
connectedness within the Wisconsin archive Facebook community.

CHAPTER II
LITERATURE REVIEW
Social media has extended into many facets of society and has quickly become a huge part
of how people communicate. Through different social media platforms, people interact by open
opinion sharing, the exchange of photographs, and videos on both professional and personal
levels. However, the development of an online network is not as easy as it seems; social networks
are only as strong as their network size and network quality (Sacks & Graves, 2012).
Granovetter’s theory of the strength of weak ties predicts that social networks are only as strong
as the communities behind them, and in order for information to bridge across different networks,
the bridging of information will only extend as far as the strong ties between the individuals.
Therefore, it is necessary for a constant evaluation of the medium to meet the community’s everchanging needs.
A common misperception associated with social media is that one simply needs to post
and post often. However, social media is not just plain and simple promotion and interaction. It is
a two-way street of communication practices. From the perspective of an organization, the context
of the message is important, users should want to respond to one’s post, and the communication
should be reciprocated. The point of social media is to engage and facilitate connection. However,
it is not known how that information and interaction exchange among archivists and archive
institutions takes place.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a known social media network (Facebook) and
its use by the Wisconsin archive community. The Wisconsin archive Facebook network was
evaluated using social network analysis, thematic analysis, and inferential statistics.
Consequently, this chapter reviews the relationship that archives and other cultural institutions
have had with social media applications, drawing particularly from library and information
49

science which includes suggestions for social media integration in a library. Suggestions from
related fields are discussed as archival science has few sources created from the field and often
draws on library science for suggestions. In addition, the discussion of related areas in relation to
archival science provides a larger scope of the field. Social media is also discussed in both the
context of archives and in related fields like library and information science. Social network
analysis, thematic analysis, and inferential statistics and the strength of each method are reviewed
and include a comparison of how the methods will aid the archival science community in learning
and evaluating its online network interactions. In order to see the importance of content analysis
and information flow, research that has used a combination of SNA work and qualitative work will
be discussed, and the findings from research of content analysis studies will be analyzed.
2.1

Archives
Archivists have recognized the depth to which social media has been entrenched into

society, and have started to make the leap to incorporate several social media tools into their
institutions. There are a few obstacles that archivists must overcome to successfully integrate
social media into the archive. These obstacles are unique from other cultural institutions. For
instance, archives are unique in each of their collections; by comparison, social media
recommendations made to public libraries are easier to integrate because public libraries have
many shared characteristics (Al-Kharousi, Jabur, Bouazza, & Al-Harrasi, 2016; Gaha & Hall,
2015). Archives differ greatly in not only their collections but also their patron base. In the past,
the adoption of new procedures and technology has been more gradual. However, the rapid
acceptance of social media has given archivists little time to prepare for the inclusion of online
participation. The issue is twofold: social media is being used as a medium for recording of
events, and archives themselves need to participate in social media.

50

This study focused exclusively on the analysis of social media use. The analysis of use
will lend itself to the issue of preservation of social media. Before an archive can store
information, the first step is to figure out how the tool is being used. The lack of integration
strategies can result in an absence of planning. Liew, King, and Oliver (2015) found that many
archives lack long-term strategic planning to sustain social media programs. Likewise, Duff,
Johnson, and Cherry (2013) found in a preliminary study of Canadian archives’ use of social
media that few archives were only interacting minimally in online communities. Thomson and
Kilbride (2015) noted social media data is rich with information, however, for research to occur,
the data must be accessible. More information is needed regarding social media use in archives
for evaluations to occur.
Social media research is needed for the archive community and conducted by archivists.
Evans (2014) noted many challenges that archives face in the digital world, including the few
specifically designed digital archive systems that facilitate participatory descriptive networks.
Evans made a point that the archival community tends to assume that outsiders will provide a
structure and archivists will make that structure fit as best as they can. While Evans’ focus was on
design and data structure of archival systems, the same is true for user and social media studies as
few studies focus on the archive community’s use of social media.
The archive community uses social media and both the wide array of users reached and
additional access to collections have been discussed as key reasons for social media
implementation. There have been a multitude of case studies regarding archives and social media
implementation, and an important characteristic of those within the archival profession is the
constant advancement of services provided. This was a focal point of many of the case studies
(Chute, 2002; Dearstyne, 1997; Hager, 2013; Mason, 2014; Njobvu, Hamooya, & Mwila, 2012).

51

Likewise, discussions of enhanced access to archive collections through social media have been
introduced. One way to provide additional sound access to collections and necessary resources is
to go where the users are, which is now not just online but on social media. “For archives, Web
2.0 connects communities with collections or, maybe even more conceptually, communities with
their history and identity” (Yakel, 2011, p. 258). Theimer (2011) identified this shift in archival
practice as ‘Archives 2.0’, which she argued is not the practice of implementation of Web 2.0
tools, rather Archives 2.0 should discuss the methods and innovations behind user-centered
theories. Both of which should be analyzed. Integrating quantitative research methods with
archival science and social media fits these criteria, as it is the working background of social
media which needs to be understood on a deeper level.
2.1.1 Digital Archival Outreach & Engagement
The transition into a new type of technology for outreach is not new to the archive. Prior
to social media, archivists used several different tools to represent the archive. The first being the
finding aid, which in the context of archival science is a document containing detailed information
about a specific collection of papers or records within an archive that is used by researchers to
help determine whether a collection is useful to them.
Finding aids were the beginning of information discovery in archive institutions. Findings
aids are guides that provide a summary of the archive collection; this permits access to the
collection and provides the user and archivist with a range of information, for instance, collection
scope, types of materials, and inventory. The incorporation of finding aids as access points were
the beginning of how the archivist would administer outreach through technology. Like many
different new professional changes, the development of finding aids was not liked by all. For
example, Pugh (1956) discussed his displeasure with the notion of findings aids by arguing that
there was no need to provide the public access to materials, thus dismissing all ideas of promoting
52

an archive. However, findings aids were readily adapted by the archive profession. There have
also been attempts to make archives more accessible by the addition of finding aids to archive
websites (Williamson, Vieira, & Williamson, 2015).
Incorporating finding aids into the archive brought forth a few different descriptive
standards that would be used to regulate the archive’s holdings. From MARC (MAchine Readable
Cataloging) to MARC AMC (MAchine Readable Cataloging Archive Manuscript Control), and
then later with the incorporation of the internet, EAD (Encoded Archival Description) have been
used at times to create a better means of access to patrons. Prom (2004) studied the usefulness of
online finding aids and suggested instead that the archivist is the main mediator between
collections and users in an online reference setting.
Access and interaction with users are at the forefront of questions continuously being
asked by the archival community. Archivists have been gradually trying out different means in
which access to collections and interactions with users can be achieved. This study’s purpose is
not to argue the proper way to distribute aids to users; rather the purpose is to provide a practical
output of how archivists can better understand the culture using social media, particularly as it
pertains to archives, which then, in turn, permits an additional way for archivists to reach their
users. Not in the same way that finding aids provide a means of access to materials, adding the
use of social media to the archive strengthens an access point or outreach that the archive is
currently doing. For example, Hager (2015) interviewed 23 archivists who used Facebook and 19
found the tool to be beneficial. The term ‘beneficial’ could mean different things to different
archives. In any case, using social media was not determined by Hager (2015) to be harmful to
archival practice.
There are arguments of the true purpose of social media, and questioning of the
helpfulness, much in the same way that the electronic finding aid was just the start of opening the
53

archives to more users. On archival representation, Cox (2007) noted, “. . . we [archivists] also
represent what has not been saved, the individual archivist’s own interest in preserving something
of the past, the objectives of the original creators of documents, and society’s own sense and
value of history” (p.28). Social media data is being created now, and archivists need to have a
better sense of how users are interacting and perhaps might even want to access collections. On
the future of archives, Cox (2016) noted “[an] archivist’s focus should be on sharing their
expertise with others, even empowering others to function competently as archivists. This takes
into account the influence of the computer in building more complex documentary systems
requiring collaborative solutions and approaches” (p. 13). Having more on an understanding of
how archive institutions use social media is one way to build a more collaborative space.
Social media development research has been conducted from the qualitative viewpoint; for
instance, Chern Li, Wellington, Oliver, and Perkins (2015) conducted a survey of libraries and
archives and found that reasons for implementation of social media included the want of “access
to a larger audience,’’ ‘‘reaching new audiences,’’ ‘‘rapid form of communication,’’ ‘‘similar
organizations were using social media,’’ ‘‘low cost,’’ and ‘‘stakeholder engagement’’ (p. 387).
From a user perspective, Duff and Johnson (2002) identified four non-linear ways that historians
orientate themselves in an archive: use of finding aids, seeking known material, building
contextual knowledge, and identifying relevant material. These different perspectives when
combined can in part be fulfilled by social media, particularly communication and seeking known
material.
It is critical to remain objective when developing the idea of adding social media tools to
the archive. For example, Freeman (1985) spoke of the importance of archivists knowing their
users and how they use the archive’s holdings. In order for the archive to ‘know’ its users, more
research needs to be conducted. While archivists have an idea of whom their users are, it remains
54

critical for research of online behaviors to be conducted to ensure that observation biases are not
taking the place of sound data findings.
In addition, “customer input” is necessary for obtaining information from the community
about “our institution’s level of service and usefulness, and provides us with ammunition for local
support” (Freeman, 1985, p. 93). Freeman argued that with that information, the archivist can
begin to build archival outreach programs. Thirty-one years later that statement can be used to
describe the need to learn about the effectiveness of social media as an outreach tool. In
accordance with Abraham Maslow’s law of the instrument, “I suppose it is tempting, if the only
tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail” (p.15). The shift to
incorporating social media into the archive seems to be the next step in service. For instance,
Chinery and Clemens (2016) proposed that improving access to collections through social media
was particularly important to reach marginalized and underrepresented groups. It is the level of
helpfulness that is contemplated. Stevenson (2013) found that archivists measured ‘helpfulness’ in
terms of their own archive and their own users. For instance, a small to medium-sized Wisconsin
institution found that social media was helpful by allowing them to reach more users. One
archivist noted, “If I get 10 likes on a post that I made, I consider that a job was well done. After
all, maybe I had two people physically enter the archive that day. The fact that at least some
additional people think about the archive for a few minutes is a plus to me” (Stevenson, 2013,
slide 10). Likewise, Kriesberg (2014) analyzed archives’ use of Twitter by conducting a
qualitative study and found that many archivists are using Twitter, but stated that a significant
amount of research was needed to dig deeper into the subject matter.
Social media is complex; it encompasses human behavior and interaction. The complexity
of human interaction results in the need for a deeper understanding of the foundational source, in
this case, social media. Archivists help define mass communication (Bratslavsky, 2015). Gordon
55

(1992) urged historical records professionals to learn more about how their users use archival
material and found that many users prefer informal information, as opposed to the more formal
finding aid. Social media is not only an informal way to distribute information but a media that
millions of people use. Allison-Burnell, Yakel, and Hauck (2011) noted that many digital
collections were created prior to the thorough understanding of user behavior, and thus, user
studies are more critical than ever to online success. Consequently, if archivists can grasp a better
understanding of user behavior and how to integrate social media into the archive, the profession
will be able to promote archival collections more effectively.
2.2

Social media
The strength of online communities has grown since the rise of social media sites and the

shift to a participatory culture in the early 2000s. Social media has replaced the former descriptive
term of Web 2.0 technologies. Initially, Web 2.0 identified, “participation of mass groups of users
rather than centrally controlled content providers, aggregate and remix content from multiple
sources and intensely network users and content together” (Ahn, 2011, p. 1435). Advertising,
marketing, and education are all affected by social media applications, “they [social media
applications] have become a major factor in influencing various aspects of consumer behavior
including awareness, information acquisition, opinions, attitudes, purchase behavior, and postpurchase communication and evaluation” (Magngold & Faulds, 2009, p. 358). The behavior and
interactions that occur within a social network provide a framework of how information travels.
This section will provide a detailed discussion of social media, particularly Facebook, and how
social media is being used in archives and library and information science. In addition, resulting
consequences of the adoption of social media like the development of online identity will also be
discussed.

56

According to web traffic analytic site, Alexa.com (2016), out of the top ten most visited
websites in the United States five of the top 10 were social media websites, including Facebook
(no. 1), Twitter (no. 2), Pinterest (no. 4), Flickr (no. 7), and OkCupid (no. 10). These social media
applications provide different interaction capabilities to the users. The types of social media
dictate different uses. For instance, a microblog like Twitter provides 140 characters for users to
share information. The users are identified by a ‘handle’ or username. Users can choose to follow
other users who tweet information that they find interesting (Twitter, 2017). In contrast, a social
news site like Reddit serves as a holding ground for users to share all different types of
information posted to subject defined ‘subreddits’, which is a sub-form that permits users to view
certain topics like science, health, and current events. Reddit users have a handle to identify
themselves and rank other users by a point system (Reddit, 2017). Xie and Stevenson (2014)
developed a comprehensive summary describing the different kinds of social media that are in use
(see Table 1).

2.2.1 Facebook
This study focused on Facebook, which uses a few terms that need to be defined which are
unique to that medium. This subsection provides a breakdown of the functionality of Facebook.
Few pieces of literature are discussed in this section; however, it is important to provide the
context of how Facebook functions, within the framework of social media applications.
Facebook has many tools that users can use to interact; these features are ‘like, ‘comment’,
‘share’, or ‘tag.’ These tools permit users the ability to connect with friends, potential friends, and
institutions that have Facebook pages. In addition, “users may join common-interest user groups,
organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends
into lists such as, ‘People From Work’ or ‘Close Friends’” (Facebook, 2017). Each one of the
interaction tools is described in the following sections.
2.2.1.1 Like
The easiest interaction tool to use on Facebook is the ‘like’ feature. The ‘like’ tool is a
quick and easy way for Facebook users to communicate an opinion. For instance, if Archive A
posts a photograph to Facebook, Friend A can ‘like’ that photograph post, thus illustrating to
Archive A and their other Facebook friends that they found this post interesting. Figure 2 is a
visual of the ‘like’ interaction on Facebook.

59

Figure 2. Like interaction found on the University of Wisconsin-Parkside Archive and Area
Research Center Facebook page
2.2.1.2 Share
Another interaction tool in Facebook is ‘share.’ There are two different ways that the
‘share’ function can be used. The first example is Archive A makes a Facebook post and Friend A
decides to ‘share’ this post made by Archive A; ‘sharing’ a post in this way enables it to be seen
by all on the person’s own newsfeed, which permits ‘friends’ to view recent activities of that user.
The second example is if Archive A decided to share a post made by Friend A, which would then
open the possibility for other friends of Archive A to see and share the post that was originally
made by Friend A. These two examples exhibit how quickly communities can become shared, and
friends can overlap through the distributing of information. Figure 3 is a representation of those
two different interactions. Figure 3 represents only two potential networks that could be involved
using the ‘share’ feature, but many more networks have the potential to be involved.

60

Figure 3. Sharing interaction on Facebook.
Figure 4 is a screenshot from Staubitz Archive that represents how the share feature is
represented by a Facebook friend of Staubitz Archive.

Figure 4. Sharing example on Facebook.

61

2.2.1.3 Comment
Another feature in Facebook is ‘comment.’ ‘Commenting’ is more interactive than the
‘like’ feature as it enables the user to explain a thought, feeling, or interaction, thus permitting the
capability for a variety of different people to become involved in a discussion. For example, if
Archive A makes a post and Friend A ‘comments’ on that post, then Friend B may make a
‘comment’ on the original post or on Friend A’s ‘comment.’ Figure 5 is an illustration of that
potential interaction.

Figure 6 is a screenshot of the commenting interaction that took place in the gathered
dataset. In order to protect the identity of the individuals who commented, the names and profile
pictures have been redacted from the screenshot.

62

Figure 6. Lawrence University Archive commenting example.
2.2.1.4 Tag
The final interaction tool on Facebook is ‘tag.’ People and institutions can be ‘tagged’ on
Facebook. When a person is ‘tagged’ in Facebook all the friends of that entity are able to see the
post. This allows for the potential of more people or institutions to decide to friend and then
follow the original poster. Figure 7 is a visual of the interaction where Friend A is the ‘tagged’
entity and Friends AB, BB, BC, and CD are all friends of A that could see the post due to the ‘tag’
of Friend A.

63

Figure 7. Representation of growth of the ‘tag’ function on Facebook.
‘Tag’ can enhance a ‘comment’ by directly citing a particular person or institution, which
then upon that person’s next Facebook login, will receive a notification of a ‘tag.’ For example,
Figure 8 is an example of the Ward Irish Music Archive using the ‘tag’ feature. In Figure 8, it is
evidenced they won an award, however, instead of simply stating they had won the award, the
Ward Irish Music Archive made the decision to ‘tag’ the awarding institution on Facebook.
Thereby permitting their ‘friends’ on Facebook with the opportunity to click on the award to find
out more information; in doing so, the archive provided their Facebook friends with more context
(see Figure 8).

64

2.2.2 Social media & Library & Information science
In order provide context for the need of social media integration within archival science; it
is necessary to analyze related fields like library and information science (LIS). The field of
library and information science is a very diverse research field with research areas varying greatly
within the realm of social media. Various research methods, tools, and outcomes have been
identified by research within LIS to use in conjunction with social media.
A plethora of research methods has been conducted in LIS and social media research. For
example, Anwyll and Chawner (2013) analyzed the use of social media use in libraries by
interviewing 15 librarians. The main reasons found to integrate social media into the library were
staff interest, conference attendance, and monitoring trends. In addition, Anwyll and Chawner
found that many librarians were conscious of language use within a social media climate, and
65

most librarians used social media as a platform to discuss books and library materials, for
example, new books. Similarly, Mulatiningsih, Partridge, and Davis (2013) used a qualitative
approach to discover LIS professionals’ experience using Twitter. The study found that being
connected, building networks, and staying informed were all foundational elements regarding LIS
professionals and their use of Twitter. The findings from these two areas provide the context of
the overall perceptions of social media. These perceptions coincide with changing opinions and
methods as new mediums of social media have emerged. For example, Torres-Salinas, CabezasClavijo, Ruiz-Perez, and Lopez-Cozar (2011) found a 52% decrease in blog usage within LIS
from 2006 to 2009 and identified the emergence of Facebook and Twitter as potential causes of
the decrease.
Research that illustrates and marks changes surrounding social media is significant as
social media adapts quickly. Without consistent studies documenting the changes in the field, it
becomes difficult to predict and offer suggestions for implementation and continued success of
social media. Qualitative and quantitative data is often integrated together for social media
analysis. The inclusion of both types of research methods allows researchers to thoroughly
analyze the use of social media in a variety of ways. For example, Ross, Terras, Warwick, and
Welsh (2011) analyzed 4,574 tweets using content analysis, text analysis, and a survey of a
selection of Twitter users; the study indicated with a high amount of certainty that Twitter is
important for academic communities due to the high level of integration by the community for
information sharing. Likewise, Gilbert and Karahalios (2009) used interviews to complement the
quantitative findings of strong and weak tie relationships in social media, the reasoning that,
“relationships make social media social. Yet, different relationships play different roles” (p.211).
The results from Gilbert and Karahalios’ research were able to predict strong and weak tie
relationships over 85% of the time with a dataset of over 2,000 Facebook posts. Charitonos,
66

Blake, Scanlon, and Jones (2012) used a mixed methods approach to determine if social and
mobile technology would increase the visitor experience in school field trips. The study used
descriptive numerical analysis, created a network map of tweets (microblogging) produced by
students, and participant interviews; and concluded that “engagement with the microblogging
platform improved students’ impressions, participation and enthusiasm during the trip itself”
(p.817). Ross et al. (2011), Gilbert and Karahalios (2009), and Charitonos et al. (2012) were able
to demonstrate the full extent of social media use by utilizing both quantitative and qualitative
methods, thus ensuring that the research was sound.
Research tools like NVivo, R, and Python make the integration of quantitative and
qualitative research easier in many respects. Although NVivo (2017) is a qualitative research tool,
it has the capability to capture the nature of social media (i.e. time stamps), and tracks
communication channels while at the same time allowing researchers to conduct a content
analysis of the material captured from the social media applications. For instance, one can review
and classify broad data points, but still very easily dive into a subset of data points for qualitative
data relative to the quantitative, thus ensuring that a large amount of data can be analyzed and that
the data is not skewed. R (2017) is a programming language specifically used for statistical
analysis and can be catered to capture social media data points. Python (2017) is another
programming language that can help manage large social media datasets.
These tools have been used by various researchers in LIS to conduct social media
research. Depending on the size of the data set, different tools aid in the interpretation of the data.
Compare Pettit (2013) who analyzed millions of social media posts across thousands of different
websites, to the content analysis research of Colburn and Haines (2012),who were only able to
review 100 results and narrow down to four categorical areas. Colburn and Haines (2012) got
specific and in-depth results, but the numbers are much lower than Pettit (2013). Content analysis
67

works extremely well for research as conducted by Colburn and Haines (2012) because there were
a specific library and a focus of the research, but Pettit (2013) had a much broader focus making it
necessary to expand the numbers to the thousands and millions to obtain information necessary
for the research question at hand. The richness of social media is only going to become more
complex as features within the applications become sleeker and users begin to utilize new
methods of communication.
2.2.3 Advancing archives with social media
Archival science has the opportunity to learn about how social media is being used by
archive institutions, archivists, and users. The observations from the potential research will aid in
the advancement of archives. Analyzing the work from related fields like library and information
science, museums, and even small businesses are all key areas to place the general context of how
users utilize social media services. In order to advance archives with social media, four major
areas will be discussed in this section: tapping into online user groups, developing an identity,
niche marketing, and embracing Archives 2.0.
2.2.3.1 Online communities
Large user groups perpetuate flourishing online communities. Businesses markets are able
to use social media to develop their consumer market. Social media is being harnessed and
effectively used by large institutions in part due to the large online communities that use their
services. User-generated content, such as reviews of a product, are often held in high regard
within online communities. The Library of Congress is an excellent example of a cultural
institution with a large user group. Solomon (2011) points out two major factors that prevent
social media from effectively being used in library settings; one being the lack of followers and
second the lack of social capital. Solomon equates social capital as having credibility in a selected
online community. Establishing credibility in an online community is a matter of becoming a part
68

of that community. However, as Crymble (2010) demonstrated, the Library of Congress has a
substantially large user group especially compared to other archive institutions. Crymble
concluded that the main reason was there were more users that frequented the Library of
Congress’s site in general. The Library of Congress had over 15,000 followers on Twitter in
August 2009. The next most popular archive had just over 2,200. Nothing about the Library of
Congress’s posting patterns, frequency, or content suggests it is a significantly better Twitter user;
therefore, it stands to reason that its reputation has attracted a significant number of followers.
More evidence is found in the Library of Congress and their involvement with the addition
of a Flickr account to showcase their digital collections in a social media environment. In 2008,
just 24 hours after the launch of the Library of Congress’s Flickr account, Flickr reported 1.1
million total views. A week later they reported 3.6 million views and 1.9 million visits. By
October 2008, the Library of Congress photographs were receiving 500,000 views a month. What
small- to medium-sized archives can take away from these statistics is the realization that there
are many online user groups who love and connect with archival material for any number of
reasons. Allied fields can hold a key to untapped users. Followers of the Library of Congress’s
Flickr account were either part of a related subject group in Flickr, for instance, fans of World
War I material, or they were generated after certain digital collection were added. To further
explain, Flickr has established online communities that a user can join that were created by other
users. In joining an already established group, there lies a participatory group ready to explore
more information that is related to the user’s interests.
It is important to know what social media service users are using. Social media
applications can cater to diverse audiences, some of which are based on common language or
shared racial, sexual, religious, or nationally-based identities. Sites also vary in the extent to
which they incorporate new information and communication tools, such as mobile connectivity,
69

blogging, and photo/video sharing. The significance for other archives is to find and follow users
who have uploaded photographs that are like the images one’s institution may intend to post. In
summary, it is important to attract users who share an institution’s interests and to also follow
users who share the same interests as the institution.
2.2.3.2 Growth of niche communities
Niche communities have harnessed social media tools to strengthen their connections.
There are several examples from which archives can draw: Ravelry, 4-chan, and the Brooklyn
Museum. The information shared in these networks is unique; typically, the information is subject
specific like Ravelry being an online knitting group. The contributions are created by many and
shared by even more. The theory of markets and the social phenomena that occur within the
“wisdom of crowds” and collaborative authoring is a piece that is unique to the emergence of
social media, and there is much that can be obtained from analyzing the semantic and information
networks of different communities (Easley & Kleinberg, 2010).
Ravelry (2017) is a prime example of strong ties in an online niche market community.
Ravelry is a community site, an organizational tool, and a yarn & pattern database for knitters and
crocheters. There are currently over 7,000,000 registered users in Ravelry as of April 2017. The
site was first created in 2007 by Jess and Casey Forbes to keep track of projects and to allow
others to easily find patterns and yarn. The site started with one hundred of their closest friends
and jumped to 15,000 in the first weekend. The rapid development of Ravelry was not done via
traditional marketing; instead, it was the users themselves who promoted the site through word of
mouth communication. Ravelry users blogged their way through their own established networks.
“There was no need to build a community for the site as there was already strong, existing well
connected, a network of knitters passing information among themselves on the internet”
(Humphreys, 2009, p.3). Unknowingly Jess and Casey Forbes simply created a meeting place for
70

knitting enthusiasts to meet and connect. The ability to latch onto an existing online community is
one way to generate the rapid expansion of a new site. The success behind Ravelry was in part
due to the existing audience of knitting enthusiasts that already existed. Despite the lack of user
studies, archives have a built-in set of users like Ravelry.
4-chan (2017) is another example of the rapid development of a niche group. 4-chan was
created in 2003 by Christopher Poole and has a highly dedicated group of users behind it. The site
is an image-based message board that allows users to post images and comments either
anonymously or with a handle (username, although no username registration is required to post).
Like Jess and Casey Forbes, Poole initially created the site for his close friends to use to
communicate and connect. As of 2017, the site has had over 500,000,000 posts made to the
website in various boards, although the site is considered controversial due to the lack of
mediation by the administration. At the same time, that is the reason behind why the site is widely
popular; the users are the mediators.
The Brooklyn Museum has created a strong online user community. Users connect with
the museum through several and various social media applications: Facebook, Twitter, and
FourSquare. The Brooklyn Museum has several Flickr groups. Seb Chan (2012), director of
digital & emerging media at the Smithsonian, weighed in on his blog in regards to the Brooklyn
Museum’s online success:
I’d suggest their success is a result of their existing strong ties with the local
community, of which the Flickr groups and image upload participation,
is a logical extension of their mission. What Flickr offers the museum is
many-fold. Firstly, there is new traffic – leveraging the existing Flickr audience.
The Brooklyn Museum (2012) has recognized the importance of online communities and makes
access to social media venues easy for its users by integrating a Community link on its homepage.
The community page is welcoming and the museum offers this statement to users:
71

The Brooklyn Museum believes in community and in the importance of the
visitor experience. In this area, you'll find a number of ways to connect with
us: blogs, photo and video submissions, podcasts, and more. We look forward
to hearing from you (Brooklyn Museum).
The practice of open engagement allows the user groups to connect in a number of ways. The
above statement validates that the museum finds not only its users but also its users’ opinions and
comments to be important. Grabowicz, Ramasco, Moro, Pujol, and Eguiluz (2012) found that the
more mentions were exchanged between users, the stronger the tie between them. The Brooklyn
Museum is successful in creating online communities because it offers many different avenues for
potential users to exchange ideas.
Typically, in a social media environment this means that once users become involved in a
network circle, it becomes easier for users to find like interests with other users, and can then find
different areas of interest. In a case study regarding Harvard’s open collection’s program, Madsen
(2009) noted, “When scholarly communities move onto the Web, it is still the function of an
academic library to support them. Libraries are no places for simple information retrieval. They
are dynamic spaces for discovery, learning, knowing, and creation” (p. 7). What the niche
communities, like Brooklyn Museum and Harvard University, have been able to accomplish is the
construction of an online identity that resonates with users.
2.2.3.3 Developing identity
Social networks allow individuals to connect with individuals, groups, and even
companies with whom they share common interests either personally or professionally. These
networks are no different for an archive. One implementation for social media in libraries noted
that “even though a library is an organizational entity, once it enters the social realm it is
perceived as a person and will need to act and speak accordingly” (Solomon, 2011, p.3). There is
72

no ‘one size fits all’ when it comes to social media and cultural institutions. Social media was
created for the user to communicate and connect. The user is central in social media. As an
organization, if one is not displaying information that is of interest to your user community, no
one will notice.
When an archive is developing an online image, it is essential to “develop relationships
with important social media personalities within a knowledge community” (Schrier, 2011, p. 5).
Niche markets have recognized this fact and market their products accordingly (Roberts & Roach,
2009). When a user ‘likes’ a product on Facebook, the user’s network sees that action. The user
has decided to use this product to demonstrate a facet of their identity.
One of the reasons for the success of niche markets like Ravelry, 4-chan, and the Brooklyn
Museum is how users are able to not only to connect with a community but also how that
community becomes a part of the user’s own personality. Business schools emphasize the concept
of identity and social media to their students by asserting the importance of communication both
formally and informally through open channels. Even more important is the idea of marketing or
branding an online image of oneself or institution. Christopher Poole discussed the idea of a
multi-faceted identity at the Web 2.0 Summit in 2011. He described how “identity is more
complex than the world’s largest social networks would like you to believe. … We all have
multiple identities” (Poole, 2011, 1:10). In relation, a study conducted by Gerolimos (2011)
reviewed the framework of academic libraries use of social media. He argued that social media
might be disconnecting the library’s functions into too many different facets of information.
A strength of social media is its flexibility to wrap itself around many different domains.
Social media applications have different purposes to communicate information. There are news
sources such as Reddit, social networks sites such as Facebook, and micro-blogging sites such as
Twitter. Just as in social settings, people behave differently when with different groups. For
73

example, Hermida, Fletcher, Korrell, and Logan (2012) found that when it comes to news
broadcasts, users are experiencing sharing as “becoming central to the way people experience
news” (p. 821). Another focus is on social identity. Lee and Leizerovici (2011) reasoned that
many consumers feel the need to seek uniqueness in a social network. The focus of Lee and
Leizerovici (2011) was within a business context; the basic ideas could also be applied to the
archive community, as archives certainly have an identity. Theimer (2011) noted that archives
need to represent themselves in several different online spaces: Wikipedia, Facebook, Flickr.
Oftentimes, what is missing for many small- to mid-level archive institutions is a pre-built larger
user community to draw from to build their online community.
When an archive is developing an online image, a different image may be necessary to
attract users. Poole (2011) also noted that there is no “one size fits all” when it comes to
developing an online identity. This idea holds true for an archive organization as well. From a
user perspective, it is essential to “develop relationships with important social media personalities
within a particular knowledge community” (Schrier, 2011, online).
Niche markets have recognized the importance of social identity and market their
products accordingly. When a user ‘likes’ a product on Facebook, the user’s network sees that
action. The user has decided to use this product to demonstrate a facet of his or her identity. When
a Flickr user connects and then follows a Library of Congress digital image, for example, the user
has decided the image means something to them about his or her own identity and wants to share
that piece of information within their network.
This connection creates a chain reaction among the user’s network. The more activity
from the user, the more the user will appear on their follower’s networks. As an institution, if a
user ‘likes’ a post made by the Library of Congress in a social media application, that user’s
network and the Library of Congress’s network will be privy to that information, thus beginning a
74

digital version of word of mouth communication that has been popular for many years in the
promotion of markets. In a study regarding participatory communication and social media, Russo,
Watkins, and Groundwater-Smith (2009) found that when users partnered with museums through
the facility of social media, the user felt that it emphasized the importance of the museum to them.
It is also significant to discuss the 90-9-1 rule, which in most online communities means 90% of
users are lurkers who never contribute, 9% of users contribute a little, and 1% of users account for
almost all the action (Nielsen, 2006). Being able to build a deeper connection with users and make
them feel as though they are a part of one’s institution is a paramount result that may occur from
the correct facilitation of social media. Likewise, gaining knowledge from the analytics behind
social media use will help identify the 90-9-1 rule.
2.2.3.4 Embracing Archives 2.0
Traditionally, archives have been a physical place that foster idea exchanges between
patrons; the movement to online communication makes the establishment of creating an online
space for library patrons a natural transition. Kennedy (2009) noted, “Archives 2.0 must work
alongside, but surely never replace, more traditional strands of research. In working alongside
these traditional strands, it will augment them as a synergy” (p. 9). It is important for archivists to
combine both traditional research methods with new tools provided by social media to meet the
needs of users.
Chern Li, Wellington, Oliver, and Perkins (2015) found that social media is failing in
archives and libraries but can be transformative. The fact that the environment is digital does not
make it any less credible than a tangible written source. Taraborelli, Roth, and Baldassarri (2008)
contend that the unique aspects of social media lie in the structure itself:
Users are not only able to create new social links but also to share content
whether in the form of collaborative content productions (such as in wikis or
open source communities), content sharing (such as sharing in photo, music or
75

video sharing services), content annotation (such as in social bookmarking
websites) or content-driven discussion (as in discussion forums or review-based
services) (p.1).
It is important to remember that social media is a means of internet communication that enables
social interaction and sharing of media. Interaction within the applications is facilitated by users
establishing their own social networks. When implemented well, the results are tenfold. For
instance, Cianci and Schutt (2014) discussed an archive project that used social media to harness
community outreach after rescuing 10,000 records from a sign painting company. Cianci and
Schutt (2014) noted that if it were not for the incorporation of social media into the project, most
the collection would have remained incomplete.
It is important to recognize that online environments are continuously changing as new
technology becomes available. In order to decide if a social media tool is going to be useful to the
user community, different testing should be employed. Thematic analysis, inferential statistics,
and social network analysis are various ways to work toward a greater understanding of archival
networking.
2.2.3.5 Summary
There are four major aspects to archives and social media: social identity, connection,
collection, and Archives 2.0. Overlap exists between all of the aspects. However, as discussed in
the literature, there are unique points to each that archives should be aware. To begin with, social
identity is much more than just creating a profile. Every action made online adds to one’s social
identity; for instance, ‘Facebook friends’, the action of ‘commenting’ or ‘sharing’ or another post.
In addition, responding to comments or questions made on Facebook also adds to social
identity. These actions provided insight for another Facebook user to understand someone. For an
archive, this might be ‘sharing’ a post made by another archive (an archive that might be in a
completely different subject area). However, choosing to ‘share’ that post demonstrates a few
76

different things: The first being that the archive is trying to connect and be a part of the broader
spectrum of the online world; the second is that it demonstrates to the other archive that there is
an interest in their material. This is part of embracing Archives 2.0.
By embracing Archives 2.0, archives will be able to connect and by connecting, archives
can share users. While it is true that archives have unique collections, interests overlap in wanting
to connect with users and share their story. Instead of archives focusing on their own material, it
would be worthwhile to reach out and ‘share’, ‘comment’, ‘tag’ other entities. Each time that one
of those Facebook interactions takes place, it opens the possibility for different people to know
about the archive and know that that archive exists.
2.3

Thematic analysis
Thematic and content analysis are often used interchangeably in research. At their

foundation, both analyses are a core form of evaluating variations of qualitative research.
However, where content analysis follows a structure of systematic coding across textual
information, thematic analysis emphasizes the recording of patterns as they emerge (Mayring,
2000; Gbrich, 2007; Braun & Clarke, 2006). Thematic analysis involves the search for and
identification of common threads that in the case of social media would extend across an entire
post (De Santis & Ugarriza, 2000). In addition, thematic analysis often refers “to the visual
presentation of themes, codes, and their relationships, involving a detailed account and description
of each theme, their criteria, exemplars and counter examples, and other similar details”
(Vaismoradi, Turunen, & Bondas, 2013, p. 403).
Content analysis is a method heavily used in qualitative research of social media. Content
analysis can also be a quantitative method, however, qualitative research is often used in regards
social media. Qualitative is used to better understand the context of the actions of social media
users. For example, even in the field of medicine, Twitter is used to discuss news events and to
77

make connections. Sullivan et al. (2011) investigated the use of Twitter and the discussion of
medical injuries, such as concussions. Through the content analysis of 1,000 randomly selected
Tweets, Sullivan et al. found that news (33%), sharing personal information/situations (27%), and
inferred management (13%) were the frequently used themes. In a related study, Mishori, Singh,
Levy, and Newport (2014) mapped the flow of tweets of four medical networks on Twitter and
found the collective community to be large and growing with a significant percentage of
individuals who follow more than one group. Mishori et al. suggested that medical groups
develop a more cohesive community of shared users to help users share content.
Politics is a subject that has received a lot of social media research. Himelboim,
McCreery, and Smith (2013) analyzed cross-ideological political views on Twitter using cluster
analysis and found that certain subgroups of highly connected users emerged from buried content
on non-traditional media sites like blogs and social media. In a related study, Naaman, Becker,
and Gravano (2011) analyzed different trends on Twitter; their findings indicate that exogenous
trends were present. Exogenous trends were described by Naaman et al. (2011) to be trends that
had characteristics centered on a certain event, for example, a holiday, a physical event like the
Superbowl or a marathon, and global news events. Many of the approaches to qualitative research
in social media are similar. In the end, the research is aimed at ascertaining more information
regarding a group of people to gauge behavior and interactions that take place in an online setting.
In addition, Adams and McCorkindale (2013) studied Twitter pages from the 2012
presidential candidates and found that the economy, events, and specific primaries were the main
content shared. Overall, the candidates failed to connect and engage in meaningful conversations
amongst users as many of the Tweets were transparent in nature. Adams and McCorkindale point
out an important aspect: social media was created to foster connections and communication
amongst users with similar interests. As such, it is incredibly important to know your user group.
78

Holmberg, Bowman, Haustein, and Peters (2014) found that astrophysicists who use Twitter
communicate with a variety of different types of groups in the same platform. Using sentiment
analysis, Holmberg et al. identified information sharing activities between opinion expression and
conversions amongst colleagues all within their ego network.
This study used thematic analysis to evaluate social media. However, given the closely
related nature of content and thematic analysis, content analysis research was also analyzed in
both library and information science and archival science contexts to provide a greater sense of
awareness of the method.
2.3.1 Thematic analysis & Library & Information science
LIS is a large field that covers several different research areas. Within LIS there has been
research conducted regarding the library’ use of social media. In addition, the content exchanged
in a social network can depend on the medium used to transmit information. Social media as an
information exchange medium will also depend on the application used to make connections.
Content from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have all been analyzed in various ways.
For example, Xie and Stevenson (2014) conducted an analysis of the use of social media
applications, Facebook and Twitter, to discover its usage in digital library environments. Xie and
Stevenson (2014) found a lack of standards and consistencies in terms of how digital librarians are
posting information via social media applications, and that information posted is loosely oriented
with the purpose of promoting the digital library or making connections. Aharony (2010)
evaluated the differences of tweets produced by 30 academic and 30 public libraries, including the
wording and content of tweets and the number of tweets produced by each. Aharony found that
academic libraries used only formal language while public libraries used a mix of both and that
the content analysis was broken down into information about library events, book
recommendations, the library collection, library services, references, and the library in general.
79

Colburn and Haines (2012) categorized and analyzed YouTube comments to understand if the
outreach projects carried out by a library were successful. Waters and Lo (2012) analyzed nonprofit organizations’ use of Facebook to find that the communication patterns, including
information sharing, were the main type of engagement that took place. Despite the different
social media applications used, communication and making connections are key points of online
communities.
The LIS research had practical outcomes for libraries using social media. The various
findings all provided insight into how the librarians were using social media and the information
exchanged, thus providing librarians with more background to improve their social media
exposure. Social media needs to be researched within the context that it was created, meaning that
the highly interactive spaces of online communities need to have multi-step approaches to get the
full picture.
2.4

Social network analysis
Social network analysis is a framework that measures structural relations between members

of a network. The ultimate purpose of social network analysis (SNA) is to explain the behind the
scenes development and interactions in a network. John Barnes first theorized the concept of SNA
in 1954. Since its conception, the theory has grown to encapsulate many different fields and
research areas, including anthropology, sociology, and computer science. SNA focuses on the
asymmetric ties, hierarchical structures, and unique characteristics of different communities
(Wellman, 1983). For example, SNA has original findings from Coleman’s 1986 research on
theories of social action. Coleman suggested that the system of behavior extends from small
individual actions to large actions that consume the whole community. The direction of social
theory focused on the building of the direction of the individual and behavioral characteristics; it

80

is the measurement of these individual behaviors within the large network, thus, analyzing
structural relationships and pattern ties of a network.
The strength of SNA comes from its visualization potential and measurement of an
immense framework. Nodes represent actors that are a part of the social network. The edge is the
representation of the tie between two nodes. Nodes are represented by points, and the edges are
represented by lines. Together they are the visual representation of a social network. When
describing the analysis of relationships between the nodes and edges, the terms actors and ties are
used as descriptors. The nodes can be abstract or physical and are representations of individuals or
institutions. For example, an abstract group would be subject words in a library database. A
physical example would a group of people in a friendship network; these people are the actors,
represented by nodes; their relationships illustrated by edges, ties. The path of the node illustrates
the connectedness that exists amongst the nodes. Therefore, the length of the path is also quite
revealing as it provides more insight into the interactivity in the network. The connections
between the nodes can be directional or non-directional. The lack of ties amongst the nodes
illustrates the network’s variables. Additionally, SNA has the ability to explain variation amongst
the different nodes at different points within the network. Scott (2000) described the relations
between nodes as the social positions or relations within the social network; this provides the
framework for the social network.
These SNA concepts explore a multitude of different types of research, particularly with the
cultural inclusion of the use of social media use. Within a larger scope, a social network can
consist of a community of a number of different environments. For example, SNA research from
the 1960s was prominent within the sociology research community. Today, due to the rapid
development of technology and widespread use of internet, the evaluation of online social
network communities is a common part of SNA. Within the online world, Guo (2012) used SNA as
81

a framework to evaluate media use and public agenda, to provide a better understanding of news
coverage. The relationships that can emerge from SNA can be very revealing. The integration of
social media into culture requires a better understanding of the use to provide better services to
the public. The quantitative data gathered from SNA enables the identification and evaluation of
how information moves in a social network. Through the understanding of the information
exchange, researchers and practitioners can ensure accurate sources.
This section will explore different capacities of SNA, including information sharing,
representation, roles of actors with the network, social structure, and participating roles. SNA will
also be discussed within parameters of subjects like social media, LIS, and archival science; and
how these areas can be enhanced by SNA.
2.4.1 SNA & Information sharing
The purpose of a social network is to share information. How that information shared is
central to understanding the social network. SNA provides measurements using the nodes and
edges that aim at uncovering as much detail about the information sharing as possible. Depending
upon the purpose of the research, several different measurements are conducted by SNA. There
are many significant factors regarding the importance of nodes and edges in information sharing,
all of which are grouped in three categories: representation, movement of information, and
relationship patterns.
2.4.1.1 Representation
The nodes and edges represent the social structure of a network. A social network is a
communication group, and the nodes are tied to one another based on their relationships. The
edges or ties describe the relationships between the nodes, meaning that the strength of the tie will
vary upon several characteristics. When implementing SNA to learn more about a community,
depending upon the issues, the measurements are defined several different ways. For instance,

Hage and Harary (1995) noted the importance in their work of being able to weigh different
variables to allow different points to be evaluated over others. The edges illustrate the
communication pattern, which are the paths of information sharing. However, depending upon the
social structure, the information can be shared differently. The interesting part of each network is
that the nodes have different connections with one another. As in the friendship network, people
are multifaceted, meaning there will be different edges depending upon those who connect with
members of their work network versus a family member. The linkages and connections (the ties)
represent the flow of information within the network.
The size of the social structure illustrates the characteristics of the network. The lack of
representation provides information regarding the popularity and potentially the type of
connections that occur. Networks are only as strong as the network size and quality. For example,
McAuley and Leskovec (2012) collected Facebook data and analyzed different friend circles, and
identified over 4,039 nodes and 88, 234 edges. Included in this data is what Knoke and Yang
(2008) refer to as both circuit ties where an edge begins and ends at the same node, and directed
ties where communication is not reciprocal.
2.4.1.2 Roles of actors and structure of a social network
In order to thoroughly understand a social network, it is necessary to examine the roles of
the actors. The actors are the backbone, the foundational piece of the social network. There are
many variables that create the structure. Actors propel information through the social network.
The role of the actor in the context of information exchange depends on several factors like the
actor’s social position in the network, centrality, relationships with other actors, and the
importance of social identity.
Within the structure of a social network, the actor can have different roles. For instance, in
an ego-centric network, the role of the actor may be central to the flow of information throughout
83

the entire network. The central actors are where the information stems and flows to other actors.
The non-central actors use the central actors as their main avenue to new information. Key players
of a network can be identified in different ways. Depending upon the type of information being
shared, node centrality, group centrality, or peripheral centrality may be employed. The
algorithms applied to the network, which quantifies the actors of a network, simply depends on
the perspective wished to be used. The structuring will also vary upon the actors and the
information that is being exchanged between that data set within the network. The structure can
differ depending upon the environment and will influence how information travels through the
social network. It is not only how the information is exchanged but also the type of information
that is a crucial variable. For example, Magni, Angst, and Agarwal (2012) investigated behaviors
of team network structure and technology use behaviors and found that advice-seeking ties were
strongly linked to increased technology usage in the financial services sector. This means that the
roles of actors both rely on and are fostered by the type of network environment.
Knowledge sharing and management is an integral part of any organization and social
structure. However, knowledge sharing is a difficult task for many organizations to do
successfully. Understanding the social structure surrounding the organization is key to gaining
information about social groups. The social context dictates the kind of information that is shared
in the network. Cruz, Bothorel, and Poulet (2014) aimed at uncovering community detection on a
social media application like Twitter to gain knowledge of the online community and social
networking methods. Cruz et al. (2014) discovered that members of a community that had
interests that were similar but not the same with those from other communities were more likely
to bridge the gap between the two communities.
The roles of actors in social networks can influence other actors. Brown, Dennis, Burley,
and Arling (2013) analyzed the role of the actor, specifically those involved in a Canadian
84

working Canadian’s workman’s compensation board, to find that the size of the individual’s
social network influenced the value of person-to-person knowledge sharing. As their social
network grew, individuals were more likely to bypass the knowledge management system and
seek out information from their own social network. The reasons behind why different
communities exchange information, paths outstretching one community to another, requires
analysis of a multitude of different types of data. Analyzing the participating roles of actors in a
social network is one way to understand the exchange.
2.4.1.3 Participating roles
The interactions that occur on a social network begin and end with the actors. A number of
different types of interactions can take place between the actors, depending upon the network
environment. Borgatti, Everett, and Johnson (2013) noted that information that is exchanged
could extend to intangible ideas like beliefs, attitudes, and norms. The relational cognition that is
structured into social networks is part of the ties that bind or remove connections that actors have
and feel toward one another. For example, on Facebook, actors can ‘share’, ‘comment’, ’tag’,
‘post’, and ‘like.’ The high rate of potential interaction greatly increases the type of participation,
“the most typical form of participation consists of posting ideas. However, community users can
also reﬁne, improve or criticize a previously posted idea by posting comments associated with this
idea” (Martínez-Torres, 2014, p. 437).
These different ways of participation provide an insight into the everyday interactions and
values of the actors. Other studies have analyzed the importance of SNA to real world scenarios.
For example, Batool and Niazi (2014) sought to discover the information flow of a social
friendship network of people involved with a karate club. Batool and Niazi (2014) identified key
nodes and analyzed patterns on different centrality patterns and determined that high closeness

85

centrality nodes and high degree centrality were highly responsible for the information flow of a
social friendship network.
The interaction among actors can be different in an online community. There are many
definitions of what constitutes an online community. Chau (2010) stated that a participatory
culture is defined by five distinct characteristics:
1. Relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement
2. Strong support for creating and sharing one’s projects
3. Informal mentorship
4. A belief that contributions matter
5. A sense of social connection
Together these traits foster an environment that has become an essential part of society and social
networks. The values that are central to the actors are also a key point to understanding how the
social network connects. A certain amount of trust is also needed for the user to communicate
freely online. Trust is often attributed in the same manner as being considered a credible source,
as networks are only as strong as the network size and quality.
2.4.2 Social network analysis & Social media
SNA is paramount to the understanding of the actions and reactions of network members.
Tichy, Tushman, and Fombrun (1979) recommended that organizations begin to utilize the
theoretical framework to help identify patterns and conceptualizations within the organization. In
order to aid in the identification of framework patterns, SNA was adopted as a process. The
importance of SNA is of great significance in today’s research due to the influx of technology and
social media use. With SNA, researchers have the capability to learn more about online
communities. The structure of the web lends itself to a strong connectivity framework. The
capabilities of individuals to connect through sequences of undirected paths have a significant
86

influence on the reachability of information. Gruzd and Wellman (2014) argued that “social
influence has become networked influence…by occurring on social networks and by propagating
through online communication networks” (p. 1251). SNA was developed to analyze face to face
groups; however, it lends itself well to the online world. It is the data gathering process that is the
most different; consequently, special care should be taken to learn the roles of the actors within
these networks to better understand potential variables.
2.4.2.1 Role of actors in social media
The type of actor has a huge impact on the type of information that is being exchanged.
Freeman (1979) discussed the structural centrality of social networks (absolute, relative, and the
entirety of the social network) and these established concepts paved the way for the prospect of
social media and information continuation. For instance, Facebook and Twitter permit the
exchange of ideas as well as information. In addition, the actors involved on Facebook can range
from people to institutions, like archives, libraries, museums, and businesses. As a result,
institutions may choose to share information on Facebook for promotion and marketing, whereas,
a single person may choose to share what they watched on television that night. Information is not
limited to a news event; social media allows actors to share a number of different ideas.
Haythornthwaite (1996) noted that the information relationships tell what kind of information is
being exchanged; the patterns that are created between the actors reveal what kind of information
is being exposed to which actors.
The information distribution among actors is a concern of various aspects of SNA research.
Bechmann and Lomborg (2013) demonstrated that in terms of information found on social media,
oftentimes, it is very user-centric and invested heavily in value creation. Given that the values of
the actor drive the purpose of social media, the role of the actor is related directly to production
and usage of information exchanged in social media environments. The flow of information in a
87

social network depends on different variables. The actors and the relationships between different
actors are one aspect. However, social media adds additional factors that add weight to the actors’
influence. Unlike other social settings, social media permits users to add information to the
network through different avenues. For example, on Facebook users are also allowed to ‘tag’
other users when information is shared.
In order to gain more knowledge about what shapes societal relationships, it is necessary
to examine the context of what is being shared in the network, rather than just analyzing the
relationships and connections.
2.4.3 SNA & LIS
The development of the International Network for Social Network Analysis in 1978
opened the door for different fields like LIS to expand research boundaries in SNA (INSNA,
2016). In an analysis of information scientists’ use of SNA, Otte and Rosseau (2002) found that as
early as 1972, pattern analysis was being conducted in relation to information transfers. LIS has
since expanded the use of SNA as a method and now encompasses different capacities: user
studies involving behavior and connections, system development, and visualization. These
research areas are also intertwined with an array of subjects that are covered by LIS researchers
ranging from sports and health to psychology. The practical side of LIS research is that it is a field
that has many practitioners in addition to researchers. The practicality of LIS calls for a need of
SNA to aid in the understanding of social media.
Behavior and connections have been analyzed in conjunction with social media.
Measurements proposed by SNA provide a toolset that enables the researcher to explain the
variation between the nodes and edges in knowledge and information sharing. The level of
analysis that takes place is completely dependent upon the research. Terblanche (2014) gathered
data from a sports team and used SNA to identify coaching communication patterns to aid in the
88

selection of good coaching candidates. Other types of information sharing can take place online;
this prospect is of importance due to the increase of mutual communication and maintained
relationships found in social networking sites like Facebook (Easley & Kleinberg, 2010).
Likewise, in the larger scheme of things, information sharing embedded within SNA, provides a
communication network that describes the cognitive social structure of different networks.
Kumbasar, Romney, and Batchelder (1994) found that individuals who see themselves more
central within their own personal networks; these networks are often referred to as ego networks.
LIS is concerned with the behavior of information and usability of that information
(Borko, 1968). LIS combined with SNA elicits research concerning connections amongst the
foundation of SNA: the nodes and edges. When researched, it is these connections that can yield
interesting results, particularly as relationships among nodes may show areas of isolation or dense
areas of activity. For example, Hambrick (2012) used SNA to explore sport social networks and
found that the integration of SNA for those involved in the sports industry promote products
through Twitter. Hambrick (2012) illuminated the interworking of athletes, teams, and entire
leagues through their use of Twitter, and found that users with numerous relationships can serve
as information hubs, thus increasing the lasting life of a message posted. Knoke and Yang (2008)
also noted that there are significant differences between a “friendship network among office
employees . . . and their advice-seeking network” (p.8). These relationship patterns are the social
structure of the network. The measurement of the nodes and edges unveils the characteristics of
the network.
In addition, in SNA, the nodes and edges are how information is posted to a network,
which is another critical area of LIS research -the flow of information. Nodes and edges are
significant to the understanding of how information is shared on the social network. The
information shared throughout the network is based upon the edges that are pre-established.
89

However, due to the nature of interactivity within social media applications, more nodes have the
possibility to see more information in their network depending upon who shares what
information. This prospect is very different compared to the bulletin board concept, where a
person would only see information if they happened to pass by that board. Social media
applications open the door to more and more people and institutions (nodes) to view new
information based upon their network connections or the edges. Communication patterns were
much more simplified. Rolland and Parmentier (2013) took the concept of bulletin boards as a
concept of communication and applied it to modern day social media, compared both concepts
within a SNA framework, and explored another avenue of SNA. Interestingly, Rolland and
Parmentier (2013) discovered that the power found in social media applications was key due to
the continuum of communication and additional networks nodes that were established over time.
However, to understand the social network, it is not enough to investigate the nodes and
edges; a deeper level of analysis is needed. As nodes and edges are representations of the actors
and ties of the social network, it is necessary to discuss the potential roles in the constructs of the
information exchange. For instance, Ingwersen (1996) found that to provide the best possible
access to information, a multitude of behaviors have to be accounted for within a system. These
behaviors can be analyzed using sentiment and regression analysis. Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan
(2013) analyzed behavior on Twitter and found that users post emotionally charged tweets, and
many of those tweets were often re-tweeted more than less emotionally charged tweets. Thus,
emotions and the information diffusion in social media environments deserve more analysis as retweeting is a powerful tool for information sharing. In addition, Singh (2013) found that a group
of undergraduate students used Facebook groups without hesitation to communicate and share
information. The information shared brought in sources from outside social media applications,
for instance, links, videos, and blogs. Together this information sheds light on users’ behavior on
90

different social mediums and provides researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of
users’ needs.
Finally, whole knowledge systems can also be analyzed using SNA and the relationships
and connections that can emerge can be quite revealing. It is imperative that systems continue to
change with users’ needs to keep up with demand. Zhang, Zhai, Stevenson and Xia (2016) made
recommendations for an improved U.S. Agriculture Department of Economic Research Service
portal after measuring the related connection optimization of the system. It was discovered using
SNA that a large knowledge system, like the World Health Organization (WHO), integrated
connections between the semantic and link navigation guidance protocol that needed
improvement (Zhang, Zhai, Lui, & Stevenson, 2016). Likewise, Akdag Salah, Manovich, Salah
and Chow (2013) analyzed user-generated content that applied to different mediums, i.e. videos,
games, images. The concept that Akdag Salah et al. (2013) merged was media visualization as
framed with social network analysis. The relationships revealed through social network analysis
can shed light on areas that are very subject specific.
LIS and SNA research uses a plethora of various methods and explores a variety of
different areas. Together, this research provides a foundational point to continue to expand SNA
research in several different capacities. SNA has the potential to unlock a large amount of
information; related subject areas like archival science can use this research to begin their own
SNA work.
2.4.4 SNA & Archives
Archives have a great deal to gain from the incorporation of SNA. Palmer (2009) discussed
that Archives 2.0 is much more than the adoption of a participatory community, and echoed many
others by adding that it was time for an epistemological shift in archival practice. SNA is a
powerful tool that permits the discovery of the intricacies of social networks, a tool that like in the
91

field of LIS, aids in the interpretation of online communities. The inclusion of SNA would provide
more insight into the usage patterns of social media. One distinct feature that social media has
fostered is how users choose and identify various groups, subjects, and products online.
Information learned from enlisting social network analysis techniques can provide the parameters
necessary to discover the connectedness between archival institutions.
There is already a participation in various online communities. In 2015, at the Archival
Education Research Institute (AERI), Dr. Ferriter from the Smithsonian Transcription Center
discussed the incorporation of social media to push an experimental transcription project, which
was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback and results. The Smithsonian project called for
users to transcribe materials from the archive. The project was promoted through various social
media applications, including Facebook, Twitter, and blogging. Prior to social media, archives
communicated like many other professions through Web 1.0 methods and word of mouth
networks (WOM). Archival communities are typically smaller in the core group of participants,
especially when compared to librarian communities and the attendance differences between the
Society of American Archivists (SAA) annual meeting and the American Library Association
(ALA) annual meeting, wherein 2014 and 2013 ALA had 14,282 and 26,362 attendees; SAA had
2,579 and 1,668 respectively.
However, like other niche communities, the size of the network does not mean that it
should not be studied. The importance of nodes within a network can illustrate so many different
characteristics. For instance, Sparrowe, Liden, and Kraimer (2001) wanted to learn more about
how individual’s network positions within a work group may influence their job performance.
The study determined that those individuals who had a central role in working groups had much
higher levels of positive job performance. Conversely, if archives can identify what their network
position is within their social group through more information regarding connections, they can
92

increase the number of Facebook friends which can be crucial for increasing the performance of
the archive within social media. The identification of interaction patterns within relationships is
one way to measure the effectiveness of what the archives are doing on a social network. For
instance, effectiveness could mean that archive institutions are interacting online and sharing a
user base which then provides the ability to grow one’s user base. The effectiveness also helps the
researcher identify key players on a social network.
Archivists have implemented social media. What is needed now is more information,
meaning statistics and network behavior of archives on Facebook regarding the use and the postimplementation process. The more information that is gained from learning about archivist’s daily
social media routines, the more quickly the profession can grow and adapt guidelines or principles
to aid the process.
2.4.5 SNA studies that combine qualitative work
SNA is considered a quantitative method; however, given the interactivity especially when
working with social media, integrating qualitative methods strengthens the research. For example,
Zupan and Kaše (2007) examined the social system configurations that were part of a human
resources social network and the identified actors that constituted the knowledge network.
Combing both quantitative and qualitative methods, Zupan and Kaše measured relationships
within the social network that were found to be a part of the knowledge creation. The qualitative
aspect of the network is necessary to better understand motivations and behaviors behind actions.
Both qualitative and quantitative methods can identify not only the structural position of
the actors but understand better the communication channels of the actors. Wood et al. (2014)
employed the use of SNA to analyze a farmer knowledge exchange in a farming network. Using
both qualitative interviews and the quantitative side of SNA measurements, Wood et al.
investigated on a deep level the communication practices of farmers. This type of information is
93

not easily extracted from the SNA measurements. SNA permits the measurement of the network,
and the flow of information can be seen; then once patterns are identified, members of that
network can be interviewed. In a related study, Greuling and Kilian (2014) used a mixed-method
approach to analyzing the use of blogs and discovered bloggers’ need to interact with other
bloggers. They were then able to cluster the content analysis findings to calculate the degree of
interaction of the bloggers.
Creating a mixed-method approach with SNA and social media is a sound way to extract
important details about the network. In these details, a significant amount of practical information
can be extracted. In order to take the analysis to the next level, content analysis of those
interactions should be conducted.
2.4.5.1 Content analysis of information flow in a network
There is a myriad of information gained through the measurements supported by SNA,
such as, interaction patterns and which actors have the most influence in a network. However, due
to the interactive nature of social media, there is even more knowledge gained by understanding
the content that is traversing the communication channels in the network. The information shared
in a social network can be exchanged in different ways. Without understanding the assessment of
behaviors behind the actions or the information shared in the network, the entire picture is left
largely unseen. For example, the relationships in SNA are the central aspect. As a result, it is
important to understand what is linking actors together and to develop a deeper understanding of
the relationships fostered in the social network.
One way to explore these relationships on a deeper level is to analyze the content of what
is being shared; in other words, what kind of information are actors identifying and interacting.
Myneni, Kayo, Cobb, and Cohen (2015) analyzed an online community that worked toward
smoking cessation. In addition to the network analysis, Myneni et al. (2015) were particularly
94

interested in the driving force that kept the group together. This information could only be
extracted through the examination of the content of the posts. Similarly, research conducted
surrounding learning and interactive environments combined content analysis with SNA to
discover the learning process among student groups (Shea et al., 2013).
Understanding the flow of information is an important aspect to understanding online
communities. SNA provides the basic structure of how that information is moving. It is the content
analysis, however, that provides information regarding insight into the user’s interests or, on a
larger scale, the group’s interests. Once knowledge is gained about the group’s interests,
improvements and suggestions can be provided to encourage participation and activity within the
group. These two aspects would be highly beneficial for the archival science community.
2.5

Summary
SNA, inferential statistics, and thematic analysis all are crucial for archives to better

understand social media. Social media is as important as having a website or phone, as it offers
many new ways to communicate and connect in an online setting. Consequently, more study is
needed to learn about the hard evidence behind how archives have implemented social media and
the cost-benefit analysis of what the free applications have accomplished.
Archives 2.0, online engagement and outreach are all in progress. LIS and marketing
research provide some basis for archivists to move forward, but it is crucial for research to be
conducted for archivists by archivists. Social media has established a stronghold in society. How
archives can foster these applications has yet to be decided. Online communities form around
niche areas, and these communities have an identity that is central to their purpose. Archives can
embrace their identity to help harness the new generation of archival users. In order to accomplish
this goal, SNA, inferential statistics, and thematic analysis can be used to analyze archive’s use of
social media.
95

Likewise, social media can be studied from a number of different points of view.
Quantitative and qualitative research methods provide researchers with a multitude of different
avenues to approach analysis. However, researchers need to be cautious when working with social
media data, as it can easily be removed from its interactive context, thus losing important aspects
of the online community. It is important to have a basic understanding of social media and the
behaviors behind it when working with data. The movement of information and information flow
of a network illustrate many characteristic behaviors of that community.
The integration of SNA is an immensely important factor in moving archival science and
social media research forward. Collaboration in an online setting is just as critical, if not more so,
as in a traditional sense. One of the best ways to learn how online collaboration is taking place is
through the analysis of social networks. Outreach is a critical part of an archive; archivists are
already using social media as a tool. The more information gathered regarding use, the more
capable the profession will be in the harnessing of social media and moving forward.

CHAPTER III
METHODOLOGY
This chapter provides the detailed methodology of the study. The methods direct the
research goals. In the first chapter, the research questions, problems, hypotheses outlined the basic
principles of the study. The foundational and significant methods of this study are SNA, inferential
statistics, and thematic analysis. In addition, the uniqueness of the sample, archives, is a lesserstudied area when quantitative methods are applied. The movement of information within a social
network is complicated. Human behavior can be difficult to measure, particularly in an online
setting. The ways that people communicate continuously evolve, as technology becomes more
sophisticated. People want to share information. Social media is now a significant medium for the
sharing of that information. Archives have always been about being able to share information with
users and archivists have been using social media for some time, however, the statistics and how
information moves through the network remains highly unreported. Consequently, it is necessary
to analyze how archives use social media. This chapter discusses the specifications for analyzing
one specific group — Wisconsin archives and their use of Facebook. The analysis conducted
included SNA, inferential statistics and thematic analysis. The application of inferential statistics
analyzed the intricacies of the various interactions, thus providing archivists with real numbers.
The thematic analysis provided an output of the content that was being discussed — a huge
advancement for archivists in knowing what their users are most interested.
3.1

Social network analysis
Social systems consist of networks. Broadly speaking, networks are made of relationships

among entities; these entities can be people, archives, businesses, and cultural institutions. Basic
network theory states, “an actor’s position in a network determines in part the constraints and
opportunities that he or she will encounter, and therefore identifying that position is important”
97

(Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson, 2013, pg. 1). The structural relations and their relation to one
another are the central aspects of SNA. Understanding an archive’s position within the archive
Facebook community is critical to learning how interactions between archives and users can be
improved and how content is suited to the needs of the community, thus providing archives with
the necessary tools for continuing to be a service to the community.
This section addresses the foundational framework of SNA, including the definitions and
overall structure. The section also discusses measurements conducted in SNA to study network
characteristics. The measurements used in this study are discussed in detail.
Nodes & Edges
SNA has a focus on social networks; the terms used for the acting bodies within the
network are nodes/actors. Actors are the entities in the network; nodes are their visual and
mathematical representations. For example, a node may be a university archive. The relationship
between two or more nodes is a tie. There are different types of ties. An archive node may have a
collegiate tie with another node that is representative of a university archive. For instance, there
are two nodes, Lawrence University Archive (node A) and Staubitz Archive (node B), which are
represented in Figure 9. The first line displays the nodes, with the name associated; the second
line displays the nodes as represented by a single letter, which is common practice in SNA. As
both archives are part of a university library, the nodes are represented by the color blue. The size
of each node is the same as there are no measurable characteristics in the figure.
One archive institution can have a Facebook account; the people at that archive institution
can also have personal accounts. For instance, Carthage College can have a Facebook account,
and archivists working at Carthage College can have their own personal accounts. Wisconsin
archive institutions and archivists with valid Facebook accounts are actors in the network. All of

98

the actors are treated as nodes within the network, “nodes can be all kinds of entities – monkeys,
firms, countries and so on” (Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson, 2013, p. 30).

Figure 9. Nodes in the Wisconsin Archive Facebook network.
In Facebook, if Lawrence University Archive ‘comments’ on a post made by Staubitz
Archive, there are two nodes, Lawrence University Archive and Staubitz Archive. The ‘comment’
made serves as the tie that links these two nodes together.
However, that tie must also be represented mathematically in SNA. The mathematical and
visual representative of a tie, referred to as an edge, connects vertices in a graph. An edge
between two nodes illustrates a relationship. The edge between Lawrence University Archive
(node A) and Staubitz Archive (node B) is represented in Figure 10. Various edges can have
different implications for the nodes in the social relation. The illustration of the node and edge
representations is conducted in graphs.

Figure 10. Edges in the Wisconsin Archive Facebook network.
Directed graph
SNA uses graph theory to conceptualize a network, graph meaning, that ‘graph’ refers to a
mathematical object and not any kind of diagram (Harary, 1969). Graphs can be directed or nondirected. Directed graphs indicate different aspects of the relationships within the network. Here
99

in Figure 11, the representation is node A and node B and the interaction that took place on
Facebook between Lawrence University and Staubitz Archive. As Lawrence University (node A)
made a ‘comment’ to a post made by Staubitz (node B), the arrow represents that ‘comment’ on
Facebook.

Figure 11. Directed graph for nodes A and B in the Wisconsin Archive Facebook network.
In the directed graph, nodes A and B are connecting vertices, because the edges between
the nodes are connected by an interaction or some kind of tie. Figure 11 is a small network, but a
network nevertheless, and the larger the network, the larger the graph. The expression remains the
same. In Figure 12, Lawrence University (node B) makes a post to Facebook. Staubitz Archive
(node A) ‘commented’ on the post. Also in that post, UW-Madison Archive (node D) is ‘tagged’.
UW-Madison Archive ‘shared’ that post with their ‘friends’, which permits UW-Green Bay
Archive (node C) to see the post. Then UW-Green Bay Archive ‘likes’ the post made by
Lawrence University (node B). The vertices, V, for the directed graph in Figure 12 are {A, B, C,
D} and ordered pairs, edges or E, {(A, B), (B, D), (D, C)}.

For each graph, a matrix mathematically represents the graph. The mathematical
representation of Figure 12 is shown in Table 2. Here in the 4x4 adjacency matrix, the interaction
that occurred in the network is labeled with ‘1’. No interactions are indicated with ‘0’. Table 2 is
an adjacency matrix as it represents who is adjacent to whom. The matrix is also asymmetric as it
represents directed ties, ties that go from a source to a receiver.

Undirected graphs
Figure 13 is an example of an undirected network. Here information is not directed
through any particular order through any node, {A, B, C, D}. The nodes in Figure 12 are the same
as in Figure 13; however, the interpretation is different. Instead of node A indicating the start of
101

the information exchange, Figure 13 shows that nodes {A, B, C, D} are connected, the path that
the direction information was exchanged is unknown. The undirected graph matrix is represented

network. The recipient and sender are unknown in Table 3.
Measurements & Degree centrality
The main aspect of graph theory is the ability to discover the prominent actors in the social
network. There are three main centrality measures degree centrality, closeness, and betweenness
(Freeman, 1979). All three of these measures are used in this study. Networks can be analyzed in
a number of ways, both visually and mathematically. Using a matrix, the social network data can
measure centrality: degree, betweenness, and closeness.

Centrality measures the vertices (nodes) in a graph, it is “a property of a node’s position in
a network” (Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson, 2013, p. 164). Using centrality measurements, the most
influential nodes in the network can be identified. The distance between two nodes is the length of
a path. The more central a node is the more influence that node has on the network. A central
node can influence others in the network through the sharing of information.
In social media, information and relations are made and directed in different ways, and
these pathways can be and measured in order to learn more about the studied network.
Centrality uncovers the overall flow of information through the network; the most central actors
are able to be observed. Statistical methods like ANOVA tests are commonly used to measure the
centrality between different variables in the network. For instance, using an ANOVA test to
calculate the centrality in the Wisconsin archive Facebook network uncovers which group of
actors (people, businesses, cultural institutions, archives) are the most central in the network.
Degree centrality
Figure 14 is an example of the multidirectional pathways that information can travel in
social media.

Figure 14. New directed graph of Wisconsin Archive Facebook network.
Each node has a degree, which is the number of other nodes it shares with an edge in the
network. The degree centrality is the total number of connected ties. There is an in_degree
103

measure and an out_degree measure; in_degree is the number of ties directed to the node and
out_degree is the number of ties directed to other nodes. Degree centrality is also dependent on
the size of the network, meaning that the “larger the network, the higher the maximum possible
degree centrality value…either an actor is well connected within a small network, or that it is only
connected to just a few others within a large network” (Knoke & Yang, 2008 p. 63). For example,
in Figure 14, Staubitz Archive (node B) has an out_degree measure of 3 and an in_degree
measure of 3, the other nodes in_ and out_ degrees are illustrated in Table 4. Note that the
measurements in Table 4 have the same in_ and out_degree measurements; this is because the
example is of reciprocated ties. The in_ and out_degree measures do provide a general sense of
how information is moving through the network.

Closeness centrality
Closeness centrality measures how near nodes are to one another. Closeness and distance
illustrate how actors in a network interact, specifically, “how quickly an actor can interact with
others” (Knoke & Yang, 2008, p. 65). Closeness determines the communication channels if there
is an intermediary between the two actors. Scott (1991) defined closeness as:
A matrix of distances between two points in an undirected path is calculated,
the sum distance of a point is its column or row sum in this matrix (the two values
are the same). A point with a low sum distance is ‘close’ to a large number of other points,
and so closeness can be seen as the reciprocal of the sum distance (Scott, 1991, p. 86).
Closeness cannot measure isolated nodes; all nodes must be connected as the measurement
is derived from the paths between the nodes. In Figure 14, to calculate the closeness centrality for
104

node A, the sum distance of A is calculated by adding the following path lengths (AB), (AD),
(AC) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Therefore, its closeness, the reciprocal of the sum distance, is equal to 1/5 or
0.2. The calculations for the rest of the network are illustrated in Table 5.

Table 5. Closeness degree measurements
Table 5 illustrates that node B has the highest closeness value in the network, meaning that
node B has the least amount of effort to interact with other nodes. Node B can quickly interact
with many nodes in the network, whereas node A (the closeness value is equal to 0.2, which is the
smallest) is the least connected to other nodes as it must go through node B to reach D or C.
Betweenness
In order to learn more about these nodes and the potential of their relationships, the
betweenness measure is important. Betweenness measures the “extent to which other actors lie on
the geodesic path (shortest distance) between pairs of actors in the network. Betweenness
centrality is an important indicator of control over information exchange or resource flows within
the network” (Knoke & Yang, 2008, p. 67). Therefore, betweenness is an indicator of who is in
control of the information flow within a network. Understanding the flow of information is
extremely important; once this knowledge is known, one then has the potential to change the
relationship within the network and maybe become more influential.
Then referring to Figure 14, actor A has to go through actor B to communicate with actor
C or actor D. As a result, actor B has the responsibility and control of the transmitting of messages
105

between actors A, and C (D), making actor B a pivotal point in the network. The actor that lies on
the geodesic path between numerous pairs increases that actor’s chance of controlling network
interaction (Knoke & Yang, 2008). Betweenness of node X is defined as the sum of the ratios of
the number of paths between the other two nodes that contain node X to the number of all the
paths between the two other nodes in the network.
In order to determine the betweenness for Figure 14, the following calculations occur.
Betweenness for B is measured by including the following paths: (A, C), (A, D), and (D, C).
These paths (A, C) and (A, D) contain node B, meaning the number of each of these paths
containing node B is 1. The path (C, D) does not contain node B, meaning the number of this path
containing node B is 0. Then they are divided by the number of all the paths that connect them
respectively, which is 1. Finally, the betweenness of B is equal to

betweenness measures for the network illustrated in Figure 14 are in Table 6. In Table 6, the
betweenness value of B is the largest. It implies that it is the most influential in terms of
betweenness.

Measurement summary
In Facebook actor interactions are different. Degree centrality and closeness centrality are
measured by the strength of connections of a node within the network. Whereas, betweenness
106

centrality, indicates the ability of one node’s linking ability to other nodes within the network. In
order to assess this information in the Wisconsin archive Facebook network, the interactions used
in the application (i.e. ‘like’, ‘comment’, ‘tag, and ‘share’) are used to provide value to these
interactions.
3.2

Facebook & Networks
Facebook is a social media application that permits individuals and institutions to connect,

interact and share information. Relationships can be created, fostered and maintained on
Facebook using many different interaction tools — ‘like,’ ‘comment,’ ‘share’ and ‘tag’ — thus
creating an environment where communication can take place.
As an online social network, Facebook has mechanisms by which interaction can occur
and consequently be measured. Unlike face-to-face communities, online networks leave
observable data traces of interactions, meaning that these relationships can be identified and
measured using quantitative measures known as social media analytics.
Facebook permits connecting and communicating among entities. An unknown “magic
number” discussed in social media is a point when a post in social media can be seen by a
significant number of people. This is the ‘reach’ of the post, meaning how many people were able
to see one’s post. When institutions and individuals reach this ‘magic number’ a completely new
door of interaction opportunities open. In businesses, marketing departments devote whole teams
of researchers to analyze posts to better understand the ‘reach’ of the company on social media.
Statistically, once the number is achieved, the greater the likelihood that posts to social media will
be considered ‘successful’, successful being interpreted in several different ways depending on
the institution or person. The closer that the archive community can come to finding this number,
the greater reach they can have for outreach program development, and better overall service for

107

their community. The measurement of centrality ensures the discovery of how information is
moving through the network as it measures each actor’s position in the network.
Archives have little resources to allocate staff time and resources to social media analytics.
In addition, few archivists conduct quantitative research. If measures are not taken now to begin
the process of learning how archive social networks function, as social media continues to be
used, it presents an even larger problem for the archive field. SNA is the most logical theory to
apply when analyzing social networks, as it takes the existing social network, breaks it down, and
mathematically rebuilds it into a matrix for analysis.
3.3

Thematic analysis & Archives
There are opportunities made available to archivists when there is an initiative to

incorporate mass communication materials into the archive’s holdings because archivists need to
actively preserve materials for future and present patrons. Thematic analysis is an efficient
method to use when the research is exploratory. For instance, Klein, Eisenstein, and Sun (2015)
used thematic analysis to understand the process of sense-making when using digital archive
collections, specifically how humanities research occurred. Using an exploratory tool like
thematic analysis, both design and process suggestions were uncovered. Rendón and Nicolas
(2012) used thematic analysis to learn how media shaped attitudes and behaviors toward Haitian
women; coding photographs in the photo archive allowed attitude-shaping behaviors to be
uncovered.
Archival content is unique and by analyzing its use on social media, a plethora of
information can be extracted. Social media comes with its own opportunities for people to connect
given the content’s archival nature; the context of these social media posts when analyzed offers
an important window into the usage for practitioners and researchers. For instance, Humphreys,
Gill, Krishnmurthy, and Newbury (2013) created a content analysis schema based on historical
108

literature in 18th and 19th-century diaries to understand the most popular commenting and
narratives types on Twitter. The content analysis provided a rich understanding of the social
communicative practices that occur on Twitter. Another example is from Humphreys, Gill, and
Krishnmurthyhu (2014), who conducted a content analysis to understand the use of Twitter as a
communication method. Humphreys et al (2013). drew on the historical aspect of diary use to
compare Twitter, and asserted that the traditional use of diaries within our culture was to share
snippets of one’s life; however, the medium of the diary is not typically shared.
The introduction of technology into society has dramatically changed the way people track
their daily lives and the increased sharing of personal details of one’s life given a certain medium.
The communication channels are vibrantly different from 20 years ago. Information is shared at a
much more rapid pace. Social media has the toolset to share all kinds of information, oftentimes
personal information.
The thematic analysis provides a sound way to evaluate the context of social media.
Together these studies demonstrate the importance of adding a qualitative component to social
media research. However, there is the undeniable importance of the quantitative element of social
media research. Thus, a combination of SNA and thematic analysis provides two pieces of a
multilayered and complex area of social media for researchers to analyze.
3.4

Data sampling
The investigative scope of this study is to evaluate Facebook archive communities in the

state of Wisconsin. The first criterion for selection was that the archive had to be located in
Wisconsin. The second criterion was that the archive had to have a professional archivist on staff.
The third criterion was that the archive had to have an active Facebook account for at least six
months, from January 2014 to June 2014; this is indicated in the profile of each archive’s
Facebook page. The final criterion was that the archive needed to have its own Facebook page,
109

meaning that if the archive is part of a parent institution the archive would not share a page with
the parent institution. For instance, the Golda Meir Archive is part of the larger entity of the Gold
Meir Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. In order for the Golda Meir Archive to
qualify for the study, the archive needed to have a devoted Facebook page and not share posts via
the Golda Meir Library Facebook page. Archives that met these criteria were the foundation of
the Wisconsin archive Facebook community (WAFC). These archives were University of
Wisconsin – Green Bay Archive and Area Research Center, Lawrence University Archive,
University of Wisconsin – Parkside Archive and Area Research Center, University of Wisconsin
– River Falls Archive and Area Research Center, University of Wisconsin – Stout Archive and
Area Research Center, Staubitz Archive, and the Ward Irish Music Archive.
Networks may be classified as homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For the
heterogeneous networks, they are treated differently based on the nature of nodes and relations of
the networks (Cai, Shao, He, Yan, & Han, 2005; Yan, Ding, & Sugimoto, 2011). The main
relation of the WAFC is the interest and interaction with and about Wisconsin archives. This
study recognized that the actors have some characteristics that make them unique. For instance, in
the WAFC actors can be archive institutions, businesses, and individual people. Knoke and Yang
(2008) state that “actors maybe individual natural persons or collectivities such as informal groups
and formal organizations” (p. 6). The people can have a variety of identifiers, such as archivist,
librarian, retired, student, teacher, etc. This study identified these characteristics for all actors in
the WAFC; Knoke and Yang (2008) addressed that, “sometimes network actors encompass mixed
types, such as an organizational field comprising of the suppliers, producers, customers, and
governmental regulators of health care” (p. 7).
The justification for using the Wisconsin archives that use Facebook is threefold. First, no
research has previously been conducted that involves both SNA and archives. It is critical that the
110

sample included a diverse type of nodes. For instance, archives are part of a larger network.
Consequently, businesses, cultural institutions, and universities are also part of the larger network
and were extracted as nodes for the network analysis. Secondly, isolating the population of the
study to a geographic area like Wisconsin ensured that all qualified archives could be extracted
for study. Finally, there is no official list of archives that use social media. Therefore, extracting
qualified and diverse archives is time consuming; by isolating archives to a single state, it ensured
that time and effort could be taken to account for a sound sample. This study acts as a
foundational point for further network studies to be conducted within and for archival science.
3.4

Data collection
Membership of the WAFC included actors who participated with a Wisconsin archive

through one of Facebook’s online interactions i.e. ‘like’, ‘comment’, ‘tag’, and/or ‘share’. The
WAFC is not an official community group. Facebook allows users to form special interest groups.
For archivists, there is no central or universal group. There are entities like the Society of
American Archivists and the United States National Archive that has a high number of followers,
however, the inclusion and analysis of archives at the national level was outside the scope of this
study.
The searching process was intensive to locate as many archive institutions as possible in
Wisconsin. The process included the identification of local archive institutions through local
groups identified by the Society of American Archivists, local archive groups like the Southeast
Wisconsin Archives Group (SWAG), museum and historical society local chapters (who have a
dedicated archive with a professional archivist on staff were also to be included), and the
harvesting/searching for archive institutions on Facebook. This process was the foundation for
establishing and defining the WAFC.

111

The process was done in three rounds to ensure that the sampled WAFC was complete.
The identification of seed nodes began with Wisconsin archive institutions that meet the four
criteria: having an active account, having a professional archivist on staff, having a self-managed
account, and being a Wisconsin archive. The Wisconsin archive institutions are the base of the
community; consequently, identifying archives that met the criteria were the seed nodes for
Round 1. The criteria are the defining factors of the Wisconsin archives, which are the foundation
of the community development. Data was captured using NVivo’s web extension tool, NCapture
(NVivo, 2017). From that point, the Wisconsin archives’ posts served as the bridge to its
Facebook community. The posts created by the Wisconsin archives were examined in order to
determine potential actors in the Facebook community.
Then Round 2 consisted of examining those interactions gathered from Round 1, and
ensuring the integrity of data set development. From the Facebook posts, actors who interacted
with the archive institutions either in the form of ‘liking,’ ‘commenting,’ ‘tagging’, or ‘sharing’
information were extracted from the original posts made by Wisconsin archives, and other posts
made by participants in the community.
For example, a local business was ‘tagged’ in a post made by a Wisconsin archive. The
business that was ‘tagged’ may or may not be a member of the WAFC, despite being ‘tagged.’
However, if that business interacts with the archive by ‘liking’ or ‘sharing’ that post in which they
were ‘tagged’, then the business becomes a part of the WAFC. Each time that an interaction
(‘like’, ‘comment’, ‘tag’, or ‘share’) occurred, the interaction was examined in order to validate
the person or institution as a member of the WAFC. Figure 15 is an illustration of the
development of seed nodes, which includes the expansion and coverage of the three rounds.
Due to the complexities involved with social media interaction, a third round was
necessary to ensure the integrity of the data collection process. Similar to Round 2, Round 3
112

continued adding and verifying individuals to the WAFC. Round 3 was another opportunity for
including more valid actors or players in the community. After the third round, more qualified
nodes were included.

Figure 15. Visual display of the WAFC final population.
In each round, new potential nodes were added; these nodes were institutions such as
archives, museums, historical societies, and businesses. There was also a wide variety of
individuals, such as archivists, museum curators, librarians, teachers, business owners, and
journalists.
Following the addition of new actors, a validation process occurred. This is because not
every one of the actors identified is a valid actor of the WAFC. Only actors that are true
participants of the WAFC were included. Occasionally, there were fringe actors that participated
in the WAFC but are not true members of the community. For instance, a valid member of the
WAFC makes a post on Facebook about the Staubitz Archive and ‘tags’ a family member. That
family member may participate in that one singular post but did not become a full-fledged
member of the WAFC. Therefore, that participant may be included in a round, and then was
113

excluded once the verification process occurred. This was a way to ensure the validity of the
WAFC in each round.
3.3.1 Internal and External Validity
In order to ensure internal validity, several rounds of filtering were conducted.
This ensured the completeness and data integrity as errors from SNA can occur from the omission
of nodes and edges often lost in the data collection and inclusion of false nodes or ties. Nodes and
ties are the building blocks of SNA research. For example, the matrices’ development took place
in three separate rounds. Each round included the identification of meaningful actors through
gathering all the Facebook interactions (‘likes’, ‘tags’, ‘shares’, and ‘comments’) and placed the
interactions in matrices that were tables created in Microsoft Excel. Each round also included the
verifying and matching of the columns and rows in each table. The matrices were alphabetized;
each row and column was checked to ensure that at least one institution or person was noted. The
three separate rounds of matrix development reduced the likelihood that there was missing data,
and that no nodes or ties were falsely added to the network. The specification of the interactions
involved allowed parameters to be established and thus reduced misrepresentation of the data.
The external validity of the archival community’s use of Facebook can be applied to many
different types of social media. For example, Twitter is also a popular social media application
amongst archivists. However, instead of using ‘likes,’ ‘shares,’ ‘comments,’ and ‘tagging,’ a
study focusing on the use of Twitter would use ‘tweets,’ ‘retweets,’ ‘mentions,’ ‘tagging,’ and
‘hashtags.’ It is not just the archival community that the methods of this research can be applied.
Any other type of community could use the matrix development here to gather and evaluate the
interactions on social media applications to learn more about their group.
The procedures described provide a foundational point for other cultural institutions to
build proper social media analysis. The study also offers practitioners an insight into how archival
114

users of social media applications are interacting, thus enabling archivists and other information
professionals a way to re-evaluate social media tools.
3.4

Matrix definitions
The clear definition of the WAFC permitted the next step, which was defining

relationships among the community members. These relationships have five levels: ‘like,’ ‘tag,’
‘comment,’ ‘share,’ and integrated relationships. The relationships were addressed separately and
defined in multiple adjacent matrices to permit SNA. When all data in the defined domain was
collected, the data was processed and multiple matrices were generated. These relationships are
vital for SNA. The relationships also lay the foundation for inferential statistics.
3.4.1. Tag matrix
The ‘tag’ function in Facebook permits users the ability to ‘tag’ a friend in a ‘comment,’
‘share,’ or post, which could be text, hyperlink, video, or photograph. Table 7 displays the matrix
representation of ‘tag’ usage in the WAFC. This matrix is an expression of how the archives
tagged themselves and one another in Facebook. Table 7 is the tag matrix. In Table 7, TAi is an
actor who ‘tags’ fellow community members. The ‘tag’ function permits users with the ability to
‘tag’ themselves.

number of all nodes/actors who use a ‘tag’ on WAFC, and TACji is a cell in the matrix and refers
to the number of ‘tags’ that actor i creates and ‘tags’ actor j or 1≤i, j≤ n. In other words, the matrix
records not only who ‘tags’ whom but also the frequency of the ‘tags.’ The frequency indicates
the connection strength between actor i and actor j.
Table 8 is an example of WAFC. There are seven actors in the community: UW-Green
Bay Archive, Lawrence University Archive, UW-Madison Archive, UW-Parkside Archive, UWRiver Falls Archive, Staubitz Archive, and Ward Irish Music Archive. In Table 8’s example, UWGreen Bay Archive ‘tagged’ Lawrence University Archive six times in different Facebook posts.
However, Lawrence University Archive ‘tagged’ UW-Green Bay Archive only two times.
Because the relationships are not always reciprocal, the matrix is asymmetric. Here each value in
a cell measures the relationship between two archives. Table 8 illustrates the ‘tagging’
relationship on WAFC.

community. The example and setup are the same formats as ‘comment.’ This matrix is an
expression of how the archives ‘comment’ on Facebook. Similar to the ‘tag’ and ‘share’ function,
the ‘comment’ function permits users the ability to ‘comment’ on a post or another ‘comment’
that they have themselves posted or previously ‘commented.’ In Table 11, CAi is an actor who

Table 12. WAFC Comment Matrix Example
3.4.4 Like matrix
The ‘like’ function in Facebook permits users the ability to ‘like’ a ‘comment,’ ‘share,’ or
post, which could be text, hyperlink, video, or photograph. Table 13 displays the matrix
representation of ‘like’ usage in the Wisconsin archive Facebook community. The example and
setup are the same formats as ‘like.’ This matrix is an expression of how the archives ‘liked’
themselves and one another in Facebook. Like the ‘tag,’ ‘share,’ and ‘comment’ function, the
‘like’ function permits users the ability to ‘like’ a post or ‘comment’ that they have themselves
posted. In Table 13, LAi is an actor who ‘liked’ a ‘comment’ or a post. The ‘like’ function permits
users with the ability to ‘like’ a post that was originally posted by them.

Table 13. Like Matrix

The archives (actors) in the rows are all the initiators and senders of the ‘likes.’ The archives
(actors) in the columns are the same as the rows. Thus, the entry LACji = 1 indicates that actor i
‘liked’ actor j one time, whereas LACji = 0 means there is no relation or ‘liking’ that occurred.
Here n is the number of all nodes/actors who use ‘like’ on WAFC and LACji is a cell in the matrix
and refers to the number of ‘likes’ that actor i made to actor j or 1≤i, j≤n. In other words, the
matrix records not only who ‘likes’ whom but also the frequency of the ‘likes.’ The frequency
indicates the connection strength between actor i and actor j.
Table 14 is an example of WAFC ‘liking.’ The actors used in the example are the same as
in the ‘tag,’ ‘share,’ and ‘comment’ tables. In Table 14’s example, UW-Green Bay Archive ‘likes’
a post or ‘comment’ from the Lawrence University Archive seventeen times. Lawrence University
Archive ‘liked’ UW-Green Bay Archive twenty times. Because the relationships are not always
reciprocal, the matrix is asymmetric. Here each value in a cell measures the relationship between
two archives. Table 14 illustrates the ‘like’ relationship on WAFC.

Table 14. WAFC Like Matrix
3.4.5 Mega Matrix
The Mega Matrix was inclusive of all the actors and all interactions in the four matrices.
The Mega Matrix is asymmetric. Each of the four original matrices — ‘like,’ ‘comment,’ ‘tag,’
and ‘share’ — corresponds to a set of actors and their interactions which are described in the
Mega Matrix, therefore the Mega Matrix format is inclusive of all actors and interactions.
To understand the interactions, weighting was used. Yan, Ding, and Sugimoto (2010)
demonstrated how relationships were weighted based on their prestige in a journal network. In
123

this study, instead of weighting being connected to a prestige relation, it is used to measure the
interactions (‘like’, ‘tag’, ‘share’, ‘comment’). It is important to weight the interactions in this
study as the medium is Facebook.
In order to assess this information in the Wisconsin archive Facebook network, the
interactions used in the application, i.e., ‘like,’ ‘comment,’ ‘tag,’ and ‘share’ are used to provide
values to these interactions. Weights were assigned to each interaction to maintain the value of the
social implication. The weights assigned ranged from 1 to 3; the higher the weight, the more
interactive the means of communication. For instance, ‘commenting’ is a major way for
community members to interact on Facebook, ‘commenting’ also requires the most effort; as a
result, the weight assigned is 3. Then ‘sharing’ and ‘tagging,’ both of which provide community
members with a way to communicate, require some effort. But neither interaction is as interactive
as ‘commenting,’ consequently, the weight assigned is 2. Finally, while ‘like’ is the least
interactive way to communicate on Facebook, it also requires the least amount of effort. As a
result, the weight assigned is 1. Equation 1 demonstrates the integrated weight formula for the
Mega Matrix.
Assigning weights to these interactions and overlaying this information to the matrix
provides a sound way to assess the strong and weak ties in the network, providing a framework to
the workflow of the information. By providing a weight to a cell of the matrix, the relationships
between the players were also analyzed. The matrix development based on the accumulation of
information, was done to capture the interactions that took place on Facebook.

Equation 1. Integrated weight formula for the Mega Matrix
The archives (actors) in the rows are all the initiators and senders of all of the interactions,
‘like,’ ‘comment,’ ‘share,’ and ‘tag.’ The archives (actors) in the columns are the same as the
124

rows. Thus, the entry MMAC ji > 0 indicates that actor i ‘liked,’ ‘commented,’ ‘shared,’ and/or
‘tagged’ actor j more than one time, whereas MMACji = 0 means there is no relation or any
interaction that occurred. Here n is the number of all nodes/actors who use ‘liking,’ ‘commenting,’
‘sharing,’ and/or ‘tagging’ interactions on WAFC. In Table 15, MMACji is a cell in the matrix and
it refers to the strengths of ‘likes,’ ‘comments,’ ‘shares,’ and/or ‘tags’ that actor i made to actor j
or 1≤i, j ≤n. The MMACji indicates the connection strength between actor i and actor j.

Table 16 is an example of the WAFC Mega Matrix. The actors used in the example are the
same as in the ‘tag,’ ‘share,’ ‘comment,’ and ‘like’ tables. Because the relationships are not
always reciprocal, the matrix is asymmetric, meaning that each cell value comes from the
combination of the interactions (‘tag,’ ‘share,’ ‘comment,’ and ‘like’).
Table 16 illustrates the combinations of interactions of the WAFC. The values for cell
UW-Green Bay Archive and Lawrence University Archive for ‘tag’ is 6, ‘share’ is 5, ‘comment’
is 7, and ‘like’ is 17. Then each one of those values is multiplied by the corresponding weight,
‘tag’ then equals 2 times 6 for 12; ‘share’ equals 2 times 5 for 10; ‘comment’ then equals 7 times
3 for 21; and ‘like’ then equals17 times 1 for 17, for a total of 60. Equation 2 illustrates the value
of the cell. The Mega Matrix took the values from each the combination of the interactions (‘tag’,

125

‘share’, ‘comment’, and ‘like’) and then assigned a weight. The weight calculations for other cells
are similar.

Table 16. WAFC Mega Matrix
3.5

Thematic analysis
The thematic analysis served one main purpose, which is the revelation of hidden themes

from Facebook posts. It was necessary to uncover the content of the information as more can be
126

learned from the information flow in the network. The thematic analysis provided information
regarding insight into the WAFC subject interests. The thematic analysis revealed subject themes
from Facebook posts while SNA illustrated information flow patterns and player patterns, the
findings of each are discussed in depth in Chapters 4 and 5.
There is a plethora of information that is gained through the measurements supported by
SNA. However, due to the interactive nature of social media, there is, even more, knowledge to be
gained by understanding the content that is traversing the communication channels in the network.
The information that is shared in a social network can be exchanged in many different ways.
Without understanding the assessment of behaviors behind the actions or the information being
shared in the network, the entire picture is left largely unseen.
The relationships in SNA are the central aspect. As a result, it is important to understand
what is linking actors together and to develop a deeper understanding of the relationships that
have been fostered in the social network. One way to explore these relationships on a deeper level
is to analyze the content of what is being shared; in other words, what kind of information is
WAFC identifying and interacting.
Facebook posts were analyzed on each archive institution’s Facebook profile page. These
posts were generated by the archive institution and by the archive’s Facebook friends. Then, the
coding of the Facebook posts served to provide a grand overview of the Facebook posts made by
WAFC. A codebook was developed to define the specific Facebook posts.
The entirety of the post needed to be analyzed in order to maintain the context with which
it was delivered to the Facebook users. Without the context of the post, the purpose of that post
cannot be interpreted. In addition, in order to provide a rich analysis of the Facebook posts, the
words used in the Facebook posts were also analyzed. The purpose of the additional layer of
analysis on the words used within the posts was to have a deeper understanding of the archive’s
127

perception and overall identity online. The analysis of the words used within the posts also added
more contexts to the entire post. The reason for this was the revealing of data patterns, thus
providing archivists and researchers with a better understanding of the use of the social network
from the context of what was being discussed via Facebook.
3.5.1 Thematic analysis data collection
Publicly available posts were captured via NVivo’s NCapture add-in expansion. Facebook
data was collected from January 2014 to June 2014 (n = 461) from the WAFC. All posts that
appeared on the archive’s profile pages during the January 2014 to June 2014-time span were
collected; this included posts made by an archive or from a Facebook user. Then a subject schema
was produced. The subject schema included four subject categories: archive story,
communication, information, and outreach. Table 17 provides the coding schema, definitions, and
examples. In order to evaluate the reliability assessment of the coding, a Kappa agreement
analysis was conducted to ensure that there was substantial agreement between the two evaluators
according to the criteria (Viera & Garrett, 2005). NVivo was used to analyze the thematic
analysis. NVivo used comparison measures between the different posts and words defined in a
study. The development of a word list that included similar words and phrases was also
developed. These themes are discussed in depth in Section 4.4 Findings for research questions 3
and H03.

Table 17. List of themes, definitions, and examples of posts from WAFC
The thematic analysis aimed to created subject categories of the posts generated by the
WAFC. These categories were analyzed using the same procedure as the interactions, i.e. ‘like,’
‘comment,’ ‘tag,’ and ‘share.’ Table 18 defines the node-category table (NCT). In the table, the
columns are categories generated from the subject thematic analysis, and the rows are actors in
the network. NCASCji indicates the frequency of subject category (SC) i and node category actor
(NCA) j. Thus, the entry NCASCji = 1 indicates that subject category i was used by node category
actor j one time, whereas NCASCji = 0 means there is no relation or usage of that subject category.
Here n is the number of all nodes/actors who have posted on WAFC with the identified subject
categories, m is the number of all subject categories, and NCASCji is a cell in the matrix and refers
to the number of times that subject category i was used by actor j or 1≤i≤m, 1≤j≤n. In other
words, the matrix records not only who uses the various subject categories but also use

129

frequencies of the subject categories. The frequency indicates the connection strength between
subject category i and actor j.

3.5.2 Keywords
Stop words (as, but, for, if, or, when) were removed and plural words like “digital
collections” were changed to “digital collection.” The unique words collected and analyzed
resulted in n = 415. In each one of the Facebook posts, terms reoccurred 17% of the time within
the sample.
Overall, there were few exact keywords that were shared; more themes were shared
amongst WAFC than keywords. Often keywords themselves were unique to that single archive.
For instance, each archive referred to a name, like Lawrence University or University of
Wisconsin-Green Bay. WAFC members used their own name in a Facebook post 11% of the time.
As a result of the keyword categories consisting of keywords that were not unique by themselves,
terms were categorized together with other like terms to yield sound results. For instance, ‘archive
material’ consisted of terms used to describe material unique to an archive, i.e. scrapbook,
processing, letters, diaries. For a keyword to be considered ‘reoccurring’, it had to appear in at
least two archives. Table 19 provides a listing of all keywords that were categorized together into
the same keyword category. Appendix D lists the raw keyword data.

Table 21. Distribution of research question, associated hypothesis, independent and
dependent variable, software used, and method tested
H01

There are no significant differences among key players in the Wisconsin archive
Facebook community (WAFC) in term of centralities (degree, closeness, and
betweenness).
The independent variables for this hypothesis were WAFC actors. The dependent variable

is centrality. The centrality can be broken down into 3 aspects of centrality: degree, closeness, and
betweenness. A Friedman Test was then conducted with results from the Mega Matrix centrality
testing. SPSS was used to test the hypothesis; a Friedman test was used because it handles rank
data of degree, closeness, and betweenness.
H02

There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of interactions on
the Wisconsin archive Facebook community.
The independent variable for this hypothesis is actor affiliations. The valid values or levels

of this independent variable are archive, business, cultural institution, and university. The people
133

affiliation was not analyzed as the number of variables that separate people are too high to gather
concrete findings.
The dependent variable is interactions, which is measured by centrality. The centrality can
be broken down into 3 aspects: degree, closeness, and betweenness. In other words, the proposed
hypothesis can be divided into 3 sub-hypotheses:
H02 (a) There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of degree on the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community.
H02 (b) There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of closeness on the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community.

H02 (c) There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of betweenness on
the Wisconsin archive Facebook community.
Since the number of the independent variable levels (4) is larger than 2 and subjects in
different groups receive different treatments (‘archive’, ‘business’, ‘cultural institution’, and
‘university’) an ANOVA statistical method was used for these hypotheses using UCINET instead
of SPSS as UCINET addresses the interdependency of the SNA matrices whereas, SPSS does not.
H03

The online posts made by the Wisconsin archive Facebook community revealed no
significant differences among the revealed subject schemas.
The independent variables are subject schemas. The valid values or levels of this

independent variable are the different subject schema: archive story, communication, information,
and outreach.
The dependent variables are the use of subject schema, which was measured by the
frequencies of subject schema identified from the thematic analysis.
Since the number of the independent variable levels is larger than 2, and each revealed
subject schema received different treatments (the different subject schema), a Chi-Square
statistical method was used for the testing of this hypothesis.
134

H04

There is no significant relationship between using a picture in a post and not using a
picture in a post in terms of online activities on the Wisconsin archival Facebook
community.
The independent variable for this hypothesis was using pictures in Facebook posts. There

are two valid values or levels, which are the Facebook posts with pictures and posts without
pictures. The dependent variable was online activities.
There are two levels of the independent variables. UCINET was used to test the
hypothesis; an independent T-test was conducted.
H05

There are no significant differences between posts with embedded hyperlinks and posts
without embedded hyperlinks in terms of their online activities on the Wisconsin
archival Facebook community.
The independent variable for this hypothesis was using hyperlinks in Facebook posts.

There are two valid values or levels, which are the Facebook posts with hyperlinks and posts
without hyperlinks. The dependent variable was online activities.
There are two levels of the independent variables. UCINET was used to test the
hypothesis; an independent T-test was conducted.
H06

There is no significant difference between posts by WAFC with digital collections and
posts by those without digital collections in terms of their online activities on the
Wisconsin archival Facebook community.
The independent variable is the presence of a digital collection in an institution. There are

two valid values or levels, which are the institutions with digital collections and institutions
without digital collections. The dependent variable was online activities which were measured by
their frequencies.
There are two levels of the independent variables. UCINET was used to test the
hypothesis; an independent T-test was conducted.

135

3.6.1 Summary
All of the statistical testings provided a well-rounded summary of the WAFC. The
significance level (α) for these tests was 0.05. If, p > α then the hypothesis was accepted. If p < α
then the hypothesis was rejected.
3.7

Software
The foundation point of data collection was done using data captured through NVivo’s

extension, NCapture. NCapture is a web browser extension tool that gathers social media data and
permits the researcher to gather and save social media datasets such as web pages and online
PDFs, Facebook posts, shares, tagged individuals or institutions, and comments, LinkedIn group
discussions, and Twitter content (NVivo, 2017). Using NVivo, the NCapture data was exported to
Microsoft Excel for analysis.
While a significant portion of the data extraction was conducted using NCapture, the rest
of the data collection was extracted manually. The manual extraction of data was necessary as
NCapture gathers the number of ‘likes’ but does not list all actors that ‘liked’ an interaction on
Facebook. In addition, ‘shares’ are noted in NCapture with the total number of ‘shares’ per post,
but do not indicate who in the network ‘shared.’ The development of the matrices was done in
Microsoft Excel. Tables in Microsoft Excel are able to be imported into UCINET, which is a SNA
tool.
UCINET and NetDraw software packages for social network analysis and cultural domain
analysis were developed by Lin Freeman, Martin Everett and Steve Borgatti (UCINET, 2016).
Both UCINET and NetDraw are used for the SNA. UCINET is the most popular and widely used
software package due to the ability to apply an extensive number of data manipulation tools
(Knoke & Yang, 2008). UCINET mathematically measures the social network in a number of
different ways as dictated by the researcher. Due to UCINET’s unique capabilities with SNA, it
136

was used for all ANOVA tests instead of SPSS. NetDraw is the visualization component and
illustrates the measurements through visual representations of the dataset.
SPSS was used primarily for measuring the statistical analysis of the data. SPSS is
predictive analytics software developed by IBM (IBM, 2016). It is widely used in the social
sciences for statistical analysis. SPSS is used for this study for the statistical measurements of the
hypotheses. The software includes tools used for descriptive and inferential statistics. Data is
entered into SPSS in a manner similar to spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets can be
imported.
UCINET was primarily used in this study for testing the hypotheses. UCINET provides
unique exponential random graph models for inferential statistical analysis (Borgatti, Everett, &
Johnson, 2013). The models address the issues that observations must be statistically independent
and the observations must follow a normal distribution. The software includes tools used for
descriptive and inferential statistics. Data was entered into UCINET in a manner similar to
spreadsheets, and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets can be imported.
3.8

Ethics
It should also be acknowledged that the author of this proposal is a practicing archivist that

participates on Facebook. The researcher’s position to the social network should always be
considered. Although one’s tie and participation within the community might be reflected in the
data, as an archivist, the involvement was not viewed any differently from other archivists as the
researcher’s participation relates to her fieldwork. However, as a researcher, this research is
highly influenced by her work as an archivist and knowledge of the lacking quantitative research
and potential practical advice it may yield to the profession. In order to use the NVivo’s NCapture
feature, the researcher must be logged into the social media application. This means that the
researcher must have an account.

For the purpose of this study, the researcher used her existing Facebook account to log in.
The researcher is identified as an archivist in her personal life, there was no conflict or need to
hide her profile. The purpose of this study was not to interact or participate in an interview-type
situation with any of the individuals involved, only observations of the data were conducted.
Kadushin (2005) noted that a potential dilemma for social network research is unlike other
research methods, “social network data have one troublesome and distinctive attribute: the
collection of names of either individuals or social units is not incidental to the research but its
very point” (p. 140).
The visualization representation of SNA is also a matter of discussion. As it is not
necessarily the individual nodes, but the entirety of the network that needs to be evaluated;
meaning that the research does not pick out single individuals to name and discuss, but rather it is
the patterns that are of major concern to the researcher. For the purpose of this study, node labels
were omitted at the individual levels for the visualizations and during the thematic analysis. In
addition, to protect the identity of those individuals involved in the study, all actors’ names are
anonymized. Numeric codes were used in lieu of actors’ real names. However, in order to learn as
much as possible about the archive’s Facebook community, individuals are anonymized and
grouped into subject areas using the information that was available on their public Facebook
profiles.
Early on in SNA research, the development of computer networks was acknowledged
along with the idea that the study of computer networks was easy, however, it was the sociology
and ethics of the research that is the most difficult (Wellman, 1996). Brass, Butterfield, & Skaggs
(1998) noted that the harvesting of personal characteristics of individuals with SNA to be the most
unethical while also discussing that it is the significant ties in individual relationships that should
be studied. The omission of those important details would result in the misrepresentation of a
138

network. Ngai, Tao, and Moon (2015) analyzed 46 different articles about social media and found
that “social media is a double-edged sword that can help and harm” (p. 42). It is important to be
mindful of the data and the group of individuals that is being used to study.
The widespread use of social media results in behavior analysts needing to evaluate the
interactions; however certain principles should be applied (O’Leary, Miller, Olive, & Kelly,
2015). Moreno, Goniu, Moreno, and Diekema (2013) suggested that in regards to observational
research, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) should pay attention to risk factors. For instance,
observational research that involves how many times a certain post was ‘liked’ has focused on the
number rather than the individual who ‘liked’ the post, particularly if the individuals were not part
of a high-risk group or one that involves illegal data (such as drug use). IRBs strive to be as
ethical as possible, but there are considerable gaps between practice and written policy. Zimmer
(2015) presented a topic on research ethics in the 2.0 era, noting the conceptual gap between
anonymity and identifiability.
This study acknowledged the potential ethical issues with the harvesting of publicly
available profile information. Data mining of people’s habits and behaviors online has been a
growing topic of discussion as social media has become more integrated into the daily lives of
people, and marketing programs have been developed to reach those individuals more efficiently.
According to the IRB at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee on the subject of social media,
the suggestion is that security measures must be taken for anonymity and that the original data set
of collected data not to be released to the public.

Summary
The WAFC data was gathered using NCapture, which is an NVivo tool. The data was

structured using Microsoft Excel. Subsequent analyses were run using SNA tool, UCINET. SNA,
inferential statistics, and thematic analysis are the three methods that were used to analyze
139

WAFC. There are six main hypotheses and six sub-hypotheses that were tested against the data
collected from WAFC. Together, these methods provide a more thorough understanding of
WAFC and their use of social media, which can be translated into different archive communities
to expand their overall understanding of social media use.

CHAPTER IV
RESULTS & ANALYSIS
This chapter reports the findings including sample development, general statistics,
previously stated hypotheses, social network analysis, and thematic analysis.
4.1

Description of the collected data
The process began with the identification of known archive areas: academic, historical

societies, and corporate. To qualify for the study, the archive needed a professional archivist on
staff; volunteer organizations did not qualify. There is no standing list of all archives that use
Facebook, nor is there a standing list of all archives in the United States, let alone the state of
Wisconsin. As a result, it was necessary to create an outline to extract as many Wisconsin
archives that use Facebook as possible. For example, the process for academic archives included
the identification of all the four-year University of Wisconsin institutions (13 university
campuses) all of which have archives.3 Each UW archive was investigated to determine if it
qualified for the study. Four UW archives were found to have an independent Facebook page.
Private universities were also analyzed for potential study; consequently, one private Wisconsin
university archive also qualified. The process for historical societies, religious archives, and
corporate archives included the investigation of archive institutions from the Southeast Wisconsin
Archival Group (SWAG), which has 69 members. As the study’s focus was on social media
application use, the next criterion was that each institution had to have at least one social media
application installed before the study began; this criterion reduced the list to 32 members.

3

All 72 counties in Wisconsin have a historical society; however, these societies are not maintained by professional
archivists. As a result, in 1992, the University of Wisconsin developed a series of Area and Research Centers (ARC)
to be housed at four-year university campuses. These ARC’s serve the public to provide access as official State
records repositories under 16.61(13) of the Wisconsin Statutes and is governed by Faculty Legislation II-400
(University of Wisconsin Archives History, 2017).

141

The last criterion is that each archive institution had to have its own social media
application outside of its parent institution, meaning that if an archive was within an academic
library, the archive must have its own Facebook page separate from the library. This brought the
final tally to three institutions from the initial 69 members of SWAG. In the end, there were seven
archival institutions in the state of Wisconsin that had their own Facebook page and these were
extracted for this study. The initial sample of the archives is small. However, due to the small
sample size, several other meaningful actors were identified; the finalized actor categories are
illustrated in Figure 16. Figure 17 illustrates the breakdown of the largest category People in the
WAFC.4

4.1.2 Description of statistical data from online activities
Publicly available posts were captured via NVivo’s NCapture add-in expansion. Data was
collected from Facebook from January 2014 to June 2014 (n = 489) from the seven Wisconsin
archives that were selected. All posts were in English. Only posts found on the archive’s profile
page were analyzed. The thematic analysis method of selection is the same used and previously
discussed in the SNA method section. The words were collected and analyzed from the same time
period resulted, n =1001.
As a result, the development of the social network matrix began; all of the potential actors
went through a validation process. For example, every post that an archive made to their
Facebook page and all the ‘likes’ associated with that post were examined; meaning that, every
time a Facebook user ‘liked’ a post, that Facebook user becomes a part of the matrix. This process
was carried out for each online activity ‘like’, ‘share’, ‘tag’, and ‘comment’.
4.1.3 Matrix Development
In order to analyze the complexities of the data, a matrix combined ‘like’, ‘comment,’
‘share,’ and ‘tag’ Facebook online activities to create the Mega Matrix. Each one of the
143

interactions builds upon the other; social media is complicated and the multi-level interactions
create complexities. The final dimensions of the Mega Matrix were 223 x 223. Combining the
matrices into a Mega Matrix ensured that the entirety of the WAFC was analyzed as a whole
network.
In addition, by providing a weight to each matrix, the relationships between the many
players were also analyzed. Through the analysis of the content using grounded theory, the data
was collected in such a way that permitted the flow of information to be captured. The matrix
development was command driven, meaning that the accumulation of information was done so to
capture the online activities that took place on Facebook.
4.2

Findings for research question 1 (RQ1)
In this section research question, 1 (RQ1) is answered. Each section introduces the topic

addressed, results, and the analysis. Sections 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 discuss the identification of
key actors in terms of centralities. In each of these sections, the top twenty actor lists are
provided. Actors who are not individual people have their complete name; those who are
individuals have a code name that was just for this study listed in lieu of a full name. This was
done to maintain the privacy of individuals; it does not take away from the discussion as all actors
were coded by categories.
RQ1 is stated as the following:
RQ1: Who are the key actors/players in the Wisconsin archival community when they
exchange and share information on Facebook?
RQ1 is addressed in hypothesis H01.
4.2.1 Hypothesis H01
4.2.1.1 Hypothesis testing H01 result
The hypothesis is stated here:
144

H01

There are no significant differences among key players in the Wisconsin archive
Facebook community (WAFC) in term of centralities (degree, closeness, and
betweenness).
RQ1 is answered by H01 through the SNA measurements: degree, closeness, and

betweenness. These centrality measurements identify who the key actors and players are in the
WAFC and how information is shared. First the process of the testing results is discussed
followed by a description of WAFC key members. A deeper analysis of RQ1 and H01 is described
in section 4.6.1Analysis of RQ1 & H01.
The Mega Matrix dataset was entered into UCINET and was used to conduct the SNA
testing. The Mega Matrix is comprised of the online activity data from the WAFC. Three different
SNA centrality measures were run: degree, closeness, and betweenness. A Friedman Test was then
conducted with results from the Mega Matrix centrality testing results. SPSS was used to test the
hypothesis. The result is that the proposed hypothesis is rejected as there was a significant
difference among key players in the Wisconsin archive Facebook community (WAFC) in terms of
centralities (degree, closeness, and betweenness), here n = 223, betweenness (mean = 433.78, SD
= 1772.53), closeness, (mean = 1.58, SD = .428), and degree (mean = 21.2, SD = 61.55). Table 22
illustrates the mean and standard deviation of each centrality.

Findings for research question 2 (RQ2)
In this section research question 2 (RQ2) is answered. Each section introduces the topic

addressed, results, and the analysis. Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.1.1, 4.3.1.2, 4.3.1.3 address the hypothesis
testing.
RQ2 is stated as the following:
RQ2: What is the role of the actors within the Wisconsin archive Facebook community?
RQ2 is addressed in hypothesis H02, which is broken down into three sub-hypotheses
H02(a), H02(b), and H02(c). The interactions defined in H02 refer to centrality degree measurements
from SNA. The sub-hypotheses deal with each centrality measurement: degree, closeness, and
betweenness respectively.
4.3.1 Hypothesis H02
The hypothesis is stated here:
H02

There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of interactions on
the Wisconsin archive Facebook community.
RQ2 is answered by H02(a-c) through the SNA measurements: degree, closeness, and

betweenness. In contrast to RQ1, RQ2 kept actors within their specified groups: archive, business,
cultural institution, and university. The term role here is generalized to these specific groups in
order to ascertain a broad determination of the WAFC. These centrality measurements identify
who the key groups are in the WAFC and how information is shared. First the process of the
testing result is discussed followed by a description of WAFC key groups. A deeper analysis of
RQ2 and H02 is described in Section 4.6.2 Analysis of RQ2 & H02. In addition to the determination
146

that there is a significant difference among WAFC group members, key groups were able to be
identified from the H02 analysis.
The measurements of the interactions (degree, closeness, and betweenness) are in Sections
4.3.1.1, 4.3.1.2, and 4.3.1.3. The actor affiliations are comprised of four different areas: archive,
business, cultural institution, and university. The people affiliation was not analyzed as the
number of variables that separate people are too high to gather concrete findings. Figure 17
illustrates the visual layout of the actor affiliations of the WAFC. It is evident from Figure 17 that
there are clear hubs within the WAFC; A5, A4, A2, and A8 are all associated with the archive
affiliation. The intricacies of the WAFC are articulated in the rest of section 4.3.

4.3.1.1 Hypothesis testing H02(a) result
Hypothesis H02(a) is stated here:
H02 (a) There are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of degree on the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community.

147

Within the degree results, the actor affiliations were sorted alphabetically. The analysis
was used to test the hypothesis; an ANOVA test was conducted using UCINET. The significance
level was .05. The result is that the hypothesis is rejected as there was a significant difference
among actor affiliations in terms of degree [F(3, 59)] = 9.79, p = .0002. Table 24 illustrates the
test statistics from H02(a).

Findings for research question 3 (RQ3)
In this section research question 3 (RQ3) will be answered. Each section introduces the

topic addressed, results, and the analysis.
RQ3 is stated as the following:
RQ3: What does the content of each online activity (tagging, sharing, liking, and
commenting) reveal about the Wisconsin archive Facebook community?
RQ3 is addressed in the thematic analysis, which breaks down the content of the WAFC
posts and associated interactions (online activities). The associated hypothesis (H03) is also tested
and the results are revealed in this section. H03 is stated here:
H03

The online posts made by the Wisconsin archive Facebook community revealed no
significant differences among the revealed subject schemas.

4.4.1 Hypothesis H03
The thematic analysis revealed much about the content being posted by the WAFC as well
as each online activity. The process of an online activity begins with a Facebook post. A
150

Facebook post is a message made to other Facebook users. The post appears on the user’s profile
and can be viewed by either the public or by the Facebook user’s friends; posts can be a status
update, and/or can contain a photo, link, or video. The purpose of a post depends on the Facebook
user, and can vary from wanting to share information to engaging others in an activity, the list is
endless. The coding schema uncovered four prominent themes: archive story, communication,
outreach, and information.
4.4.1.1 Thematic analysis overview
All posts are in English. Only posts found on the archive’s profile page were analyzed.
The thematic analysis method of selection is the same used and previously discussed in the SNA
method section. Figure 18 is an illustration of the posts accumulated each month from January 1,
2014 to June 30, 2014. One post that was captured read, “This May Day celebration was filmed at
Lawrence in 1929 – 85 years ago today! That’s the old Carnegie Library in the background. If you
think this is as awesome as we do, keep an eye out for news about recently digitized films from
the Archives…” A theme was assigned to the post. The theme applied to the post was ‘outreach’
as it demonstrated a service provided by the archive (digitized collections available to the public).
Certain identifiers of the post may be identified, for instance, the name of the archive being used
or the use of the post to identify a particular activity such as education about history to the public,
which adds an aspect of the archive’s purpose and their identity.

151

Figure 18. Monthly WAFC Facebook posts from January 2014 to June 2014
As previously stated, posts could be made by the archive or by another institution
(affiliation being business, university, cultural institution), or by a fellow Facebook user. A post
could also be created by another entity and then shared by an archive; however, most posts made
by the WAFC were original. On average, 92% of the posts were original material created by the
archive, 6% were created by an institution, 4% were posted by a WAFC member, and 5% were
posts created by another entity and shared by an archive.
4.4.1.3 Themes from thematic analysis
Coding of the WAFC posts was conducted through an open coding process. The purpose
of the thematic analysis was to identify the main ways that archives use Facebook. Two coders
coded the Facebook posts independently. To evaluate the reliability assessment of the coding, a
Kappa agreement analysis was conducted. A second observer, an archivist with a Master’s degree

152

in Library and Information Science, was asked to code the posts independently from the
researcher.5 The observed agreement was kappa = .74.
Four main themes emerged from the thematic analysis: archive story, communication,
information, and outreach. Archive story posts create awareness about the archive, and typically
have an example from the archive’s collection to go along with the details in the post. Archive
story was also the most common post in the WAFC occurring 78% of the time. Figure 19 is an
illustration of the percentages of the thematic categories. Communication is the main type of
Facebook posts used by WAFC to interact and accounts for 12% of WAFC posts. Announcements
might be made in a communication post. Information Facebook posts are the most direct and the
smallest category at 4%; these posts have weather updates, information regarding closing early or
even job postings in the archive. Finally, Outreach posts are like announcements, but of a
different kind. Instead of general announcements like in communication, outreach posts have a
program or service that is going to be taking place that patrons could partake. Outreach posts
occurred 6% of the time in the WAFC.

5

The second observer is a working archivist who has been working in the field of archival science since 2012. The
observer obtained a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science and Master’s in History from the University
of Wisconsin Milwaukee. The observer is an archivist at a corporate Wisconsin archive; that archive is not involved
in this study.

4.4.2 Hypothesis testing result
The associated hypothesis for RQ3 is
H03

The online posts made by the Wisconsin archive Facebook community revealed no
significant differences among the revealed subject schemas.
The categories tested come from the identified themes: archive story, communication,

outreach, and information. These themes provide the foundation for the hypothesis test in H03.
The frequencies for each category come from the corresponding frequencies found for each
theme, meaning, archive story had a frequency of 358, communication had 54, outreach was 28,
and information had 18 for n = 458. These four themes and their corresponding frequencies
provided the basis for the hypothesis testing. The significance level was 0.05. SPSS was used to
test the hypothesis, and a Chi-Square test was conducted. The result is that the proposed
hypothesis is rejected as resultant p-value .000 < than the significance level 0.05, the Chi Square
value 699.373 and df = 3. The result means there is a significant difference among the subject
schemas. Table 30 illustrates the Chi-Square results.

Findings for research question 4 (RQ4)
In this section research question 4 (RQ4) will be answered. Each section introduces the

topic addressed, results, and the analysis.
RQ4 is stated as the following:
RQ4: How do the post characteristics (use of pictures, use of embedded hyperlinks, and use of
digital collections) influence the online activities of the Wisconsin archival Facebook
community?
RQ4 is addressed in three hypotheses (H04, H05, H06); each associated hypothesis breaks
down the stated characteristics in RQ4.
4.5.1 Hypothesis H04
4.5.1.1 Hypothesis testing H04 result
The first hypothesis is stated here:
H04

There is no significant relationship between using a picture in a post and not using a
picture in a post in terms of online activities on the Wisconsin archival Facebook
community.
The 458 posts were divided into two categories, posts with pictures, and those without

pictures. Posts with pictures, valued at 136; posts without pictures, valued at 322, for a total
number of 458. Then breaking down the without pictures category further: hyperlink posts
numbered 202; video numbered 9; finally, there were 111 posts that contained no pictures, links,
or videos. It was the two main categories, posts with pictures and posts without pictures that
provided the foundation for the hypothesis test in H04. The frequencies for both categories came
from the corresponding online activities associated with each category. Posts that contained
155

pictures had online activities valuing 920 and posts without pictures valuing 677. The significance
level was 0.05. UCINET was used to test the hypothesis; an independent T-test was conducted.
The result is that the proposed hypothesis is rejected as there was a significant difference in the
posts with a picture (mean = 6.7, SD = 9.02) and posts without a picture (mean = 2.1, SD = 4.97 );
t(456) = 7.004, p = 0.0001.
4.5.2 Hypothesis H05
4.5.2.1. Hypothesis testing H05 result
The second hypothesis is stated here:
H05

There are no significant differences between posts with embedded hyperlinks and posts
without embedded hyperlinks in terms of their online activities on the Wisconsin
archival Facebook community.
The 458 posts were divided into two categories, posts with hyperlinks and those without

hyperlinks. Posts with hyperlinks valued at 202; posts without hyperlinks valued at 256, for a total
number of 458. It was the two main categories, posts with hyperlinks and posts without hyperlinks
that provided the foundation for the hypothesis test in H05. The frequencies for both categories
came from the corresponding online activities associated with each category. Posts that contained
hyperlinks had online activities valuing 288 and posts without hyperlinks valuing 1,309 for online
activities which equaled 1,597. The significance level was 0.05. UCINET was used to test the
hypothesis; an independent T-test was conducted. The result is that the proposed hypothesis is
rejected as there was a significant difference in the posts with a hyperlink (mean = 1.42, SD =
3.17) and posts without a hyperlink (mean = 5.11, SD = 8.28); t(456) = -5.9944, p = 0.0001.
4.5.3 Hypothesis H06
4.5.3.1. Hypothesis testing H06 result
The third hypothesis is stated here:

156

H06

There is no significant difference between posts by those WAFC with digital collections
and posts by those without digital collections in terms of their online activities on the
Wisconsin archival Facebook community.
WAFC posts were divided into two categories, posts associated with digital collections

valued at 320 and posts not associated with digital collections valued at 138, for a total number of
458. Then, the total number of online activities was calculated per post which is 1,597. It was the
two main categories, posts with digital collections and posts without digital collections that
provided the foundation for the hypothesis test in H06. The significance level was 0.05. UCINET
was used to test the hypothesis; an independent T-test was conducted. The result is that the
proposed hypothesis is rejected as there was a significant difference in posts with digital
collections and those without digital collections in terms of their online activities. Posts with
digital collections had a result: mean = 2.3, SD = 5.2, and posts without digital collections had a
result: mean = 6.22, SD = 8.92; t (456) = -5.87, p = 0.0001.

Data analysis
There are four research questions and six hypotheses that were conducted in this study. In

order to thoroughly examine each area, 4.6 Data analysis breaks down each research question and
its corresponding hypotheses.
4.6.1 Analysis of RQ1 & H01
In addition to the determination that there is a significant difference among WAFC
members, specific members were able to be identified from the H01 analysis. Degree identifies the
“extent to which a node connects to all other nodes in a social network” (Knoke & Yang, 2008, p.
63). Degree measures both the in_ and out_degrees for an actor. A high degree measure means
that the actor is sharing high amounts of information (out_degree), and receiving information
from actors in the network (in_degree). The higher the total degree measurement, the more
157

connectivity the actor has with other actors in the network. The top 20 of the key actors in terms
of degree are listed in Table 31. Appendix A has the complete listing of the WAFC degree results.

Table 31. Top 20 Actor degree centrality results
Four of the top five actors as measured by degree centrality are UW-Green Bay Archive &
Area Research Center (733), Ward Irish Music Archive (347), UW-Parkside Archive & Area
Research Center (262), and UWGB Cofrin Library (187). These four actors have the most
information flowing through them in WAFC, particularly, UW-Green Bay Archive and Area
Research Center which is incredibly influential with a degree centrality measure of 733.

158

Out of the top twenty actors of degree centrality, most actors were from the archive
category. People in three different sub-categories accounted for another significant portion as
well. Four of the five top actors are archives, the fifth entity is in a related category, cultural
institution; what is more, UWGB Cofrin Library is on the same campus as the UW-Green Bay
Archive & Area Research Center. Figure 19 is an illustration of the categorical breakdown of
actors in the top twenty of degree centrality.

Closeness refers to how quickly nodes can interact with each other in a network without
having another node function as an intermediary. Here, the higher the actor’s centrality value, the
more important it is in the network as the actor can reach other actors through a shorter distance.
The top 20 of the key actors in terms of closeness are listed in Table 32. Appendix B has the
complete listing of the WAFC closeness results.

Table 32. Top 20 Actor closeness centrality results
The top five actors as measured by centrality are UW-Green Bay Archive & Area
Research Center, Ward Irish Music Archive, two Person-Other, and one Person-Cultural
Institution. This means that in terms of closeness UW-Green Bay Archive & Area Research
Center and the Ward Irish Music Archive have the most direct connections in the WAFC when
measured by closeness. In the practical sense, having a high closeness measurements means that
the top five actors have the most direct connections within the WAFC. However, out of the top
twenty actors, the category of Person-Other had the most participants. In fact, the category of
people was a highly influential group in terms of closeness, other than a couple of archives and
160

cultural institutions; it is people that comprise the most connected closeness group. Figure 20
illustrates the categorical breakdown of the closeness centrality by actor affiliation.

Figure 20. Categorical breakdown of the top 20 actors measured by closeness
Betweenness is determined by measuring each pair of nodes and the “proportion of all
shortest paths from one to the other pass through the focal node” (Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson,
2013, p. 174). In other words, the betweenness measure uncovers who the gatekeepers of
information are in a social network, as information that reaches a high betweenness actor can
either be permitted to continue to spread through the network, be stopped, or modified in some
way. The top 20 key actors in terms of betweenness are listed in Table 33. Appendix C has the
complete listing of the WAFC betweenness results.

Table 33. Top 20 Actor betweenness centrality results
The top five actors measured by betweenness are Reference, Access & Outreach Section
of the Society of American Archivists (20945.49), Person-Other (9565.32), Person-University
(7010.13), Person-Archive (6608.62), and The Lawrentian (4021.58). The betweenness measure
has several interesting results. First, is discovering that the top betweenness measurement is from
the Society of American Archivists, which is the professional affiliation of American archivists.
Second, is that archive is the top category in betweenness. People, business, and cultural
institutions are also significant in the top 20 betweenness measurements. Figure 21 illustrates the

162

categorical breakdown of the betweenness centrality by category. This means that archive is the
major gatekeeper of information in the WAFC.

Figure 21. Categorical breakdown of the top 20 actors measured by betweenness
In summary, each centrality measurement uncovered who the key/actors and players were
in the WAFC and determined how information moved throughout the network. Degree is the overall
number of ties. Closeness is how central a node is within the network. Betweenness measurement
illustrates how often a node is used as a bridge to other nodes in the network. University of
Wisconsin Green Bay Archive & Research Center and Ward Irish Music Archive have the highest
measurement in both degree and closeness. However, neither of these archives appear in the
betweenness top five actors. A comparison chart is listed in Table 34 which indicates the top five
actors in each measurement. The top five actors of the betweenness measurement are not actual
archive institutions. This finding indicates that archives are isolating themselves within the WAFC.
In other words, few connections are being made to other entities within the network. Archives are
adding friends and are sharing information that they create and post themselves, but are not bringing
in information from other members of the WAFC.

Table 34. Top five actors of each centrality measurement
4.6.2 Analysis of RQ2 & H02
RQ2 focused on the relationships and the sharing of information in the WAFC amongst
groups. These groups were identified as archive, business, cultural institution, and university. H02
consisted of three different measurements: degree (H02(a)), closeness (H02(b)) and betweenness
(H02(c)). Each sub-hypothesis and its distinct analysis are discussed here.
4.6.2.1 Analysis of H02(a)
H02(a) revealed that there is a significant difference among actor affiliations in terms of
degree centrality. Figure 22 provides a visual layout of the average degree centrality of the
WAFC. Figure 22 illustrates that the actor affiliation that has the highest mean degree
measurement is archive with a value of 165.4. The next highest actor affiliation is university
which has a value of 34.2. Both business and cultural institution have similar values (9.57 and
9.53 respectively), which are significantly lower than the other two actor affiliations.

164

Figure 22. Degree centrality average amongst WAFC actor affiliations
The findings indicate that archive has a high influence on information in the WAFC. This
means that information typically travels through an archive node before reaching other nodes in
the network. Figure 23 provides a full display of the WAFC as determined by degree centrality; in
Figure 23, the larger the node, the higher the degree value.

Figure 23. Visual display of the WAFC actor affiliations as determined by degree centrality

165

It is clear from Figure 23 that some archive nodes are in control of other actor affiliations.
For instance, node A8 has a high number of cultural institutions nodes that it has influenced.
Whereas, node A5, is in control of a high number of university actor affiliation nodes. However,
node A4 appears to have a mix of business, cultural institutions, and university nodes. These
nodes also have a higher connection to other nodes within that cluster, it is important to be
connected to nodes that also are highly connected themselves. As determined in section 4.1, node
A4 (UW-Green Bay Archive & Area Research Center) was, in fact, the highest ranked degree
centrality node and had a degree centrality score of 733.
However, there is room for improvement. Section 4.2 determined that the highest possible
degree score for the WAFC was 809 for individuals. This means that even though the actor
affiliation, archive, scored highest out of the actor affiliations, there are still many missed
connections that archive could connect to influence the network more directly.
4.6.2.2 Analysis of H02(b)
H02(b) revealed that there is a significant difference among actor affiliations in terms of
closeness centrality. Figure 24 illustrates that the actor affiliation that has the highest mean
closeness measurement is archive with a value of 1.95. The next highest actor affiliation is
university which has a value of 1.74. Both business and cultural institutions have smaller values
(1.19 and 1.41 respectively), which are significantly lower than the other two actor affiliations.

166

Figure 24. Closeness centrality average amongst WAFC actor affiliations
Within centrality degree, the paths that information takes through the nodes is important.
An actor has a strong centrality degree if the reach of the actor is able to get to many other actors
in the network. Figure 25 provides a visual layout of the average closeness centrality of the
WAFC; the node’s importance increases with size. Figure 25 also illustrates that even though
archive is an actor affiliation and has the highest centrality degree, there are other actors within
the network that have a stronger centrality degree as evident by the size of the node. For instance,
Figure 25 demonstrates that there are a number of cultural institutions that have a higher
closeness centrality than archive actor affiliation, and as determined in Section 4.2, cultural
institutions accounted for 15% of the total actors that had the highest closeness centrality.

167

Figure 25. Visual display of the WAFC actor affiliations as determined by closeness
centrality
4.6.2.3 Analysis of H02(c)
H02(c) revealed that there is a significant difference among actor affiliations in terms of
betweenness centrality. Figure 26 illustrates the average betweenness centrality amongst actor
affiliations in conjunction with betweenness centrality. Then comparing between other different
actor affiliations, there is a great divide of betweenness. For instance, the archive affiliation ranks
far higher in betweenness centrality than any other affiliation.

168

Figure 26. Betweenness centrality average amongst WAFC actor affiliations
Section 4.6.1 found that on an individual basis, archive is the keeper of information, as
actors from this affiliation had the highest betweenness centrality measurement. Figure 27
provides a visual layout of the betweenness centrality of the WAFC; the node’s importance
increases with size. It is evident from Figure 27 that archive is an important player for
betweenness.
The findings from H01 revealed that on an individual basis archive is the keeper of
information, these findings are strengthened by H02(c), which determined that as a whole unit,
archive again is the most important affiliation when defined by betweenness centrality. Figure 26
also illustrates that archive has the highest betweenness centrality measurement with a value of
4583.43; however, when actor affiliations are grouped together, connectivity between nodes can
be diminished. Meaning that it is important to remember that there can be a disparity amongst
actors within the same affiliation. This further emphasizes the importance of connecting with
other actors outside of one’s own affiliation group, as “betweenness reaches its maximum value
when the node lies along every shortest path between every pair of other nodes” (Borgatti,

169

Everett, & Johnson, 2013, p. 174). The disparity will be discussed more in Section 4.6.1 Unique
findings.

Figure 27. Visual display of the WAFC actor affiliations as determined by betweenness
centrality
In summary, each centrality measurement uncovered who the most influential groups were
in the WAFC and determined how information moved throughout the network. As in RQ1, degree
is the overall number of ties. Closeness is how central a node is within the network. Betweenness
measurement illustrates how often a node is used as a bridge to other nodes in the network.
Whereas RQ1 focused on individual actors and found that archives are only included in the top
five measurements of degree and closeness; when grouped together archives have the top
measurement for all centrality. This means that overall archives behave in a similar fashion in an
online setting, at least on Facebook. The findings indicated that while archives do have the top
centrality score, other groups have a competitive score. This illustrates that there are connections
that are not being reciprocated by archives. This finding is further backed by the findings from
H01, which demonstrate on an individual basis that there are individual actors that far outscore
170

archives in all measurements because out of the top five spots for each centrality measurement,
archives only appear 27% of the time.
4.6.3 Analysis of RQ3 & H03
RQ3 sought to understand the content of each online activity (‘tag’, ‘share’, ‘like’, and
‘comment’), and what the content and online activities revealed about the Wisconsin archive
Facebook community. This question was answered by conducting a thematic analysis of the posts.
Four themes were revealed by the thematic analysis, archive story, communication, outreach, and
information. Archive story was defined as, “creates awareness about the archive, and is associated
with the archive's identity. The promotion and marketing of the archive might be embedded in the
post. There is also information regarding general archiving techniques, such as processing and
collections.” Communication was defined as “provides relatability for the archive.
Announcements like new staff members, retirements, and Throwback Thursday posts all create
avenues for the archive to interact with the public. Communication can also include incentive
posts to entice interaction”. Outreach was defined as, “includes different services that the archive
provides, such as, events, workshops, and educational programs. Some posts are 'mini'
educational pieces, providing information about how to go about researching genealogical
information.” Finally, information was defined as, “includes information regarding the hours of
the archive, weather, and job postings.”
RQ3 was also answered by conducting Chi Square analysis on the associated hypothesis
(H03) which stated, “The online posts made by the Wisconsin archive Facebook community
revealed no significant differences among the revealed subject schemas”. H03 was rejected as the
Chi Square analysis revealed that there are significant differences among the subject schemas.
RQ3 sought to better understand the content of posts from the WAFC. The keywords
extracted from each post revealed that there were few shared keywords amongst the WAFC.
171

Archive story yielded the most use by the WAFC; it also had the highest number of interactions.
Communication was the second highest, outreach was the third, and information was the least
used.
4.6.4 Analysis of RQ4 & H04
H04 revealed that there is a significant relationship between using a picture in a post and
not using a picture in a post. Further analysis revealed that the posts with pictures category
generated the highest value of online activities for all online activity types (‘like’, ‘comment’,
‘comment like’, ‘share’, and ‘tag’). Figure 28 is an illustration of the difference of online
activities per post.

Figure 28. Comparison distribution of online activities across posts with and without
pictures
Within the archive story theme, posts without pictures had a much higher percentage of
use at 76% as compared to posts with pictures which yielded 24%. However, posts with pictures
that were also categorized as archive story had a higher online activity rate at 56%, as compared
to archive story posts without pictures, 44%. As a result, posts categorized as archive story and
had a picture associated with that post had an online activity value of 12% above all other posts.

172

Figure 29 is an illustration of the distribution themed posts with and without pictures across
themes.
The remaining three themes (communication, outreach, and information) did not have an
obvious difference of online activity rates when posts were combined with or without pictures.

Figure 29. Comparison distribution of posts with and without pictures and across themes
The primary reason for the rejection of H04 is that the WAFC has different emphases on
posts with pictures and those without pictures. The WAFC had more posts that did not contain
pictures with a total of 322, however, posts with pictures (even though it was a lower frequency of
occurrence with a total of 136) had a higher value of online activities. This finding means that
suggestions will be able to be developed for archives in terms of what followers interacted with
the most. In addition, the themes combined with online activities provide a deeper analysis of the
WAFC. For instance, archive story posts that contained a picture had an online activity value of
11.44% higher than other archive story posts.
4.6.5 Analysis of RQ4 & H05
The result is that the proposed hypothesis is rejected as there was a significant difference
in the posts with a hyperlink and those without a hyperlink. Posts without hyperlinks generated
173

more online activity than posts with a hyperlink. Further analysis revealed that the posts without
hyperlinks generated the highest number of online activities for all types (‘like’, ‘comment’,
‘comment like’, ‘share’, and ‘tag’). Figure 30 is an illustration of online activities for posts with
and without hyperlinks.

Figure 28. Comparison distribution of online activities across posts with and without
hyperlinks
Posts with and without hyperlinks were most widely associated with the archive story
theme. Figure 31 is an illustration of the themes as distributed by posts with hyperlinks and those
without. Across all the themes, posts without hyperlinks outnumbered posts with hyperlinks. In
addition, posts without hyperlinks had a much higher online activity concentration across all
posts, for instance, posts without hyperlinks accounted for over 56% of total online activity.

Figure 29. Comparison distribution of posts with and without hyperlinks across themes
The primary reason for the rejection of H05 is that the WAFC had different behaviors on
posts with hyperlinks and those without hyperlinks. The WAFC had more posts that did not
contain hyperlinks (with a value of 256), and those posts without hyperlinks had a much higher
online activity rate than posts with hyperlinks. The findings of H05 suggest that embedded
hyperlinks did not boost the online activities. People may prefer direct information in a post rather
than indirect information hidden in a hyperlink. In addition, the themes combined with online
activities provide a deeper analysis of the WAFC. For instance, archive story posts had the
highest online activity rate for posts both with and without a hyperlink.
4.6.6 Analysis of RQ4 & H06
H06 revealed that there is a significant relationship between WAFC posts with a digital
collection and the number of online activities associated with each post. Interestingly, many posts
came from WAFC posts that have a digital collection and had a value of 320 posts; WAFC posts
without digital collections were valued at 138 posts. However, most online activities came from
WAFC posts without digital collections. The total online activity of WAFC posts with digital
collections was valued at 738; WAFC posts without digital collections numbered 859, yielding a
175

total of 1,597. Figure 32 is an illustration of the distribution of all online activities types (‘like’,
‘comment’, ‘comment like’, ‘share’, and ‘tag’) per posts with and without digital collections.
Posts without digital collections had a much higher percentage of ‘commenting’ and
‘sharing’ than posts with digital collections. Overall, ‘commenting’ accounts for 11% of total
online activity in the WAFC, however, posts without digital collections accounted for 66% of
those ‘comment’ online activities. In addition, ‘sharing’ accounted for 7% of total online
activities, but posts without digital collections accounted for 70% of those total ‘shares’.

Figure 30. Comparison distribution of online activities for WAFC posts with and without
digital collections
The thematic distributions were not evenly distributed across posts with and without
digital collections. Posts with digital collections were largely responsible for archive story posts;
over 76% of archive story posts came from WAFC posts with digital collections as opposed to
24% from WAFC posts without digital collections. The remaining three themes (communication,
outreach, and information) did not have an obvious difference of online activity rates when posts
were combined with or without digital collections. Figure 33 shows the distribution of online
activities across themes and WAFC posts with and without digital collections.

176

Figure 31. Comparison distribution of online activities within themes and across WAFC
posts with and without digital collections
The primary reason for the rejection of H06 is that WAFC posts with digital collections and
those WAFC posts without digital collections have a different online activity rate. WAFC posts
with digital collections consisted of most posts in the WAFC, valued at 320; however, WAFC
posts without digital collections did have a higher rate of online activity, valued at 859. In
addition, WAFC posts with digital collections had many archive story theme posts, valued at 269.
This finding means that WAFC posts with digital collections may be posting more archive story
theme posts because they have easy access to archive stories and pictures.
4.6.7 Data analysis summary
RQ1 sought to identify who the key actors/players in the Wisconsin archival community
were when they exchange and share information on Facebook. Consequently, H01 measured the
WAFC in terms of closeness, betweenness, and degree. Most of the actors that had a high degree
centrality were archives in the WAFC. This means that most information that is shared within the
WAFC is being created and disseminated by archives. However, there were a significant
percentage of people that were highly ranked degree actors as well as cultural institutions. This

177

means that if archives can harness and open their network, more information from other actors
can be created and shared as well, thus developing a stronger online community.
People are highly connected in the closeness centrality measure; this category has the
highest direct connectivity out of any other group in the WAFC. This finding demonstrates the
importance of engaging with other WAFC members as it is not just the influence from archive
institutions that is important, but also the finding that the online activity of people is a highly
influential direct group.
Archive was found to be the top holders of betweenness measurements in the WAFC. This
means that archives have a lot of power over the information that is shared and distributed in the
network. However, this puts more pressure on archives to ensure that they are the makers of their
own design within the network; meaning that other participants are not in a position in the WAFC
network to create new ties. Consequently, it is important for archives to articulate to other
participants of other information within the network as this will ensure healthy growth of the
network and bring in other ideas and information. These three centrality measurements: degree,
closeness, and betweenness all provided critical information about the WAFC.
RQ2 sought to determine the differences among the actor affiliations in the WAFC when
they exchange and share information on Facebook. H02 was created to answer RQ2, which stated,
there are no significant differences among actor affiliations in terms of interactions (degree,
closeness, and betweenness) on the Wisconsin archive Facebook community. H02 was divided into
three sub-hypotheses to measure each interaction. H02(a), H02(b), and H02(c) were rejected as there
were significant differences among actor affiliations on the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community (WAFC) in term of centralities (degree, closeness, and betweenness). The actor
affiliation that had the highest measurement for each centrality was archive. This means that most
information is controlled by archive as compared to other actor affiliations.
178

The degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality measurements findings emphasize the
importance that other affiliation groups can strengthen one’s connectivity within the network. For
instance, university and cultural institutions often had high degree and closeness measurements.
However, those two measurements illustrate that in a network environment, it is not enough to be
connected to one’s own affiliation; meaning the more diverse the group, the more likely that the
influence of information can be betweenness measurements, not as large as archive, but still
important results. Consequently, diversifying the actors within one’s network can strengthen the
connectedness within the network as it increases the likelihood that other networks and actors can
be reached.
Three major areas of analysis were revealed by RQ3: first, the originality of the posts;
second, the keywords and their uniqueness. The third and final area is the themes revealed by the
thematic analysis and the testing of the associated hypothesis H03. These areas are discussed in
this section. More emphasis on the practical significance of these findings is in Section 4.6.1.2
Content sharing and 4.7 Implications.
The thematic analysis schema reveal four major areas that WAFC members create:
archive story, communication, information, and outreach. The associated hypothesis, H03, was
rejected, meaning that there are significant differences amongst the subject schema. For instance,
Archive story relates to the emphasis that an archive places on its collection, history, and
community. Being the largest subject topic discussed, it has obvious importance to the WAFC.
Posts in this category are centered on connecting a WAFC member with an item or items in the
archive collection; for instance, announcing that a new collection was donated by a university and
employee A was currently processing the material. The post might also entail a picture of the
employee working on the collection, and might include information regarding how processing
worked.
179

The importance of the use of archive story is further emphasized by the keyword analysis
where ‘year’ (55% reoccurrence), ‘archive name’ (10% reoccurrence), ‘archive material’ (5%
reoccurrence), ‘cultural institutions’ (4% reoccurrence), and ‘holiday’ (3% reoccurrence) were all
important keywords in the WAFC. In addition, these posts were made by adding a picture which
yielded a high return in interactions. However, posts with videos were the highest interaction
return type.
Communication posts were the second highest category in the WAFC. Part of many
archives’ mission statements is to reach out and connect with the community. The purpose is two
part, one to help the community realize that the archive holds important material that is available
to many people (unless the archive is private), and secondly, to ensure that the community will
continue to utilize archive services through future donations of archival material. Communication
had the second highest number of interactions.
Outreach posts were the way that archives articulated workshops, events, and other face to
face engagements. These posts provided information to other WAFC members of events going on
at the archive. There were some instances of the archive sharing information regarding an event
going on locally by maybe a parent institution or a local gallery that was hosting an event.
Outreach posts also entailed the engagement of sharing archival practices with WAFC members.
Outreach did not yield a lot of interactions. It is possible that by ‘tagging’ other people or
institutions in the post or by providing more information regarding an event other than a simple
link (just like the communication posts that utilized links the most) might generate more
discussion amongst users. For instance, if the archive is hosting an event, perhaps by ‘tagging’ a
local entity that might be interested in the event as well could be a way to make new connections.
Information posts were the most basic posts made by the WAFC. Time pending
information was often articulated; for instance, the archive closing early to due to a weather
180

warning or other types of information posts included job postings. Information had the lowest
number of interactions, which is not unexpected given the ‘one and done’ type of content shared
via these posts.
The primary reason for the rejection of H03 is that the WAFC has different emphases on
the four themes in terms of their interactions on Facebook. The WAFC was more focused on
archive story (358) than communication (54), outreach (28), and information (18). This finding
means that suggestions will be able to be developed for archives in terms of what followers
interacted with the most. For instance, if archivists were to balance the type of posts, instead of
focusing on only archive story, different types of discussions could take place. The themes
combined with the interaction activities provide a deeper analysis of the WAFC.
There were differences in the number of interactions that occurred within the thematic
analysis. Archive story yielded the highest number of interactions with 1,005, followed by
communication with 367, then outreach at 138, and information had 87 for a total number of
interactions of n = 1,597. The interactions include ‘like’, comment’, ‘comment likes’, ‘tag’, and
‘share’.
RQ4 sought how to understand characteristics about posts (use of pictures, use of
embedded hyperlinks, and use of digital collections) and their influence on online activities by the
WAFC. Three hypotheses were generated from RQ4. H04 measured the influence of pictures in
posts in the WAFC and found a significant difference in posts with a picture and without a
picture. H05 measured the influence of hyperlinks in posts in the WAFC and found that there was a
significant difference in the posts with a hyperlink and posts without a hyperlink. H06 measured
posts by those WAFC with digital collections and posts by those without digital collections and
found that the hypothesis was rejected as there was a significant difference in posts with digital
collections and those without digital collections in terms of their online activities. Interestingly,
181

the use of hyperlinks decreases the likelihood that interaction will occur. Likewise, the lack of a
digital collection typically had more interaction in themes regarding information, communication,
and outreach. These findings are discussed in more depth in Section 4.6.1.3 WAFC Post
Characteristics.
The rejection of the three hypotheses revealed that posts with pictures had increased online
activity levels, whereas, hyperlink posts boosted little online activity. In addition, the presence of
a digital collection to a post had increased online activity.
4.7

Discussion
This section includes a discussion of unique findings, irregular and unexpected findings,

and a comparison of this study’s findings with previous findings.
4.6.1 Unique findings
This study identified four research questions. Sections 4.2 – 4.5 provided the findings for
each of those questions. Each question dealt with a different area; 4.2 identified key actors of the
WAFC in terms of centralities, 4.3 identified the affiliations and their influence in the WAFC in
terms of centralities, 4.4 took a qualitative approach and conducted a thematic analysis of the
posts, finally 4.5 identified characteristics of posts within the WAFC to discover what was the
most influential. These findings are discussed in the following sections.
4.6.1.1 Information flow
Archives were identified as the main actors that have control over information flow in the
WAFC; each one of the centrality measurements (degree, closeness, and betweenness) measured
archives as the major contributor. However, people were also found to be highly connected within
the WAFC. This means that instead of archives creating their own content to share in the WAFC,
they could draw more from what their fellow WAFC members are posting to Facebook. This
could generate not only new information being circulated, but it opens the possibility for other
182

Facebook users to join the WAFC. Some archive actors have diversified their followers and
interacted with other WAFC member posts; these actors have the highest centrality measurements
like UW-Green Bay Archive and Area Research Center and the Ward Irish Music Archive.
Group affiliation measurements (degree, closeness, and betweenness) of the online
activities from RQ2, discovered the role of the actors within the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community and found archives as a group to be the most influential in the WAFC. However, to
have a well-rounded online community, it takes several contributors not just one group. As RQ2
identified, there is variability within the archive affiliation group. Hypotheses from RQ1 found
that archives far out measured other actors, and hypotheses from RQ2 found that archive again as
a group out measured other affiliation groups. However, there is a wide range of variability within
each affiliation not just archive. For instance, university and cultural institution affiliations had
instances within degree and closeness centrality measurements that were high, but due to varying
averages within the group, the overall score was not high enough to out measure archive. These
implications are discussed in depth in Section 4.7 Implications.
4.6.1.2 Content sharing
The thematic analysis uncovered the relatedness between the content and online activity
(tagging, sharing, commenting, and liking) in the WAFC. Four major themes were identified by
the thematic analysis archive story, communication, outreach, and information. Archive story was
the most used theme by the WAFC and was associated with a high interaction rate.
Communication was the second highest, outreach was the third, and information was the least
used. While archive story was widely used, there was a lot of variability within this theme. For
instance, there are few keywords shared amongst the WAFC; this finding reflects on the
uniqueness of archives and their collections, but also demonstrates archives are not connecting
with fellow archives.
183

The originality of the posts illustrates that the WAFC has interests that are unique to them
at their perspective institutions. However, it also demonstrates that the WAFC is not using social
media to its full potential. Sharing enables people and institutions to connect via a social media
platform. Continuously creating new and original material is good, but should come with sharing
of posts from community members. The sharing of posts enables archives to open themselves up
to other potential community members. For instance, if an archive in another state recently
digitized a collection and makes an announcement on Facebook, the act by another archive to
‘share’ that announcement and ‘tag’ that archive thereby allows the ‘friends’ of that archive to see
the former archive.
The emphasis on originality is further emphasized by the lack of reoccurring words in the
posts. Members of the WAFC are linked by their interest in archives. The keywords emphasize
the archive collections that are unique to each archive, and on the same note, its history. Archives
are defined by their communities and the collections that they oversee maintaining; all the WAFC
members have this in common. By sharing posts from similar archives or other cultural
institutions, the archive is still staying closely aligned to its core purpose and potential audience.
However, in sharing, the archive has now reached beyond its own borders and could connect with
followers of another archive. Part of the success of Facebook is the interactive process provided to
users; marketing research suggests that sharing not only encourages participation from existing
group members but also allows the potential for new network connections to be forged (Hsu,
2012).
4.6.1.3 WAFC post characteristics
Each Facebook post has unique characteristics associated with it. In addition to who
posted it and the content of the post, there are several different pieces that can be added to bolster
the post. For instance, the use of pictures, embedded links, and video can all be added to a post to
184

make it more dynamic. Furthermore, due to the unique nature of the WAFC and the use of digital
material, the fourth research question also analyzed the use of digital collections and their
influence on WAFC posts.
Not surprisingly, posts that were associated with pictures yielded a higher interaction rate.
Posts that had embedded hyperlinks which ultimately brought WAFC members out of Facebook,
were not utilized. Posts that were associated with the theme archive story and had a picture had
the highest online activity rate. The online activity of ‘commenting’ was also the highest when
combined with the two previously mentioned variables. ‘Commenting’ is a dynamic way for
Facebook users to interact. It is also the most time sensitive activity; whereas with embedded
hyperlinks, ‘liking’ was the main online activity chosen to interact with those posts. ‘Liking’ is a
minimally time sensitive action. If posts were associated with hyperlinks, the interaction rate
decreased dramatically. Hyperlinks seemed to limit the amount of interaction that took place in
the WAFC. This is most likely since the user would have to leave Facebook to go to that link to
find out more information. As a result, more information should be added to the post regarding
the link.
In addition, posts associated with digital collections had a higher online activity rate.
These online activities were also more time sensitive like ‘commenting’. Archive story posts were
most widely associated with digital collections as well. This is most likely because it is less time
consuming for an archive story post to be created if there is an existing digital collection from
which to draw from. However, all other themes (communication, information, and outreach) had
higher interaction rates with posts not associated with a digital collection. The major takeaway
from these characteristics is that WAFC members like pictures, particularly pictures that have a
short caption associated with them, as doing so generates discussion amongst community
members.
185

4.6.2 Irregular or unexpected findings
Some of the findings from this study were unexpected and require more elaboration. For
instance, even though archives scored the highest out of the affiliation groups, considering what
the total score could have been for each centrality measurement, archives did not even achieve
even 60% optimization of the WAFC. There is a lot of improvement that can and should occur as
far as archives taking advantage of the potential connectivity of social media.
Secondly, the incentives behind what drives users share on Facebook have a lot to do with
the content of the post. This study found that videos were by far the most highly interactive piece
of media on the WAFC. For instance, Facebook posts can have a photograph, link, or video
attached to the post. There were 136 photograph posts, 202 link posts, 9 video posts, and 111
other posts. Overall, photographs yielded the highest number of interactions with 920, then link
with 288, other with 281, and video with 108. With online social networking the return cost does
not refer to a return on investment; rather a return on interaction means for every type of post
(video, photograph, hyperlink, other) how many interactions occur. The return of interactions per
post illustrates the interesting findings of which Figure 34 provides a visual of the data. Posts that
contained a video by far had the highest number of return interactions with 12, picture also had a
high return rate with 6.76 interactions, other yielded 2.53, and hyperlink had 1.43. Table 35
demonstrates the type, number of posts, interactions, and return rates of interactions.

4.6.3 Comparison between these findings and previous findings
It is not surprising that archives have a noticeable hold on the information flow in the
WAFC, as other studies have shown that how a user presents their identity on Facebook is closely
tied to their social capital in the real world (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007). Other studies
have found that characteristics of users play a key role in the dissemination of information in a
social network (Carrera, Lee & Jung, 2016). However, what is surprising are the instances when a
diversity of affiliations was permitted into the flow, improved the reach of the actors. This finding
stems from the complexities of human behavior. How users engage with a social media
187

community can be driven by several things, however, groups do share some characteristics. The
shared identity, even if within a limited capacity, creates a community; sub-communities and
peripheral communities can exist concurrently (Kietzmann, Hermkens, McCarthy & Silvestre,
2011). The key part is being able to tap into the sub- and peripheral communities to continue to
grow the larger community.
The content that is distributed on Facebook can have a lot of influence on whether users
decide to share the information. For instance, this study found that archive story was the most
common theme among WAFC posts and had the most online activity associated with it. Fu, Wu,
and Cho (2017) found that content type had a significant correlation to whether it was shared or
not on Facebook; particularly content types that were centered on commercial messages, lifestyle
affairs, and personal opinions.
The type of content is related to the media that is attached to it. For instance, this study
found that communication posts were more likely to be connected to a link instead of a picture,
however, links are often ignored if not explained well or do not open correctly (Nielsen, 2000). In
the case of the WAFC, hyperlinks are ignored. Fogg (2009) referred to ‘clicking’ as a target
behavior, which requires effort by the user. Nielsen (2000) noted that if possible it is always better
to show photos of tangible things which are related to a topic in lieu of an abstract link.
In addition, Sabbar and Hyuan (2016) found that Facebook posts had an increased chance
of receiving ‘likes’ if one of the following features was a part post: satire, artistic materials,
family relationships, relationship with the opposite sex, emotional materials, and admiration of
individuals. Likewise, visual displays have been found to be a dynamic way for interaction and
sense-making activities to take place (Tolins & Samermit, 2016). This certainly fits with the
WAFC which found that pictures and video posts had the most interactions (although videos were
scarcely used).
188

CHAPTER V
IMPLICATIONS
There are several important findings from this study that have meaningful outcomes for
the archive community. These implications of these findings are discussed in the following
Sections: 5.1 Theoretical, 5.2 Methodological, and 5.3 Practical.
5.1

Theoretical
Archival theory goes hand in hand with archival practice; one cannot have one without the

other. According to Eastwood (1994), “the first object of archival theory is the nature of archival
documents or records. The archival discipline consists in building knowledge about archival
documents and acting upon them in methodical ways to protect the properties that they
have” (p. 125). What is currently missing from archival science is the knowledge surrounding
social media. One of the solutions is provided from the methodology and findings of this study;
this study provides a method to permit the analysis of social media used by the archival
community from a research standpoint.
While there is no other research that examines archival science and SNA, there are other
subject areas that have improved their knowledge base through network analysis. For instance,
Norman, Nordin, Din, Ally, and Dogan (2015) used SNA to measure social participation among
students. Norman et al. determined that social participation was represented in four areas: lurkers,
gradually mastering members/passive members, recognized members, and coaches. Having a
better understanding of one’s user base is one way that social media knowledge gaps can be
closed. The findings by Norman et al. are similar to the findings of this study; archives were the
most influential group in all SNA measurements. Businesses were often on the periphery of each
measurement, which is similar to the lurker finding by Norman et al.

189

A take away from this indication is that perhaps incorporating businesses into social media
posts might make the group more active overall. This in turn then has the potential to bolster the
overall reach by an archive and will increase awareness and potential outreach relations. Users
influence the network and understanding their interests paves the way for more successful social
media experiences. del Fresno García, Daly, & Segado Sánchez-Cabezudo (2016) found that user
influences to be in one of three categories: disseminator, engager, and leader. Certain members of
the WAFC are more influential than others.
Archival science is at a difficult place now. Social media is often considered ephemeral;
however, archives can and should use social media to connect with the community. In addition, as
social media continues to be used, the need for archivists to understand how to deal with the
media increases. Archivists will be unable to advise members of their institutions of proper saving
techniques if they are unaware of how the media is being used within their own community. This
leads directly to issues of appraisal in archives and how social media can be incorporated into the
appraisal process; currently, there are few suggestions and practice guidelines provided on the
matter.6
More and more states consider social media a record, which quickens the need for
archivists to grasp the media before the information is lost. For instance, in the state of Wisconsin,
2013 WI Act 208, social media is a record and retention of that record must be maintained. In
addition, the UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage (2003) presses the
importance of long-term preservation of digital heritage material, stating that “unique resources of
human knowledge and expression” many of which “have lasting value and significance” (Article

Appraisal is the process of “establishing the value of documents made or received in the course of the conduct of affairs,
qualifying that value, and determining its duration. The primary objective of appraisal is to identify the documents to be
continuously preserved for an unlimited period of time” (Duranti, 1994, p. 329).
6

190

I). Here lies many importance issues with the retention of social media: the value, and
significance.
It is difficult if not impossible for archivists and records officers to offer professional
advice on how to manage social media if they are unaware of how it is being used. A great place
to start is by understanding how archivists and archive institutions and their online communities
are using social media. This study has begun the foundational point of answering those questions.
In addition, Nathan and Shaffer (2012) discussed the preservation of social media as a ‘wicked
problem’ and noted that “the difficulties of preserving the documentary artefacts created through
these interactions with citizens has strong ethical (and legal) implications” (p. 7).
Challenges of recording keeping are part of a complex networked environment (Duranti,
2016). However, this study is the start of building the understanding around some of these
networked spaces. A first step for archivists is developing a social media strategy as conducting a
full SNA study is outside the scope for an archive. However, developing social media strategy and
social media policy are the first steps that an archive can do to do social media better. Even if
extracting social media from the application to keep as a ‘record’ is outside the scope or ability of
the archive, a social media policy is a good practice to point to if issues arise.
5.2

Methodological
The implications of this study’s methodology are threefold. One being that the methods

employed in this study can be replicated and adapted to any number of social media applications.
Secondly, the methods bring together social network analysis and social media in a sound way.
Finally, the methodology provides a foundational point for archival science to continue the long
development of establishing more quantitative work to grow the field in the ever-expanding arena
of digital material.

191

The methodology of this study brought together many different types of analysis to
discover how the Wisconsin archive Facebook community functioned. The inclusion of SNA,
inferential statistics, and a qualitative analysis of the Facebook posts provides a well-rounded
picture. These analyses are adaptable to different media; meaning that the methodology employed
in this study can be replicated in several different ways. For example, many different social media
applications could be analyzed using the procedures outlined in this study. Only the different
online activities would have to be changed. For instance, if an online community using Twitter
was analyzed, rather than ‘share’, ‘tag’, ‘comment’, and ‘like’ as exist on Facebook, a study using
SNA of a Twitter community would analyze ‘like’ and ‘retweet’. Likewise, with a different media
like Tumblr that is image based, the different types of images could be analyzed using a weighting
system. While adding the analyses of images to the study increases the difficulty of constructing a
weighting system, the general concept is the same.
Social media is a means for people to communicate online, thereby creating an online
community of sorts. As a result, for obvious reasons, SNA and social media research have gone
hand in hand since the conception of social media applications in the early 2000s. However, when
SNA was developed it was designed for face to face communities and not online communities.
When conducting SNA and social media research, the researcher must take certain precautions to
ensure the integrity of the data. This study determined that by weighting online activities, the
meaning of interactions can be deconstructed and then reconstructed in a sound manner to
measure quantifiably without compromising the integrity of the data.
There have been few quantitative studies conducted within the field of archival science
that analyze the use of social media by archive institutions. This study provides a foundational
base from which additional work can be conducted. The findings indicated that Wisconsin archive
institutions that use Facebook are central in the network; however, they are missing connections
192

and therefore limiting their amount of potential reach. This reach if achieved at a higher level
could result in more participation from community members, the growth of the network, and
overall awareness about the archive.
This study established a base line for SNA and archival science. Additional studies are
needed to discover if there are differences in social media use in different contexts. In addition,
temporal studies are needed to analyze changes over time. Social media is an ever expanding and
changing atmosphere. Self-evaluations and social media critiques are often conducted by
archivists for their archive. Implementing these same procedures for social media is of the upmost
importance, as critiquing social media outputs will start a dialogue about what is working and
what should happen for future social media planning.
5.3

Practical implication
The findings of this study have practical implications for archival practice and research.

These areas are the information flow, content/context of the post, and a base level knowledge of
how Wisconsin archive institutions use Facebook; these areas are discussed in length in regards to
suggestions for actually carrying out of these procedures. While this study was able to determine,
that SNA is a sound method to address the emerging issue of how social media is used particularly
by the archive community; this study is not suggesting that archivists conduct a SNA study in their
archive - that is not practical. However, there are a few procedures that enable archivists to more
thoroughly understand the process surrounding social media and its day to day functions. These
procedures include implementing a social media strategy, including a mix of themes, using of
media in posts, and posting to social media for awareness not just promotion.
The first step is to create a social media strategy. When a team meeting takes place, take
the time to discuss what social media posts the archive might like to make for the month. In
addition, taking turns by archival staff of posting information can give a fresh voice to the social
193

media posts. This study uncovered what actual archive institutions are posting and how they are
posting information. What was determined was that there is not a balance of what is being posted;
posting a variety of voices may increase the interaction rate and therefore the reach of the archive.
Many posts created for the WAFC were of the archive story theme, which revolves around
information specific to an archive like a date, short caption, and then a picture.
Literally changing the voice of the archive is not always possible, as in a lone arranger
situations. However, lone arrangers can achieve the same effect by sharing information posted by
another entity, thus broadening the voice of the archive. Another option is to share information
from the larger institution, meaning, if the archive is part of a parent entity, share what another
department is doing. This also creates stakeholders in the archive and will raise awareness of their
existence within the archive’s own institution, which could be helpful for other areas of archiving
like record management. This also matches with the findings of information flow. The
information flow in the network does involve archive institutions as the central hub, as indicated
in the degree, closeness, and betweenness measurements. However, the measurements also
revealed that different affiliations like cultural institutions and universities try to connect with
archives but the relationship is not always reciprocated. Reaching out to other entities has the
potential for a high return of interaction.
Likewise, not only does the content of the post matter but so does the media that is
attached to the post. Pictures and videos that were attached to the post yielded much higher
interaction rates than those without. Hyperlinks yielded very little interaction rates. This finding
means that media should be added to the post to increase interaction. When hyperlinks are needed,
the adding of more information to the post itself will help to explain to the viewer what the link
includes. The more context that is provided also increases the likelihood that a discussion will
take place on that particular social media post.
194

A common theme within archival science is that it is difficult to create a system that will
work for archives due to the uniqueness of the collection. This is one of the reasons why EAD
(encoded archival description) which is XML standard for coding archival finding aids (a
description of an archival collection), took many years to create. This study found that at least in
Wisconsin, archive institutions have similar behaviors in an online space. This researcher is not
denying that these unique characteristics exist, however, at least in terms of SNA and social
media, archives are more alike than originally thought when one breaks down the statistics behind
the online interactions. To generalize, this means that instead of posting for promotion, archives
should try to post for awareness. Ultimately, having this base level of knowledge of how archive
institutions behave in an online setting will be to help produce more research and encourages
archives to have more open discussions about why and how they are using social media.
5.4

Summary
The purpose of this study was to uncover how the Wisconsin archive community uses

Facebook. This study identified and collected Facebook data produced from the Wisconsin
archive community. A Mega Matrix was created from the data which combined Facebook online
activities – ‘like’, ‘comment,’ ‘share,’ and ‘tag’. The final dimensions of the Mega Matrix are 223
x 223. Weight was considered amongst the online interactions to maintain the integrity of the
social media nature of the data.
Four research questions and six hypotheses were developed to determine the main actors,
the role of the actors, content of each online activity (‘tagging’, ‘sharing’, ‘commenting’, and
‘liking’), and post characteristics. Unique findings of this study were found regarding the
information flow of the WAFC and the content. For instance, the research questions determined
that archives are a central hub within the WAFC; however, other affiliations like cultural
institutions and universities are other contributors to the information flow. Four different themes
195

were discovered by the thematic analysis: archive story, communication, information, and
outreach. The most popular theme was archive story. If posts were made with a picture or a
video, the posts interaction reach was much higher than posts with media or an embedded link.
The methodological, theoretical, and practical implications of this study were discussed.
The methods selected for this study were found to be not only a sound methodology but also
provided a foundation for other social media and archive online communities to be evaluated
using SNA. The use of SNA in future social media and archive research is both a theoretical and
methodological addition to archival science. Finally, the practical implications are addressed in
the discovery of information flow, content/context of the post, and a base level knowledge of how
Wisconsin archive community use Facebook. These findings provided a foundation of how other
archive communities can make effective use of Facebook and potentially other social media
applications.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS
The final chapter summarizes the research problem, significance, and findings. The
limitations of the study are also discussed. Finally, future research directions are addressed in
Section 6.3.
6.1

Summary of research problem, findings, and significance
The primary research problem was the investigation of the information exchange within

the Wisconsin archive Facebook community (WAFC): the roles of both Wisconsin archives and
their followers within the online community, discussion content, and characteristics of online
activities that attribute to the sharing of information and connectivity of the social network,
Facebook. Four research questions were derived from this research problem.
Research question 1 (RQ1) is restated here: Who are the key actors/players in the
Wisconsin archival community when they exchange and share information on Facebook?
The first research question analyzed who are the major players in the WAFC, and how the
players exchange and share information. The significance of RQ1 was the discovery of
quantitative evidence which was necessary to examine the information exchange within the
WAFC. H01 was created to measure differences among key players in the Wisconsin archive
Facebook community (WAFC) in terms of centralities (degree, closeness, and betweenness): n =
223, betweenness (mean = 433.78, SD = 1772.53), closeness, (mean = 1.58, SD = .428), and
degree (mean = 21.2, SD = 61.55).
Most of the actors that had a high degree and betweenness centrality were archives in the
WAFC. This means that most information that is shared within the WAFC is being created and
disseminated by archive, and that archives have a lot of power over the information that is shared
and distributed in the network. However, there were a significant percentage of people that were
197

highly ranked degree actors as well as cultural institutions. This means that if archives can
harness and open their network, more information from other actors can be created and shared as
well, thus developing a stronger online community. The expansion of an online network can be
done in a few different ways. For archivists using Facebook, expansion can be achieved by
becoming ‘friends’ with an archive of a similar subject area or becoming ‘friends’ with an archive
that is larger, i.e. an archive of medium sized becoming ‘friends’ with the Library of Congress,
which has a large user base. Another avenue would be for an archive that is part of a larger
institution, for instance, a university archive, making a post and ‘tagging’ the university or
university alumni group or ‘sharing’ a post from one of these groups. The post itself might not be
‘archival’ in nature, but it provides other Facebook users who are friends with that group to
become aware of the existence of the archive.
Research question 2 (RQ2) is restated here: What is the role of the actors within the
Wisconsin archive Facebook community?
Actors are key to understanding a social network. The significance of RQ2 was the
determination that archives play a key role within the WAFC. RQ2 also revealed that there are
other actors that play supporting roles but could be larger contenders within the network if
archives change their sharing strategy. H02 and three sub-hypotheses were developed to signify
differences among actor affiliations in terms of interactions on the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community. All three hypotheses were rejected: degree [F (3, 59) = 9.79, p = .0002]; closeness [F
(3, 59) = 9.794, p = .0002]; betweenness [F (3, 59) = 6.6921, p = .0004].
The actor affiliation that had the highest measurement for each centrality was archives.
This means that most information is controlled by archives as compared to other actor affiliations.
Affiliations university and cultural institutions often had high degree and closeness
measurements; this means that diversifying the actors within one’s network can strengthen the
198

connectedness within the network because it increases the likelihood that other networks and
actors can be reached.
Research question 3 (RQ3) is restated here: What does the content of each online activity
(tagging, sharing, liking, and commenting) reveal about the Wisconsin archive Facebook
community?
RQ3 sought to understand the content of each online activity (‘tag’, ‘share’, ‘like’, and
‘comment’), and how the content and online activities revealed information about the WAFC.
This question was answered by conducting a thematic analysis of the posts. Four themes were
revealed by the thematic analysis: archive story, communication, outreach, and information. RQ3
sought to better understand the content of posts from the WAFC. The keywords extracted from
each post revealed that there were few shared keywords amongst the WAFC. H03 was developed
to determine if online posts made by the Wisconsin archive Facebook community revealed
significant differences among the revealed subject schema. The hypothesis was rejected (p-value
.000 < than the significance level 0.05, the Chi Square value 699.373 and df = 3) meaning that
there is a significant difference between themes.
Archive story yielded the most use by the WAFC with 78% usage; it also had the highest
number of interactions. Communication was the second highest at 12%, outreach was the third at
6%, and information was the least used at 4%. This finding means that suggestions will be able to
be developed for archives in terms of what type of posts yield the most interaction and reach.
Research question 4 (RQ4) is restated here: How do the post characteristics (use of
pictures, use of embedded hyperlinks, and use of digital collections) influence the online
activities of the Wisconsin archival Facebook community?
RQ4 analyzed how characteristics influence a post on Facebook. This question was
answered by addressing the research question in three hypotheses (H04, H05, and H06). Each
199

hypothesis uncovered particular unique areas of how post characteristics have an influence on the
material and subsequent online activities. For instance, H04 analyzed the use of pictures, and it
was revealed through the use of an independent T-test that the proposed hypothesis was rejected
due to a significant difference in the posts with a picture (mean = 6.7, SD = 9.02) and the posts
without a picture (mean = 2.1, SD = 4.97 ); t(456) = 7.004, p = 0.0001. H05 analyzed the use of
hyperlinks, and it was revealed through the use of an independent T-test that the hypothesis was
rejected due to a significant difference in the posts with a hyperlink (mean = 1.42, SD = 3.17) and
posts without a hyperlink (mean = 5.11, SD = 8.28); t(456) = -5.9944, p = 0.0001. Finally, H06
analyzed whether digital collections made a difference in posts, and it was revealed through an
independent T-test that the hypothesis was rejected due to a significant difference in the posts
with a digital collection, mean = 2.3, SD = 5.2, and posts without digital collections had a result:
mean = 6.22, SD = 8.92; t (456) = -5.87, p = 0.0001.
The rejection of the three hypotheses revealed that posts with pictures had increased online
activity levels, whereas, hyperlink posts had little online activity. In addition, the presence of a
digital collection in a post had increased online activity. There was much interaction variability
between the different characteristics. For instance, posts without hyperlinks had a much higher
online activity rate than posts with hyperlinks. Posts with pictures and videos had the highest rate
of online activity. In addition, when the themes are combined with the characteristics, even more
information can be extrapolated. Even for posts within the same theme, those with pictures had a
higher online activity rate, here archive story posts that contained a picture had an online activity
value of 11.44% higher than other archive story posts. Likewise, WAFC posts with digital
collections had many archive story theme posts.
The significance of this research is found in three areas: theoretical, methodology, and
practical. The theory of archival science opens the door to social media and more electronic work
200

to be included. What this study provides is a means to conduct further research into the
interworking of how archives behave in an online space. SNA, offers a sound way to do such
analysis. The methodology of this study laid out the necessary techniques, such as weighting and
the construction of multiple matrices to deal with the different online activities that are associated
with each type of social media application to ensure the integrity of the data. Finally, the practical
aspects are that the field of archive science has a base knowledge of how at least one group of
archivists uses social media. This research also establishes that social media is being used by the
archive community and therefore, continued research should be conducted to learn more to enable
the field to develop practical guidelines to implementation, and continued use of social media. It
also begins the process of learning how social media should be preserved.
6.2

Limitations
There are a number of areas of this study that present limitations: the use of only

Facebook, limited timeframe, lack of qualitative interviews with archivists, and a relatively small
sample. Facebook was the only social media application addressed in this research. There are
dozens of social media applications, many of which are most certainly used by the archive
community. However, to begin the analysis of how archive institutions use social media,
Facebook was selected. The long existence of the application and ample use made it a good
candidate to analyze its overall use by a community. In addition, due to the lack of knowledge in
the field of archival science as to how archives use a social media space, it was necessary to limit
the range of potential community spaces to build a solid foundation for future research to take
place.
This study only analyzed six months of Facebook data. This was done as the there was no
other research to compare archive’s use and SNA. As a result, the SNA matrices had to be
developed manually, there was no automation of the matrices. In addition, the thematic analysis
201

was also conducted manually, no automated sorting of the Facebook posts was done. The reason
for the manual nature of the study was to thoroughly and completely understand the process and
to get a better insight into the behaviors of archives in a social media space. Now that these
behaviors are better understood, more data for longer periods of time should be extracted for
study. A temporal study is critical to continuously understanding the process of online behavior
and use.
Social media is all about behavior. This study identified and examined the quantitative
side and only a part of the more qualitative nature of social media. Understanding the needs and
actions behind posts needs to be understood to truly see the whole picture. However, this study
did not interview archivists that are involved with their Facebook pages. The inclusion of
interviews was outside the scope of this study, but should be conducted in the future.
This research study had limited the size of the sample to a specific geographic area:
Wisconsin. Consequently, it cannot be stated with one hundred percent certainty that how the
WAFC interacts on Facebook is how all archive institutions will interact on Facebook, subsequent
research is required to gather more information on archive use of social media applications. This
study made a point to only analyze archives that had their own Facebook page. This was done to
discover how archives and only archives are posting material and sharing information with their
online community. Part of the reason for the small sample was that this study needed to establish
a baseline for archives’ use of Facebook. Consequently, only archives that had their own
Facebook page were analyzed. Archives that shared a Facebook page with a parent institution
were not included as the data would be skewed from archives.
The establishment of a baseline now permits the ability for future studies to expand the
scope and sample size as these archives are a part of the wider community and should be
included. The inclusion of a wider range of archives using social media will provide a more well202

rounded view of use. This research study does provide a foundation for future research on the
subject as well as begin to point to the fact that archive institutions (at least in the same state)
behave similarly online, which is an argument against the common talk that archives are too
unique to have any similarities.
6.3

Future work
Archivists need statistics and programming skills. Unfortunately, when one brings up math

or programming or coding of software to a group of archivists, many archivists are intimidated
and that needs to change. This researcher is not implying that all archivists need to learn SNA, but
the field does need to become more comfortable with statistics and programming because these
are the skills that are now needed to be successful in the field and ensure the longevity of
archives. And it can be done; this research is the start for archival science research to become
more technical. More research in this area such as expanding the size of the sample and including
other social media applications will only expand the knowledge base of how archives use social
media.
The interdependence of online human behavior and the interaction tools that are available
have a high influence on each other. Currently, SNA is frequently used to analyze online
networks. Social network analysis was created to analyze face to face communities, so while it
can be used for social media, painstaking efforts need to be considered in order to ensure that the
social network is intact. A future research goal of this researcher is to refine and adapt social
network analysis to better suit online networks. Conducting a full range SNA study in an archive is
not practical. Suggestions for social media use policy was provided in Section 5.3 Practical
implications, however, in order to more thoroughly understand the needs and wants of archivists,
it will be necessary to conduct interviews with archivists involved with social media to ensure that
suggestions for social media use are practical and sustainable.
203

Social media is often considered ephemeral, however, how are archivists supposed to save
information and to advise their institution on how to save information if they do not have the
skillset to do so. Research needs to be continuously conducted simultaneously with these
applications. Otherwise, the gravity of the communication channels could be lost. Without this
information, researchers and practitioners will have decades of lost communication. A
complication with this research is that human behavior changes. In a time when both Facebook
and Twitter have been widely used for more than a decade, it can be easily forgotten how these
two applications have adapted their interaction features throughout the years. Temporal studies
should be conducted to better understand how both social media applications and people change
over time. This study provides a solid foundation from which additional social media research in
archives can be conducted. While the sample of this study is small, the data that was extrapolated
was rich in detail about the entirety of the WAFC. The findings from this study provide a sound
base from which larger research can be done. In order for data analytics to continue to evolve and
incorporate the necessary tools to remain relevant, more adaptable methods need to be created to
sustain the ever-evolving world of data analytics, which includes social media.
Additional future work will include an approach to bridging the gap in how entities build
networks today. In order to fill the knowledge gap, temporal analysis with social network analysis
work will also be applied. This includes the evolution of the adaptation and incorporation of
necessary tools to remain relevant; more adaptable methods need to be created to sustain the everevolving world of data and social analytics. The construction of different databases and
interdisciplinary collaboration will enhance our understanding of the infrastructure that
desperately needs to be understood.
