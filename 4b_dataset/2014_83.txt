ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
USER MOTIVATION AND EXPECTATION FOR ASKING A QUESTION IN
ONLINE Q&A SERVICES
By ERIK CHOI
Dissertation Director:
Chirag Shah, Ph.D.

Online Q&A services are online information sources where people identify their
information need, formulate the need in natural language, and interact with one another to
receive answers to satisfy their needs. Even though in recent years online Q&A has
grown considerably in popularity and impacted people’s information-seeking behaviors,
we still have little understanding of what motivates people to ask a question and what
they expect from others with respect to their answers to judge information quality in the
online Q&A environments. The purpose of the dissertation is to understand the
motivations and expectations behind questions asking of unknown people in online Q&A
services. Therefore, Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers were selected as the test beds in
the study because these online Q&A services allow people to interact with most likely
unknown people via the question-answering processes, yet provide different features of
how answers are given to a question. Three research questions are addressed: (1)
motivation: what motivates people to ask a question that address their needs in Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers?; (2) Expectation: what are an asker’s expectations from
other users to fulfill his or her needs when asking questions in Yahoo! Answers and

ii

WikiAnswers?; (3) relationship: how do motivations of asking a question relate to
expectations of answer content in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers?; and (4)
comparison: To what extent are motivations, expectations, and the relationship between
motivations and expectations different and/or similar between Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers?
Cognitive needs such as finding factual information or seeking others’ opinion or
advice were found as the most significant motivational factor that drives people to ask a
question. Yet, it was found that other motivational factors (e.g., tension free needs) also
played an important role in user motivations for asking a question, depending on peoples’
unique and contextual situations. It was found that when asking a question in online
Q&A services, three main expectations were common: (1) looking for quick responses;
(2) looking for additional or alternative information; and (3) looking for accurate or
complete information. Additionally, dynamic relationships between different motivations
and expectations for asking a question to seek contextual information to satisfy their
unique situation are presented. The study also identified that there were incidents in
which people have more than one motivation and/or expectation for asking a question.
Understanding user motivations and expectations could provide a general
framework of conceptualizing different contexts and situations of information needs that
drive people into human-to-human interactions for seeking information within an online
Q&A context. The findings from the dissertation have several implications not only to
develop better question-answering processes in online Q&A environments, but also to
contribute to gain insights into understanding of online information seeking behaviors.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1.

Background
Asking a question represents an innate information seeking behavior that

addresses a condition of inadequacy in an asker’s knowledge, defined as “genuine doubt"
(CP5.443)1. While an information need is “a cause of information seeking” (Case, 2002,
p.80), questioning is a formation of an information need (Taylor, 1968) where an asker is
aware of his or her anomalous state of knowledge2 within a problematic situation (Belkin,
1980; Belkin et al., 1982). Thus, asking a question is a kind of information behavior, or
“the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal”
(Wilson, 2000, p.49), and information acquired through questioning becomes the
meaningful sources that help solve an asker’s problem(s) (Yang, 1997) and make sense of
his or her world (Dervin, 1992).
Given the fact that asking a question can be conceptualized as a purposive and
active process of seeking information, previous research in the Library and Information
Science (LIS) field attempted to investigate how and why people ask a question (see
Mackay, 1960; Taylor, 1962, 1968). In addition, the concept of questioning and its
related behaviors (Taylor, 1962, 1968) has been adopted to develop user-centered

Belkin (1980) and Belkin and his colleagues (1982) proposed the information user’s anomalous state of knowledge
(ASK), which stated that “an information need arises from a recognized anomaly in the user’s state of knowledge
concerning some topic or situation and that, in general, the user is unable to specify precisely what is needed to resolve
that anomaly” (Belkin et al., 1982, p.62). ASK assists in understanding the user’s information need and its change over
the information seeking process, as well as conceptualizing the user’s knowledge and understanding of the problem.	  

2
theoretical frameworks of information seeking behavior to understand contexts of
information seeking and use, information seeking processes, and interactions with
information systems (see Belkin, 1980; Kuhlthau, 1991; Markey, 1981 for example).
During the past few decades, advanced information technologies and systems
have emerged to help people seek information. In conjunction with these developments,
the Internet and the World Wide Web have become important tools that people use to
seek information to solve a specific problem, as well as to browse general resources to
fulfill their everyday life information needs. Since the advent of the Internet and the Web,
the number of online resources for information seekers has substantially increased (Levy
et al., 1996). These resources provide new ways to “seek and distribute information and
communicate with others” (Rice & Haythornthwaite, 2009, p.92), and also include online
Q&A services which allow people to identify their information need, formulate the need
in natural language, and interact with one another to receive answers to satisfy their
information need. Harper et al. (2008) argue that online Q&A services are “purposefully
designed to allow people to ask and respond to questions on a broad range of topics”
(p.866).
Online Q&A services, unlike face-to-face Q&A services (e.g., reference service in
libraries), are online information sources where people identify their information need,
formulate the need in natural language, and interact with one another to receive answers
to satisfy their information need in virtual environments. Examples of these services
include machine- and human-driven Q&A. While machine-driven Q&A services are
typically referred to as the systems for automatic extractions of answers (e.g., ask.com),

3
human-driven Q&A services are designed for receiving user-generated answers through
interactions with other people (e.g., experts, non-experts, etc.) on either specialized topics
or a broad range of topics. Expert-based online Q&A services including traditional online
Q&A such as virtual reference services (VRS), facilitate the question-answering
interaction with experts while peer-driven online Q&A services are constituted by
interactions with either known or unknown people to seek and share information.
Additionally, people have utilized other services that are not purposefully designed for
question-answering interactions (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) in order to ask a question
to their network. Table 1.1 provides various elements constituting different characteristics
of question-answering services.

Although traditional expert-based online Q&A services are still available to assist
information seekers, online community-based and collaborative-based Q&A services
have enabled people to access these services more conveniently. Additionally, online
Q&A services allow crowds or members of a community to answer questions,
traditionally undertaken by reference librarians. These online Q&A services therefore
allow people to have human-to-human interactions for seeking and sharing information,

4
i.e., Yahoo! Answers, while having the convenience of doing it virtually (Shah et al.,
2009).
Unlike traditional information retrieval (IR) systems and other online sources (e.g.,
search engines) in which people use queries to obtain information from systems, online
Q&A services enable computer-mediated interpersonal communication with other people
through new information and communication technologies (ICT). These Q&A services
encourage social interactions and relationships for seeking and sharing information. Thus,
a successful interaction within online Q&A assumes that the asker clarifies what he or
she wants to know and an answerer (or answerers) understands the asker’s information
need, and responds back to the asker’s question in order to satisfy his or her information
need.
1.2.

Problem Statement
As online Q&A has rapidly grown in popularity and impacted peoples’

information-seeking behaviors, a rich body of research has emerged to understand
various aspects of online Q&A services. This research focuses mainly on two areas (Shah
et al., 2009): (1) user-based studies (e.g., motivations of answering questions, an asker’s
satisfaction, etc.) and (2) content-based studies (e.g., question type, question formulation,
answer quality, etc.). One of the major aspects of user-based studies is to investigate user
motivation and behavior (Gazan, 2011). However, most of this research has focused on
what motivates people to answer a question (see Nam, Ackerman, & Adamic, 2009; Oh,
2012). Few studies have attempted to address what motivates people ask a question to
unknown people in order for seeking

information to satisfy their needs as

5
opposed to using machine-driven information sources (e.g., search engine) and
interacting with an asker’s known people via a variety of mediated-communication
channels (e.g., email, IM, Facebook, etc.). Figure 1.1 shows the area focused in this
dissertation in order to investigate online Q&A users’ question-answering interactions
with unknown people in the context of online Q&A.

Figure 1.1. Area of online Q&A services focused in this dissertation.
The fact that online Q&A facilitates human-to-human interaction poses a key
difference from search engines that facilitate a keyword-based search (e.g., Google).
Rosenbaum and Shachaf (2010) argue that users’ social interactions play a significant

6
role in seeking and sharing information within the dynamic of an online Q&A
community. Since social interactions within the question-answering processes represent a
critical feature of an online Q&A environment, Gazan (2011) argues that Rosenbaum and
Shachaf’s work (2010) provides “theoretical grounding for the idea that information
exchange on [online Q&A] sites may not be motivated by classical notions of
information retrieval and topical relevance” (p.2304). As online Q&A services are
structured to provide information unique to an asker’s situation and context, it would be
essential to investigate the ways in which people use online Q&A for their information
needs by a “person in situation oriented” approach (Vakkari, 1997).
Given that online Q&A provides a unique context that affects a user’s information
seeking process, the main focus of the study for understanding the online Q&A user’s
situation and context in their information seeking is to investigate motivations that lead
people to interact with unknown people by asking a question within the context of online
Q&A services. Going beyond the motivations behind asking a question, the study also
investigates expectations that the askers have with respect to answers they get for their
questions. As Hsu et al. (2010) argue, “an individual’s motivation to perform a certain
activity is a function of the expectation that he or she will be able to perform the activity
and obtain the desired outcomes, and the personal value of all outcomes associated with
that activity” (pp. 284-285). Therefore, it can be argued that motivation and expectation
are correlated in achieving a specific goal or desirable outcome. Thus, it is also important
to investigate what online Q&A users expect to receive with respect to the responses to
their question, as well as how users’ motivations and expectations are related to each

7
other when people ask a question to satisfy their information needs in online Q&A
services.
1.3.

Significance of the Research
Understanding users’ motivations behind asking a question as well as their

expectations with respect to the responses is a critical endeavor that could provide a
general framework of conceptualizing different contexts and situations of information
needs (e.g., affective, social, personal, and cognitive states) that drive people to humanto-human interactions for seeking information within an online Q&A context.
Conceptualization of contexts and situations of online Q&A user information seeking
behavior will also contribute to developing a recommender system based on an asker’s
motivations and expectations. Thus, a research focus of an online Q&A user’s behavioral
processes by incorporating an asker’s motivations and expectations will enable us to not
only understand the contexts of use for online Q&A services to seek and share
information, but also improve online Q&A service quality that helps provide satisfactory
answers
Moreover, one of the main elements of study of online Q&A is to measure
information relevance and quality. To do so, previous studies attempting to analyze
information quality in online Q&A have paid attention to textual (e.g., length of the
answer’s content) and non-textual features (e.g., information from the answerer’s profile)
(see Shah & Pomerantz, 2010 for details of criteria employed for predicting information
quality). Even though the recent research has also focused on new criteria (e.g.,
politeness, novelty, etc.) that can be

employed to assess the quality of

8
information (Kim & Oh, 2009; Liu et al., 2008; Shah, Oh, & Oh, 2008; Shah &
Pomerantz, 2010) in order to analyze how information satisfies an asker’s need, there is
still a lack of consideration for how the situational context behind asking a question
affects quality judgments.
As Agichtein, Liu, and Bian (2009) suggest, personalized approaches for
evaluating the quality of information tailored to an individual information seeker can
result in improvements of assessing information quality in online Q&A. Mai (2013)
argues, “for the quality of information to be assessed, it must mean something to
somebody in some context” (p.765). Therefore, findings from this dissertation can help
not only in identifying why and how users are engaged in information seeking within an
online Q&A context to satisfy their information needs, but also in developing more
comprehensive personalized approaches to deriving information relevance and
satisfaction, including the motivations and expectations of users when seeking
information. Since online Q&A users may want to “have what we can call the best textual
means to his end” (Wilson, 1968, p.21), understanding the motivations and expectations
of asking a question has applications for building on a framework of how people assess
information, which includes not only question content, but also users’ contexts (i.e.,
motivations, expectations) established by asking a question in a given situation.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
The current literature review attempts to understand peoples’ motivational factors
and expectations within the process of questioning behaviors. Since the context of online
Q&A is focused to investigate the factors influencing online Q&A users’ questioning
behaviors in the this dissertation, an introduction to a general overview of online Q&A
services, as well as different types of services will be first provided. This will be followed
by a review of online Q&A studies that have investigated users’ questions. Following this,
the next sections overview previous literature of users’ motivations and expectations and
identify gaps that the dissertation attempts to address.
2.1. Online Question-Answering (Q&A) Services
Online Q&A services are designed to support people who exchange information
via questioning and answering within online environments. Specifically, online Q&A
services provide outlets for information retrieval where the user’s information need is
articulated by natural language questions posed to a community whose members can
answer the question or even offer feedback on the given responses, resulting in a
personalized set of answers generated via the collective wisdom of many (Bian et al.,
2008). Since the early 2000s, online Q&A services have become popular on the Web and,
according to a Hitwise report, there was an 889% increase in visits to online Q&A
services between 2006 and 2008 within the U.S (Tatham, 2008).
Due to the popularity of online Q&A services as an information-seeking method
and availability of data from them, different types of online Q&A services have emerged
and are currently available for helping people fulfill their information needs in various

10
ways. There are four different types of online Q&A services: (1) community-based Q&A;
(2) collaborative Q&A; (3) expert-based Q&A; and (4) social Q&A. This typology was
generated based on the author’s review and identification of the unique characteristics of
different Q&A services, as well as informed by previous research studies focusing on
online Q&A services (Choi, Kitzie, & Shah, 2012).
2.1.1. Community-based Q&A
A community-based online Q&A service, sometimes referred to as a knowledge
exchange community (Adamic et al., 2008), constitutes a user-driven environment where
people searching for personalized answers post various types of questions to the Q&A
community. A community-based online Q&A service consists of three components: (1) a
mechanism for information seekers to submit questions in natural language; (2)
answerers or responders who actively submit answers to questions; and (3) a community
built around this exchange (Shah et al., 2009). Most community-based Q&A services also
archive question-answer pairs and make them publicly available to allow people to search
these pairs, therefore avoiding duplication of previously asked questions and answers,
which saves time and effort for users (Bian et al., 2008). An example of a communitybased Q&A service is Yahoo! Answers launched by Yahoo! on 2005, which has become
by far the largest English-language based online Q&A site. According to Leibenluft
(2007), more than 120 million users have joined Yahoo! Answers, and generated
approximately 400 million answers to the questions.
Users’ question-answering activities are driven by a variety of motivations within
a community-based online Q&A service.

Oh (2012) found the most influential factor

11
that motivated answerers to help others to satisfy information needs was altruism. Similar
to Oh’s (2012) findings, Nam et al. (2009) also found that altruism, as well as learning
and competency were reported to be the most frequent motivational factors driving
answerers to contribute knowledge in a community-based online Q&A service. Moreover,
this type of service encourages users to participate in various activities not only by asking
and answering, but also by commenting on questions and answers, rating the quality of
the answers, and voting for a “Best Answer” (Kim et al., 2007).
2.1.2. Collaborative Q&A
Unlike a community-based Q&A service where every question-answer pair is
separately located in an archived thread list, collaborative Q&A services facilitate the
ability to edit and improve the phrasing of a question and/or the answer to a given
question over time via user collaboration. Examples of collaborative Q&A services are
WikiAnswers and Wikipedia Reference Desk, which allow users to rephrase existing
questions and answers in order to best address the information needs of both the asker
and other community members interested in the same or similar question topic. Similar to
a community-based online Q&A service, WikiAnswers also displays a list of similar
questions that have already been asked on the site in order to assist in fulfilling an asker’s
information need (Bernhard & Gurevych, 2008).
2.1.3. Expert-based Q&A
As in the first two Q&A services, an expert-based Q&A service allows users to
ask questions and get direct responses from others. However, in this service, answers are

12
provided by a group of experts rather than an open community. Another factor that
differentiates these types of sites from the other models is that many services include
pricing systems, referred to as a price-based knowledge market (Chen et al., 2008) that
allows the asker to specify the range of payment the answerer receives based on the
asker’s perceived value of the answer (i.e., Google Answers’ payments ranged from $2 to
$200 with a non-refundable listing fee of $0.50). However, other expert-based Q&A
models such as AllExperts allow an expert to voluntarily join the system and provide
answers to questions based on his or her self-identified expertise sans fees. The Internet
Public Library (IPL), an asynchronous digital reference service (Pomerantz et al., 2004),
can also be characterized as an expert-based Q&A service since an expert, in this case a
reference librarian, interacts with users to resolve information needs.
2.1.4. Social Q&A
Social Q&A provides users with the opportunity to ask questions to friends or
acquaintances within social network sites or social search engines (Horowitz & Kamvar,
2010). According to Paul, Hong, and Chi (2011), the question-answering interactions
within social network sites (e.g., Facebook3, Twitter4, etc.) are gaining increased
popularity because these sites let people leverage the expertise of network friends, as well
as engage in the collective knowledge of their social network community.
Arguably, social Q&A services share many of the same characteristics as
community-based services, i.e., a repository of questions and answers for sharing

13
knowledge within a Quora5 community (Wadhwa, 2011), but with a few key differences.
For example, Honeycutt and Herring (2009) found that the Twitter users utilize the
service to solicit information, and according to Morris et al.’s (2010) study of users who
post questions to social networking sites, not only does the user most likely trust the
information source since it is someone from his or her personal network, but also the
information received is also personalized based on the answerers' knowledge of the user.
2.2. Questions in online Q&A services
A rich body of literature has focused on developing a taxonomy for questions
asked within digital reference services (see Arnold & Kaske, 2005; Desai, 2003; Garnsey
& Powell, 2000; Hodge, 2002; Kibbee, Ward, & Ma, 2002; Sears, 2001; Smyth, 2003).
Numminen and Vakkari (2009) argued that Sears (2001) developed the most
comprehensive taxonomy, which “covered the greatest range of various types of
questions and included the most detailed subdivision of questions” (Numminen &
Vakkari, 2009, p.1251). Sears’s (2001) taxonomy divided reference questions into the
three categories: (1) ready-reference questions; (2) specified search questions; and (3)
research questions.
Similar research has been performed within other online Q&A sites. For example,
Harper, Moy, and Konstan (2009) developed two distinct question types in order to
investigate archival value in online Q&A sites (Ask Metafilter, Answerbag, Yahoo!
Answers): (1) informational questions are more likely to gather information; and (2)
conversational questions stimulate discussion that solicits opinions from others. Another

14
study by Harper et al. (2010) utilized a rhetorical framework (Aristotle, 2007) to classify
questions using the same online Q&A sites as the previous study (Harper et al., 2009).
The framework has three major categories: (1) Deliberative (advice, identification); (2)
Epideictic (approval, quality); and (3) Forensic (prescriptive, factual). The study found
that factual (31%) questions are most frequently asked, followed by identification (28%),
advice (11%) and prescriptive (11%).
Additionally, a recent study by Choi et al. (2012) also focused on frequency
distributions for question type among four different online Q&A services, each
representative of a type of Q&A site identified above. The study developed four different
question types using previous research by Harper et al. (2010): (1) information seeking
questions, (2) advice-seeking questions, (3) opinion-seeking questions, and (4) noninformation seeking questions (self-expression).
Recent studies have also paid attention to how a question is formulated and how
this impacts quality within online Q&A environments. For example, Shah et al. (2012)
examined why fact-finding questions from Yahoo! Answers failed, or did not receive an
answer. A typology was developed in order to determine reasons for why a question
might fail and the results indicated that the most significant proportion of failed questions
were too complex and/or overly broad (34%), followed by those that lacked information
(14%), had multiple related questions (13%), and were ambiguous (10%). Choi, Kitzie,
and Shah (2013) performed a similar study, but focused on fact-finding questions that
both did and did not receive an answer. They subsequently developed a model that
predicts question quality (good or bad) using textual features of a question for training

15
and non-textual features of a question as evaluated by human assessors for testing.
The results from the study (Choi et al., 2013) revealed that six significant textual
attributes contribute to the model with the highest percentage of accuracy: (1)
interrogative words used at the beginning of a question; (2) the number of unique words
in the question, which is an indicator that the information within the question is more
specific; (3) the clarity score representing the complexity of the question; (4) presence of
content that provides additional information in order to give the reader a better
understanding of what the asker is looking for; (5) the number of question marks, which
signifies how many questions the user asks; and (6) presence of taboo words, which
indicates whether the question is socially appropriate.
2.3. Motivation
This dissertation explores people’s motivations in asking online questions of
Q&A services. Motivation is a psychological factor that engages people in a process of
actions that lead toward a desired goal. One of the main topics in this study is to
investigate information behaviors, defined by Nahl (2004) as a form of goal-directed
behavior taken to satisfy an information need, with emphasis on their motivational factors
for asking a question in order to fulfill their information needs within online Q&A. The
dissertation assumes that what motivates people to ask questions influences their
information seeking behaviors for satisfaction of needs within online Q&A. In this
section, in order to gain a better understanding of what motivates people to ask a question
within online Q&A services, the definition of motivation is reviewed, followed by an
overview of related theoretical frameworks of motivation, including the concept of

16
information need as motivation in LIS. Additionally, previous research focusing on
motivation of media use will also be described.
2.3.1. Definition of Motivation
As Maehr (1974) argues, motivation comprises the “inner states or process of the
organism – needs, drives, etc. – which prompt and guide behavior” (p.887) indicating that
people are driven to act in a certain way in order to satisfy their needs. Mitchell (1982)
explicates that each individual tends to engage in certain specified behaviors pertinent for
different needs. Although a wide range of research areas have focused on different
aspects of motivation in order to understand an individual’s behavioral process for his/her
perceived value, Mitchell (1982) also argues that there are three fundamental perspectives
“underlying properties of this definition” (p.81): 1) motivation is based on an individual
phenomenon, 2) motivation is intentional, and 3) motivation is multifaceted. This
signifies that an individual has a unique set of motivational factors driving them to act in
a certain way to achieve a desired outcome within different stages of behavioral process,
such as “the arousal (activation, energizers) and direction (choice) of behavior” (p.81).
Additionally, although motivation is defined by inner states (e.g., achievement,
recognition, responsibility, etc.), external factors also affect how people behave to fulfill
their needs. For example, Self-determinism Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and Two-Factor
Theory (Herzberg, 1966) explains how extrinsic motivations derived from organizational
or environmental contexts (e.g., salary increase, work relationships, and job security, etc.)
influence the behavioral process.

17
2.3.2. Theoretical Frameworks of Motivation
A number of motivational theories, models, and frameworks have been introduced
to understand and explain why people to act in a certain way. Campbell et al. (1970)
argued that those motivation theories could be divided into the two distinct groups: (1)
process models; and (2) content models. Process models of motivation investigate the
process of how people act in a certain way in order to achieve specific goals, while the
content models of motivation pay attention to specific factors that motivate people to
behave a certain way. A detailed review of each motivational theory and model within
these two groups is provided in the next section.
2.3.2.1. Process Models of Motivation
Stimulus-response theory (Guthrie, 1935; Spence, 1936; Thorndike, 1911)
focuses on how an individual’s behavioral process is constructed by the stimulusresponse (SR) bond, which provides “rules relating stimulus factors such as reward
magnitude, number and timing to the strengths of those intervening variables, and rules
relating those variables to empirical response measures” (Holland, 2008, p.228). Similar
to the conceptual framework of stimulus-response theory, Hull (1943) proposed drive
theory, which explains how individuals’ biological and physiological needs compel them
to perform a certain action in order to satisfy these needs. For instance, basic biological
drives (e.g., hunger, thirst, etc.) motivate individuals to seek food and water. Additionally,
habit strength is built through (Campbell et al., 1970) positive reinforcement from
previous experiences, which increases the probability of an individual choosing a similar
behavior when the same need arises in the future.

18
Unlike drive theory, which does not speculate on individuals’ selection of their
actions to satisfy physiological needs, expectancy theory proposes that individuals
consciously act with respect to the anticipation of a reward (Campbell et al., 1970).
Expectancy theory (Porter & Lawler, 1968; Vroom, 1964) explains the behavioral
process of why individuals make one behavioral choice over another. Instead of focusing
on what factors motivate individuals, this theory highlights why individuals act a certain
way according to the perceived consequences of their actions or desired outcomes.
Campbell et al. (1970) pointed out that expectancy theory relies on the assumption that
“individuals have cognitive expectancies concerning the outcomes that are likely to occur
as the result of what they do and that individuals have preferences among outcomes”
(p.343). Expectancy theory is based on three core variables: (1) expectancy; (2) valence;
and (3) instrumentality. Expectancy can be referred to as “a belief concerning the
likelihood that a particular act will be followed by a particular outcome” (Campbell et al.,
1970, P.344). Valence is a belief about an individual’s preference or desirability of
outcomes, and there are presumably individual differences in the level of preference for
an outcome (Vroom, 1964). Instrumentality can be described as a belief that an individual
will receive a perceived or valued outcome if he or she performs well.
2.3.2.2. Content Models of Motivation
Murray (1938) developed a theory of personality that conceptualized what factors
or needs influence an individual’s behaviors. Psychogenic needs are divided into five
groups: (1) ambition needs (e.g., achievement, exhibition, recognition); (2) materialistic
needs (e.g., acquisition, construction, order, retention); (3) power needs (e.g., abasement,

19
autonomy, aggression, avoidance, deference, dominance); (4) affection needs (e.g.,
affiliation, nurturance, play, rejection); and (5) information needs (e.g., cognizance,
exposition, sentience).
Similar to Murray’s (1938) identified human needs that motivate an individual’s
behaviors, Maslow (1943, 1954) also presented a more systemic hierarchical model of
human needs for understanding human motivation, including physiological needs, safety
needs, love and belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs (shown in
Figure 2.1). According to Maslow (1943, 1954), an individual’s growth or upper level
needs may not emerge until his/her lower level of needs are satisfied. This signifies that
human needs need to be fulfilled sequentially, starting with basic needs (e.g.,
physiological needs), in order to achieve self-actualization needs.

Figure 2.1. Maslow’s hierarchy model of human needs.
In order to investigate motivation and job satisfaction, particularly in work

20
environments, Herzberg (1966) proposed two-factor theory, which postulates two
motivational factors in the workplace – motivators and hygiene factors. Motivators are
more likely correlated to an individual’s inner states related to his/her job (e.g.,
achievement, recognition, or responsibility), while hygiene factors more likely stem from
external, organizational contexts (e.g., salary increase, the work relationships, and job
security, etc.) that influence an individual’s job performance (Campbell et al., 1970).
Unlike two-Factor theory, which particularly pays attention to how an
individual’s needs affect his or her job satisfaction in work environments, uses and
gratification theory (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974; Katz, Gurevitch, & Haas, 1973)
focuses on an individual’s media use in order to explain what motivates an individual to
seek a specific medium for gratifying his/her needs. The focus of this theory is on what
people do with the media rather than the effects of media on an individual. The basic
assumptions of uses and gratification theory are that there are individual differences in
needs and that media users are active and goal-directed in attempting to satisfy their
needs through media use (Katz et al., 1974). According to Katz et al. (1973), there are a
number of the basic human needs identified from “the social and psychological functions
of the mass media” (p.166), and these needs could be classified into five groups: (1)
needs for strengthening information, knowledge, and understanding; (2) needs for
strengthening aesthetic, pleasurable and emotional experience; (3) needs for
strengthening credibility, confidence, stability, and status; (4) needs for strengthening
contact with family, friends, and the world; and (5) needs for escape or tension-release.
2.3.3. Motivation in the context of LIS

21
While theoretical approaches of motivation have been applied to understand
behavioral processes, as well as motivational factors within various contexts, such as
education (see Bartol & Srivastava, 2002; Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 2001; Lepper &
Malone, 1987; Vallerand et al., 1992), consumer behavior (Madox, 1981), health care
(Benson & Dundis, 2003; Sheldon, Williams & Joiner, 2003), managerial processes
(Bassett-Jones & Lloyd, 2005; Conger & Kanungo, 1988), and work environments (Hart
et al., 1986; King, 1970; Lundberg, 2009), the concept of motivation has been also
discussed in LIS, in order to understand peoples’ information needs and their information
seeking behaviors for fulfilling those needs.
The concept of an information need and its role in information seeking and use
has been discussed within LIS (Bruce, 2005). Generally, an information need is “a cause
of information seeking” (Case, 2002, p.80) or “a requirement that drives people into
information seeking” (Ikoja-odongo & Mostert, 2006, p.147). In addition, Case (2002)
points out that an information need could be also illustrated by the continuum of
motivation, ranging from the objective end (Atkin, 1972, 1973) to the subjective end
(Dervin, 1983, 1992). The objective end of motivation views an information need as
indicative of an information seeker’s “objective reality”, which motivates him/her to seek
“a specific fact to make a decision or solve a problem” (Case, 2002, p.86), while the
subjective aspect of motivation tends to understand an information need as an
individual’s ability to identify a gap in his/her knowledge and attempt not only to retrieve
data, but also make sense of his/her problematic situation(s).
However, Wilson (1981) argued that the association of the terms, “information”

22
and “need” causes confusion; “[t]his association imbues the resulting concept with
connotations of a basic ‘need’ qualitatively similar to other basic ‘human needs’” (pp. 56). In other words, he argued that “information need” appears to account for general
human needs (Case, 2002), and paid more attention to various needs that specifically
motivate information seeking behavior. Thus, Wilson (1981) pointed out that
physiological, affective, and cognitive needs, as well as an information seeker’s social
role and environment constitute the types of motivation for information seeking behavior,
and information seeking behavior tends to arise when an information seeker perceives “a
consequence of a need” (Wilson, 1999, p.251).
Since one of the central purposes of this dissertation is to investigate what
motivates people to ask a question within online Q&A specifically, as opposed to
investigating why people ask a question over other information seeking behaviors,
Wilson’s (1981) concept of an information need and information seeking – “information
seeking towards the satisfaction of needs” (p.6) - and the content models of motivation
that pay attention to a variety of factors that motivate people to act in a certain way,
provide a relevant conceptual framework of motivations behind asking a question. Uses
and gratifications theory (Katz et al., 1973) in particular appears to constitute the most
appropriate content model of motivation since, unlike other content models of motivation
that focus on basic needs affecting personalities or job satisfaction, this theory focuses on
human needs within mediated channels as a specific context. In addition, uses and
gratification theory explains that there are individual differences in needs that motivate
media use, therefore it could be useful to investigate different needs that people want to

23
fulfill via the question-answering process within an online Q&A context. A detailed
review of uses and gratification theory is presented in Section 3.3.
2.3.4. Motivation of media use
This dissertation focuses on what motivates people to use online Q&A services to
ask a question as information seeking behavior to satisfy their needs. In the following
section, previous literature focusing on motivations for various media uses, including
traditional and new media, will be presented in order to provide general understanding of
factors that drive people to use media for their needs.
2.3.4.1. Motivation of traditional media use
Previous research employing a uses and gratification approach has investigated
conventional media such as newspapers (Berelson, 1949), radio (Armstrong & Rubin,
1989), television (Bryant & Zillmann, 1984; Dobos, 1992; Rubin, 1983), and the
telephone (Dimmick, Sikand, & Patterson, 1994; O’Keefe, & Sulanowski, 1995). The
findings from these studies indicate that information seeking and social connection are
the most significant motivational factors for using traditional media.
2.3.4.2. Motivations of the Internet use
The emergence of new media, including the Internet, has also attracted
researchers to investigate what motivates a user’s switch from conventional media to new
media and how new media has subsequently been used for satisfying users’ needs and
goals (Eighmey & McCord, 1998). December (1996), for example, identified
communication, interaction, and information as three major factors for why people use

24
the Internet, while Korgaonkar and Wolin (1999) added the additional factors of social
escapism (e.g. getting away from reality) and economic motivation (e.g. using the
Internet to save money). Other research has also studied motivations within different
Internet contexts such as virtual communities (Sangwan, 2005), chat rooms (Leung,
2003), personal home pages (Noh, 1998; Papacharissi, 2002), electronic bulletin boards
(James, Wotring, & Forrest, 1995), and social media (Quan-Haase & Alyson, 2010).
Additionally, Morris, Teevan, and Panovich (2010) conducted a lab study in order to
understand why people use either search engines or social networking sites to search for
information. Their findings show that whereas the participants prefer to use search
engines to receive faster and authoritative information, they utilize their social
networking sites to seek information because “it is fun, they trust their social network,
they wanted opinion-type answers, and their social network knew additional context
about them.” (p. 293). Similarly, the recent study by Oeldorf-Hirsch et al. (2014) focused
on motivations of seeking information in both traditional search engine systems (e.g.,
Bing, Google) and social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twiter). The study indicated
that information needs for using social networking sites are rooted in trusted networks
where people may be able to receive personalized, subjective information (e.g., opinion,
etc.), while traditional search engine systems were used when people had navigational
and exploratory information needs.
2.3.4.3. Motivations of online Q&A use
Studies of motivations have also been conducted within different online Q&A
services. For example, Pomerantz and Luo (2006) investigated what motivates people ask

25
a question within NCknows, a chat-based digital reference service. Six categories of
motivation emerged from users’ responses: (1) to answer a work-related question; (2) to
answer a question that arose from the user’s personal life; (3) to conduct a known-item
search; (4) to answer a question about the library itself; (5) to help others look for
information; and (6) other.
Studies have also focused on motivations within other types of online Q&A sites.
Lee et al. (2005) studied information seeking behaviors when searching for music-related
information within two different types of online services: (1) Yahoo! Answers, a
community-based Q&A; and (2) Google Answers, an expert-based Q&A, and identified
the most significant information need as identifying either the artist and/or work. Zhang
(2010) analyzed health-related questions from Yahoo! Answers with emphasis on how an
everyday life context (e.g., goals, motivations, emotions) affects motivations for seeking
health-related information seeking. Zhang (2010) identified three motivational factors:
cognitive motivation, social motivation, and emotional motivation. Additionally, Morris
et al. (2010) examined social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) in order to
investigate the types of questions asked and users’ motivations for using their social
networks to pose questions. The study explored why people choose social networking
sites rather than a search engine, finding that the most common reason is that people have
more trust (24.8%) in the answers provided by their social network. Users also tend to
believe (15.2%) that social networking sites perform better than search engines in
addressing subjective questions seeking opinions or recommendations (21.5%).
However, previous studies of motivations within the online Q&A environments

26
have been constrained to specific interests and/or domains. Therefore, it is necessary to
investigate a variety of online Q&A services consisting of a broad range of topics in
order to gain insights into user motivations for asking a question within online Q&A sites
as a whole, over other information sources.
2.4. Expectation
2.4.1. Definition of Expectation
Expectation can be defined as the perceptions of what is likely to be required in
order to receive “favorable outcomes that is desired” (Campbell et al., 1970, p.343);
whether or not an outcome is perceived as favorable is based on an individual’s
subjective values (Feather 1982). In other words, people choose to perform a specific
behavior based on whether or not they anticipate that their expectation will be met by the
outcomes. Therefore, their specific goals or needs could be satisfied if their expectation is
met to some degree based on their perceived values. Yet, expectation goes hand-in-hand
with motivation. In other words, motivation to satisfy needs or achieve goals based on
personal values is driven by the expectation of what will occur when this goal is achieved,
and vice versa. This indicates that motivation and expectation are correlated in achieving
a specific goal or desirable outcomes.
2.4.2. Expectation to Information
People anticipate or expect that when they articulate an information need, they
will receive information that fulfills this need. People employ evaluative criteria in order
to assess how well an information source

fulfills their information need. Therefore, it

27
can be argued that the evaluation of information in relation to these criteria articulates a
user’s expectations for this information.
Previous research studies examine the evaluative criteria employed to judge the
results of an information search, which, as argued above, can be used to determine the
expectations of online Q&A users for the information they receive. These evaluative
criteria appear to be grounded by overarching high-level constructs: quality, satisfaction,
and/or relevance. Taylor (1986), for example, likened the evaluation of information to
making a quality-based assessment, and found five values that comprise quality: accuracy,
comprehensiveness, currency, reliability, and validity. On the other hand, Barry (1994)
identified the act of evaluation as a satisfaction-based assessment rather than a qualitybased judgment. He identified criteria such as background/experience, consensus within
the field, external verification, source quality, source reputation/visibility, effectiveness,
and time constraints, as hallmarks of satisfaction. Another marker of information
evaluation depicted by Bateman (1999) is of relevance. He identified quality, credibility,
and completeness as the critical factors of information relevance judgments made among
survey respondents. Aside from the larger criteria of relevance, quality, and satisfaction,
and their related sub-criteria, other evaluative criteria have also been identified. Rieh
(2002), for example, employed various high-level concepts consisting of information
evaluation elements, such as cognitive authority (e.g., trustworthy, credible, authoritative)
and topical interest in the Web environments.
Studies of criteria employed to evaluate information have also been conducted
within the context of online Q&A services. Janes, Hill, and Rolfe (2001) analyzed expert-

28
based reference services, focusing on the characteristics of questions as well as responses
received to the given questions, in order to examine their relevance within the library and
other professional information service fields. Findings indicated that additional or
alternative information in relation to the requestor’s stated information need proved an
important factor in determining the perceived quality of responses within expert-based
reference services. In addition, Kim, Oh, and Oh (2009) investigated evaluation criteria
employed by Yahoo! Answers users to select a “Best Answer”. The study identified 25
items as being essential to users’ evaluation of information content and grouped them
into six main categories: content value, cognitive value, socio-emotional value, extrinsic
value, information source value, and utility. The findings indicated that among these
categories, utility (effectiveness, solution feasibility) is the most critical factor in
evaluating answers, followed by socio-emotional value.
A recent study by Shah and Kitzie (2012) identified the additional factor of
trustworthiness as constituting one of the critical factors in making evaluative judgments
within online Q&A environments. Although these studies identify different high-level
criteria purported to structure and describe how information is evaluated, it is apparent
that both these high-level criteria and the factors identified as comprising them tend to
experience considerable overlap, suggesting that expectations influenced by information
evaluation follow a finite, explicable set of characteristics.
Although previous research exists that examines either the motivations for asking
a question to seek information or the evaluations of information, which articulates a
user’s expectations for the service within online Q&A, these studies have not considered

29
the relationship between motivations and expectations for the user’s information seeking
behavior within online Q&A. This relationship is important to consider, as addressed by
Feather (1982), who proposed that motivation is a function of expectation. Hsu et al.
(2010) argued that “an individual’s motivation to perform a certain activity is a function
of the expectation that he or she will be able to perform the activity and obtain the desired
outcomes, and the personal value of all outcomes associated with that activity” (pp. 284285). Therefore, this study will start with the assumption that both motivations for and
expectations of asking a question within an online Q&A environment constitute the
intervening processes for all following aspects of information seeking behavior that occur.
2.5. Summary of Literature Review
This chapter reviewed the core elements that construct user motivations and
expectations in the questioning experiences within the context of online Q&A for the
study. This section summarizes findings from the literature reviews and points out the
gaps that need to be filled for a better understanding of why people ask a question and
what they expect from other participants in online Q&A services.
The previous research studies focusing on questioning behaviors in online Q&A
services were reviewed. Even though they have been conducted to investigate a variety of
aspects of how and what questions are asked, it was identified that there is little
knowledge of the general backgrounds of what motivates people to ask a question and
how they judge information quality based on their expectation in the context of online
Q&A. Additionally, it was found that four different types of online Q&A services could
be classified based on unique characteristics of question-answering interactions, as well

30
as the online environments in which people interact with other people to seek and share
information. Since the focus of the study is to understand users’ questioning behaviors
that relate to interactions with unknown people, community-based and collaborative
online Q&A services may be appropriate for investigating users’ questioning behaviors
for the study because these services are designed to allow people ask their own question,
while unknown participants voluntarily provide answers.
Since one of the interests in this study is to investigate motivational factors for
asking a question in order to fulfill needs in online Q&A services, a number of theoretical
frameworks of motivation were reviewed in order to understand how questioning
behaviors could be understood by different perspectives of motivation. From the previous
literature related to information needs in the field of LIS, it was found that people tend to
be involved in information seeking behaviors to satisfy their need, which could be
different based on their unique situation. Thus, it was suggested that the content models
of motivation that conceptualize what factors or needs influence behaviors could be
helpful for the study since the main focus is to investigate different motivational factors
for asking a question in online Q&A environments.
Additionally, since the study assumed that motivation and expectation are
correlated in satisfying a user’s need when asking a question in online Q&A services, the
previous research studies focusing on how to judge information quality in field of LIS
were specifically reviewed because evaluative criteria are employed to judge how well an
information source fulfills their information need. The evaluation of information in
relation to these criteria also articulates a user’s expectations for this information.

31
Reviewing the previous studies on the evaluative criteria in the field of LIS helped gain a
broad sense of contextual backgrounds of what online Q&A users expect from others
with respect to their answers to a question.
The findings from the literature review indicated different types of motivational
factors expectation-based factors with a focus of the online Q&A users’ questioning
behaviors. These factors were then tested in this dissertation.

32
CHAPTER 3: CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
In this section, several theoretical frameworks that guide the proposed research,
including developing research questions are presented. These are everyday life
information seeking, social exchange theory, communities of practice, uses and
gratifications, and sense-making. First, everyday life information seeking (ELIS)
provides the general outline of how people engage in human-to-human interactions by
asking a question to fulfill their information need within an online Q&A context. Since
human-to-human interactions and social contexts are important places to conceptualize
humans’ information seeking behaviors in everyday life contexts, social exchange theory
and communities of practice facilitate an understanding of how people exchange
information through the question-answering process within online Q&A sites. Finally, in
order to investigate social contexts and situations that influence asking a question using
an online Q&A service, this proposal pays attention to online Q&A users’ motivations
and expectations. Uses and gratifications theory will be used to describe motivations,
since it conceptualizes the different types of needs expressed when people ask a question
within online Q&A sites. Sense-making is proposed as the conceptual framework to
understand expectations based on the asker’s unique situation.
3.1. Asking a Question for Seeking Information in Everyday Life Information
Seeking
The advent of the Internet has enabled people to ask a question in order to seek
information for their information need within online environments. Online Q&A is a
Web environment where people ask a question to seek information for their information

33
need in the online environments. Within an online Q&A environment, people can ask a
question across a broad range of topics (Harper et al., 2008). Thus, online Q&A sites
provide an everyday life information-seeking context that allows people who are
confronted with a problematic situation to acquire the information necessary to solve it.
In this instance, the theoretical framework of everyday life information seeking (ELIS)
developed by Savolainen (1995) could be useful to contextualize how people visit online
Q&A to ask a question.
Everyday life information seeking (ELIS) is a holistic framework for
understanding how people seek information within their daily life. Savolainen (1995)
provides the concept of a “way of life”, derived from the notion of habitus (Bourdieu,
1984), which conceptualizes information seeking as “a natural component of everyday
practices” (p.261). The ELIS framework helps researchers to understand how people use
information to solve their everyday problematic situations. Unlike other theories and
models of information seeking behavior based on investigations of scholars’ or
professionals’ task-related information behaviors (for example, Ellis, 1993; Kuhlthau,
1993), ELIS serves as a framework for ‘‘the acquisition of various informational (both
cognitive and expressive) elements which people employ to orient themselves in the daily
life or to solve problems not directly associated with the performance of occupational
tasks’’ (Savolainen, 1995, pp. 266–267). However, the study of ELIS points out that
everyday life and work or job-related tasks are inextricably tied (see Figure 3.1 for details
of the structure of ELIS practices). Therefore within online Q&A, it can be argued that
some may ask a question to seek information to solve personal issues (e.g., health) while

34
others may use online Q&A for their professional or academic tasks (e.g., homework).

Figure 3.1. The basic components of the study of ELIS in the context of “way of life”
(Savolainen, 1995).
Previous Library and Information Science (LIS) literature has paid much attention
to understanding human information behavior through the theoretical framework of ELIS

35
(see Carey, McKechnie, & McKenzie, 2001; Given, 2002; Julien & Michels, 2000;
Shenton & Dixon, 2004; Spink & Cole, 2001; Wick, 2004, Williamson, 1997) among
different populations and settings. These studies have similarly stressed two important
factors in determining peoples’ information seeking behaviors in the daily life world: (1)
human sources of information and (2) specific problem-solving contexts. In this fashion,
McKenzie (2003) proposed a model of information practices with emphasis on social
interactions and contexts in human information seeking within the ELIS framework.
The most significant attribute in online Q&A services that distinguishes it from
promoting traditional information retrieval (IR) is that an information seeker is engaged
into human-to-human interactions when asking a question in various social contexts.
Additionally, traditional approaches of information seeking behavior have focused on
scholarly and professional tasks, whereas online Q&A is designed to seek contextual
information for an asker’s unique ELIS situation. Therefore, the development of a
theoretical framework to understand how social interactions, contexts, and situations
within everyday life contribute to asking questions would be useful to gain a better
understanding of what motivates people to visit online Q&A services and what the users’
expectations are with respect to question responses.
3.2. Human-to-human Interactions for Seeking and Sharing Information
Social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) may provide a theoretical approach to
explain how individual users interact to fulfill information needs within online Q&A.
This theory is derived from economics with a focus on the exchange of economic value.
Cropanzano and Mitchell (2005) also argued that exchanges can be related to symbolic

36
relevance, where people tend to seek and share a “symbolic benefit” rather than
“objective worth” (p.880). Foa and Foa (1974, 1980) proposed six exchange resources:
love, status, information, money, goods, and services; this was divided into two major
outcomes: economic outcomes (economic exchange) and socio-emotional outcomes
(social exchange). In other words, exchanges for economic outcomes are more likely
related to money, goods, and services, and the people involved in such exchange
transactions desire “objective worth,” whereas love, status, and information for socioemotional outcomes is produced from exchanges likely developed for “symbolic benefit.”
Additionally, Blau (1964) argued that social exchange is distinct from economic
exchange because it is less likely linked to objective worth, which “involves favors” and
“engender[s] feelings of personal obligations, gratitude, and trust” (p.94), whose benefits
are hardly quantified or matched by the price.
Online Q&A provides a means for people to engage in social exchanges through
question answering interactions for seeking and sharing specific information that helps
satisfy each asker’s information need. In other words, people receive specific answers
tailored to their information needs (Shah, Oh, & Oh, 2009), and an asker also values the
affective elements of social Q&A sites, often posting content soliciting advice and
opinions, as well as general social engagement (Kim, Oh, & Oh, 2007). This indicates
that online Q&A users utilize services to ask a question with the expectation of receiving
different socio-emotional outcomes (Foa & Foa, 1974; 1980). This is in comparison to
other information sources (e.g. keyword-based search engines) where people are only
allowed to input their query and cannot interact with others in order to fulfill information

37
needs. According to Monge and Contractor (2003), social exchange theory posits that
people regulate their interactions with others based on the overall worth of interactions.
Thus, people may continue to use online Q&A to seek a particular socio-emotional
outcome (e.g., factual knowledge, opinion or advice, or social engagement, etc.) over
other information sources when the perceived value of social interactions in online Q&A
is positive. This signifies that the benefits (e.g. receiving relevant information based on
the unique situation of the asker) are greater than the costs (e.g. investing time to
formulate a question, as opposed to entering keywords, to express an information need).
Communities of practice constitute another appropriate framework for
understanding the use of human-to-human interactions to seek and share information in
an online environment. This approach is used because social interactions are necessary
for knowledge exchange among people. Lave and Wenger (1993) originally developed
the concept of communities of practice, which is described as “a set of relations among
persons, activity and world, over time and in relation with other tangential and
overlapping communities of practices” (p.98). Lave and Wenger (1993) argued that
participation is a critical factor for interaction within any environment (e.g., virtual,
physical co-presence, etc.) where people participate in activities where they have a
common interest and/or understanding that promotes information sharing and exchange
(Kimble, Hildreth, & Wright, 2001).
In accordance with Wenger (1998, 2004), a group of people within a community
develop social norms and construct collaborative relationships with one another, i.e.,
mutual engagement, in order to achieve “problem solving, requests for information,

38
discussion of developments, information seeking and coordination, planning, or
negotiation of meaning” (Mills, 2011, p.349) through developing a shared understanding
or joint enterprise within an interaction. Thus, the notion of communities of practice
posits that people within a community develop a shared repertoire as a part of their
practice that is used in “the pursuit of their joint enterprise and can include both literal
and symbolic meanings” (Wenger, 1998, p.73). In this respect, a notion of communities
of practice has been discussed in order to understand effective ways of sharing
information and to investigate collaborative knowledge sharing within a variety of online
contexts. Faraj and Wasko (2001), for example, utilized the concept of communities of
practice in order to understand the dynamics of knowledge exchange among three
technical computer related newsgroups on Usenet. The study found that the motivation
for professional affiliation has a significant relationship with knowledge acquisition and
contribution, as well as knowledge exchange with like-minded people. Moreover,
Ardichvili et al. (2002) argued that a majority of respondents regarded collaboration for
sharing knowledge in virtual communities of practice as a useful problem-solving tool
that helps obtain specific expertise from others.
The theoretical approach of communities of practice focuses on a shared domain
of interest and engagement in participation between groups of people within a community
to promote the seeking and sharing of information, as well as mutual engagement when
delivering information. Although Shachaf (2010) argued that online Q&A communities
might differ in scope and means of operation to share and seek information, this approach
helps us to understand how users’ social interactions of seeking and sharing information

39
in online Q&A environments affect information seeking and sharing. Online Q&A
provides an opportunity to investigate how people ask a question in order to acquire
information via their social interactions with other people for their general concerns and
topics of interest in various everyday life information contexts.
3.3. Seeking Contextual Information to Address an Asker’s Unique Situation
To investigate social contexts and situations that influence asking a question using
an online Q&A service, the study focused on the two elements – motivations and
expectations – of online Q&A users’ information behavior. Understanding user
motivations behind asking a question and expectations with respect to potential responses
could provide a general framework of for conceptualizing different contexts of
information needs that drive people into social interactions for seeking information
within online Q&A information seeking situations.
First, uses and gratifications theory is taken in order to investigate users’
motivations for asking a question. This approach explains the motivations related to using
a specific form of media (Swanson, 1979), and assumes that active media users tend to be
goal-directed, achieve their goals and needs through media uses (Katz, Blumler, &
Gurevitch, 1974), and exercise awareness of their needs by choosing a specific media
outlet they think will best gratify them (Blumler, 1979; Swanson, 1979). This theoretical
approach provides insight into media users’ psychology and behaviors (Lin, 1996) in
addition to “(1) the social and psychological origins of (2) needs, which generate (3)
expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources, which lead to (5) differential patterns
of media exposure (or engagement in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratifications

40
and (7) other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974, p. 20).
McQuail, Blumler and Brown (1972) developed a typology of media use based on
the gratification users sought. This typology consists of “(1) diversion (escape, emotional
release), (2) personal relationships (companionship, social utility), (3) personal identity
(personal reference, reality exploration, value reinforcement), and (4) surveillance
(acquiring news and information)” (p. 162). Similar to the typology of needs for media
use developed by McQuail et al. (1972), Katz et al. (1973) also attempted to identify
thirty-five needs associated with one’s resources, and group those needs into five major
categories: “(1) Needs related to strengthening information, knowledge, and
understanding —these can be called cognitive needs; (2) Needs related to strengthening
aesthetic, pleasurable and emotional experience—or affective needs; (3) Needs related to
strengthening credibility, confidence, stability, and status—these combine both cognitive
and affective elements and can be labeled integrative needs; (4) Needs related to
strengthening contact with family, friends, and the world. These can also be seen as
performing an integrative function; and (5) Needs related to escape or tension-release
which we define in terms of the weakening of contact with self and one’s social roles”
(p.166).
While the theoretical framework of uses and gratifications provides insights into
different motivations for engaging with online Q&A services to ask a question, a useful
theoretical framework for understanding what people expect to receive from others to
address their uncertainty and the problematic situations derived from this unknown is
Dervin’s (1983,1992, 1996) sense-making model. This model argues that information is

41
“subjectively constructed by the person seeking the information” (Cole, 1997, p.55), and
employs the “situation-gap-use” metaphor in order to explain information seeking and its
use through understanding how the information seeker embedded in a particular context
or situation utilizes information to bridge the gap in his or her understanding to solve a
problem (see Figure 3.2).
Social contexts constitute the unique circumstance in which each information
seeker recognizes an inadequacy in his or her knowledge state, or recognizes a ‘gap’ in
his or her reality, and then attempts to construct a bridge by acquiring information in
order to once again make sense of the world. As different situations lead to different
information needs and uses during the process of information seeking (Dervin, 1977),
people may expect to receive contextual information unique to their situation. This may
also signify that there could be different expectations in constructing the subsequent
bridge based on each information seeker’s unique situation.

Figure 3.2. Dervin’s (1992) sense-making metaphor.
3.4. Summary of Theoretical Frameworks
The study attempts to gain a better understanding of an asker’s information

42
seeking behavior with emphasis on motivations for asking a question and the
expectations with respect to the responses within online Q&A. Savolainen’s (1995)
concept of everyday life information seeking (ELIS) emphasizes different everyday life
contexts fostered by social interactions through different media use. Social exchange
theory and the notion of communities of practice can be applied in order to better
understand the social interactions that occur to facilitate information seeking within
online Q&A. These theoretical frameworks posit the importance of human-to-human
interactions to seek and share information among a group of people, which constitute a
critical feature of online Q&A.
Finally, the uses and gratifications approach and Dervin’s sense-making model
are proposed to demonstrate how individuals’ social contexts and situations are
conceptualized as subsequent motivations and expectations for asking questions, with
specific emphasis on their interrelationships. Figure 3.3 visualizes the relationships
between theoretical approaches, which helps in understanding human-to-human
interactions by asking a question within an online Q&A context.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
This chapter describes the methodology used in the study of online Q&A users’
motivations and expectations for asking questions in order to satisfy their needs. In this
dissertation, the motivational factors identified by the uses and gratifications approach, as
well as expectations based on variables identified in previous literature that form the
evaluative criteria employed to judge information, were examined using a mixedmethods design.
4.1. Research Questions
The goal of this study was to investigate online Q&A users’ contexts and
situations behind a questioning behavior. Especially, the user’s expectations and
motivations that prompt him or her to ask a question to others for seeking contextual
information unique to their situations were examined. Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers
were selected because people interact predominantly with unknown individuals in order
to seek information in a wide range of topics within the online environments. This is
opposed to other types of online Q&A services where people ask a question in a specific
area (i.e., virtual reference services) or ask a question to known people (i.e., social
networking sites). To do this, the following research questions were proposed:
RQ1. What motivates people to ask a question that address their needs in Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers?
RQ2. What are an asker’s expectations from other users to fulfill his or her needs
when asking questions in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers?

45
RQ3. How do motivations of asking a question relate to expectations of answer
content in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers?
RQ4. To what extent are motivations, expectations, and the relationship between
motivations and expectations different and/or similar between Yahoo! Answers
and WikiAnswers?
4.2. Research Design
To address the research questions, this dissertation used a mixed-methods design
(Creswell, 2003), more specifically a sequential mixed method design (Morse & Niehaus,
2009) that blends quantitative and qualitative research in a single study. It is argued that
quantitative and qualitative approaches could complement each other and the
combination of these approaches could foster a more comprehensive data analysis
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998) and sharpen the understanding of findings (Gay & Airasian,
2000; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). In a mixed-methods design, multiple research
approaches are employed to collect and analyze data. Sieber (1973) argues that
integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches could be effective not only to
develop the research design, but also to help data collection and analysis. For example, at
each stage of the research design, qualitative research provides the rationale to design
quantitative research (e.g., a survey), and the researcher’s familiarity, insights, and
information can “make a major contribution to the development of a meaningful survey
design” (p.1342). Quantitative research helps the researcher identify representative cases
that should be more carefully explored to interpret the meanings derived from qualitative
research. At the data collection stage, quantitative research helps avoid an “elite bias”

46
(e.g., having gratitude to the elite, keeping on good terms with the elite, etc.), which
hampers the researcher’s “objectivity throughout the ensuing study” (p.1352) before
conducting qualitative research (e.g., an interview). Elites are defined as interview
participants who “are often more articulate and give the impression of being better
informed about the group than any other member” (p.1352). On the other hand,
qualitative research provides “a means of gaining legitimation” (p.1344) to gather
participants for quantitative research. Finally, at the stage of data analysis, qualitative
research is useful not only to verify and interpret statistical findings from quantitative
research, but also to clarify responses collected in quantitative research, while
quantitative research takes important roles in verifying data interpretation, generalizing
findings, and casting new light on findings in qualitative research.
It is also important to identify how mixed research methods should be
appropriately organized to address questions in the research. Thus, Creswell et al. (2003)
provided important criteria that the researcher should consider when designing research,
as well as when collecting and analyzing data. These are: (1) determining which method
(quantitative or qualitative) should be prioritized; (2) deciding which data collection
procedures (sequential, concurrent, or transformative) should be implemented; and (3)
integrating the multiple research approaches. Moreover, previous studies have formulated
a typology of mixed methods research designs depending on characteristics and contexts
of the research setting (see Creswell, 2002; Greene et al., 1989; Leech & Onwuegbuzie,
2009; Morse, 1991; Steckler et al., 1991). For instance, Leech and Onwuegbuzie (2009)
conceived three-dimensional mixed methods designs, i.e., “the 2 (partially mixed versus

47
fully mixed) x 2 (concurrent versus sequential) x 2 (equal status versus dominant status)
matrix” (p.268). These designs were developed based on three criteria proposed by
Creswell et al. (2003): (1) partially mixed concurrent equal status design; (2) partially
mixed concurrent dominant status design; (3) partially mixed sequential equal status
design; (4) partially mixed sequential dominant status design; and (5) fully mixed
concurrent equal status design. The purpose of this study was first to identify
motivational and expectation-based variables for asking a question, to investigate the
general characteristics of these variables and their relationships, and then to expand the
understandings of these findings. Therefore, a sequential mixed method design was used,
which employs a survey to investigate general characteristics of variables in motivations
and expectations for asking questions within online Q&A sites to identify representative
cases of online Q&A users’ motivational and expectation-based factors (phase 1). This
was then followed by the diary method to collect information about online users’
questioning behavior patterns for interviews (phase 2). Interviews were then conducted
to help interpret meanings in contexts and situations of these patterns, as well as clarify
responses collected from the data of the first two phases (phase 3). Figure 4.1 illustrates
the sequential research design employed in this study.

Figure 4.1. Sequential explanatory design in this dissertation.
In phase 1, an Internet-based survey was distributed to collect quantitative data
that provided the big picture of users’ motivations and expectations for asking questions
within the context of online Q&A. The purpose of the quantitative research phase was to
identify motivational and expectation-based variables within an online Q&A context,
generalize online users’ motivations behind asking a question and expectations for
responses to their question within online Q&A sites, and finally attempt to select
participants representing different cases of questioning behaviors for the next two phases
in the research design.
In phase 2, prior to conducting interviews, the diary method was used to illustrate
participants’ general online searching behavior, as well as their motivations and
expectations for asking questions within online Q&A. Different types of motivations and
expectations to be investigated in this research are listed in section 4.4.2. The purpose of
the survey in phase 1 was to analyze the general characteristics of users’ questioning
behaviors, including their motivations and expectations. Yet, it was limited in
understanding specific contexts or situations that influence user motivations to choose an
online Q&A when asking questions. Therefore, it might be necessary to supplement
survey results with follow-up interviews for an interview analysis of their contexts and
situations. However, interviews for investigating specific previous events, i.e., asking
questions within online Q&A sites, need to rely on the interview participants’ past
experiences, which could be inaccurately recalled. Thus, the diary method in phase 2
helped collect real-time information about moments in which online Q&A users are

49
engaged in the question-answering process to satisfy their needs in natural and
spontaneous settings. Thus, this phase was used as a starting point to elicit further
information and document online Q&A users’ motivations and expectations each time
they asked a question within online Q&A sites, for interviews in phase 3.
In phase 3, interviews were conducted for qualitative data collection and analysis,
which provide “depth and texture” (Hodgkin, 2008, p.296) in explaining online Q&A
users’ motivational factors and expectations for asking questions in different
representative cases that were identified from an Internet-based survey in phase 1. As
Kvale (1983) argues, “an interview [has the] purpose […] to gather descriptions of the
life-world of the interviewee with respect to interpretation of the meaning of the
described phenomena” (p.174). Therefore, conducting a series of interviews in phase 3
was a useful technique to understand specific situations and/or contexts that affect
motivations and expectations in asking a question on online Q&A sites, as well as to
explore the meanings of participants’ responses, and information collected through the
survey and the diary in the previous phrases.
Information and documents collected through an Internet-based survey in phase 1
and the diary in phase 2 not only provided objective and generalized findings about
online Q&A users’ questioning behavior pattern with emphasis on motivational and
expectation-based variables, but also helped identify representative cases for conducting
interviews to analyze the situated contexts of asking questions for satisfying needs within
online Q&A environments.
4.3. Target Population and Sample

50
The target population was online Q&A users who actively ask their own questions.
This study included online Q&A sites Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, respectively
representing community-based Q&A services and collaborative Q&A services (Choi et
al., 2012). A detailed review of each type of online Q&A is presented in section 2.1. To
select potential participants for an Internet-based survey in phase 1, it was required that
the participants had used one of online Q&A sites listed above, and asked at least one
question during the previous six months. Moreover, participants from the United States
were only considered for the survey recruitment in order to avoid possible cultural
variances.
A total of 226 such participants, including 75 participants from the pilot study
were recruited for the survey for the quantitative research portion. For phases 2 and 3 for
the qualitative research component of this dissertation, maximal variation sampling was
used to seek approximate representative samples for multiple cases. Maximal variation
sampling is a purposeful sampling where the researcher selects different sample cases,
which “represent the complexity of our world” (Creswell, 2002, p.194). This sampling
“yields detailed descriptions of each case, in addition to identifying shared patterns that
cut across cases” (Hoepfl, 1997, p.54), which maximizes the diversity, close to the whole
populations, in the study.
Thus, identifying how many cases should be selected for the qualitative research
portion of this study was dependent upon the data collection and analysis in the
quantitative research phase. A total of 18 participants were selected from the survey
participants based on participants’ responses: (1) gender; (2) age; (3) general Web search

51
behaviors; (4) history of online Q&A site use; (5) use of different types of online Q&A;
(6) motivations and expectations for asking questions; and (7) their relationships when
asking questions within online Q&A sites. This selection could help explore user
behaviors that are both unique and similar (Sandelowski, 1995) within the context of
online Q&A environments.
4.4. Data Collection
4.4.1. Phase 1- Survey
The first phase of this dissertation was to conduct an Internet-based survey mainly
focused on quantitative data collection and analysis to identify and investigate
characteristics of online Q&A users’ motivations and expectations for asking questions
and the relationships between motivations and expectations.
The quantitative survey approach focused on descriptive and experimental
analysis in a population in order to make inferences with numerical data (Charles &
Mertler, 2002). This approach analyzed variables referring to characteristics or attributes
of the objects in phenomena and used statistical measurement and observation (Creswell,
2002). This constituted a useful data collection method because it could analyze
significant phenomena based on a frequency of motivation and expectation, which helped
explain the contextual backgrounds and situations of Q&A user’s behavioral processes
when asking a question.
A total of 226 participants from Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers participated
in the Internet-based survey. Among 226 survey participants, 126 (55.75%) were Yahoo!
Answers users and 100 (44.25%) were WikiAnswers users. The survey was based on the

52
self-reporting questionnaire consisting of different formats of questions such as openended questions, as well as Likert-scale based self-assessment questions. The survey
questionnaire consisted of thirty four questions, which were also grouped into five
categories: (1) demographics; (2) general Web and questioning behaviors; (3)
motivational factors behind asking questions within online Q&A services; (4)
expectations from other users with respect to their response to the question asked within
online Q&A services; and (5) general experiences asking questions within online Q&A
services. The details of the survey questionnaire are provided in Appendix 3. Since the
study focused on active users who visit online Q&A to ask a question for satisfying their
needs rather than those who search similar questions answered without asking their own
question in online Q&A, it was not possible or practical to conduct a random sampling.
Rather, online Q&A users who have asked at least one question during previous six
months were purposefully selected in order to address the research questions for the study.
An online survey tool was administrated using Google Form6 and the survey link
was distributed via various communication channels (e.g., a direct message via an email,
Facebook page, Twitter promotion, and advertising on classified sites) in order to reach
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers users.
First, Yahoo! Answers provide the users’ profile pages where they optionally
include their personal contact (e.g., email, IM). A direct message via email was used to
distribute the survey link (see Appendix 1 for a recruitment message form for the survey).
However, since sending a direct message was limited to 10 per day using a same account,

Google form is one of Google Drive products in which users are able to create a survey and link to to a Google
spreadsheet for responses from participants.

53
20 different made-up accounts were created in order to distribute 200 direct messages to
Yahoo! Answers users. The initial distribution ran from March 10th to March 29th, 2013
for the purpose of the pilot study. A second series was conducted from November 12th to
November 29th, 2013. In both instances, a survey link distribution via a direct message
for Yahoo! Answers users included additional reminder emails for a recruitment message
that were sent the week after the first email recruitment message.
Second, the Facebook page7 was created to promote the online survey distribution
in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers users. The page was configured to only be
visible to individuals over 18 years of age who currently live in the United States. The
page was promoted with a paid advertisement measured by pay-per-clicks and
impressions. A total of USD 39.70 was used for the Facebook page promotion to raise 10
clicks and 2,294 impressions for 10 days. This means that 2,294 users saw the Facebook
promotion page for the online Q&A survey and 10 Facebook users clicked the survey
link through the Facebook page. Third, Twitter was utilized to expand the online survey
distribution channel. A short description of the study was posted with a Twitter hashtag
(e.g., #yahooanswers, #wikianswers) in order to expose the survey recruitment message
to other Twitter users who have similar ideas or expressions (Tsur & Rappoport, 2012),
particularly related to these two online Q&A sites.
Last, classifieds Websites (i.g., backpage.com, craigslist.com) were used to
promote the online survey with both paid and free promotions, especially to
WikiAnswers users since, unlike Yahoo! Answers, WikiAnswers does not provide users’
profile pages on which they are able to provide their personal contact information (e.g.,
7

https://www.facebook.com/onlineQA?ref=tn_tnmn	  

54
email, IM). The survey recruitment message was posted on a community/volunteer page
in the top 50 major cities8 within these two classifieds Websites. Since using the same
subject in the posting for different cities could be automatically detected or suspected as
spam, different subjects were used for posting the same survey recruitment message (e.g.,
“Participants for the WikiAnswers study!”, “WikiAnswers Survey: participants needed
for the short survey”, “Seeking Yahoo! Answers users for the short online survey”, etc.).
Moreover, the postings usually expired after a certain time period (e.g., 7 days) after they
were created. New postings with a different subject for the survey recruitment message
were then created weekly over the course of one month (Oct 22nd, 2013 to Nov 24th,
2013).
4.4.2. Motivational and Expectation-based Variables
To investigate motivations behind asking questions in online Q&A services, the
dissertation conducted descriptive statistical analyses to measure participants’ responses
on the survey questionnaire that identify different types of motivations, using factors
indicated by previous typologies of motivations for media use (Katz, et al., 1973;
McQuail, 1983).
These typologies were chosen in the study since they remain the most
comprehensive account of user motivations of media use. Other previous research studies
attempting to investigate motivations of the Internet use in different contexts have
focused on a more narrow set of gratifications, which have limited the generalizability of
the findings (Cho et al., 2003). Table 4.1 presents motivational factors and variables in
quantitative analysis.

55
To identify an online Q&A user’s expectations with respect to their responses to
his/her question, this study used criteria identified by previous research studies on how
people evaluate information within LIS (Adamic et al., 2008; Barry, 1994; Bateman,
1999; Janes et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2009; Rieh 2002; Shah & Kitzie, 2012; Wang &
Soergel, 1998). Table 4.2 presents meta-analysis for identifying the expectation-based
variables that were used in the study.

4.4.2. Phase 2 - Diary
The diary method was conducted with selected participants from the Internetbased survey in phase 1, in order to collect diary data for interview in phase 3. The goal
of the interviews was to promote a greater understanding of contexts and situations that
influence information seeking behavior within online Q&A environments. However, one
of the challenges of interviews was that this methodological approach depends upon
participants’ ability to recall their previous behaviors. Brewer et al. (2004) argue that
incomplete memory of events may cause inaccurate recall and response. Additionally,
although a survey in phase 1 provided general characteristics of motivations and
expectations for asking a question, failures of recall could reduce the accuracy of selfreport measures (Crockett, Schulenberg, & Petersen, 1987) and cause “retrospective
aggregate responses that reflect faulty reconstruction of the phenomena of interest” (Reis,
1994, p.585). Therefore, to overcome the potential issues of recall, a diary method was
used to elicit information about online Q&A users’ motivations and expectations for
asking questions, as well as record their online information-seeking behaviors to
contextualize their online Q&A activities before conducting interviews.
Moreover, since the diary method captured comprehensive records of users’
events and activities online (Bruckman, 2006), as well as collected objective and
quantitative information about online users’ behavior patterns (Rieger, 2009), another

57
benefit of the diary method to this dissertation was to capture general information
regarding participants’ information-seeking behaviors that helped to broaden
understandings of how and when online Q&A services were used to satisfy their needs in
dynamic Web search environments.
A diary method was designed to capture “little experiences of everyday life that
fill most of our working time and occupy the vast majority of our conscious attention”
(Wheeler & Reis, 1991, p. 340). The benefits of the diary method in this dissertation are
that this data collection method allowed research participants to report their events and
experiences naturally and spontaneously (Reis, 1994). This data collection method has
gained in popularity in the LIS field as a mean to understand human-centered
perspectives of information behaviors in various contexts (e.g., see Byström & Järvelin,
1995; Hansen & Järvelin, 2005; Kuhlthau, 1991, 1993). Moreover, the diary method for
addressing the research questions in this study was designed with “the short term between
event occurrence and recording, hence, less subject to memory lapses and retrospective
messaging, as may be the case with interviews” (Hyldegård, 2006, p. 154), which
mitigate concerns of the potential incomplete recall in a transaction log. However, as
Bolger, Davis, and Rafaeli (2003) argued, a diary design for collecting incident log data
in this dissertation was concise and short. The diary was intended to take only a few
minutes for participants to complete because this type of data collection method usually
requires a certain level of participant commitment and dedication compared to other types
of research studies.
To implement the diary method in phase 2, this study used an extension toolbar

58
for the Firefox and Chrome browser called Coagmento (http://coagmento.org) (see
González-Ibáñez & Shah, 2012; Shah, 2010 for a detailed description of Coagmento).
This extension toolbar served as a client-level log data collection tool, which
automatically collected anonymized Web search information, but also allowed interview
participants to manually keep a diary for their questioning behaviors each time they ask
questions within online Q&A services.
The participants were asked to install an extension toolbar on their browsers (i.e.,
Firefox, Chrome) in order to collect diary data for 4 weeks prior to participating in
interviews. Figure 4.2 depicts the two core components of an extension toolbar in this
dissertation: (1) the toolbar – letting the participants connect to an extension toolbar into
their Firefox browser; and (2) the sidebar - allowing the participants to keep a diary of
their motivations and expectations each time they ask a question within online Q&A sites.

Figure 4.2. Components of an extension toolbar for diary data collection.

59
However, after the pilot study with two participants focusing on the clarity of
using an extension toolbar for collecting diary data, it was found that they had difficulties
keeping a diary of their questions, motivations, and expectations each time they posited a
question. Thus, it was necessary to modify the extension toolbar’s sidebar in order for
participants to more systemically keep a diary of their motivations and expectations,
which also helped facilitate more comprehensible data collection and analysis for the
study. These pilot study results with the two participants were excluded from the full
study. Figure 4.3 illustrates a modification of an extension toolbar’s sidebar for the full
study, which include semi-structured sections for: (1) a question asked by participants;
(2) a check box for participants’ motivational factors with comment; (3) a check box for
participants’ expectations with comments; (4) any other communication channels for
asking a similar question or consulting their needs; and (5) additional comments for their
information need.

60

Figure 4.3. Screenshot of the browser sidebar for recording a diary instance.
The diary data collection spanned 4 weeks in order to obtain sufficient diary
entries, especially instances of participants’ motivations and expectations each time they
use online Q&A site to ask a question. A shorter period of time for the diary data
collection less than 4 weeks would collect insufficient data for analyses, while a longer
period of time might increase the already significant burden on participants.
The findings from the pilot study for the survey with 75 Yahoo! Answers users
showed that they normally ask one or two questions a month. This indicated that the diary
data collection with approximately 20 participants for 4 weeks would generate
approximately 25-30 incidents of asking a question. These incidents would then be used
as the basis for interviews.
Table 4.3 illustrates types of information collected by this method for the study.

61
Additionally, there was a sidebar where the participants were required to manually keep
their diary about motivations and expectations each time they asked a question within
online Q&A sites (see Appendix 5 for the diary form in a sidebar).

4.4.3. Phase 3 - Interview
Phone interviews were conducted with the same 18 individuals who participated
in the diary data collection and represented each case identified through quantitative
research in phase 1. Interviews were conducted with information about online Q&A users’
motivations and expectations for asking questions elicited via diary data from phase 2.
Data collection for the interview in phase 3 was based on the principles of the
Critical Incident Technique (CIT) to study more specific situations or incidents of the
users’ questioning behaviors for seeking information, as well as their expectations of
others based on their questions on the online Q&A sites. The CIT was first developed by
Flanagan (1954) for evaluating particular activities (Bycio & Allen, 2004; Jacoby &
O’Brien, 2005). This technique has been applied in several information needs and uses

62
studies (Martyn & Lancaster, 1981), including a qualitative evaluation of how students
perceive interactions with urban public librarians and library staff (Radford, 1999) and
library systems and information use (Tonta, 1992; Wilkins & Leckie, 1997; Wilson,
Starr-Schneidkraut & Cooper, 1989). As the CIT is designed to examine complex sets of
behavioral intentions (Urquhart et al., 2003) with a flexible set of procedures designed to
collect data on participants’ behaviors during actual situations (Miller et al., 2000), this
data collection approach for qualitative research enables the researcher to focus on each
interview participant’s specific situation or incident in which they are motivated to ask a
question to fulfill their needs, what they ask, as well as their expectations of others based
on their questions on the online Q&A sites.
Each phone interview took approximately 30 minutes to investigate the
participants’ motivations and expectations for asking questions. The interview was semistructured featuring open-ended questions based on diary data. However, the interview
protocol included probes that asked spontaneous questions in order to gain a better sense
of new information about participants’ questioning behaviors found during the interview.

• Can you explain what you used [the specific online Q&A
site] were helpful at that time?
• Why was [the specific online Q&A site] helpful in
searching information for you?

The interview was recorded with permission of the interview participants.
Additionally, to analyze the collected data, the data was transcribed into a word processor
and organized by each unique critical incident identified in the question-answering
process within online Q&A sites. Table 4.4 illustrates the interview design with examples
of questions that address specific incidents and situations where participants are
motivated to ask a question within online Q&A sites.
4.5. Data Analysis
4.5.1. Survey Data Analysis

64
Descriptive analyses were used first to describe the general characteristics of the
survey participants’ motivational factors behind asking questions (RQ1), as well as their
expectations of others when asking question within online Q&A sites (RQ2). Descriptive
statistical analyses provided not only frequency distributions of motivations and
expectations, but also an overview of their demographic characteristics and general use of
the Internet and online Q&A sites. This analysis helped to assess how well variables are
correlated for each motivational factor. In the study, there were five motivational factors
and several variables within each factor. Thus, to test reliability of variables in
motivational factors, Cronbach’s α was measured for internal consistency reliability
analysis (Santos, 1999). This analysis helped assess how well variables are correlated for
each motivational factor.
To address RQ3, a series of linear regression analyses were also conducted to
investigate the relationship between motivations and expectations influencing online
Q&A users’ questioning behaviors. Correlation coefficients were also calculated to depict
the relationship between each of the two sets of variables in the study. Finally, clustering
analysis was employed to group the survey participants based on their backgrounds and
by their motivations and expectations for asking a question. This analysis provided
insights into the diversity of motivation and expectation characteristics, which helped to
identify the representative groups of Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers for qualitative
data collection and analysis in phases 2 and 3.
4.5.2. Diary Data Analysis
Three levels of analyses were

conducted to address the research questions.

65
These levels focused on information-seeking behaviors performed in the context of
online Q&A with an emphasis on users’ motivations (RQ1) and expectations (RQ2) for
asking questions: (1) each participant’s typical experiences, and how they differ in these
experiences; (2) the time span of their experiences, and how they differ in their time span;
and (3) processes underlying changes in participants’ experiences, and how they differ in
the processes (Bolger et al., 2003).
To understand participants’ motivations and expectations in the questioning
experiences within online Q&A sites, analysis focused on what types of motivations and
expectations participants have for each incident of questioning and how these variables
differ among participants. The types of questions were also examined to investigate the
relationships between tquestion type and a participant’s motivations and expectations.
Each participant’s motivations and expectations were analyzed to examine how similar
and/or different their motivations and expectations were for each question they asked
within online Q&A throughout the time of the data collection (4 weeks). .
Qualitative data collection and analysis using interviews was conducted to
interpret meanings that people create in social phenomena (Denzin, 1994), which
“develops a complex, holistic picture, analyzes words, reports detailed views of
informants, and conducts the study” (Creswell, 1998, p. 15). Multiple case studies (Stake,
1995) based on online Q&A users’ experiences with emphasis on their motivations and
expectations for asking questions were used.
A case study can be viewed as “a holistic inquiry that investigates a contemporary
phenomenon within its natural setting” (Harling, 2002, p.1) in order to explore specific

66
real-time situations or incidents where people ask questions and address “why" questions
(Darke, et al., 1998) within online Q&A. The data collected via diary data in phase 2 was
used for examining these real-time situations or incidents among participants during
interviews in phase 3.
4.5.3. Interview Data Analysis
The interview data was organized and prepared for analysis, and transcribed
interviews and any other notes obtained during the interview were stored to develop
codes and themes for qualitative analysis. Preliminary data exploration was conducted by
reading through all data (e.g., transcripts, notes, etc.) collected during the interview.
This process was conducted “to obtain a general sense of the information and to
reflect its meaning” (Creswell, 2003, p.191). The coding process consisted of “taking
data or pictures, segmenting sentences (or paragraphs) or images into categories, and
labeling those categories” (Creswell, 2003, p.192). Data analysis focused on developing
detailed descriptions (e.g., themes) rendering information about online Q&A users’
motivations and expectations for asking questions. This process was useful in developing
and comparing themes for each case, which reveal different perspectives on motivations
and expectations for asking questions within each instance.
The data analysis process focused on cross-case approaches to qualitative research
(Stake, 1995) to analyze how themes may be interconnected among the multiple cases of
online Q&A users’ motivations and expectations. It focuses on interpreting and
constructing meaning from the data from all cases. This stage was critical to synthesize
the data analysis within-case and across-

case approaches and report what lessons the

67
researcher learned (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) about online Q&A users’ questioning
processes through data collection and analysis. Moreover, since this study used a
sequential mixed method design, conducting quantitative research followed by qualitative
research, qualitative data findings and analyses in both phases 2 and 3 were integrated
with those of quantitative research from phase 1 to enhance the overall findings that
inform the research questions in the current study.
4.5.4. Summary of Data Analysis
This dissertation investigated online Q&A users’ questioning behaviors with a
specific focus on their motivations and expectations for asking questions within online
Q&A sites. To do so, quantitative data collection and analysis using an Internet-based
survey was conducted for providing a general and statistical overview of online Q&A
users’ motivations and expectations, as well as the relationships between motivations and
expectations. The diary data collection and phone interviews helped provide deeper
stories of multiple cases and enhance the findings from quantitative data collection and
analysis (Hodgkin, 2008).
Overall, a core component of the study was guided by the qualitative approach for
collecting and analyzing data via diary data and phone interviews. This provided a more
comprehensive interpretation of online Q&A users’ behavioral processes by
incorporating an asker’s motivations and expectations. The quantitative data collection
and analysis using an Internet-based survey in phase 1 provided essential components for
soliciting objective perspectives for the study, as well as identifying representative cases
for the qualitative research approach using

a diary method with follow-up interviews.

68
Moreover, the integration of the survey results and findings from diary data and
interviews occurred in the final stage of data analysis, which will bolster understandings
of online Q&A users’ contexts of information seeking behavior.

69
CHAPTER 5: FINDINGS
This chapter provides the details of findings identified by a sequential mixed
method in the study. The overview of the data analysis was conducted in the three phases:
(1) the Internet-based survey; (2) diary, and (3) interviews, are presented in Section 5.1.
This includes detailed backgrounds of the participants in the survey, characteristics of the
selected participants in the diary data collection and interviews, and how each method in
the three phases was conducted in order to address the research questions.
In Section 5.2, the first research question attempted to address what motivates
people to ask a question in online Q&A services. The findings of user motivations
identified from both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis are
presented. In Section 5.3, the second research question related to user expectations from
other online Q&A users with respect to their answers to a question, which constitute
personalized assessments of answer quality was discussed. The findings of user
expectations from the survey, diary, and interviews in the research phases are presented.
In Section 5.4, the third research question addressed how user motivations and
expectations were correlated with one another based on an asker’s unique situations in
which he or she decided to ask a question in online Q&A services. Section 5.6 illustrates
additional findings of the participants’ questioning behaviors identified especially by
analysis of the interview data. This is followed by a summary of all findings from the
three methods in the study in Section 5.7.

70
5.1. Overview of the Data Analysis
5.1.1. Backgrounds of the Survey Participants
A total of 226 Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers users participated in the survey
in order to collect quantitative information of general characteristics of online Q&A users,
and draw statistical inferences of their motivations and expectations for asking a question.
This section describes the general backgrounds of the survey participants from Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers (e.g., demographic characteristics, Web search behaviors, use
of online Q&A services). 141 females (62.39%) and 85 males (37.61%) of Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers participated in the survey, and the average age of the survey
participants was 32.96 years old (S.D.=13.17), ranging from 18 years old to 69 years old.
The level of education among the survey participants was relatively high; 110 (48.67%)
participants have some college degree (e.g., BA, BS, etc.) and 62 (27.43%) participants
have an advanced degree (e.g., MA, MBA, PhD, etc.). Only 54 (23.89%) participants
have high school or less than high school education. Table 5.1 shows all details of
demographic characteristics of the survey participants.

As presented in Table 5.2, most survey participants reported that they conduct
moderate to frequent Web searching to seek information (4-6 searches per day, n=37,
16.37%; 7-10 searches per day, n=44, 19.47%; More than 10 searches per day, n=103,
45.58%), while a small group of people (n=42, 18.58%) indicated that they do not
actively use the Web. In regard to a history of online Q&A use, 108 (47.79%)
participants have used more than one year and only 49 participants (21.68%) are
relatively new to either Yahoo! Answers or WikiAnswers. Additionally, the surveyed
participants were asked for information regarding their previous activities, especially the
number of questions they have asked in Yahoo! Answers. It was found that most
participants have asked less than 10 questions during their online Q&A use (n=95,
42.04%), followed by asking more than 40 questions (n=48, 21.24%), and asking 11-20
questions (n=39, 17.26%)

As presented in Table 5.3, it was found that fact-finding and advice-seeking
question are the most frequent question type that the participants ask in online Q&A
services (fact-finding, Mean=3.07, 1.25; advice-seeking, Mean=3.02, S.D=1.29),
followed by opinion–seeking question (Mean=2.91, S.D.=1.31) and fact-finding question
(Mean=2.92, S.D=1.20). It was found that self expression is the least frequent question
type people ask in online Q&A services (Mean=2.44, S.D.=1.35); 78 (34.51%) of the
survey participants indicated that they never ask a question to express their thoughts or
ideas without an explicit attempt of seeking information. These question types were
measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1-Never to 5-Always) in this dissertation.

5.1.2. Identifying Representatives from the Survey for Diary and Interviews
The 18 participants were selected from the survey, and recruited to participate in
both diary and interviews. Hierarchical clustering analysis was first conducted in order to
identify representatives of different groups of Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers
participants from the survey. These groups were identified based on their survey
responses to 34 questions that targeted their demographic background, Web search
behaviors, questioning behaviors in the online Q&A services, and their motivational and
expectation-based factors for asking a question. Ward’s (1963) agglomerative method

73
was used for hierarchical clustering analysis because it is a useful procedure to identify
mutually exclusive groups based on quantitative variables. This method also attempts to
split the data in a fairly equal size since the main purpose of conducting hierarchical
clustering in the study was to seek a wide range of instances that represent different cases
of the survey participants and their questioning behaviors. Additionally, the mean cityblock distance (Everitt, 1980) was used to calculate similarities in participants’ responses
since most survey questionnaires were created with the Likert-based scales.

First, in terms of analyzing the hierarchical clustering with the Yahoo! Answers
survey data, a total of 10 groups of Yahoo! Answers survey participants were identified
based on their demographic backgrounds, Web search behaviors, questioning behaviors
in Yahoo! Answers, and their motivations and expectations for asking a question. The
Pearson’s Chi-square test identified that a total of 23 features out of 33 features of the
Yahoo! Answers participants and their questioning behaviors were significantly different
among the 10 groups identified from hierarchical clustering analysis. Table 5.4 illustrates
each feature that has the significant influence on identifying the 10 different groups of
Yahoo! Answers participants. Additionally, the characteristic of each feature among the
ten identified groups in Yahoo! Answers are presented in Table 5.5.

Second, hierarchical clustering analysis with the WikiAnswers survey data
identified the eight different groups of WikiAnswers survey participants based on their
demographic backgrounds, Web search behaviors, and questioning behaviors in
WikiAnswers. 29 out of 33 features of the WikiAnswers participants and their
questioning behaviors were significantly different among the eight groups identified from
hierarchical clustering analysis. Table 5.6 illustrates each feature that highlights the

76
significant influence in grouping the clusters of WikiAnswers participants. Additionally,
the characteristics of each feature among the ten identified groups in WikiAnswers are
presented in Table 5.7.

A total of 18 different groups were identified by hierarchical clustering analysis
based on the participants’ survey responses to questions regarding their backgrounds, as
well as motivation and expectation for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers. Each group constitutes different sizes of survey participants, ranging from
6 to 22.
The first round of recruitment to seek participants from Yahoo! Answers was
conducted via email, which the participants provided in the survey from Dec 19th to Dec
25th, 2013. An additional reminder email was sent out to those solicited in the week
following the first survey distribution for the Yahoo! Answers survey participants. The
second round of recruitment to identify participants from WikiAnswers went from Dec
26th, 2013 to Jan 3rd, 2014. An additional reminder email was also sent out to those
solicited in the week following the first survey distribution for the WikiAnswers survey
participants.
A couple of participants from each group were first recruited for the diary data
collection and interviews, and the next group of participants was approached in case the
first group of participants did not respond to the recruitment email. However, since the
first six participants selected for the study dropped out, another recruitment phase was

79
conducted from Jan 25th to Feb 5th, 2014. The initial data collected by these six
participants was excluded for data analysis.
Finally, a total of 18 participants, 10 participants from the Yahoo! Answers
survey and 8 participants from the WikiAnswers survey, were recruited for the diary data
collection and interviews. Each selected participant was representative of different cases
in order to recruit these representatives for the diary data collection and interviews.
5.1.2. Backgrounds of Diary Data
In the second phase, diary data was collected from the 18 participants for a 4week period via the extension tool that was required to be installed on the participant’s
Web browser (i.e., Chrome, Firefox). The extension toolbar was mainly used for the diary
data collection. 18 participants were required to write a short electronic diary for each
time they asked a question in online Q&A (See Figure 8 for the design of the extension
toolbar). Once the participants logged into the toolbar during their Web search session,
other information such as their web page visits, web search queries, and time they visit
specific sites including Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers were also automatically
collected.
5.1.2.1. Characteristics of the Participants in Diary
A total of 18 participants from the survey in phase 1 were selected to participate
in the diary data collection. The same 18 participants who participated in the diary data
collection also participated in the follow-up interview to explore a set of cases relating to
asking a question in online Q&A over a 4-week period. In order to provide better

80
understanding of each participant in the diary data collection and interviews, the
descriptive of demographic profiles were presented in Table 5.8.
13 females (72.22%) and 5 males (27.78%) participated in the diary data
collection, and an average age of the participants was 35.72 years old (S.D=14.41),
ranging from 21 years old to 69 years old. The level of education among the participants
was high; 16 (88.89) participants had at least some college degree (e.g., BA, BS, etc.),
while only 2 (11.11%) participants had high school education.

As presented in Table 5.9, it was found that 9 (50%) participants conduct frequent
Web searches (i.e., more than 10 searches per day), while only 3 (16.67%) participants
identified themselves as inactive Web searchers. The length of online Q&A use was
fairly high among the participants. It was found a half of the participants have been using
either Yahoo! Answers or WikiAnswers to ask questions for more than 24 months. In
addition, the total number of questions asked in Online Q&A was fairly dispersed among
the WikiAnswers survey participants. The participants reported that 7 (38.89%)
participants have asked no more than 10 questions in online Q&A, while 7 (38.89%)
participants have asked more than 30 questions in online Q&A.

Different motivations and expectations were rated as the significant factors for
asking a question based on the characteristics of each group in Yahoo! Answers. The
findings indicate that while three Yahoo! Answers participants (YA22, YA44, and
YA55) were less likely to look for social or emotional supports, the other three
participants (YA2, YA6, and YA10) indicated that looking for social or emotional
supports is sometimes a critical factor that satisfies their needs when asking a question in
Yahoo! Answers.
Moreover, YA4, YA22, and YA55 reported that personal and social integrative
needs are less significant motivational factors that drive them to ask a question, whereas
these motivational factors are significant for asking a question between YA11 and YA6.
Table 5.10 presents a summary of all characteristics of motivations and expectations for
each participant in Yahoo! Answers.

Similarly, the findings from the WikiAnswers survey indicates that two
participants (WA6 and WA10) reported that they may not be motivated to ask a question
in an affective state while the other two participants (WA5 and WA7) indicated that
affective needs are one of the significant motivational factors that encourages them to ask
a question in WikiAnswers. Furthermore, most participants from WikiAnswers specified
that looking for quick responses is the significant factor that they expect from other
WikiAnswers users to satisfy their needs, except for WA6. This participant indicated that
accurate or complete information would

more likely satisfy their needs. Table 5.11

5.1.2.2. Analysis of the Diary Data
A total of 112,476 web pages were recorded through the extension toolbar with 18

85
participants for 4 weeks. The average page visits among the participants was 6,140.33
(S.D=8,557.23), ranging from 111 to 30,856 page visits. This signifies that some
participants in the diary data collection phase may likely be more active Web users than
other participants. This may also signify that particular information search strategies in
the online environments may cause more page visits depending on the topics or contexts
of information seeking. During a 4-week period for collecting diary data, the participants
were also required to write a diary about their motivations and expectations each time
they asked a question in online Q&A.
As mentioned previously, a total of 205 diary data sets have been recorded
through the extension toolbar. Eeach record included: (1) question; (2) motivation; (3)
additional comment on motivation; (4) expectation; (5) additional comment on
expectation; and (6) additional comment on general circumstances of which the
participants decided to ask a question in online Q&A. In addition, there were other
sections where the participants optionally specified other communication channels to
seek information on a similar topic if they ever used them along with online Q&A. Table
5.12 shows an example of the diary data collection.

The news is too skewered towards President Obama.
Let's have a frank discussion of the pitfalls of
Obamacare. Or maybe some responses will support it.
Looking for verification for own belief or knowledge
I have a negative perspective of Obamacare. I feel
strongly it will fail. Actually it's failed already. But
what do others think?

205 incidents of asking a question in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers were
collected by 18 participants during a 4-week of period of diary data collection. The
participants were also required to choose a specific motivation and expectation and to
provide a short narrative of their motivation and expectation each time they wrote their
diary entry about the question. In terms of the timestamp generated each time the
participants wrote a diary entry of asking a question, it was found that the question data
set has a fairly equal split among the four different time points for a 24-hour period. Yet,
the number of questions asked was slightly higher during the evening time period (see
Table 5.13).

Types of questions the participants asked were investigated with a total of 205
questions collected during a 4-week period. To classify question types in the study, the
coding scheme developed in the previous studies by Choi et al. (2012) and Harper et al.

87
(2009) was used. Table 61 presents types of questions with an example of each question
type. Fact-finding questions are to solicit factual or objective information. Opinionseeking questions are more likely constituted as an open-ended question that look for
other peoples’ thoughts or ideas about an asker’ specific situation. Advice-seeking
questions are asked to seek personal behavior guidance to resolve his/her problematic
state. Self-expression is when people tend to express their own thoughts or ideas, but not
necessarily seek responses from others in online Q&A (See Table 5.14).
Table 5.14. Example of each question type.
Question type
Fact-finding question
Opinion-seeking question
Advice-seeking question
Self-expression

Example
What are the Four Nobel Truths of Buddhism?
What current television series do you recommend?
How do I get rid of PCOS symptoms?
Why are some people so negative when you being
positive?

Two coders conducted content analysis for classifying question types. Coders first
classified the question type with approximately 10% of the question set (N=20) together
to ensure coding consistency throughout the process. The final Kappa value for
intercoder reliability between the two coders was 0.678. Based on suggestions by Landis
& Koch (1977) about Kappa values – 0.40 to 0.59 are considered moderate, 0.60 to 0.79
substantial, and 0.80 outstanding – it can be argued that the intercoder reliability for
content analysis is acceptable in the study.
It was found that the distributions of frequencies for each type of between Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers were significantly different (χ2=34.282 , df=3, p<.001). The
most frequent question type participants asked during the data collection was fact-finding

88
type, which they use to solicit factual information to solve their issues (N=101, 49.27%),
followed by opinion-seeking questions (N=67, 32.68%) and advice-seeking questions
(N=37, 18.04%).
However, it was found that people were more likely to ask a question to seek
factual information within WikiAnswers (N=51, 67.11%), while opinion-seeking was the
most frequent question type in Yahoo! Answers (N=58, 44.96%). This may suggest that
people prefer to use Yahoo! Answers, a user-driven community environment, over
WikiAnswers in order to ask questions that look for others’ thoughts and ideas. People
may perceive that WikiAnswers might be a better online Q&A than Yahoo! Answers in
order to solicit factual information.
This partially supports the results from the previous study by Choi et al. (2012),
which found that people ask information-seeking questions in WikiAnswers,
collaborative online Q&A, while either advice- and/or opinion-seeking questions are
more likely asked in Yahoo! Answers. Details of the distributions of frequencies for each
type of question were shown in Table 5.15.

Of the 205 questions asked by the 18 participants during the diary data collection
period, it was found cognitive needs were the most frequent motivational factor for
asking a question among the participants (N=133, 64.88%). This was followed by
personal integrative needs (N=21, 10.24%) and tension free needs (N=20, 9.76%).
The findings show that social integrative needs were the least significant
motivational factor (N=14, 6.83%). It was found that there were statistically significant
differences in motivational factors between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAsnwers users
(χ2=13.682, df=4, p<.05). Especially, people were more likely motivated to ask a
question for satisfying their personal integrative needs in WikiAnswers, while people
were more interested in social interactions through the question-answering interactions in
Yahoo! Answers. Additionally, tension free needs were found to be the stronger
motivational factor that prompts people to ask a question in Yahoo! Answers. Table 5.17
presents a summary of distributions of all motivational factors in Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers.

In terms of cognitive needs, some participants included additional comments on
their motivation where they specified that they were motivated to ask a question in a
cognitive state, especially to solicit factual information in order to satisfy their needs in a
specific situation.
“This question was asked based on an assignment that asked me to compile
reasons why organizations were upgrading to ICD10.”
“I want to be able to identify the name since the painting spoke powerfully to me..
So when I share with others I can name it and show a part of myself with it.”
People also tend to be engaged in the question-answering processes to receive
other peoples’ thoughts or ideas that help evaluate their problematic situations, but also
behave in a certain way to resolve issues. The examples of this instance are:
“I want the opinion of people outside of our group of friends. The friendship I had
is over, but I guess I'm seeking a sort of closure, as I can't communicate with the
person who ended the friendship anymore, not that I still want to be friends with
her.”
“I'm in the market for a laptop and I'm reconsidering my brand of choice of
Toshiba Satellite Windows Laptop and would like to know other Windows users
opinion on what is the best model/series/brand Windows Laptop out there right
now.”
“I'm trying to make a list of movies I should watch while I'm on a 3 week break,
but I want opinions from other people.”
Additionally, it was found that the participants perceive online Q&A as an online
environment in which they may be able to learn something from other peoples’
experience and knowledge through the question-answering interactions, as one
participant vocalized:
“I would like to learn about some experiences to see if this would be worthwhile

92
for me. I think it will be fulfilling but I would like to see if I am missing
something that can go terribly wrong with the situation.”
“To learn how to make a study guide for pmbok 5th edition”
Personal integrative needs were found as the second most frequent influential
motivation that drives people to ask a question in online Q&A during a 4-week diary data
collection period (N=21, 10.24%). Because personal integrative needs are associated with
an individual’s self-desire to be more credible and stable, it was found that the
participants had hoped to receive information through the question-answering
interactions. This would then help the participants gain more insights into their
understanding of a particular context or situation.
“The news is too skewered towards President Obama. Let's have a frank
discussion of the pitfalls of Obamacare. Or maybe some responses will support it.”
“This site is in itself too good to be true. I often wonder if snopes is biased and
who or what is funding it.”
It was found that tension free needs were the third most frequent motivational
factor among the participants in online Q&A. This may indicate that online Q&A
services could be used as a means of passing time or having fun (N=20, 9.75%). The
question-answering interactions of other people in online Q&A forums are perceived not
only as an information seeking behavior, but also as another type of activity that supports
socio-emotional behaviors in the computer-mediated communication network.
“During my free time, I like to follow the NBA and I just wanted to get NBA fans
opinion on which two players’ skills would form the most talented NBA player.”
“I am bored and am curious about the thoughts of others.”

93
Finally, affective and social integrative needs were found as the least influential
motivational factor for asking a question in online Q&A. However, even though affective
needs were not a significant motivational factor compared to cognitive needs, which let
people either solicit factual information and/or seek other peoples’ advices or opinions,
some participants had situations where they were needed for social or emotional support
on their own personal issues or someone else’s situations. The examples for these
incidents are:
“The reason why I asked this question to understand the social and emotional
aspect of why the girl would not want her boss to know to that we talk and are
planning to hang out.”
“Friend having difficult time during holidays”
In addition, people may not be strongly or frequently motivated to find
companionship or identify with others in the online Q&A environment to develop social
interactions although, they still value the feature of social interaction to receive relevant
information for their needs. This result is similar to the findings from the Internet-based
survey in phase 1. Yet, the comments from the participants indicate that sometimes
people tend to create an open discussion where they may want to interact with other
people in order to discuss personal or social issues.
“We have a newly elected Mayor who is spending tax payers money like it is her
personal piggybank.”
“Looking for social support and ideas to get my new dog socialized.”
As there was an assumption that people behave in a certain way with the
expectation that this type of behavior would satisfy their needs in the current study, the

94
participants were required to choose one of expectation-based factors, and specify their
expectations of other people each time they wrote a diary about their question.
It was found that in terms of expectations of other online Q&A users with respect
to the question that the participants asked during a 4-week diary data collection period,
looking for accurate or complete information (N=77. 37.56%) was the most frequent
expectation. The participants described that they were hoping to receive more accurate or
complete information to their question in order to satisfy their needs:
“I was looking for accurate information about that person because I want to verify
what I have read the article.”
“I was expecting a very scientific and accurate answer that I may have not been
able to completely comprehend.”
“I was expecting a straight forward answer and a correct answer.”
It was found that looking for quick responses was the second most frequent
expectation-based factor. This indicates that people conceive that they may satisfy their
needs once this type of expectation was met during the question-answering processes
(N=57, 27.80%) as some participants vocalized:
“Mainly just want a 1-2 word response.”
“I know I will get the right answers fast!!”
“Not sure. Want a fast answer, but not a pat answer.”
Finally, the participants reported that looking for additional or alternative
information (N=36, 17.56%) was the third most frequent expectation, suggesting that
people also tend to ask a question in online Q&A in order to receive second thoughts

95
from other users, or gain insights into their current events or activities through other
peoples’ opinions. The examples of this expectation are:
“I would like to see if there's more to the subject matter than I already know for
my assignment.”
“I’m trying to get people opinion on what video camera will work best that is
priced under $1000 dollars and the pro and cons of the cameras they mention…I
was looking to check out different examples before selecting one.”
Looking for verification of one’s beliefs or knowledge and seeking trustworthy
sources were found as the least frequent expectations that the participants looked for from
other users when they asked a question in online Q&A.
Ultimately, it was found that there were no statistically significant differences in
expectation-based factors between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers (χ2=9.846, df=6,
p=.131). Table 5.18 presents a summary of the distributions of all expectation-based
factors.

Finally, another descriptive analysis was conducted to examine the relationship
between motivations and expectations for asking a question in online Q&A. It was found
that cognitive needs and seeking accurate or compete information were the factors most
frequently correlated when asking a question during the diary data collection (N=61,
45.86%). This was followed by cognitive needs and looking for quick responses, (N=36,
27.07%) and cognitive needs and looking for additional or alternative needs (N=23,
17.29%).
Additionally, it was also found that such cognitive-related expectations (i.e.,
looking for quick responses, looking for additional or alternative information, and
looking for accurate or complete information) were correlated with other motivational
factors. For example, the participants also looked for either additional information or
accurate information to satisfy their affective needs more than social or emotional
supports, even though it was predictably assumed that affective needs might be highly
correlated with looking for social or emotional supports. These findings may signify that
the relationships between user motivations and expectations may be dynamically changed
based on an asker’s unique situation.
Interestingly, it was found that when people were motivated to ask a question to
satisfy their tension free needs, (e.g., passing time, releasing emotion, etc.), they were
more likely look for quick responses (N=8, 40%) than any other expectational factor.
This indicates that timeliness in receiving answers would be a critical factor of how users’

97
tension free needs are fulfilled through the question-answering processes.
However, it was found from analysis of the diary data that there were no
significant differences in the relationships between motivations and expectations between
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. Table 5.19 presents a summary of relationships
between motivations and expectations in all incidents generated by the participants in the
diary data collection.

5.1.4. Backgrounds of Interview Data
The same selected 18 users who participated in the diary data collection in phase
2 were invited to complete interviews. This was a purposeful sampling to select different
sample cases, which “represent the complexity of our world” (Creswell, 2002, p.194).
This indicates that the 18 participants from Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers represent
different motivational profiles and expectations for asking a question. 13 females
(72.22%) and 5 males (27.78 %) participated in interviews. The average age of the

99
interview participants was 35.72 years old (S.D.=14.41), ranging from 21 years old to 69
years old.
The qualitative data analysis was based on not only the survey responses for each
participant’s general experience with online Q&A use, but also each individual
participant’s diary data collected via an extension toolbar. This tool bar was installed on
each participant’s Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) during phase 2. Each interview
was recorded by an electronic audio recording device, and the interview data was
transcribed into texts.
The coding process for the data was analyzed by two coders in order to verify the
intercoder reliability (Lombard et al., 2005). In this section, the participants’ interview
data on motivation and expectation is presented in order to verify the survey responses
collected in the phase 1, explore the meanings of each motivational factor behind asking
a question in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, and discover any additional findings on
how the participants were motivated (addressing RQ 1 and 2). Additionally, dynamic
relationships between motivations and expectations are also presented in order to address
RQ3.
5.2. RQ1: Motivation
5.2.1. Analysis of the Survey Data
The five motivational factors for asking a question in online Q&A services were
investigated (i.e., cognitive needs, affective needs, personal integrative needs, social
integrative needs, and tension free needs), and these motivational factors were measured

100
on a 5-point Likert scale in the survey (1-Strongly Disagree to 5-Agree). However, since
each motivational factor has 3-4 sub-variables, internal consistency reliability was
analyzed to investigate whether each sub-variable was correlated to measure the same
motivational factor in online Q&A services. To do that, Cronbach’s α was used to
measure internal consistency reliability within each motivational factor.
As Kline (1999) argued that a commonly accepted rule of thumb is that an α of
more than 0.6 is acceptable reliability, it can be argued that all sub-categories in
motivational factors in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers are acceptable in the
study. Table 5.20 presents details Cronbach’s α for each motivational factor in the study.

First, motivational factors for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers were
investigated. As Table 5.21 presents, it was found that cognitive needs were the most
prominent motivational factor for asking a question in both Yahoo! Answers (Mean=3.45,
S.D=0.88) and WikiAnswers (Mean=3.57, S.D.=0.93), followed by tension fee needs
(Yahoo! Answers, Mean=2.93, S.D.=1.02; WikiAnswers, Mean=3.05, S.D=1.02),
personal integrative needs (Yahoo! Answers, Mean=2.86, S.D=1.18; WikiAnswers,

101
Mean=3.01, S.D.=1.13), and affective needs (Yahoo! Answers, Mean=2.76, S.D=1.14;
WikiAnswers, Mean=3.03, S.D.=1.15).

In Yahoo! Answers, cognitive needs were found to be the most prominent
motivational factor, especially learning. Self-education was the most influential

102
motivational variable in cognitive needs (Mean=3.67, S.D.=1.23). One of participants
vocalized the way of using Yahoo! Answers to learn from responses posed by other
Yahoo! Answers users:
“The answers are out of personal experience, making the answers to the questions
seem more credible as well as entertaining to read. I like that there are more than
one answers I can read and learn from.”
Another significant variable in cognitive needs was finding relevant information
(Mean=3.44, S.D.=1.16) and seeking advice or opinions for making decisions
(Mean=3.40, S.D.=1.33). This finding indicates that the participants tend to use Yahoo!
Answers to receive relevant and precise information in order to solve their specific
problematic situation as one participant stated:
“I used Yahoo! Answer for a very specific question [after] I searched for relevant
information on Google (without getting a satisfying answer). I sense Yahoo!
Answers can provide a detailed, tailored answer for my specific situation.”
Moreover, while some participants indicate that they use Yahoo! Answers to ask a factfinding question to solicit relevant information, other participants were also motivated to
interact with others Yahoo! Answers users through the question-answering interactions in
order to receive more subjective responses such as opinions or advice for unique
situations.
“I use Yahoo Answers when I am seeking advice and recommendations from
other people. I use a search engine to find facts. I expect more subjective results
from Yahoo Answers.”
“I like to hear people’s advice. People don't know what you’re talking about so
Yahoo! Answers is the only way out.”
In WikiAnswers, Similar to the findings from analysis of the Yahoo! Answer
survey data, it was found that cognitive needs were identified as the most significant

103
motivational factor for asking a question. Especially, learning; self-education through
acquiring information was the most significant sub-variable for asking a question in
WikiAnswers (Mean=3.76, S.D.=1.19) as one participant vocalized the fact that people
may perceive WikiAnswers as the virtual educational environment:
“I think it’s important that people become educated about (WikiAnswers) search
type information resource, [b]ecome involved in the learning movement and
understand that's about. It makes a better environment for all of us.”
Finding relevant information in immediate surroundings, society, and the world
was also reported as a significant motivating variable driving the participants to ask a
question in WikiAnswers (Mean=3.55, S.D.=1.10). As some WikiAnswers survey
participants specified, one of main reasons that people tend to use WikiAnswers is to
receive more relevant information to their specific question as opposed to looking
through irrelevant information when searching through search engines such as Google.
“Main reason for using wiki answers is that often with a forum type setting you
get the human element, which can often lead to better insight of an issue.
The traditional Search engine method can often be suspect or lead to completely
irrelevant information due to over-searching or perhaps due to the use of spiders
(web crawlers) use of key words versus an actual human being viewing your
question and giving thought to the question at hand directly.”
“Google doesn't understand the point of my asking a question. In WikiAnswers I
get answers that feel personalized to my question and that don't have irrelevant
information like with a search engine. I like knowing that somebody has thought
about the exact thing I'm asking about.”
Additionally, the survey results disclosed that seeking advice or opinions for
making decisions was another significant variable within cognitive needs (Mean=3.40,
S.D.=1.27). This indicates that the participants may want to receive personalized
opinions or advice from other users who have already experienced similar situations or

104
have expertise that helps resolve an asker’s specific situation.
“Often I am looking for a quick answer to a situation and would like an array of
opinions. The opinions are more direct and non-scripted and that's what I
appreciate...”
“WikiAnswers gets straight to the point and gives you a few options/opinions to
look at and it's up to you to look into them which I really like”
“Nobody has all the answers. Sometimes asking people questions helps they
realize where they are and where they are going. History and Facts are easier to
locate online. Life advice is harder to find and give.”
“I used WikiAnswers when a Google search did not provide the answers I was
looking for. I use it to get technical advice and can generally tell if the person
knows what they are talking about.”
It was found that tension free needs were the second significant motivational
factor for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers (Mean=2.93, S.D.=1.02). Especially,
having fun asking a question for tension free needs was the second most significant
motivational variable for asking a question among all sub-variables in Yahoo! Answers
(Mean=3.48, S.D=1.26) after learning; self-education through acquiring information
(Mean=3.67, S.D=1.23) as participants stated:
“I use Yahoo! Answers mainly for amusement or to kill time. I answer questions
in order to help people out, and I ask questions in order to read the answers. I
usually do not trust it as a good source of accurate information, but it is useful for
gauging peoples’s opinions in some cases.”
“I use yahoo answers because it is a fun website. It's a good tool when you are
looking for answers that are tailored to your question and situation, something
you can't always find when you embark on a general web search.”
In WikiAnswers, tension free needs were also rated as the second most significant
motivational factor driving people to ask a question in WikiAnswers (Mean=3.05,
S.D.=1.02). Especially, having fun asking a question was the third most substantial sub-

105
variable (Mean=3.40, S.D.=1.35) that motivates people to ask a question, after learning;
self-education through acquiring information (Mean=3.76, S.D.=1.19) and gaining a
sense of security through knowledge (Mean=3.55, S.D=1.16) from cognitive needs.
Furthermore, it was found that 68 survey participants (68%) reported that they are
from moderate to strongly motivated to ask a question in WikiAnswers in order to pass
their time. In these cases, participants, for example, specified their tension free needs for
asking a question in WikiAnswers:
“[I] find it very informative and is a great way to kill time or just have some
casual fun.”
“It helps to kill time. Also it’s funny to see people’s responses.”
“I've used WikiAnswers mainly to pass time (in-between asking questions on
Yahoo! Answers). The answers I've received were mainly opinion-based and
typically facts in one answer would come from many different sources.”
In terms of affective needs, analysis of the Yahoo! Answer survey data identified
that looking for attainment on personals or ideas was a relatively higher influential
motivation (Mean=3.08, S.D.=1.22) than looking for social and emotional support for
personal issues (Mean=2.70, S.D.=1.40) and looking for social and emotional support for
someone such as family members or friends (Mean=2.50, S.D=1.34) within affective
needs. Yet, one participant pointed out advantages of using Yahoo! Answers when
seeking emotional support for personal issues.
“I've used Yahoo Answers over another search engine for the questions I've asked
because I needed emotional/people-based answers to them. I was asking questions
whose answers wouldn't be explained by facts.”
The other participant also stated how Yahoo! Answers could be a helpful information
resource to seek emotional supports.

106
“I believe that Yahoo! Answers is a great site to research information, get advice
and help out others. If I am trying to find facts or educational answers then I
would firstly try Google before asking Yahoo! Answers. If my question is
emotional then I will tend to go to Yahoo to begin with. Generally, I am quite
pleased with suitable answers I receive however in some cases people may answer
unhelpfully and below expectations.”
Analysis of the WikiAnswers survey data indicates that affective needs were
identified as the third most significant motivational factor for asking a question in
WikiAnswers. It was found that looking for attainment on personal thoughts or ideas was
relatively a higher influential motivation (Mean=3.35, S.D.=1.19) than looking for social
and emotional support for personal issues (Mean=2.87, S.D.=1.33) and looking for social
and emotional support for someone else (Mean=2.88, S.D=1.34) within affective needs.
However, even though looking for social and emotional support for either personal issues
of their own and/or someone else’s (e.g., family members, friends, etc.) issues was not
relatively rated as a significant motivational factor. 59 WikiAnswers survey participants
(59%) moderately to strongly agreed that they tend to ask a question to seek social or
emotional supports for personal issues. 63 participants (63%) moderate to strongly agreed
that they ask a question to seek social or emotional supports for someone else’s issues.
Personal integrative needs were identified as the third most significant
motivational factor for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers. Moreover, as Table 5.5
presents, it was found that the three sub-variables were rated at a fairly equal level. Since
personal integrative needs were characterized as increasing self-esteem through finding
support for one’s own values, gaining insight into one’s own life, or experiencing
empathy with problems of others, one participated stressed how Yahoo! Answers is
helpful to find supports from other people for their own values without being judged.

107
“I like yahoo answers because it connects you with a real person, one on one. I
don't know the person and they don't know me and we are not together in person
and will never meet, so I feel more free to express my thoughts without being
judged. Also, since I don't know the person, I feel like I can be my real self and be
honest, and can ask things or say things that I don’t feel comfortable expressing
with friends and family members.”
The other participant also stressed that responses received from other people in Yahoo!
Answers allowed them to experience empathy.
“I use Yahoo Answers to ask a question so as to get answers and opinions from
different people and to see how their answers and insight measure up in regards to
my question. The types of answers I get are more emphatic here than the answers
given on other sites.”
In WikiAnswers, in terms of personal integrative needs, gaining insight into one’s
own life was ranked highest among sub-variables within personal integrative needs
(Mean=3.10, S.D.=1.29), which indicates that people attempt to develop a better
understanding of themselves by acquiring a variety of information. In this case, the
participants, for example, stated:
“Sometimes different opinions offer more/various insights. WikiAnswers has
proven to be helpful than other search engines sometimes”
“WikiAnswers is better than Google, Yahoo or any other search engine because it
is more personal. I am able to speak with other people like myself who enjoy
talking to others and finding out about questions or inquires of interests to them.
If I use WikiAnswers, I know that the information I receive may not always be
accurate or right on point with the question I asked entails, but most of the time it
is very insightful for me.”
However, It was found that social integrative needs were the least influential
factor that motivates people to ask a question within the context of Yahoo! Answers
(Mean=2.54, S.D.=1.12) although it was assumed that people may prefer to use online
Q&A services over other information resources (e.g., search engines) because online
Q&A services allow people to socially interact with other people for seeking information

108
to satisfy their needs. However, it can be argued that people may not necessarily look for
companionship/social connection or gaining a sense of belonging within a community of
Yahoo! Answers, while social or conversational interactions are still important factors to
find more tailored and personalized responses to their questions in Yahoo! Answers. In
this sense, the participants from Yahoo! Answers vocalized how the features allowing
social conversations still play an important role in Yahoo! Answers.
“I use Yahoo! Answers because it is a conversation between people and therefore
seems relatable.”
“I used both Yahoo! [Answers] and a search engine to ask a question. Yahoo!
Answers gives a more conversation type answer rather than a dictionary style
answer form a search engine.”
It was noteworthy that 68 participants (58.97%) still reported having moderate to
strong social integrative needs, especially finding a basis for conversation and social
interaction, when asking a question in Yahoo! Answers, suggesting that a socio-affective
factor plays a role that motivates people to be engaged in question-answering processes
in Yahoo! Answers as one participant stated:
“More personal, you know there's real people out there..... My expectations? Just
to interact with someone.....”
Similar to the findings from the Yahoo! Answers survey data, it was found that
social integrative needs were the least significant motivational factor for asking a
question in WikiAnswers (Mean=2.80, S.D.=1.17). Especially, having a substitute for
real-life companionship was identified as the least significant motivational variable in all
motivational factors (Mean=2.40, S.D=1.36). This may signify that people may not be
necessarily driven to ask a question to actually find some companionship through the

109
question-answering processes, but favor the social components such as feeling connected
or having conversation-based interactions with other people when seeking information in
WikiAnswers. In this sense, the survey participants vocalized:
“I wanted some direct human interaction rather than a staid and possibly outdated
answer. Also, it might be quicker to get a direct answer rather than sifting through
pages of Google sites. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing if the answer is
accurate but it might put you on the right track to limit your search.”
“Main reason for using wiki answers is that often with a forum type setting you
get the human element, which can often lead to better insight of an issue. The
traditional Search engine method can often be suspect or lead to completely
irrelevant information due to over-searching or perhaps due to the use of spiders
(web crawlers) use of key words versus an actual human being viewing your
question and giving thought to the question at hand directly.”
5.2.2. Analysis of the Diary Data
In terms of motivational factors, for the 205 questions surveyed during the diary
data collection period, it was found cognitive needs were the most frequent motivational
factors for asking a question (N=133, 64.88%), followed by personal integrative needs
(N=21, 10.24%) and tension free needs (N=20, 9.76%). The findings show that social
integrative needs were the least significant motivational factor (N=14, 6.83%). It was
found that there were statistical differences in the motivational factors between Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers (χ2=13.682, df=4, p<.05). For instance, people were more
likely motivated to ask a question for satisfying their personal integrative needs in
WikiAnswers, while people were more interested in social interactions through the
question-answering interactions in Yahoo! Answers. Additionally, tension free needs
were found as the stronger motivational factor driving people to ask a question in Yahoo!
Answers. However, there were less

significant differences in cognitive and

110
affective needs for asking a question in both online Q&A services.
In terms of cognitive needs, some participants included an additional comment on
their motivation where they specified that they were motivated to ask a question in a
cognitive state, especially to solicit factual information in order to satisfy their needs in a
specific situation.
“This question was asked based on an assignment that asked me to compile
reasons why organizations were upgrading to ICD10.”
“I want to be able to identify the name since the painting spoke powerfully to me..
So when I share with others I can name it and show a part of myself with it.”
People also tend to be engaged in the question-answering processes to receive
other peoples’ thoughts or ideas that help evaluate their problematic situations, but also
behave in a certain way to resolve issues. The examples of this incident are:
“I want the opinion of people outside of our group of friends. The friendship I had
is over, but I guess I'm seeking a sort of closure, as I can't communicate with the
person who ended the friendship anymore, not that I still want to be friends with
her.”
“I'm in the market for a laptop and I'm reconsidering my brand of choice of
Toshiba Satellite Windows Laptop and would like to know other Windows users
opinion on what is the best model/series/brand Windows Laptop out there right
now.”
“I am trying to make a list of movies I should watch while I'm on a 3 week break,
but I want opinions from other people.”
Additionally, it was found that the participants perceive online Q&A as one of
many online environments in which they may be able to learn something from other
peoples’ experience and knowledge through the question-answering interactions, as one
participant vocalized:
“I would like to learn about some experiences to see if this would be worthwhile

111
for me. I think it will be fulfilling but I would like to see if I am missing
something that can go terribly wrong with the situation.”
“To learn how to make a study guide for PMBOK 5th edition”
Personal integrative needs were found to be the second most frequent influential
motivational factor that drives people to ask a question in online Q&A during a 4-week
diary data collection period (N=21, 10.24%). Because personal integrative needs are
associated with an individual’s self-desire to be more credible and stable, it was found
that the participants hoped to receive information through the question-answering
interactions. This ultimately helps the user gain more insight into their understanding of a
particular context or situation.
“The news is too skewered towards President Obama. Let's have a frank
discussion of the pitfalls of Obamacare. Or maybe some responses will support it.”
“This site is in itself too good to be true. I often wonder if snopes is biased and
who or what is funding it.”
It was found that tension free needs were the third most frequent motivational
factor among the participants in online Q&A, which may indicate that online Q&A
services could be used as a means of passing time or having fun to release their tension
(N=20, 9.75%). The question-answering interactions of other people in online Q&A are
perceived as not only an information seeking behavior, but also as another type of
activity that supports socio-emotional behaviors in the computer-mediated
communication network.
“During my free time, I like to follow the NBA and I just wanted to get NBA fans
opinion on which two players’ skills would form the most talented NBA player.”

112
“I am bored and am curious about the thoughts of others.”
Finally, affective and social integrative needs were the least influential
motivational factor for asking a question in online Q&A. However, even though affective
needs were not a significant motivational factor compared to cognitive needs, which let
people either solicit factual information and/or seek the advice or opinions of others,
some participants had situations where they needed social or emotional support for their
personal issues or someone else’s situations. The examples for these incidents are:
“The reason why I asked this question to understand the social and emotional
aspect of why the girl would not want her boss to know to that we talk and are
planning to hang out.”
“Friend having difficult time during holidays”
In addition, similar to the findings from the Internet-based survey in the phase 1,
people may not be strongly or frequently motivated to find companionship or identify
with others in the online Q&A environment in order to develop social interactions,
although they still value the feature of social interaction to receive relevant information
for their needs. However, the comments from the participants indicate that in some
instances people tend to create an open discussion where they may want to interact with
other people in order to discuss personal or social issues.
“We have a newly elected Mayor who is spending tax payers money like it is her
personal piggybank.”
“Looking for social support and ideas to get my new dog socialized.”
5.2.3. Analysis of the Interview Data
In this section, five different motivational factors are presented based on the

113
interview data derived from the 205 questions asked by 18 participants in phase 2.
Additionally, an additional theme that emerged from the interview data is also illustrated.
5.2.3.1. Cognitive Needs
From the survey responses and diary data, it was confirmed that cognitive needs
are the most influential motivating factor that drives people to ask a question in Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers. The survey data indicates that cognitive need was rated as
the most frequent motivation in both Yahoo! Answers (Mean=3.45, S.D.=0.88) and
WikiAnswers (Mean=3.57. S.D.=0.93). Cognitive needs were chosen as the significant
motivational factor for asking a question in 133 incidents (64.88%). However, although
the survey responses indicated that there were no significant differences between Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers in terms of cognitive needs, classification of question types
signifies that there may be some differences in the participants’ cognitive needs. 82
questions were asked in Yahoo! Answers during the diary data collection. These were
either opinion and/or advice-seeking (63.57%), whereas 53 questions asked in
WikiAnswers were based on a fact-finding type (69.74%). This suggests that people are
more likely to ask a question in WikiAnswers in order to find relevant information in
immediate surroundings, society and the world, while Yahoo! Answers users are more
likely motivated in a cognitive state for seeking advice or opinions for making decisions.
First, it was found that a fact-finding question is one prevalent question typs that
solicits objective and relevant information in order to satisfy an asker’s need in a
cognitive state. The examples for this incident are:
“I was watching the Olympics and I’ve always been into the sports and I was
trying to figure out when it actually started because me and my brother had an

114
argument about it so it was more like sibling rivalry about who has the correct
answer but it was interesting to find out the answer…I was watching the
Olympics and I was like let’s find out when this actually started.”
“That one actually I was trying to learn what has vitamin C I knew some things
had it but I needed others like more variety like fruit and vegetables and other
stuff this was more like I needed to know like affective needs like I needed to
know this answer but not like right away but it was interesting to find out how
many different stuff there are.”
“I always drink chamomile tea but I didn’t know there were health benefits for it
or if you don’t drink it as a tea you can use it to dry eye puffiness which I didn’t
really know so it was a great response and it was a lot of information that I didn’t
know.”
Also, another participant indicated that she attempted to ask a question in WikiAnswers
in order to seek the newest information in her specific area, since she thought it would be
beneficial to know up-to-date information.
“I'm in the HIT field and I wanted to get the latest accurate information about the
latest EHR assistant today. I expect up to date answers and that's what I was
trying to formulate my question around- to see an up to date answer provided
because I am in the field… I kind of asked the question and afterwards I searched
other online resources Google and other search engine websites and I wanted to
compare answers.”
Second, it was found that receiving more professional information and advice
from subject experts is another significant motivational factor in cognitive needs that
drives people to ask a question in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. This supports the
finding from the survey responses in phase 1, which indicated that seeking advice or
opinions for decision-making was one of the significant motivational factors for asking a
question. In this sense, participants asked a question to receive more professional
information or advice on a health condition. One participant asked a question about
PCOS symptoms in order to receive more professional information or advice on her

115
health condition.
“I have PCOS it's a condition and it is very hard to figure out. It has a lot of
symptoms and so I just googled this on yahoo to find answers about how to get rid
of the condition and there's really nobody that will help you there's no doctor, you
have to go to an endocrinologist, I looked all over the place for answers… I've
been to the doctor they said that I have to wait and some of it will go away and I
have a lot of questions because it messes up with your whole body because it
messes with your hair and it won't go back to being normal like itchy scalp all of a
sudden I have an itchy scalp and they don't even care about your hair its just
really hard to get help for things that PCOS does to you.”
The other participant also asked a health-related question in WikiAnswers in order to
receive more professional advice.
“I received the lab value when I went to my therapist they had a lab done and the
therapist was in a clinic and I was doing a regular blood draw and was told that
that was very low but I'm like going in taking vitamin c to increase this- I didn't
know white blood count was a little different because the doctor said was red
blood count was iron but they didn’t really talk about what I could do for my
white and in order for my own health and for correction of bad labs, I wanted to
do something that was effective, efficient but not interacting with something and
making me do that at the detriment of some other - you know something with
toxins.”
Another example was based on one participant’s finance-related situation where she
needed professional advice on setting up a trust fund.
“I am retired and trying to consolidate my assets and I have found it very
complicated so I was looking for some guidance. My financial advisor suggested I
needed to set up a trust fund….I have a financial advisor and sometimes I have
trouble communicating with him. I was looking for a simple financer [in
WikiAnswers]…. I was trying to resolve my confusion from what I heard from
my financial advisor which - the need to set up a trust fund didn’t seem necessary
to me.”
This participant also visited different websites through a search engine after asking
questions to get more detailed information about her question in order to verify an answer
received in WikiAnswers. She indicated that personal advice from WikiAnswers helped

116
her to decide what she needed to do. It also provided a better understanding of what her
financial advisor indicated for her situation.
“[T]he next day I discussed it with my financial advisor and I was better able to
understand what he was saying.”
Similarly, one participant had a technical issue related to her mother’s cell phone. She
indicated that she was not familiar with a cell phone service, and thus wanted to ask a
question in Yahoo! Answers to receive specific information specific to her question from
other Yahoo! Answers users who have expertise in this area.
“My mom gave me her cellphone and she had a contract and it was up. I’m trying
to figure out how to get more minutes I called the person who makes it Samsung
or LG and I still don’t know. I needed to be more specific…. I'm not savvy with
phones I don't have a cellphone so I always got pay as you go ones so this one is
different I don't know if I can just take her cellphone and add minutes”
In another case, one participant asked a question about how to stop food from getting
between their gums and teeth in Yahoo! Answers with a hope of receiving reliable
information from experts who may offer ideas to help her to solve her problematic
situation.
“I was getting food in my gums and I don't know how to prevent it from going in
my gums so I was wondering how do people stop this because all I do is floss my
teeth so I wish there was a way to prevent it I was looking for some answers
[from] a dental assistant or someone who works in the profession or someone who
had the same thing happen to them.”
Additionally, another participant asked a question in WikiAnswers to get more detailed
information from people who have encountered similar issues, problems, or experiences.
For example, one participant needed to ask a question about using online Turbo Tax site
to file state taxes for a married same-sex couple.
“I have been studying the tax law in Virginia and its very frustrating and
complicated. We normally file our taxes on turbo tax but this year it’s going to be

117
a nightmare….. We're married we know how to file our federal taxes together but
VA will not accept that so then we have to file individual returns we have to
create a dummy federal return individually and then use that to prepare our
Virginia taxes….. It's very complicated and very frustrating. I was hoping that
someone had perhaps up to date information from what I could find on the VA tax.
I have gone to the VA tax law site and I was hoping. I found information I didn’t
like which was that we had to file two different ways so I was hoping someone
had different information [in WikiAnswers] and I had also gone to turbo tax and I
found contradictory information….. I got a good answer, not an answer I liked but
it was good enough it confirmed the fact that we would have to file 4 different tax
returns between federal and state.”
Third, participants indicated that one strong reason that prompted them to use
online Q&A was to explore others’ recommendations. This also illustrates that online
Q&A users value the interactions with other people in the context of online Q&A in order
to seek and share personalized idea or thought on in a wide range of topics or areas for
the best course of an asker’s action in the near future. Table 5.22 presents the participants’
comments on seeking other peoples’ opinion or idea as recommendation, as well as
questions they asked in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.
Table 5.22. Comments on seeking others’ opinion or idea.
Question
What is the best video camera
to film YouTube videos for
under 1000 dollars?
What is the different
between garam masala and
hot madras curry powder
sold as a McCormick
Blend?
What toys would you suggest
trying with a recently tamed
feral kitten?

Comment
I was just trying to see other opinions because a lot
of people have different opinions about cameras.
I was cooking a recipe and I was looking for a
cognitive answer to see if I could substitute one for
the other…. I would say I got an interesting answer
but I don’t think it is true. Interesting but not
necessarily correct but I was satisfied I was happy
that someone answered.
My husband's cat had found a feral kitten outside
and we haven’t been able to have cats or dogs for a
while so I took the kitten from him but he was very
scared and didn’t want to play very much so I was
looking for some feedback to see what toys could
draw him out a little bit more and make him social.

118
Is there a best way to get an
Indy film in a festival?

What is a homemade natural
remedy for ulcerative colitis?

I have gone to film festivals and I wanted to see
about making a film myself and I wanted to see
because I’ve always heard how difficult it was to
get into a film festival I was hoping someone might
have answer…. I thought there might be people
who have done this already and who might have
extra tips.
Well I have ulcerative colitis which means that
sometimes certain foods are not good for you and I
don’t like taking medicine so I wanted to find
something that would be a natural remedy not
drugs.

Finally, the participants from the interviews implicitly and explicitly pointed out
that learning is a critical factor that people are willingly involved in during the questionanswering interactions. It seemed that learning, self-education through acquiring
information as one of the sub-categories within cognitive needs, was not mutually
exclusive with other sub-categories when people asked a question in online Q&A. In
other words, a need for learning in a cognitive state might be a predetermined condition
that lets them ask a question in order to receive factual information and/or others’ advice
or opinion to solve their problematic situations. The following quotes are examples of
how a learning process was explicitly developed through the question-answering
interactions between an asker and answerer(s).
“That one actually I was trying to learn what has vitamin c I knew some things
had it but I needed others like more variety like fruit and vegetables and other
stuff this was more like I needed to know like affective needs like I needed to
know this answer but not like right away but it was interesting to find out how
many different stuff there is.”
“My main motivation really was to learn more about libertarians and to see if
there’s any facts to that not just opinions but the political party they come from
what they're about.”
“Well in general I try to learn

something new every day because I’m

119
alone a lot so I do a lot of googling and browsing and I usually learn something
new and I think it’s interesting I just wanted to know if anyone else does the same
thing.”
Moreover, the participants also implicitly indicated that they looked for information from
others when asking a question in online Q&A in order to learn something in his/her
interests. The examples in this case are:
“I have a game console called PS Vita and I was wondering like will the existing
accessories work for the new version that’s coming out soon and there's no
question on Google and nothing came up so that's why I customized and
personalized that question.”
“This question I asked because I’m a first time home buyer and I was looking
around and before purchasing a home what are some low cost not too expensive
remodeling to increase the value of a house, I didn’t know anything and I didn’t
look on Google so I just asked this question…. Opinions and cognitive
information that people have used and I asked this in the decorating and
remodeling category I figured they had good information…. the user I remember
said painting, fixing the kitchen and add more appeal and something with the light
fixtures upgrading those.”
“I was going camping and we were getting ready and I asked this question
because we have raw flaxseeds I remember back in school you can’t just eat raw
flaxseeds so I asked this question just to be sure and someone did answer you
can’t just eat it raw you have to cook it.”
“I have grandparents they came from Vietnam and they were here but their visa
expired and when I bought the plane tickets I realized their passport is valid but
their visa is not so I wanted to know what happens and I googled for this question
but Google didn’t show me a specific answer so I asked yahoo answers and I got a
quick response from knowledgeable people about immigration and they gave me
a link and basically said once the visa expired they cannot go back to the U.S.”
Overall, as one participant pointed out, Yahoo! Answers provides a good
educational setting in which people including young students are able to learn something.
This environment is compared to other online sites where many gossips and uncensored
stories are provided. He thinks that these sites would be not appropriate from an

120
educational point of view. This participant also indicated that in Yahoo! Answers, he can
engage in numerous interactions with other people who have expertise in a wide range of
areas. This helps him learn through the question-answering processes.
5.2.3.2. Affective Needs
Another motivational factor measured in the study was affective needs, which
indicates that people are motivated to ask a question in order to receive emotional or
social supports for an asker’s current issues in some degree, not necessarily seek
information.
From the survey responses, it was found that affective needs are a moderately
frequent motivational factor that influence people to participate in the question-answering
interaction in both online Q&A sites (Mean=2.76, S.D.=1.14 in Yahoo! Answers;
Mean=3.03, S.D.=1.15 in WikiAnswers). In addition, 17 questions (8.29%) were asked in
order to satisfy their affective needs with different expectations; more details of
expectations and relationships between motivations and expectations will be presented in
the following section.
Another data analysis was conducted to determine if there were differences in
affective needs between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. It was found that overall
there were no statistically significant differences. Yet, looking for social and emotional
support for someone else, one of sub-categories within affective needs, was rated slightly
higher in WikiAnswers; t(224)=2.118, p=.035.
In qualitative analysis with the interview data, it was found that although people
still attempted to look for factual information, personal advice, or opinions to solve their

121
problematic situations, they indicated that their primary need for asking a question was to
satisfy an affective need in some cases. This suggests that it might not be possible to
identify a primary motivational factor by only analyzing the content of a question they
asked. For insistence, one participant asked a question about dating the friend of a mutual
Facebook friend, and looked for others’ thoughts or opinions about her situation.
However, she indicated her motivation as a result of affective needs:
“I'm dating someone who was actually friends with one of my Facebook friends
before they dated me…. I guess for me, I have people telling me I'm doing the
wrong thing but I don’t think I am. I wanted to see if other people think. [I want to]
get an opinion from someone who's not directly involved in the situation.”
Although she wanted to receive unbiased opinions from the forum users, she vocalized
that she hoped her decision regarding the relationship would be supported.
In another case, one participant from WikiAnswers with affective needs, asked a
question about the most effective anti-depression treatment. She encountered a personal
mental issue related to depression and thus began searching for any recommendations or
suggestions for a mental therapy.
“Well, I have issues with being umm…. affected by the seasons where I live and I
was trying to find effectiveness of some of the supplements and things that people
use and I had a therapy appointment and I wanted to go in if my therapist
recommended something knowing what the implications or benefits of that.”
In this case, the nature of question itself may indicate that she wanted to receive more
professional advice or personal experiences regarding solutions for successfully coping
with depression. However, she indicated that she actually looked for social and emotional
supports from others through question-answering interactions. Additionally, she asked
another question to get information about whether or not hypnosis was effective.
“Well it was kind of a cross reference about the question about the tongues and

122
the anti-depression. Hypnosis I've always been kind of curious…. does it help
relax someone is it…. who does it work for, how does it happen….”
People also asked questions to receive social or emotional support for someone
else such as family members or friends. One participant asked a question about a 2202
psychiatric hold.
“I had a friend on Facebook saying that she was - based on an attempt she had to
harm herself and I was like wow… what does that involve? How severe is it? Is
she under a watch? Or I was just very concerned for her well-being and who got
involved I wanted to be a friend and support her….”
This case illustrates that the question asker wanted to empathize and understand what a
message to her meant through understanding what a 2202 psychiatric hold is.
Another participant from Yahoo! Answers asked a question about how to cope
with the bad economy.
“This question is kind of lingering right now kind of one of the hot topics like
with health care kind of the economy. I had some friends that their mortgage rates
went up a couple years ago, now they’re ok but their mortgage went up to almost
1k a month and they were paying less than half that before and they were
struggling to stay afloat and pretty much their entire paycheck went into paying
that and I felt bad for them and it was a question that sparked in my head.
Thinking about then and you watch in the news and you read the newspapers and
it still- a lot of that going on. When I asked the question the responses were
actually a lot of them were they’re telling me their stories where a lot of them
were struggling. I didn’t really receive a positive answer to it- versus oh I'm doing
ok. A lot of them were just struggling surviving.”
He described how his friends were recently struggling in terms of their financial
situations, but had a hard time discussing it with them since it was a difficult question to
bring up.
“It's hard to bring up these topics and in general talk because there is a sense of you have to involve the ego and pride and everything kind of factors into it and
those are things you really don't want to talk and there's issues of masculinity that
they don't want to discuss because for males you're supposed to be able to handle
the real world and everything that goes on and it includes paying bills and paying

123
rent and paying for their kids.”
Thus, this participant wanted to ask a question on Yahoo! Answers in order to find out
how other people have faired during a financially difficult time. He then thought that by
understanding others’ experiences, he might be able to talk to his friends more carefully.
Although the survey responses revealed that people sometimes ask a question for
social or emotional support for someone else in WikiAnswers more than people do in
Yahoo! Answers, it was not clearly found if there would be a significant difference in
both sites because: (1) incidents of affective needs were too small to investigate statistical
significance (N=17); and (2) most incidents of this motivational factor retrieved during
the diary data collection were based on social or emotional supports for own issues and
problems.
5.2.3.3. Personal Integrative Needs
It was found that personal integrative needs were a moderately frequent
motivational factor that influenced users to participate in the question-answering
interaction in both online Q&A sites (Mean=2.86 S.D.=1.18 in Yahoo! Answers;
Mean=3.01, S.D.=1.13 in WikiAnswers). The diary data indicates that personal
integrative needs are the second most frequent motivational factor that drives people to
ask a question in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers (N=21, 10.24%), followed by
cognitive needs (N=133, 64.88%). Even though it was found that there were no
statistically significant differences in personal integrative needs between Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers, the WikiAnswers participants asked questions more often to
satisfy their personal integrative needs than the Yahoo! Answers participants did during

124
the diary data collection.
Personal integrative needs are based on self-esteem. This quality is usually
strengthened when people reassure their idea in a state of their knowledge or status in a
society. Thus, it can be assumed that when people ask a question to satisfy their needs in
a personal integrative state, they tend to use information or others’ opinions and ideas to
increase stability, gain credibility, and reinforce their own beliefs.
One participant from Yahoo! Answers used to be more creative and work on
photography and film. However, she found that she has not been inspired or able to even
think creatively about the projects. Prompted by these concerns, she asked a question
about how to think creatively again in Yahoo! Answers.
“I do photography and film, but for the past year, I haven't been inspired or able
to even think creatively about projects. I was trying to get any suggestions on how
to get the creative juices flowing….”
Her motivation was related to personal integrative needs, and she attempted to seek
supportive ideas to get her creative minds back or gain more insights into her creativity
through a variety of suggestions from other Yahoo! Answers users.
Another participant asked about the potential negative effects of Obamacare in
order to get different perspectives on how people perceive the new health care system.
The participant believed that an open discussion through the question-answering
interaction in Yahoo! Answers would help him gain insightful ideas regarding the health
system.
“I came in with a negative perspective on health care. I wanted to see what other
people thought about it and people who it affected directly, even they weren’t
happy with it either so it was kind of interesting the people who it was supposed
to help weren't happy either and the people who were well off they didn’t really
care, they just said they liked Obamacare just because of Obama so pretty

125
interesting in how they justified it.”
Then, this participant also indicated that he received interesting and satisfactory
information for his question at this time.
“Yes, I did because it was all different backgrounds so it was interesting to see people
who were for it and affected and the people who were affected by it most actually were
against it because they're going to get penalized if they don’t apply to it by the end of
March.”
Another case related to personal integrative needs was people asking a question
for finding a do-it-yourself solution or method (Wolf & McQuitty, 2011). For example,
one participant asked about how to change the hood release hatch in WikiAnswers to get
information.
“My hood release hatch on my car broke so I was trying to find what was the best
way to fix it…. I was trying to fix it myself and it just broke but I got it fixed so
all is good.”
She indicated that her primary motivation was personal integrative need, rather
than cognitive needs because she wanted to get insightful information into her life, which
helped her to figure out how to fix her car for not just saving money but empowering
herself.
Another participant also asked two different questions in WikiAnswers in order to
fix the household appliances herself. She also described her motivation as personal
integrative needs in both cases because she wanted to get information in order to increase
a level of confidence or self-credibility for doing something herself.
“My fridge is old and wanna make sure I am doing it right since I am doing it by
myself.”
“I wanted to install a ceiling fan myself, but I want it to be safe and secure and

126
make sure it's done right...also have the confidence to know how to do it myself.”
5.2.3.4. Social Integrative Needs
The survey responses revealed that social integrative needs were a low to
moderate frequent motivational factor for asking a question in online Q&A in the study.
This suggests that people are less likely to rely on online Q&A sites to connect their
networks (e.g., friends, family members, acquaintances, etc.) or develop a companionship
within online Q&A environments. However, as described in a previous section, people
still value the fact that they may be able to have social interactions or conversations to
find information or share others’ personal opinions and experiences over seeking
information through search engines (e.g., Bing, Google, Yahoo, etc.). As some
participants vocalized, social elements of online Q&A satisfy their social integrative
needs by being connected to other people or having conversations with other online Q&A
users to seek and share information:
“Well, I spend a lot of time alone so I feel like I need to have music or Netflix or
there needs to be some kind of interaction somehow like I don’t want to just be
sitting alone in silence.”
“I’m seeking information but because you get more answers I'm more likely to
figure out the answer myself by discussing it in a social environment.”
“Well basically I don’t really get out a lot. I'm kind of an isolated person and so as
far as connection with others a lot of my connections are through social media and
I wanted to not disconnect from that but in order to maintain my ability to not get
overwhelmed by Pinterest and social media but still not have to isolate from that
as a social outlet I wanted to be able to interact would be important- and kind of
read through so I can connect with those who I intended to and not just give some
stranger because it happened to be a common word or something.”
Even though the survey data analysis showed that there were no significant
differences in social integrative needs between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, the

127
diary data collection in phase 2 indicates that people in Yahoo! Answers were more
motivated in a social integrative state when asking a question. This may signify that
unlike WikiAnswers, in which people collaboratively paraphrase an answer to a question,
Yahoo! Answers’ interface, that allows people to participate in an open discussion as a
forum during the question-answering processes, may encourage people to participate in
the question-answering interactions in the site in order to satisfy their social integrative
needs.
5.2.3.5. Tension Free Needs
Tension free needs were found as the third most frequent motivational factor
(N=20, 9.75%) as it was found from the survey data analysis that tension free needs were
the second most significant motivational factor that influence people to participate in the
question-answering interaction in both online Q&A sites (Mean=2.93, S.D.=1.02 in
Yahoo! Answers; Mean=3.05, S.D.=1.02 in WikiAnswers). Having fun asking a question,
one of sub-categories within tension free needs, was rated as one of most frequent
motivational factors in the study (Mean=3.48, S.D=1.02 in Yahoo! Answers; Mean=3.40,
S.D=1.22 in WikiAnswers). This indicates that the question-answering interactions may
be perceived as more interesting as a dynamic information seeking process. This quality
could be a critical factor that help satisfies users’ tension free needs. The illustrative
quotes from the participations for this needs are as follows:
“For me astrology and tarot reading is kind of relaxing something I do when I’m
stressed out so when I asked this question I didn’t really feel any urgency to get
an answer because I already know some astrology and tarot reading sites so it was
kind of just to relax.”
“Usually I'll go on Netflix or listen to music but sometimes I don’t feel like doing

128
either one of those so I'll just do [ask a question].”
“I was kind of bored and I decided to ask a question because I wanted to make an
informed purchase later on but I asked the question and the answerer left the pros
and cons between which one to pick.”
“[T]he motivation was just something for fun really just like a random question
just to ask.”
5.3. RQ2: Expectation
5.3.1. Analysis of the Survey Data
In the study, there was an assumption that people may be motivated to ask a
question to satisfy their needs with a certain expectation from other users with respect to
their answers to a question. In this sense, the study also attempted to investigate what
people would expect from other online users when they are motivated to ask a question in
the online Q&A environments. The six expectation-based factors were identified based
on previous literature in the field of LIS (i.e., looking for quick responses, looking for
additional or alternative information, looking for accurate or complete information,
looking for social or emotional supports, looking for verification for own belief or
knowledge, and looking for trustworthy sources). These expectation-based factors were
measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1-Never to 5-Always) in the study.
It was found that looking for looking additional or alternative information was
identified as the most significant expectation from others when asking a question (Yahoo!
Answers, Mean=3.90, S.D.=0.94; WikiAnswers, Mean=3.97, S.D.=0.94), followed by
looking for accurate or complete information (Yahoo! Answers, Mean=3.86, S.D=1.15;
WikiAnswers, Mean=3.88, S.D.=1.20), looking for quick response (Yahoo! Answers,

129
Mean=3.74, S.D=1.15; WikiAnswers, Mean=3.88, S.D.=1.15), and looking for
trustworthy sources (Yahoo! Answers, Mean=3.60, S.D=1.19; WikiAnswers, Mean=3.40,
S.D.=1.29). It was found that looking for social or emotional support was the least
significant expectation when a participant asked a question in Yahoo! Answers (Yahoo!
Answers, Mean=2.56, S.D=1.23; WikiAnswers, Mean=2.77, S.D.=1.32). Table 5.23
presents details of distribution of all expectation-based factors in online Q&A services.

In Yahoo! Answers, it was found that people most likely expect to receive
additional or alternative information that helps satisfy their need when using Yahoo!
Answers to ask a question. Especially, the survey participants pointed out that Yahoo!
Answers is the appropriate place where people may get additional thoughts on the issues
that an asker encounters. Some participants vocalized their thoughts on looking for
additional or alternative information when asking a question in Yahoo! Answers.
“I use yahoo answers because I can always get multiple answers to my question. I
think yahoo answer and a search engine answers are different. Yahoo Answers is
that anyone can answer if you know. Search engines provided a one person
answer with a paragraph.”
“Yahoo Answers provides specific

answers to specific questions in a more

130
concise and direct way than a Google search. However, they might not always be
accurate. [S]ometimes, it is better to get several responses to choose from.”
Analysis of the survey data indicated that the participants also strongly look for accurate
or complete information to their question in order to satisfy their needs in Yahoo
Answers.
“There are many reasons why I choose Yahoo answers over various search
engines. Because I find it to be more accurate than other websites that I use and it
is way more helpful then others. I usually get great answers back from yahoo
answers and feel it’s very helpful for me. I would much rather have it help me
then other sites.”
“Enjoy using Yahoo for pertinent information. Always satisfied with the
responses (answers) received. Really like the completeness of the answers given.”
Nonetheless, other people also argued that information given to their question in Yahoo!
Answers may not be accurate although it helps get other people’s opinions.
“I use Yahoo Answers mainly for amusement or to kill time. I answer questions in
order to help people out, and I ask questions in order to read the answers. I usually
don't trust it as a good source of accurate information, but it is useful for gauging
peoples’s opinions in some cases.”
Additionally, the WikiAnswers survey participants reported that they tend to look
for additional or alternative information when asking a question although WikiAnswers
since this online Q&A platform only allows for one answer per question. The answer is
potentially paraphrased through collaborative editing by a number of WikiAnswers users.
However, one participant indicated that WikiAnswers usually sends an email notification
whenever people attempt to paraphrase the existing answer, therefore the asker may be
able to be notified how different information could be added in order to collectively help
address the askers’ question. In this case, the WikiAnswers survey participants pointed
out:

131
“WikiAnswers is a space for questions with softer answers; they may not have a
direct yes/no response, and I like that there’s room to elaborate and provide
additional assistance.”
“I use WikiAnswers because I get more informal information than from other
search engines!!! My expectations are that I gain more knowledge, and that I gain
more opinions!!!”
“I used WikiAnswers to get a wider array of responses from individuals. My
expectations are higher within WikiAnswers because of the quality of users.”
It was found that receiving responses to a question in a timely fashion in order to
satisfy their needs is also one of the significant expectations when asking a question in
Yahoo! Answers even though searching information through search engines (e.g., Bing,
Google, Yahoo, etc.) may take less time to receive immediate results for their needs.
However, the survey participants indicated that they might look for quick responses that
are tailored to solve their specific situations.
“I use Yahoo Answers to get solutions to questions because it is quick. People
usually respond in a matter of minutes. That is faster than doing extensive
research. I don't expect to get expert advice from Yahoo Answers, but I feel I may
bump into someone that has had a similar experience or who has knowledge of
the answer firsthand.”
“I use yahoo answers to get information relevant to my situation quickly, typically
some form of advice. If I use a search engine, I will find advice for people in
similar situations, not my specific one.”
It was also found that looking for a quick response was another significant
expectation when people ask a question in WikiAnswers. This indicates that
WikiAnswers users tend to believe that a quick response would satisfy their needs when
asking a question.
“Sometimes you just need a quick answer such as when you are doing a
homework assignment and are confused about the problem/answer itself.
WikiAnswers provide answers to homework (college level) questions. They also

132
answer questions that your child may want to know. It is quick.”
“I really enjoy doing research. I find that asking WikiAnswers questions does
help with the situation faster. My expectations are that this is a quicker to find
what I want than using a search engine (e.g., Google).”
“I wanted some direct human interaction rather than a staid and possibly outdated
answer. Also, it might be quicker to get a direct answer rather than sifting through
pages of Google sites.”

Finally, the survey participants reported that looking for accurate or complete information
when asking a question was another prominent expectation from other online Q&A users
with respect to their answers as the participants indicated:
“WikiAnswers is very accurate at providing results for questions. It is better than
Google when it comes to specifics. So, I think WikiAnswers was a good option”
“With WikiAnswers, you do not have to search for the correct response, you’re
instantly given the answer without any guesswork. I do however like to Google
same question many times to compare answers. I am confident with WikiAnswers
that the response I receive is accurate and I do not have to research it further
whereas with Google, for instance, I would need to verify with several resources
usually to make certain I do have my facts straight.”
However, although looking for accurate or complete information was identified as one of
the significant expectations from others with respect to their answers to a question in
WikiAnswers, some WikiAnswers participants also perceive that information received
from other WikiAnswers users may not be accurate. In this case, they pointed out:
“Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing if the answer is accurate but it might
put you on the right track to limit your search.”
“While WikiAnswers may not always be the most accurate, it’s usually sufficient
for a quick insight/answer and, more often than not, one of the first search results
on my cellphone. The site loads quickly and information is directly available.”
Finally, it was found that looking for trustful information to the question was

133
another significant expectation among the WikiAnswers survey participants. This would
indicate that WikiAnswers could be used for interacting with someone who has expertise
in a certain area in order to receive professional information:
“I have always known wiki to be helpful and reliable. I expect something more
professional from WikiAnswers.”
“My experience with WikiAnswers has a bit more depth in getting the answers, or
close, to what I am seeking. Wiki is different due to a genuine factor, unlike the
wide range of jokes and sarcasm you find on alternative search engines.”
5.3.2. Analysis of the Diary Data
Since there was an assumption that people would behave in a certain way with the
expectation that something would happen to satisfy their needs in the study, the
participants were required to choose one of the expectation-based factors and specify
their expectation of other people each time they wrote a diary about their question.
It was found that in terms of expectations from other online Q&A users with
respect to the questions that the participants asked during a 4-week diary data collection
period, looking for accurate or complete information (N=77. 37.56%) was the most
frequent expectation with respect to the question for asking a question in online Q&A.
The participants described that they were hoping to receive more accurate or complete
information to their question in order to satisfy their needs:
“I was looking for accurate information about that person because I want to verify
what I have read the article.”
“I was expecting a very scientific and accurate answer that I may have not been
able to completely comprehend.”
“I was expecting a straight forward answer and a correct answer.”

134
It was found that looking for quick responses was the second most frequent
expectation-based factor. This indicates that people conceive that they may satisfy their
needs once this type of expectation is met during the question-answering processes
(N=57, 27.80%) as some participants vocalized:
“Mainly just want a 1-2 word response.”
“I know I will get the right answers fast!!”
“Not sure. Want a fast answer, but not a pat answer.”
Finally, the participants reported that looking for additional or alternative
information (N=36, 17.56%) was the third most frequent expectation, suggesting that
people also tend to ask a question in online Q&A in order to receive second thoughts
from other users, or gain insights into their current events or activities through other
people’s opinion. The examples of this expectation are:
“I would like to see if there's more to the subject matter than I already know for
my assignment.”
“I’m trying to get people opinion on what video camera will work best that is
priced under $1000 dollars and the pro and cons of the cameras they mention…I
was looking to check out different examples before selecting one.”
Verification for own beliefs or knowledge and looking for trustworthiness were
found as the least frequent expectations that the participants looked for from other users
when they asked a question in online Q&A.
5.3.3. Analysis of the Interview Data
In this section, six different

expectation-based factors identified from

135
the previous research studies in the field of LIS are presented in conjunction with the
interview data consisting of 205 questions asked by 18 participants in phase 2.
Additionally, the newly discovered theme of expectation from other online Q&A askers
is also presented here.
5.3.3.1. Looking for Quick Responses
The survey responses indicated that looking for quick responses was rated as one
of significant expectations from others when people ask a question in online Q&A. It
was also found that this expectation with respect to other online Q&A users’
answer(s)was the second most frequent expectation for asking a question during the diary
data collection (N=57, 27.80%). This indicates that receiving an answer to a question in a
timely manner is a critical factor that satisfies an asker’s needs in the online Q&A
environments.
The interview data analysis indicates that there were a wide range of situations in
which the participants tended to look for quick responses. The following quotes present
the examples of different circumstances the participants were in when looking for quick
responses.
“My girlfriend called me on the phone she asked me how to use one of those
things and I never heard it in my life so that's why I used it to ask because I don’t
even know what that is….. She was cooking and she wanted an answer right away
and I couldn’t really give her an answer so I said let me look it up and I googled it
and I couldn’t really find it.”
“I used Launchcast for a long time maybe 4 or 5 years before it got cancelled and
I listen to music all day and the player I used is ok and it’s not like that and I was
looking for something similar and everyone said to use Pandora but it’s just not
the same…. And, I would love to find one as soon as possible.”
“I want to be able to identify the name since the painting spoke powerfully to

136
me…. I first googled the painting but I couldn’t find any information about it. So,
I asked a question in WikiAnswers and was looking for a fast response since I
wanna know now.”
“A lot happened this year in terms of celebrity news and I wanted to know what
peoples’s opinions are and what impacted them the most…. It's good for advice
but most of the time I ask random questions when I'm not bored but when I have
time. I don’t ask questions that I can find answers online, Yahoo answers isn’t
that useful for that…. Just want to see what people have to say quickly....”
5.3.3.2. Looking for Additional or Alternative Information
As was identified by the survey responses, looking for additional or alternative
information was the most frequent motivation for asking a question (Mean=3.90,
S.D.=0.94 in Yahoo! Answers; Mean=3.97, S.D.=0.94 in WikiAnswers), suggesting that
receiving a series of different information (e.g., opinion, recommendation, advice, etc.) is
a significantly critical factor for people to employ in online Q&A when searching for
information to satisfy their needs. From the diary data collection, it was found that 36
(17.56%) questions were asked by the participants who expected to receive additional or
alternative information from other online Q&A users when asking a question. The
following quotes from the interview data are examples of how the participants tend to ask
a question in order to get other peoples’ opinion, recommendation, advice, or second
thought, in order to satisfy their needs in various interests.
“There are sites or apps that are just really generic they feel like something that
anyone can- information that anyone can say that can apply to almost anyone in
different circumstances so I was thinking if I asked this question maybe I could
get answers from sites that are accurate because if people are recommending it.
It’s probably because they had good experiences with these sites.”
“Well, it’s the last semester of college for me and my friends and I were thinking
of the things we should do and we couldn’t come up with a long list and I guess
we had the same mind and couldn’t come up with anything outside of the box.”
“Dave and Busters is a place where you can eat and play games kind of like

137
Chuckee cheese but only for adults we wanted to go out to dinner and play games
and I wanted to see if anyone knew where to get coupons and deals because
they're pretty expensive.”
“We had gone out, the foster fell through so we went out to the local humane
society to adopt a shelter dog who spent her entire life in a box so she’s very
scared and hard to handle so I was looking for ideas from people who've been in
my situation to see how we can get her happier.”
“This question I asked because I’m a first time home buyer and I was looking
around and before purchasing a home what are some low cost not too expensive
remodeling to increase the value of a house, I didn’t know anything and I didn’t
look on Google so I just asked this question…. [I was looking for] opinions and
cognitive information that people have used and I asked this in the decorating and
remodeling category I figured they had good information.”
“Basically I was going camping and we were getting ready and I asked this
question because we have raw flaxseeds I remember back in school you can’t just
eat raw flaxseeds so I asked this question just to be sure and someone did answer
you can’t just eat it raw you have to cook it…. Yes, [I was looking for] advice
and additional information that I can get on it.”
It was also found that people from WikiAnswers indicated that looking for
additional or alternative information is their one of most frequent expectations. In
WikiAnswers, only one answer could be given and potentially paraphrased by the
collaborative efforts of different WikiAnswers contributors (e.g., regular users, content
supervisors, etc.). This format is different than the Yahoo! Answers structure in which
people are involved in a discussion-based answering forum and different answers may be
displayed in thread for each question. Note that there is no guarantee that more than one
answer is received. However, one participant from WikiAnswers commented that she
always received an email notification whenever people add more content in the answer
received to her question. This made her feel that she received additional information
from different people to her question.
“Multiple people usually answer the question…. and I get multiple answers for

138
questions with multiple people who answer the same question or add to what
other people say and I like that.”
This may explain why there were no statistical differences in looking for additional
information or alternative information between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers,
although it was hypothesized that Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers function differently
in terms of the number of answers that can potentially be given to a question (See section
2.1 for detailed characteristics of each online Q&A service).
5.3.3.3. Looking for Accurate or Complete Information
The survey data analysis indicated that looking for accurate or complete
information was the second most frequent expectation (Mean=3.86, S.D.=1.15 in Yahoo!
Answers; Mean=3.88, S.D.=1.20 in WikiAnswers), followed by looking for additional or
alternative information. However, it was found that looking for accurate or complete
information was the most frequent expectation from other online Q&A users with respect
to their answers to a question (N=77, 37.56%). This may be related to a question type the
participants asked during the diary data collection. The incident diary data analysis
revealed that 98 (27.80%) questions were to solicit factual or objective information for
their question, suggesting that people tend to look for accurate or complete information to
satisfy their cognitive needs, especially when asking fact-finding questions in the online
Q&A environments.
The following quotes from the interview data present the examples of different
circumstances (e.g., food, finance, health, etc.) in which people looked for accurate or
complete information in order to satisfy their needs during the diary data collection.
“I wanted to post an ad without going to each specific site…. I was trying to look

139
for accurate information because I want to see a software….. from a verified
source to help me with my business.”
“I'm hoping to get the right name for this plant so that I can start researching care
instructions.”
“It's also cognitive needs too. I use electronic cigarettes I’ve been using them for a
while and in some parts like New York and Chicago they’ve been regulating them
but I wanted to know if they're ever going to ban them or if they're trying to.”
“I visited a church that was Pentecost and I was wondering if that was a belief that
I agreed with and - I just thought the people were nice…. I was just looking up
some factual information about this belief.”
“I have eyebags that have been under my eyes for a long time so I was just asking
this question- I asked this in the medicine category there's actually doctors on
there they have accurate information and factual for what causes this or that.”
“I was looking around for a home and I noticed there’s some houses on the MLS
they have something called owners finance is the certain type of financing and I
wanted to know if there’s anything to watch out for behind owners finance and
some folks said there’s nothing wrong with it I only got two answers for it and I
asked it under real estate they said there’s no real catch and they backed it up and
said that if you are late on your payment that the county can legally kick you out
of your house its really interesting.”
5.3.3.4. Looking for Social or Emotional Supports
Compared to other expectations, the survey data indicated that people were less
likely look for emotional or social supports from other people when asking a question in
the context of online Q&A (Mean=2.56, S.D.=1.33 in Yahoo! Answers; Mean=2.77,
S.D.=1.32 in WikiAnswers). Only 20 questions (9.76%), were asked by the participants
looking for social or emotional supports rather than factual information or others’ opinion
or advice. In addition, there was no significant evidence of differences in this expectation
between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers from both the survey and diary data analysis.
However, the following example illustrates how and when people tend to look for social

140
and emotional supports for their problematic situations in Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers.
“We kind of got into a fight I don’t know I wanted to know other peoples opinion
if they thought she overreacted. I wanted to meet some people I don’t know
because they usually give unbiased information…. I guess I expect someone to
give me insight on what went wrong.”
One participant from WikiAnswers commented that she already decided to foster a
certain dog even though she found some information and negative perspectives on
fostering a dog. When she asked a question about others’ experiences of fostering a dog,
including some positive or negative experiences, she wanted to have some support from
other WikiAnswers to confirm that she made the right decision.
“I filled out an application to foster dogs and we had to accept certain dogs if we
want to take care of them and I wanted to know if - mostly if there were any
negative experiences but positive experiences would make me happier about
doing it…. I was hoping that their positive experiences - if there were any would
back me up in order to be ready to foster a dog.”
5.3.3.5. Looking for Verification for Own Belief or Knowledge
Although it was confirmed from the survey data analysis that looking for
verification for one’s own belief or knowledge was rated as a moderately frequent
expectation from other people when asking a question (Mean=3.29, S.D.=1.23 in Yahoo!
Answers; Mean=3.34, S.D.=1.27 in WikiAnswers), only a few questions (N=9, 4.39%)
were asked when looking for verification for own belief or knowledge as an asker’s
expectation.
One participant asked a question about a NBA player to see others’ opinions
about the best NBA Players in their position. He also indicated that he wanted to verify

141
his belief.
“I was hoping I would get answers that were what I believed but the rest of the
answers was another player….. I did get an answer but they named another player
from another team. I still do believe that the player is inconsistent but I also do
believe that the other player is inconsistent.”
Another participant from WikiAnswers looked for verification for her knowledge, and
indicated that verifying what she believed through the question-answering processes with
others is “social confirmation or assurance” that tends to validate own ideas through the
information received from other people.
“I guess it was more of a confirmation that if it’s really tasting that bad that I'm
going to ask kind of confirm that when I asked people were like- oh yea. It was
kind of a social confirmation…. just kind of assurance.”
5.3.3.6. Looking for Trustworthy Sources
Similar to the findings of the previous expectation-based factor, looking for
verification for own beliefs or knowledge, only 3 questions (1.46%) were asked by the
participants although it was rated as moderate to high frequent expectation in the survey
(Mean=3.60, S.D.=1.19 in Yahoo! Answers; Mean=3.40, S.D.=1.29 in WikiAnswers).
Basically, this expectation indicates that people who look for trustful resources when
asking a question more likely want to get “authoritative information” or interact with
someone who has expertise in his/her question topic or area, rather than receive personal
opinion or thought as one participants vocalized their expectation of having trustful
resources:
“I'm thinking of Yahoo groups and some of these searches they're just like
basically cross referencing peoples’s blogs where they talk about I've tried this
this this and it's just lists and that doesn’t tell me side effects or anything and it’s
just a list and it comes up in buying your drugs online but I wanted a research site
that compared different ones and brand names like prozac.com.”

142
5.4. RQ3: Relationship between Motivation and Expectation
5.4.1. Analysis of the Survey Data
As it was assumed that motivation and expectation would be correlated when
people ask a question in the study, a series of linear regression analyses were conducted
in order to investigate the relationships between users’ motivations and expectations.
5.4.1.1. Relationship between Motivation and Expectation in Yahoo! Answers
First, looking for quick responses was statistically significant for finding relevant
information in the following contexts: immediate surroundings, society and the world,
seeking advice or opinions for making decisions, learning, self-education through
acquiring information, gaining a sense of security through knowledge, social and
emotional support for personal issues, social and emotional support for someone else, and
emotional release. These results indicate that cognitive needs were strongly correlated
with looking for quick responses, suggesting that people in Yahoo! Answers tend to look
for quick responses to their question when they were motivated by cognitive needs to
either receive factual information and/or seek others’ advice or opinion tailored to an
asker’s specific situations.
Moreover, it was found that the participants were motivated to ask a question to
satisfy their affective needs, especially for social and emotional supports. Yet, there was
no statistically significant relationship with seeking quick responses. Similarly, it was
also found that looking for quick responses was correlated with tension free needs.
Especially, analysis of the survey data presents that releasing emotion, one of sub-

143
variables that was highly correlated with looking for quick responses, suggests that when
the participants decide to ask a question in order to release their emotion, they tend to
look for quick responses from other online Q&A users to satisfy their needs in Yahoo!
Answers. However, it was also found that there were no statistically significant
relationships between any personal and social integrative needs and looking for quick
responses when asking a question in Yahoo! Answers. Table 5.24 illustrates a series of
linear regression analyses of the relationships between motivations and looking for quick
responses.

responses in Yahoo! Answers.

The relationships with looking for additional or alternative information were
statistically significant for finding relevant information in immediate surroundings,
society and the world, seeking advice or opinions for making decisions, learning; selfeducation through acquiring information, gaining a sense of security through knowledge,
having fun asking a question, and filling time. These results indicate that cognitive needs
were highly correlated with the situations in which people tend to expect to receive
additional or alternative information from others in Yahoo! Answers.
Moreover, it was found that tension free needs, especially having fun asking a
question and filling time, were statistically correlated with looking for additional or
alternative information. This suggests that the participants were more likely expecting to
receive more diverse responses from others when they asked a question for having fun or
filling their time in Yahoo! Answers. However, the relationships with looking for
additional or alternative information were not statistically significant for affective needs,
personal integrative needs, and social integrative needs in Yahoo! Answers. Table 5.25
presents a series of linear regression analyses of the relationships between motivations
and looking for additional or alternative information.

In terms of the data regarding looking for accurate or complete information,
which is presented in Table 5.26, it was found that only finding relevant information in
immediate surroundings, society and the world, and gaining a sense of security through
knowledge were statistically correlated with this type of expectation. Especially, finding
relevant information in immediate surroundings, society, and the world, was strongly
correlated with looking for accurate or complete information as it could be assumed that
accurate information more likely satisfies an asker’s need for receiving objective or
factual information. Overall, this suggests that more objective criteria influencing
expectations of information within SQA (e.g., accuracy) may be correlated with

146
motivational factors in a cognitive state.

The relationships with looking for social or emotional supports were statistically
correlated with all motivational factors except learning; self-education through acquiring
information, as shown in Table 5.27. It may be predictable that affective needs for
seeking social and emotional support for personal issues or someone else’ ones were
strongly correlated with the expectations of having social or emotional supports from

147
others when asking a question in Yahoo! Answers. Yet, it was also found that social
integrative needs and tension-free needs were also strongly correlated with looking for
social and emotional supports. These findings indicate that when people are motivated to
ask a question to having social conversations or interactions, they may expect to receive
social or emotional supports from other Yahoo! Answers users through the questionanswering processes. Additionally, the significant relationships between tension-free
needs and looking for social and emotional supports may indicate that people who are
strongly motivated to ask a question to release their tension or stress more likely look for
social and emotional supports in order to satisfy their needs.

All motivational factors and their sub-level variables experience strong significant
correlations with looking for own beliefs or knowledge. It was thought that the
approaches people use in an attempt to verify their own belief or knowledge may be
varied depending on each asker’s unique situations involving their information seeking
behaviors. They range from needs of more cognitive principles (e.g., fact finding, seeking
advice or opinion, etc.) to needs of more subjective ones (e.g., seeking social and
emotional support, having social connections, releasing emotion, etc.) in order to receive
information sources for verifying their own belief or knowledge. Table 5.28 describes a
series of linear regression analyses of the relationships between all motivational factors
and looking for verification for own belief or knowledge.

Finally, the relationships with looking for trustworthy sources were statistically
correlated with finding relevant information in immediate surroundings, society and the
world, seeking advice or opinions for making decisions, learning; self-education through
acquiring information, gaining a sense of security through knowledge, attainment on
personal thoughts or ideas, gaining insight into one’s own life, and experiencing empathy
with problems of others.
Analysis of the survey data indicates that all motivational variables in cognitive
needs were highly correlated with looking for trustworthy sources, signifying that
credibility of an information source may be a critical factor satisfying an asker’s need
when seeking either factual information and/or others personal opinions or advices.
Yet, it was found that social integrative needs and tension free needs were not
statistically correlated with looking for trustworthy information when asking a question
in Yahoo! Answers. Table 5.29 illustrates a series of linear regression analyses of the
relationships between motivations and looking for trustworthiness.

5.4.1.2. Relationship between Motivation and Expectation in WikiAnswers
A series of linear regression analyses were conducted in order to investigate the
relationships between users’ motivations and expectations when people ask a question in
WikiAnswers.
First, it was found that looking for quick responses was statistically related to

151
finding relevant information in immediate surroundings, society and the world, learning,
self-education through acquiring information, gaining a sense of security through
knowledge as cognitive needs, social and emotional support for personal issues as
affective needs, finding support for one’s own values, gaining insight into one’s own life
as personal integrative needs, identifying with others and gaining a sense of belonging,
finding a basis for conversation and social interaction as social integrative needs, and
having fun to ask a question as tension free needs. These results indicate that when
people are motivated to ask a question for satisfying their cognitive needs, they are more
likely to look for a quick response except in situations when they may seek advice or
opinions for making decisions.

responses in WikiAnswers.

Additionally, there was a statistically significant relationship between looking for
a quick response and social and emotional support for personal issues. This may signify
that the timeliness of receiving answer(s) would be a critical factor to satisfy affective
needs when they ask a question in WikiAnswers. Table 5.30 presents a series of linear
regression analyses of the relationships between motivations and looking for quick
responses.

Second, all motivational factors, including all sub-categories were statistically
correlated to looking for additional or alternative information. This suggests that people
generally look for additional or alternative information to satisfy any type of motivation
that drives people to ask a question in WikiAnswers. Table 5.31 presents a series of linear
regression analyses of the relationships between motivations and looking for additional or
alternative information.
Third, looking for accurate or complete information was statistically correlated
with finding relevant information in immediate surroundings, society and the world,
seeking advice or opinions for making decisions, learning; self-education through
acquiring information, gaining a sense of security through knowledge as cognitive needs,
social and emotional support for personal issues, attainment on personal thoughts or ideas
as affective needs, finding support for one’s own values, gaining insight into one’s own
life as personal integrative needs, identifying with others and gaining a sense of
belonging, finding a basis for conversation and social interaction, having a substitute for
real-life companionship as social integrative needs, and having fun asking a question as
tension free needs.
It was found that people tend to look for accurate or complete information when

154
they are more likely motivated to ask a question for satisfying their affective needs. This
may signify that people may still look for professional advice or experiences in order to
socially or emotionally support their problematic situations, e.g., looking for professional
advice for their current health-related issues. It was found that there was not a significant
relationship between looking for accurate or complete information and social and
emotional support for someone else’s issues. In addition, it was evaluated by looking for
accurate or complete information was strongly correlated with social integrative needs,
especially by finding a basis for conversation and social interaction. This indicates that
social interactions with other people to consult an asker’s needs in order to receive more
factual information are expected in WikiAnswers. Table 5.32 presents a series of linear
regression analyses of the relationships between motivations and looking for quick
accurate or complete information.

Fourth, it was found that looking for social or emotional supports had statistically
significant relationships with all motivational factors, including all sub-variables, except
finding relevant information in immediate surroundings, society and the world within
cognitive needs. It was found that the WikiAnswers participants tend to look for social or
emotional supports when they are motivated to ask a question to satisfy their affective
needs such as finding social and emotional support for either personal issues and/or
someone else’s ones. At the same time, they also look for social or emotional supports
when their needs are more likely from cognitive states, e.g., seeking advice or opinions
for making decisions.

Additionally, the WikiAnswers participants tend to seek social or emotional
supports when asking a question to either satisfy an asker’s personal integrative needs to
improve their credibility or develop their self-esteem and/or social integrative needs that
drive him/her to socially connect with other people or find a basis for conversation
through the question-answering processes. Table 5.33 describes a series of linear
regression analyses of the relationships between all motivational factors and looking for
social or emotional supports.
Fifth, the relationships between all motivational factors and looking for
verification for one’s own belief or knowledge were evaluated as presented in Table 5.34.
It was found that most motivational factors except finding relevant information in
immediate surroundings, society and the world, seeking advice or opinions for making
decisions, and learning; self-education through acquiring information were strongly
correlated with looking for verification for own belief or knowledge. This may signify

157
that when the WikiAnswers participants are motivated to ask a question in order to satisfy
their cognitive needs, their expectations from other WikiAnswers users with respect to
their question are less likely to verify their own belief or knowledge. However, gaining a
sense of security through knowledge, one of sub-categories within cognitive needs, was
significantly correlated with this type of expectation when asking a question in
WikAnswers.

Finally, it was found that no matter how the WikiAnswers participants are
motivated to ask a question, they tend to look for trustful information to their question,
except the situations in which they ask a question to seek advice or opinions for making
decisions.
“I thought that asking WikiAnswers would give me quick, and reliable response. I
really needed and outside perspective. WikiAnswers came through and provided
enough data to satisfy my quest.”
“I have always known wiki to be helpful and reliable. I expect something more
professional from WikiAnswers.”
However, it was also found that seeking advice or opinions for making decisions
had no a statistically significant relationship with looking for trustworthiness, suggesting
that when people use WikiAnswers to find other peoples’ opinion or advice, it would not
matter whether or not information received to his/her question is trustful since people
perceive that such advice- or opinion-based responses might not be a right or wrong
information. Table 5.35 presents a series of linear regression analyses of the relationships
between all motivational factors and looking for trustworthy sources.

5.4.2. Analysis of the Diary Data
Another descriptive analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between
motivations and expectations for asking a question in online Q&A. It was found that
cognitive need and looking for accurate or complete information were the most
frequently correlated attributes when asking a question during the diary data collection
(N=61, 45.86%), followed by cognitive needs and looking for quick responses (N=36,
27.07%) and cognitive needs and looking for additional or alternative needs (N=23,
17.29%). Additionally, it was also found that such cognitive-related expectations (i.e.,
looking for quick responses, looking for additional or alternative information, and
looking for accurate or complete information) were correlated with other motivational
factors. For example, the participants also looked for either additional information or
accurate information to satisfy their affective needs more than social or emotional

160
supports, even though it was predictably assumed that affective needs might be highly
correlated with looking for social or emotional supports. These findings may signify that
the relationships between user motivations and expectations may be dynamically changed
based on an asker’s unique situation when they ask a question in online Q&A services.
It was found that when people were motivated to ask a question to satisfy their
tension free needs (e.g., passing time, releasing emotion, etc.), they more likely look for
quick responses (N=8, 40%) than any other expectations. This indicates that timeliness in
receiving answer(s) would be a critical factor of how their tension free needs are fulfilled
through the question-answering processes.
Yet, it was found from the diary data analysis that there were no significant
differences in the relationships between motivations and expectations between Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers. Table 5.36 presents a summary of relationships between
motivations and expectations in all incidents generated by the participants in the diary
data collection.

5.4.3. Analysis of the Interview Data
In the study, it was assumed that user motivations and expectations could be
correlated when people decide to ask their own question in online Q&A. In other words,
people may be motivated to ask a question to satisfy their needs in a unique situation
where they feel that asking a question in online Q&A is mostly appropriate with a certain
expectation from other online Q&A users with respect to their responses to the question.
From both survey and diary data analysis, it has been observed that dynamic
relationships between motivations and expectations were developed when asked a
question among the participants as opposed to linear relationships between certain
motivational and expectation-based factors. This suggests that the relationships between
these two factors are based on an asker’s unique situation in which contextual
information is inquired for satisfying an asker’ needs in online Q&A.
The following sections present different types of information seeking grounded by
multiple cases of relationships between motivations and expectations when asking a
question for seeking contextual information in online Q&A. Different cases illustrating a
variety of relationships between different needs and expectations are presented for
describing each type of information seeking behaviors.
5.3.3.1. Fast Information for Needs
One of the predominant information seeking behaviors identified in the study is to
get fast information for an asker’s needs in online Q&A. Their needs may vary

163
depending on an asker’ unique situation. It ranges from looking for factual information or
others’ opinion or advice, to getting insights on personal thought, to developing social
conversation for an open discussion, and to just having fun to pass time by the questionanswering interactions.
Cognitive Needs. Getting fast information to satisfy an asker’s need in a cognitive
state was found as the most significantly frequent information seeking behavior (N=36,
63.15%), and there was no significant evidence that this relationship might be different
between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers as the survey data analysis also presents that
the relationship between cognitive needs and looking for quick responses were
statistically significant in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.
It was found from the diary data that most questions within the relationship
between cognitive needs and getting fast information were to solicit factual information
in a wide range of topics. For example, one participant from WikiAnswers asked about
libertarians.
“My main motivation really was to learn more about libertarians and to see if
there’s any facts to that not just opinions but the political party they come from
what they’re about.”
However, she indicated that since there was too much information about what it is online,
she wanted to ask a question in WikiAnswers to get quick and concise information about
it as she vocalized her expectation from other WikiAnswers users:
“I am asking this question because there seems to be so much information out
there internet wise regarding libertarians, that I wanted a more simple
explanation.”
Personal Integrative Needs. It was found that people looked for quick responses

164
to satisfy their personal integrative needs when attempting to find supports for their own
values or gain insights into their belief and life. As confirmed in the survey data, there
were more frequent correlations between personal integrative needs and looking for quick
responses in WikiAnswers. For instance, one participant from WikiAnswers had an
offline conversation with her brother, talking about the Olympics, then had an argument
about when it actually started and two had a different answer for it.
“I was watching the Olympics and I’ve always been into the sports and I was
trying to figure out when it actually started because me and my brother had an
argument about it so it was more like sibling rivalry about who has the correct
answer but it was interesting to find out the answer.”
Social Integrative Needs. Unlike statistical analyses, which showed that there was
no significant evidence that social integrative needs were related to looking for quick
responses in Yahoo! Answers, there were more incidents where social integrative needs
and looking for quick responses were related when asked a question in Yahoo! Answers
(N=4), while there was no incident that the participants were motivated to ask a question
in a social integrative needs and looked for quick responses.
It seems that people tend to ask a question to either solicit factual information
and/or find other online Q&A users’ advice when looked for quick responses to satisfy
their social integrative needs, which they tended to create an open-ended discussion by
their question to generate social interactions or conversations. For example, one
participant from Yahoo! Answers asked about the current weather in his area.
“Subject arose with recent very cold temps here in Pittsburgh PA, and I was
finding information, but wanted to share ideas with other people because I’m sure
there is more one answer for my question, and I want to meet others who have
different answer for it….”

165
He expressed that his initial motivation was to ask a question to seek correct
information about his topic, but he was also interested in interactions with other Yahoo!
Answers users who have different opinions or thoughts about the topic he asked. In
addition, he indicated that offline discussions with his family members or friends
sometimes encourage him to visit Yahoo! Answers in order to interact with other people
that he does not know and have another discussion through the question-answering
process for the similar topics the he discussed with his family members or friends.
Tension Free Needs. A total eight of incidents illustrated the relationship between
tension free needs and looking for quick responses. Especially, the participants asked
more questions in Yahoo! Answers to satisfy their tension free needs through receiving
fast responses from others (N=6). The participants described that they sometimes use
online Q&A to ask a question because they feel bored. Thus, they indicated that having
fast responses from other online Q&A users helps them to have fun asking a question and
fill their time. In this sense, one participant, for instance, wanted to create an open
discussion of games with other Yahoo! Answers users.
“I was kind of bored and I decided to ask a question because I wanted to make an
informed purchase later on but I asked the question and the answerer left the pros
and cons between which one to pick…. In Yahoo Answers, there’s something
called polls and surveys and that category has a bunch of people on it asking
questions and so that one was I was just wondering why people were choosing
one over the other….. [I was] looking for a fast response from people to see how
others think….”
It was also found that selecting a specific category to ask a question in online Q&A may
affect how user motivation and expectation is correlated with one another. He indicated
that he uses different categories based on what he wants from other online Q&A users.
“I get more technical information from the video game forum, but on the polls

166
and surveys forum they might not even know which is which but they choose one
anyway its more personal I guess it’s not like technical I guess….”
5.3.3.2. Additional Information for Needs
Another significant type of information seeking in online Q&A is ‘seeking
additional information for needs’ (N=36, 17.56%), which indicates that an asker wants to
receive multiple responses to a question. Thus, it was found that the questions that people
look for other online Q&A users’ opinions and advices may be most likely related to this
type of information seeking. Additionally, an asker’s need is based on a unique situation
in which he or she asks a question to find contextual information. The following sections
present the relationship with looking for additional or alternative information with each
significant need found from the diary data analysis.
Cognitive Needs. It was found that seeking additional information to satisfy an
asker’s need in a cognitive state was the most frequent (N=23, 63.88%), and there was
evidence showing that the relationship between looking for additional information and
cognitive needs for asking a question was statistically significant in both Yahoo! Answers
and WikiAnswers. For example, one participant from Yahoo! Answers asked a question
about a CAPM certification exam. She indicated that she tried to study it a couple of
times previously, but could not figure out which way is the most appropriate.
“[I] would like to see how others studied for CAPM so that I can consider their
method as one of options to study for the exam…. I was expecting to receive
multiple alternatives on different prep courses what not, so that I can seek and
choose what suits the best for me….”
She pointed out that since there are a variety of ways for people to study and prepare for a
CAPM certification exam, she wanted to receive additional information about them from

167
other Yahoo! Answers users who have already done it.
Another participant also wanted to receive multiple suggestions from other Yahoo!
Answers users when she asked a question about some good party games for college-aged
people.
“I would like to get other people’s suggestions for activities…. I would like to get
many suggestions that I haven't thought of myself.”
Affective Needs. There were incidents that represented the relationship between
affective needs and looking for additional or additional information (N=5), suggesting
that people sometimes want to get multiple information perspectives about his/her topic
in order to have social or emotional supports from others through the question-answering
interactions in online Q&A. One participant from Yahoo! Answers explained, for
example, that he wanted to find someone else who could provide some emotional
supports for his situation.
“I ended up surprising my female coworker after not seeing her for 2 months so I
ended up going from behind and giving her a hug and we held that position for 2
months and just want peoples opinion on what type of hug is this…. I just want
people opinion who has missed a person and hugged a person for over 10 seconds
and ask them what type of hug this is because I know that there are several hugs.”
This incident exemplifies one of the situations in which an asker’s primary
motivation for asking a question is less likely related to seeking and sharing information
or knowledge. He primarily wanted to have emotional supports from others who have
similar experiences in order to understand the situation.
Personal Integrative Needs. It was also found that people tend to satisfy their
personal integrative needs by having diverse information in online Q&A. A total of 3
incidents (8.33%) were made by the participants in which they looked for additional or

168
alternative information for satisfying their personal integrative needs. One of participants
asked a question about an existence of female ginger cats. She commented that her main
motivation was personal integrative needs since she wanted to gain more insights into her
current knowledge through various information related to her question topic.
“I just found out my stray ginger cat is a female, when I thought all along that it
was a male…. since I didn't know this I wanted to gather as much information as I
could, genetics…..”
Tension Free Needs. A total of 4 incidents occurred during the diary data
collection where the participants’ tension free needs were related to looking for additional
or alternative information when asked a question in online Q&A. The questions asked
within this case were mostly related to seeking others’ opinions, which indicates that
people tend to look for other users’ opinions or thoughts when they either feel bored to
fill their time or want to release their emotion through asking a question in online Q&A.
For example, a Yahoo! Answers participant asked about a favorite astrology or tarot
reading site in order to not only look for others’ suggestions but also release her emotion
and feel relaxation.
“For me astrology and tarot reading is kind of relaxing something I do when I’m
stressed out so when I asked this question I didn’t really feel any urgency to get
an answer because I already know some astrology and tarot reading sites so it was
kind of just to relax….”

5.3.3.3. Accurate Information for Needs
It was found that seeking accurate information for satisfying an asker’s needs is
the most frequent form of information seeking when people ask a question in online

169
Q&A (N=76, 37.07%). Seeking ‘accurate information for needs’ is a type of information
seeking in online Q&A asserts that online Q&A users may perceive that receiving
accurate or complete information from other online Q&A users would help them to
satisfy any need that they have in their state. In addition, it was found that there were
evidences of which the following four needs are often related to looking for accurate
information.
Cognitive Needs. Looking for accurate or complete information and cognitive
need was the most significantly frequent relationship, which was identified from the diary
data analysis (N=61, 80.26%). This may signify that people look for accurate information
when they are motivated to ask a question to satisfy their needs in a cognitive state, more
specifically through finding factual information or seeking professional advice for an
asker’ problematic situation. For example, one participant wanted to know what Obama
Care means. She indicated that she has been taught about what it is, but did not fully
explain it to other people. Thus, she decided to ask a question to get more complete
information about it.
“I wanted an answer that could provide me an in depth look into Obama Care, but
still be something that is easy to understand. I want to know more about Obama
Care because everyone I ask about it seems to really have no idea on what it is
about. The internet on the other hand has too much information on it, and I can
barely comprehend some of it.”
Another participant from WikiAnswers asked a technical question related to how
to hook up a portable receiver to her television, and commented that she thought it would
be not a difficult task, which she would not need to hire a technician to do it. Thus, she
decided to do herself, but needed more detailed information.
“I wanted to be able to get information from someone who knows what to do….

170
self-help knowledge via experiences of others….and quick response or
information…. I prefer the information to be detailed and not just a quick
response without nothing specific."
Affective Needs. A total of 4 incidents occurred during the diary data collection,
which present how affective needs were related to looking for accurate information. It
was found that people who are motivated to ask a question to satisfy their affective needs
do not always expect to receive others’ social or emotional supports in online Q&A.
Rather, this finding indicates that people also look for accurate or complete information
to satisfy their affective needs that drive them to ask a question for finding social or
emotional supports for either own and/or someone else’s problems.
One participant from WikiAnswers asked a question about what products have
vitamin c to see if she should change her meal plans to get more vitamin c, She hoped
that someone would provide good information, which would confirm that she would not
change her meal plans.
“I was trying to learn what has vitamin c…. I knew some things had it, but I
needed others like more variety like fruit and vegetables and other stuff…. it was
interesting to find out how many different stuff there is…. It was more like I
wanted to know what it was like I needed to know and I wanted to know so it was
a balance in between both, so it’s kind of hard to explain.”
Personal Integrative Needs. There were 7 incidents collected from the diary data
that represent how personal integrative needs were related to looking for accurate or
complete information (9.21%). This indicates that sometimes, people want to receive
more accurate or complete information than quick or additional information, in order to
satisfy their need in a personal integrative state, which there are attempts for people to
gain more insights on their own values through the question-answering processes in

171
online Q&A. For example, one Yahoo! Answers participant asked a question about how
to record restaurant meals on Sparkpeople in order to get specific advice from other users
who use the same service. But her main motivation in asking the question was to gain
insightful ideas into the right way of doing a certain thing by others’ comments on their
experiences.
“I've been dieting the past two months and I haven’t been eating any restaurant
meals but I’ve been recording everything I eat into sparkpeople so I was
wondering how I record a restaurant meal if the nutrition facts weren’t on the
website…. I wanted someone who's done it before but I didn’t someone to guess I
wanted someone who's actually done it before to give me an answer.”
5.3.3.4. Supports for Situations
‘Support for situations’ indicates that an asker looked for social or emotional
supports from others who provided favorable supports for an asker’s problematic
situations. Even though an asker may have different motivations to ask a question, e.g.,
finding objective information, having different perspectives drawn by other’s opinions or
advices, gaining insights for his/her own life, or having social conversations, the primary
expectation for supports for situations may look for others’ social or emotional supports
through the question-answering processes.
A total of 20 incidents were identified as this type of information seeking in
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, and it was found that different motivational factors
(e.g., cognitive needs, affective needs, social integrative needs, and tension free needs)
were correlated with looking for social or emotional supports. The following present
various situations in which the participants were motivated to ask a question to satisfy
different needs in each participant’s unique situation by having social or emotional

172
supports in online Q&A.
Cognitive Needs. It was found that the when participants tended to ask a question
to seek other people’s opinions or advice to resolve their issues or make decisions, they
more likely looked for social or emotional supports (N=8, 40%). This confirms the
findings that there was no statistical significance in the relationship between finding
factual or objective information in immediate surroundings, society and the world in
cognitive needs and looking for social or emotional supports, which were found in the
survey data analysis.
Social Integrative Needs. It was also found that people sometimes expect to have
social or emotional supports when they were motivated to ask a question for social
interactions or conversations with others in the context of online Q&A. One of the
participants in Yahoo! Answers asked a question about how people cope with negative
feelings (e.g., sad, unmotivated, etc.) and wanted to have an open discussion with other
people.
“sometimes you just feel like you're not doing anything or that you're not going
anywhere or achieving what you want to achieve so you get kind of depressed so I
was thinking of something I could do that would make me feel better….”
However, it was found that she did not intend to have a new friend or acquaintance from
Yahoo! Answers although she was willing to have conversations with other users to share
others’ suggestions or advices.
“…. I could do that but then you get afraid that you're going to get a crazy person
talking to you, you get worried because some people they get and think- and if
you don’t say something they like they might give your email address out and you
might have spam mail or something.”
This comment confirms that the having a substitute for real-life companionship, one of

173
sub-categories in social integrative needs, was rated as one of the least motivational
factors among the survey participants.
Tension Free Needs. A total of 3 incidents were occurred in the diary data
collection, which illustrate how tension free needs were related with looking for social or
emotional supports. One of the participants in Yahoo! Answers, for example, wanted to
know how other people think about the music video she previously watched. She
indicated that she was bored and happened to ask the question in Yahoo! Answers.
“I watched the video on Facebook and I saved the link to show someone but I lost
it and I wanted to find it but I couldn’t and it was irritating…. Just bored and
wondering if I am alone in this opinion.”
Her motivation to ask a question was to pass time by having the questionanswering interactions in Yahoo! Answers. But, she wanted to have some support from
other Yahoo! Answers users that might help her to think that she was not the only person
who found the music video irritating.
5.5.3.5. Social Assurance for Confirming Ideas
People utilize online Q&A in order to receive objective information and/or
personal opinions or advice to confirm whether or not the facts or norms that an asker
believes are correct. This type of information seeking is identified as ‘social assurance for
conforming ideas’ through the question-answering processes, which an asker tends to
verify their own belief or knowledge.
A total of 9 incidents occurred during the diary data collection, which illustrate
how looking for verification for own belief or knowledge was related with different

174
motivational factors when they ask a question in online Q&A. The following presents
various cases providing different incidents in which people were motivated to ask a
question to satisfy different motivations, while they expect to verify their idea or belief
by having an answer(s) from others.
Cognitive Needs. Two incidents were identified that represent the relationship
between looking for verification of own belief or knowledge and cognitive needs. It
seems that people expect to verify their own belief or knowledge by receiving other
peoples’ opinions or advices when they ask a question in online Q&A. These incidents
represented this relationship, and it appears that people want to receive either objective
information and/or others’ opinions or thoughts on an asker’s question. One
WikiAnswers participant asked whether or not a person who is allergic to penicillin eat
blue cheese, which she tends to receive accurate information from someone who has a
professional background in the question topic.
“I am just curious. You see, blue cheese probably has the same mold that is used
to make penicillin…. I have a feeling the answer is yes, so I want to know if that
is true.”
This example describes that she wanted to verify what she believes by having a reliable
information sources provided from subject experts.
Affective Needs. Two incidents were observed during the diary data analysis,
which illustrate how affective needs were related to looking for verification of own belief
or knowledge. This relationship signifies that people may be motivated to ask a question
to have social or emotional supports for personal issues, while they want to confirm what
they believe is not wrong by the question-answering interactions with others. For instance,

175
one participant asked about his personal current issues that he had a difficult time to
figuring out himself. He wants to have social supports from Yahoo! Answers to make
sure that he is not wrong on what he believes in the situation.
“I’m looking for an answer as to why my ex female coworker doesn’t want her
boss to know that we still talk. My female coworker told me she just wanted to
keep her private life private but I think there is still a deeper reason why she wants
it private….. I believe that she wants to keep private because she wants a romantic
relationship because I would like for others to tell me if I’m correct or not.”
Social Integrative Needs. The relationship between looking for verification of
own belief or knowledge and social integrative needs indicates that people may want to
have an open discussion with other people who have similar interests in order to validate
what they believe. For example, one participant asked a question about the best NBA
players in their position. He included his own opinions about players in each position as
additional information in his question, and wanted to share thoughts with other people
who have similar interests in Yahoo! Answers.
“I was interesting to see other people think about this….trying to get verification
for my ideas….Most people answered, they said LeBron James.... they disagreed
with me on other players, I was mostly correct. Everyone has the same opinions
on what makes the best player, some people think its defense some think its
offense. LeBron James…. so you can't disagree on that…..”
5.5.3.6. Finding Authoritative Information for Needs
‘Finding authoritative information for needs’ is referred to as a form of
information seeking in online Q&A, which an asker tends to look for more credible or
authoritative information to satisfy an asker’s need.
Even though the survey participants rated looking for trustful sources as one the
frequent expectation-based factors when they ask a question in online Q&A, only 3

176
incidents occurred in which the participants looked for trustful resources from other
online Q&A users in order to satisfy their cognitive and affective needs. One participant,
for instance, vocalized how her motivation and expectation for an asking question was
related to see authoritative information about the product in WikiAnswers.
“Randomly, taking a shower I saw there were very bright sparkles in my shampoo
and I read the back ingredients and there's nothing that should explain that and I
wanted to know exactly what they were…. I was hoping that somebody who had
a truthful answer would actually answer instead of something who's taking a
guess or something.”
5.5. RQ4: Comparison between Motivation and Expectation
The previous sections have focused on investigating motivational and
expectation-based factors for asking a question in both Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers. The following two sections present a series of independent sample t-tests
in order to investigate either differences and/or similarities in user motivations and
expectations for asking a question between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.
5.5.1. Comparison of motivations between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers
First, a series of independent samples t-tests with the survey data were conducted
to investigate any differences in motivational factors between Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers. It was found that there were no statistical differences in motivations
between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers except one-variable - looking for social and
emotional supports within affective needs.
This indicates that the WikiAnswers users are motivated relatively stronger than
people in Yahoo! Answers to ask a question to seek social or emotional supports for

177
someone else such as family members or friends. Details of differences in each
motivational factor between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers are presented in Table
5.37.

Even though analysis of the survey data did not reveal any significant differences
in user motivation for asking a question between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers,
except one sub-variable, analysis of the diary data found that there were several incidents
in which the participants were motivated by different needs during a 4-week period of the
diary data collection. For example, it was found that the participants more frequently
asked a question to satisfy their personal integrative needs (N=13, 17.11%) than the
participants from Yahoo! Answers (N=8, 6.20%), while the participants from Yahoo!
Answers attempted to ask a question to satisfy their social integrative needs more
frequently (N=13, 10.08%) than the WikiAnswers participants did (N=1, 1.32%).
Additionally, it was also found that tension free needs were identified as the more
frequent motivational factor for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers (N=16, 12.40%).

5.5.2. Comparison of expectations between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers
Another series of independent samples t-tests were conducted in order to evaluate
the differences in expectations from other WikiAnswers with respect to the question.
There were no statistically significant differences in expectations between Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers, These findings indicate that there would be similar criteria
that articulate an asker’s expectations for answers to his or her question in both Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers. Table 5.38 presents the details of differences in each
motivational factor between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.

Analysis of the diary data confirmed that the three cognitive-based expectations
were the most frequent expectations from other online Q&A users with respect to their
answers to the questions in the incidents identified during a 4 week period of the diary
data collections in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers: (1) looking for quick
responses (N=28, 27.71% in Yahoo! Answers; N=29, 38.16% in WikiAnswers); (2)
looking for additional or alternative information (N=25, 19.38% in Yahoo! Answers;
N=11, 14.47% in WikiAnswers); and (3) looking for accurate or complete information
(N=51, 39.53% in Yahoo! Answers; N=26, 34.21% in WikiAnswers). However, even
though looking for additional or alternative information was rated as the most significant
expectation-based factor, analysis of the diary data indicated that looking for accurate or
complete information was the most frequent expectation-based factor in both Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers. This difference in expectation between the analysis of the

180
survey and the diary data may be caused by the question types that the participants asked
during the diary data collection. It was found that a fact-finding question that solicits
factual or objective information was found as the most frequent question type (N=50,
38.75% in Yahoo! Answers; N=51, 67.11% in WikiAnswers). Thus, it may infer that the
participants more frequently looked for accurate or complete information from other
online Q&A users to satisfy their needs. Nonetheless, it was found from analysis of the
diary and interview data that there were no such differences in user expectations between
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.
5.5.3. Comparison of relationships between motivations and expectations between
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers
First, the relationships between all motivational factors and looking for quick
responses were evaluated to examine the similarities and differences between Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers. It was found that in both online Q&A services cognitive
needs had a statistically significant relationship with looking for quick responses, except
seeking advice or opinions for making decisions in WikiAnswers. This relationship
indicates that people may look for quick responses when they ask a question to solicit
objective or factual information for satisfying their need in a cognitive state in both
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, while people more likely want to receive others’
opinions or advices for making decision in a timely manner after asking a question in
only Yahoo! Answers.
It was also found that looking for quick response was statistically correlated with
affective needs, especially looking for social or emotional supports for personal own

181
issues in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. Furthermore, tension free needs were
also statistically correlated with looking for quick responses in both Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers, suggesting that receiving quick answers from other online Q&A users is a
critical factor, which affects on peoples’s evaluative criteria to judge information quality
when they are motivated by tension free need to ask a question. Yet, it was also found
that the Yahoo! Answers participants more likely look for quick responses when they are
motivated to ask a question for releasing their emotions, while the WikiAnswers
participants more likely look for quick responses when they are motivated to ask a
question for having fun.
In terms of personal and social integrative needs, it was found that there were
only statistically significant relationships with looking for quick responses in
WikiAnswers. Table 5.39 presents a summary of comparison of the relationships between
all motivational factors and looking for quick responses between Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers.
Table 5.39. Comparison of relationships between all motivational factors and looking for
quick responses between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.

Second, all motivational factors were statistically correlated with looking for
additional or alternative information in WikiAnswers, while only cognitive and tension
free needs were statistically related to looking for additional or alternative information in
Yahoo! Answers. Cognitive needs, especially learning through acquiring information,
were strongly correlated with looking for

additional or alternative information in both

183
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, suggesting that people may believe they are able to
learn something, depending on their unique situations, from diverse information received
to their question.
Additionally, it was found that other motivational factors (i.e., affective needs,
personal integrative needs, and social integrative needs) were statistically correlated with
looking for additional or alternative information in only WikiAnswers. Table 5.40
provides a summary of comparison of the relationships between all motivational factors
and looking for additional or alternative information between Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers.

Third, in terms of relationships between all motivational factors and looking for
accurate information, it was found that in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers
cognitive needs were statistically correlated with looking for accurate information when
people ask a question, except seeking advice or opinions for making decisions and
learning; self-education through acquiring information in Yahoo! Answers. This indicates
that people who use Yahoo! Answers may not necessarily look for accurate or complete
information when they try to ask a question to seek others’ personal opinions or advices
on specific situations, or to learn something from others’ previous experiences.
In regard with other motivational factors such as affective needs, personal and
social integrative needs, and tension free

needs, it seems that these motivational

185
factors have statistically significant relationships with looking for accurate or complete
information in only WikiAnswers. Nonetheless, there was no statistically significant
relationship between tension free needs and looking for accurate or complete information
in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, except having fun asking a question within
tension free needs in WikiAnswers. Table 5.41 provides a summary of comparison of the
relationships between all motivational factors and looking for accurate or complete
information between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.

Fourth, it was found that in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers there were
statistically significant relationships between all motivational factors and looking for
social and emotional factors, except finding relevant information in immediate
surroundings, society and the world, suggesting that people do not have a tendency to
look for social or emotional supports from other people when they are motivated to ask a
question for seeking factual or objective information.
Additionally, these results indicate that people look for social or emotional
supports to satisfy different needs when asking a question such as seeking professional
advices, finding social interactions, or just having fun asking a question depending on an
asker’s unique situations or contexts. Table 5.42 provides a summary of comparison of
the relationships between all motivational factors and looking for social or emotional

187
supports between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.

Fifth, in terms of looking for verification for own belief or knowledge, it was
found that in only Yahoo! Answers the cognitive needs were statistically correlated with
this type of expectation. Other motivational factors such as affective needs, personal and
social integrative needs, and tension free needs had statistically significant relationships
with looking for verification for own belief or knowledge in both Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers. Table 5.43 presents a summary of comparison of the relationships between

Finally, cognitive and personal integrative needs were statistically correlated with
looking for trustworthy sources in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. However, the
findings indicate that people do not tend to look for authoritative information when they
are motivated to ask a question for seeking advice or opinions for making decisions
within cognitive needs in WikiAnswers. Yet people do not look for authoritative
information to find supports for their own values within personal integrative needs in

190
Yahoo! Answers.
For other motivational factors such as affective needs, social integrative needs,
and tension free needs, it was found that there were significant relationships between
other motivational factors (i.g., affective needs, social integrative needs, and tension free
needs) and looking for trustworthiness in only WikiAnswers. Table 5.44 presents a
summary of comparison of the relationships between all motivational factors and looking
for trustworthiness between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.

Analysis of the diary and interview data found that the three cognitive-based
expectations (i.e., looking for quick responses, looking for additional or alternative
information, and looking for accurate or complete information) were frequently
correlated with all motivation factors, suggesting that no matter how people are
motivated to ask a question, they more likely look for one of these expectations. This
would depend on an asker’s problematic situations where different favorable expectations
may be determined in his or her questioning behavior in online Q&A services.
However, analysis of the diary and interview data found that there were no
significant differences in the relationships between user motivations and expectations. It
was found that there were statistically significant differences between Yahoo! Answers
and WikiAnswers, e.g., the relationships between personal integrative needs with the
three cognitive-based expectations, the

relationships between social integrative

192
needs with three cognitive-based expectations. It was also found that there were
significant relationships between these motivational and expectations-based factors in
only WikiAnswers.
The findings from the analysis of the diary and interview data with regard to the
relationship between motivations and expectations, may indicate that user motivations
and expectations are correlated with one another when asking a question are not affected
by a specific online Q&A services, but developed by unique situations in which they
perceive the question-answering interactions could be helpful to get such contextual
information from other people.

5.6. Additional Findings
One of the findings on user motivations for asking a question emerged from
analysis of the interview data in the study was that the extension of uses and gratification
theory that was used in order to investigate users’ individual differences in needs that
motivate online Q&A use for asking a question. Previous studies employed uses and
gratifications theory as a theoretical framework to measure users’ motivations and needs
for media use treated each need (e.g., cognitive needs, affective needs, etc.) separately.
This indicates that although there have been several previous research studies where
exploratory factor analysis was conducted to yield any identifiable characteristics of
media users based on their survey or interview responses (see Clavio & Kian, 2010; Park,
Kee, & Valenzuela, 2009 for the examples of exploratory factor analysis in research
employed the uses and gratifications theoretical framework), it has not been concerned

193
with whether or not each individual’s need for using a specific media might be
dynamically mixed based on his/her contextual situation. This may be because the
previous studies did not specifically investigate each time of media use, but instead
examined users’ overall need of using different media (e.g., television, newspaper, social
media, etc.).
However, as the interview data analysis progressed, it was found that people were
sometimes motivated in more than one state when asking a question in online Q&A. Two
coders conducted content analysis for the interview transcriptions with 205 questions and
their initial motivation data. Coders first coded 4 participants in order to ensure coding
consistency throughout the process. The final Kappa value for intercoder reliability
between tow coders was 0.712. Based on suggestions by Landis & Koch (1977) about
Kappa values – 0.40 to 0.59 are considered moderate, 0.60 to 0.79 substantial, and 0.80
outstanding – it can be argued that for intercoder reliability for content analysis is
acceptable in the study. 23 different incidents (11.22%) were found that a dynamic
combination among five different motivational factors has been developed based on each
participant’s specific and unique contextual situation. Table 5.45 present participants’
comments of how different motivational factors were combined for each question they
asked in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers in the study.

other peoples perspectives.”

“I was not sure where to put this as just

Another new finding on user expectations for asking a question in the study was
that there was an emergent theme found from the interview data analysis. Two coders
conducted content analysis for the interview transcriptions with 205 questions and their
initial expectation related data. Coders first coded 4 participants in order to ensure coding
consistency throughout the process. The

final Kappa value for intercoder reliability

195
between tow coders was 0.638. Based on suggestions by Landis & Koch (1977) about
Kappa values – 0.40 to 0.59 are considered moderate, 0.60 to 0.79 substantial, and 0.80
outstanding – it can be argued that for intercoder reliability for content analysis is
acceptable in the study. 19 questions (9.27%) were identified as participants had more
than one expectation from other online Q&A users when asked a question. Table 5.46
present participants’ comments of how different expectations were combined for each
question they asked in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers in the study.

The study focused on the question-answering interactions within the context
online Q&A in order to gain a better understanding of why people ask a question and
what they expect from other users with respect to their answers to a question. Even
though several cases in which user

motivations and expectations were

197
correlated to ask a question and judge information quality were found, there was another
finding that illustrates a direct communication via a personal contact information (e.g.,
email) outside of online Q&A services. In a personal profile, people are allowed to
display their contact information (e.g., IM, email in Yahoo! Answers, a direct message
board in WikiAnswers). One of the participants from Yahoo! Answers commented that
he has had experiences in which he contacted to the person who answered his question in
order to get more professional information to solve his issues, while he also received
emails from others when he answered their questions.
“…. that is interesting in that way it’s almost like a forum talking to people and
I’ve actually gotten messages from people before you can talk to people directly
via email and they just email you back and forth and you can talk about anything,
and I’ve also direct messaged some folks and we talked to each other via email
back and forth and it can go far beyond just yahoo answers so that’s the cool thing
about it.”
This signifies that asking a question to initiate social interactions with others in terms of
seeking and sharing information may also have implicit motivation of which they may
want to contact answerers directly to receive further information sources. The participant
indicated that he received an answer from a person who seemed to have a professional
background in health-related works, thus he was motivated to ask more questions about
his health-related issues to that specific answerer via the answerer’s email given in the
personal profile. Therefore, it would be interesting if future studies continue to explore
how motivations to ask a question within online Q&A services influence asker’s another
motivations to interact with others outside the context of online Q&A, and how
motivations would be either different and/or similar between interactions within and
outside online Q&A services.

198
Another finding is that when people were motivated to ask a question in online
Q&A services, looking for quick responses was found as one of the significant
expectations for judging information quality. However, some participants also indicated
that they are willing to wait longer if they can get more comprehensive and personalized
information that help them to satisfy their needs in an unique contextual situations.
“I am willing to wait for a good answer from yahoo answers even though it takes
more time to get information…. sometimes I'll google and look for things and I
don’t really find anything or what I find doesn’t really seem to answer my
question so I feel like maybe I need to ask someone who had a personal
experience.”
This confirms the notion of social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), which explains
how individual users interact to fulfill their needs in online Q&A services and how they
invest their time to wait more time to receive personalized information tailored to a
question they ask. Teevan et al. (2013) also argue that there are some situations in which
information searchers value the high quality of information over speed. As Cropanzano
and Mitchell (2005) pointed out symbolic relevance in social exchange, online Q&A
users are voluntarily involved in communities of practice through the question-answering
processes in order to receive more contextual information for satisfying their needs.
Finally, the study used Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers functions as a test bed
to investigate user motivations and expectations for asking a question. There were also
attempts to investigate if motivations and expectations were different or similar between
these two services. However, it was found that there was not much difference in
motivations and expectations between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers although it
was assumed that each online Q&A service provide differentiated features in terms of the

199
question-answering interaction. However, it was also observed that familiarity and
personal preference/taste had impacts on how people choose an online Q&A service to
ask a question. In other words, additional features or influential factors of media choice
would affect people to choose a particular online Q&A to ask a question.
5.7. Summary of Findings
The theoretical framework of uses and gratification was utilized in the study in
order to investigate different motivational factors that drive people to ask a question in
online Q&A. Not surprisingly, cognitive needs were identified as the most significant
motivational factor for asking a question in both Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, and
either finding relevant or factual information and/or seeking others’ opinion or advice for
decision makings were the key factors for people to ask a question. However, there was
no statistical evidence that showed motivational factors could be different between
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, except looking for social and emotional support for
someone else (e.g., family, friends, etc.) and finding a basis for conversation and social
interaction.
Criteria identified by previous research studies on how people evaluate
information within LIS were used to identify an online Q&A user’s expectations in the
study. The six expectations were identified: (1) looking for quick responses; (2) looking
for additional or alternative information; (3) looking for accurate or complete information;
(4) looking for social or emotional supports; (5) looking for verification of own belief or
knowledge; and (6) looking for trustworthy sources. It was found that looking for
additional or alternative information was the most frequent expectation that people look

200
for from other online Q&A users to satisfy their needs, followed by looking for accurate
or complete information, and looking for quick responses. Yet, there were no statistically
significant differences in expectations between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.
In terms of the diary data collection, three major parts were analyzed – question
type, question topic, and an asker’s motivation and expectation each time he or she asked
a question. Fact-finding questions that solicit factual or objective information were the
most frequent type of question that the participants asked during the diary data collection,
followed by opinion-seeking questions. Additionally, the participants tended to ask a
question most frequently in the “Heath” category, followed by “Education & Reference”,
“Entertainment & Music”, “Business and Finance”, and “Science & Mathematics”.
A total of 205 questions were asked during the diary data collections, and the
most frequent motivational factor was cognitive needs, followed by personal integrative
needs and tension free needs. Even though the survey data analysis found that there were
no significant differences in motivational factors between motivations and expectations,
the diary analysis revealed that people tend to ask a question more to satisfy their
personal integrative needs in WikiAnswers, while people do ask a question more to
satisfy their social integrative needs in Yahoo! Answers.
In terms of expectation from other online Q&A users with respect to their
answer(s) to a question, it was found that looking for accurate or complete information,
followed by looking for quick responses and looking for additional or alternative
information. And, the diary analysis confirmed that there was no significant evidence of
differences in expectations between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. However, it was

201
found that people look for quick responses relatively more in WikiAnswers, while people
look for additional or alternative information more in Yahoo! Answers.
The qualitative analysis was conducted with a data collected by phone interviews
with 18 participants who participated in the diary data collection in the phase 2. The main
goal of implementing the diary data collection in which the participants were required to
write a short diary about their motivation and expectation each time they ask a question
in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers was to overcome the potential issues of recall of
their questioning behaviors, as well as collect records of users’ recent activities in online
Q&A.
A variety of contextual situations were explored to understand user motivations
and expectations within different incidents collected from the diary data collection. One
of the findings from the interviews in terms of user motivations and expectations was that
they sometimes had more than one motivational and expectations-based factor when they
asked a question in online Q&A. Additionally, the interviews also helped to gain a better
understanding of how user motivations and expectations are dynamically correlated when
people ask a question in the online Q&A environments, depending on each participant’s
unique contextual situation.

202
CHAPTER 6: DISCUSSION
The dissertation focused on gaining a better understanding of contextual
backgrounds and situations of information seeking behaviors with emphasis on user
motivations and expectation for asking a question in the context of online Q&A services.
A mixed method approach that sequentially employed the Internet-based survey,
diary, and interviews, was used in order to investigate information practices in the
context of online Q&A with a focus of user motivations and expectation for asking a
question. Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers were selected because the main focus of the
study was to investigate online Q&A users’ questioning behavior with most likely
unknown people with a wide array of topics or areas, and the four main research
questions were proposed: (1) What motivates people to ask a question that address their
needs in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers?; (2) What are an asker’s expectations from
other users to fulfill his or her needs when asking questions in Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers?; (3) How do motivations of asking a question relate to expectations of
answer content in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers?; and (4) To what extent are
motivations, expectations, and the relationship between motivations and expectations
different and/or similar between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers?
Five motivational factors and six expectation-based factors were identified and
measured in order to understand online Q&A users’ contextual information needs and
personalized criteria to judge answer quality within the question-answering processes. A
total of 225 Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers first participated in the Internet-based
survey in order to investigate the general backgrounds of online Q&A users, as well as

203
their motivations and expectations for asking a question. Additionally, 18 participants
were selected through maximal variance sampling, and recruited in the diary data
collection for 4 weeks, as well as the follow-up phone interview.
In this chapter, a summary of the findings for each research question are presented,
and the results from each method are synthesized to address the research questions to
seek extend and sharpen understandings of findings in the study. Moreover, additional
findings from analysis of the interview data are followed in order to expand a scope of
understandings of information seeking behaviors through the question-answering
processes in the context of online Q&A services, followed by a description of the
limitations in the current study.
6.1. Key Findings
6.1.1. Motivation
The study focused on investigating what motivates people to ask a question in
online Q&A services where people mostly interact with unknown participants in Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers. First, Analysis of the survey data identified that cognitive
needs were the most significant motivation factor for asking a question. Specifically, it
was found that the participants were highly motivated to learn through acquiring either
factual or objective information and/or other peoples’ personal opinions and advice,
depending on an asker’s contextual information need in such a unique situation. Even
though learning - self-education through acquiring information - was measured as one of
sub-variables in conjunction with other variables such as finding relevant information in
immediate surroundings, society and the world, or seeking advice or opinions for making

204
decisions, the analysis of the interview data indicates that these sub-variables are
interrelated with one another. In other words, people who ask a question in online Q&A
services have a desire to learn something from information received to their question via
the question-answering process. This information could be factual knowledge or
opinions or advices from others’ personal experience or expertise, depending on an
asker’s unique contextual situations. The findings confirm that learning is one of the key
criteria in the theoretical framework of communities of practice (Wenger, 1998),
indicating that a mutual engagement of seeking and sharing information in online Q&A
services constitutes social practices that construct informal learning-teaching formations
through the question-answering processes among online Q&A users. Moreover, as it was
found that the study participants asked questions in a broad array of topics identified
during the diary collection, the framework of everyday life information seeking provided
a holistic viewpoint of online Q&A users’ information seeking through questioning in the
dissertation. This framework helped to understand online Q&A users’ everyday social
practices of acquiring different information in various topics or areas where people look
for information from other online Q&A users, ranging from personal health or
relationship issues to school work-related question.
The findings of the prominent motivation of asking a question for seeking either
factual information and/or other users’ personal advice or opinion to satisfy needs in a
cognitive state within online Q&A services may be similar to the findings of previous
research focusing on investigating the user intent or goal of Web search, which identified
that informational searching as one of the prominent intent of Web searching (Broder,

205
2002; Jensen & Pooh, 2000; Lee, Liu, & Cho, 2005; Rose & Levinson, 2004; Sellen,
Murphy, & Shaw, 2002). For example, Jensen and Pooh (2000) found that more than 80%
of Web searching was related to information searching, which attempts to identify
specific Web pages to retrieve relevant information to satisfy users’ searching goal.
Moreover, Rose and Levinson (2004) provided a hierarchical framework of what
constitutes information searching, and included looking for advice as one of information
searching that helps users to learn something through ideas, instructions, or suggestions
from Web pages. This may indicate that information behaviors in online Q&A services
and the other information sources (e.g., search engines) may share a similar intent or goal.
However, other interview participants also indicated that even though they are
aware of which other questions that have been already answered could be existed in
online Q&A services, which might be similar to a question they intended to ask, they still
wanted to ask their own question to receive new personalized answers from other users,
which are just tailored to their own question through the question-answering interactions
with others. This may be how online Q&A services may leverage the ‘human touch’
through human-to-human interactions within the question-answering processes, which is
an inherent differentiation from informational searching in the Web even though both
online Q&A services and Web searching share a similar intent or goal of information
behavior in online environments.
The second most frequent motivational factors were personal integrative needs
and tension free needs. This indicates that people are also motivated to ask a question to
increase self-esteem by finding support for one’s own values or gaining insight into one’s

206
own life. Even though personal integrative needs may be similar to cognitive needs in
terms of acquiring information, people who are motivated by personal integrative needs
more likely ask a question to gain insights or find values in his or her state of knowledge.
For example, it was found that people who are motivated by personal integrative needs
attempted to gain insights by verifying their current information or knowledge through
information received to their question. One of the interview participants asked about
abortion during the diary data collection, and personal integrative needs was her
motivation to ask the question in order to verify her current knowledge about abortion
through answers from others in WikiAnswers.
“ I know what it is. I know that it is a termination of a pregnancy, but I wanted to
know the scientific way [of how] it is done, what exactly happens like the pills
someone takes what surgical procedure it is….”
People are sometimes motivated to ask a question in order to seek credibility and insight
in a state of knowledge, which they believe that acquiring information through the
question-answering interactions with others in online Q&A services may increase their
self-esteem in different contexts. Self-esteem is a psychological term, defined as
perception of “a person’s belief about whether he or she is intelligent” (Baumeister,
Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003, p.2). Thus, it infers that online Q&A users may be
motivated to ask their own question to increase self-confidence (Branden, 1969) of being
intelligent by information, experience, knowledge shared by other people to their
question in online Q&A services.
In addition, people were also highly motivated to ask a question to satisfy their
tension free needs. This indicates that online Q&A services may play an important role in

207
not only helping people to seek and share information or personal ideas, but also serving
as another form of social media platforms in which people attempt to find their own fun
or enjoyment through questioning-answering interactions in online Q&A services. For
example, one Yahoo! Answers participant commented that online Q&A services are
similar to social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter, which people are allowed
to make some online friends and look at other users’ activities. In terms of practical
implications of online Q&A designs and interfaces, this would suggest a variety of
gamification related features (e.g., point, level, social badge, etc.) for the questionanswering interactions for situations in which online Q&A users are motivated by tension
free need to ask a question. Of course, in online Q&A services, people may not
necessarily find real friendships or develop long-term interpersonal relationships through
the question-answering interactions, which the findings from the survey in phase 1
support that people are less likely motivated to ask a question to have a substitute for
real-life companionship. However, some online Q&A users may still value human-tohuman interactions that are temporarily constructed when asking a question to other
people in order to satisfy their tension free needs in online Q&A services.
It was found that socio-affective elements (i.e., affective needs, social integrative
needs) were less significant motivational factors for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers
and WikiAnswers. These results indicate that although online Q&A services mainly
support the question-answering interactions for seeking and sharing information, socio–
affective characteristics of online Q&A still play an important role in the questionanswering processes in which people sometimes tend to be engaged in social interactions

208
to seek others’ supports for problematic situations as the previous studies indicate that
emotional supports or social conversations via an open discussion when asked a question
were more needed than receiving information (Kim et al., 2007; Shah and Kitzie, 2012).
Similarly, even though analysis of the survey data indicated that social integrative needs
were the least significant motivational factor for asking a question in both Yahoo!
Answers and WikiAnswers, the interview participants also pointed out that they
sometimes ask a question to interact with other online Q&A users to share personal
thoughts or ideas. For example, one participant commented that he wanted to ask a
question related to new PlayStation games in a poll category, in order to have social
conversations with others in Yahoo! Answers, rather than seeking any factual information
about the games.
One of the new findings in this dissertation was that online Q&A users were
sometimes motivated by multiple needs when they ask a question in online Q&A services.
For example, people mainly seek professional information from subject experts to get
reliable information for their personal problems or issues, while they are also motivated
to ask a question to receive social or emotional supports from other online Q&A users.
As Maslow (1954) argues that human beings’ actions typically have more than one
motivation, this finding indicates that an asker’s actions, particularly questioning
behavior and his or her interactions with others in online Q&A services are sometimes
undertaken in pursuit of multiple needs based on an asker’s unique situations.
6.1.2. Expectation
In the study, it was assumed that

people would expect something from others

209
with respect to their answers to a question when they articulated their information need
by asking a question in online Q&A services. Moreover, they have their own expectation
by employing their evaluative criteria to judge answer quality for their unique contextual
situations. Thus, it can be argued that people’s expectation of information with respect to
answers to their question are articulated by their criteria to judge information quality. In
this sense, the dissertation used meta-analysis to identify peoples’ evaluative criteria from
the previous research studies in the field of LIS, and these identified criteria were used to
measure online Q&A users’ expectation when they ask a question in Yahoo! Answers
and WikiAnswers.
This dissertation identified the three major expectations: (1) looking for quick
responses; (2) looking for additional or alternative information; and (3) looking for
accurate or complete information, which online Q&A users look for from others with
respect to their answers when asking a question in online Q&A services. Analysis of the
survey indicated that the most substantial expectation when asking a question in online
Q&A services was looking for additional or alternative information, followed by looking
for accurate or complete information, and looking for quick responses. The diary analysis
also confirmed that these three expectations towards answers to their question were the
most frequent expectations although analysis of the diary data presented that looking for
accurate or complete information was the most frequent expectation identified during the
diary data collection. This may be because users’ expectation is based on not only their
unique situation where different contextual information is needed, but also what kind of
question they ask to solve their problematic situations. In other words, since fact-finding

210
questions that solicit objective or factual information were most frequently asked during
the log data collection, looking for accurate information was found as the most frequent
expectation from analysis of the diary data.
The most prominent expectations identified in this dissertation were based on a
cognitive-based state. This may be because cognitive needs were also the most prominent
motivational factor for asking a question in online Q&A services, which indicates that
when people are motivated by cognitive needs when asking a question, they may more
likely have cognitive expectations from others, which attempt to find relevant
information or others’ personal opinions or advices through the question-answering
interactions for an asker’s problematic situations in online Q&A services.
First, online Q&A users tend to look for quick responses from other online users
when they ask a question, depending on situations in which an asker is needed to
immediately solve problems. The interview participants indicated that one of their
prominent reasons behind using online Q&A services to obtain information for their
needs is based on their satisfactory experiences in which they received various answers
from subject experts quickly to solve their specific problems. Of course, online Q&A
users may receive quicker results when they search information through different
information seeking behaviors such as using search engines or retrieving similar
answered questions in online Q&A services in online environments. However, they may
believe that online Q&A services facilitate human-to-human interactions with subject
experts who are willing to share their information and knowledge, and these interactions
allow him or her to receive tailored information to his or her question quickly.

211
Additionally, of a total of 57 incidents in which the diary participants indicated
that they looked for quick responses from other online Q&A users during the 4-week
diary data collection, 40 incidents (70.18%) showed that they asked fact-finding
questions when looking for quick responses was their primary expectation from others in
online Q&A services. This may signify that when people try to obtain definitive-based
factual information through the question-answering interactions, they tend to look for
quick responses to satisfy their needs in online Q&A services. As definitive-based
information could be provided with certain facts based on a relevant category of question
topics, online Q&A users may believe that concise and informative answers could be
delivered by subject experts in a short period of time after their fact-finding question is
posed in online Q&A services.
The previous study by Choi et al. (2013) also investigated the relationship
between question formulation and how quickly the best answer is arrived, which help to
fulfill an asker’s information needs. The study found that questions that explicitly include
an asker’s expression of rewarding points for the best answer had significant impacts on
receiving the best answer quicker than the questions that do not include an explicit offer
to reward points. Even though this dissertation did not explicitly focus on investigating
question formulation, the findings from the previous study (Choi et al., 2013) signify that
question formulation may affect how well an asker’s expectation of receiving quick
responses could be fulfilled in online Q&A services. Rewarding points and selecting an
answer as a best answer are some of examples of gamifications that may help to improve
the question-answering interactions for online Q&A users to seek and share information.

212
This may indicate that certain gamification-based functionalities of online Q&A services
are strongly associated with fulfillment of expectations with respect to other online Q&A
users’ answers to a question.
Second, looking for accurate information was identified as one of the prominent
expectations with respect to others’ responses when asking a question in online Q&A
services, depending on an asker’s situations in which he or she evaluates answer quality
based on how accurate information is shared by other online Q&A users when asking a
question. As Fichman (2011) argues that accuracy of information is referred to as “the
user’s perception that the information is correct” (p.478), it reflects subjective perception
that an online Q&A user who ask a question determines whether or not answer(s) given
to his or her question is correct enough to satisfy information needs. In other words,
online Q&A users employ their own personal judgment in order to evaluate how accurate
answers are given to their question based on the nature of their motivation and
expectation, as well as their unique contextual situations where they decide to ask a
question to satisfy their needs. Previous studies have focused on information quality by
measuring various perspectives of answers, including accuracy of answers (e.g., Blooma
et al., 2008, 2011; Rieh, 2002). In addition, human judgments were also utilized in order
to employ subjective measure to investigate how accurate information is given to a
question, which fulfills an asker’s satisfaction (Liu, Bian, & Agichtein, 2008).
However, these previous studies may be limited in understanding how an asker
measures the accuracy of the information given in response to their question in online
Q&A services. This is significant because an asker may be only able to judge how well

213
his or her expectation of receiving accurate or complete information is met with answers
provided by other online Q&A users. Additionally, as Shacha (2009) argues, it is unclear
that people may even ascertain whether or not the answers for their question are accurate.
One of the interview participants asked a question about a scientific subject with her
expectation of receiving accurate or complete information. After she received an answer
from other WikiAnswer user and commented about her expectation and the answer.
“I was expecting a very scientific answer that I may have been able to completely
comprehend. Instead, I got a plain, yet informative answer. I am happy with the
results”
This quotation indicates the ways in which an asker’s expectation could be also somehow
fulfilled with answers received to his or her question. In other words, user satisfaction for
answer quality subjectively may reflect fulfillments of his or her expectation based on
how an asker perceives answers for his or her question in online Q&A services.
Finally, online Q&A users prominently look for additional or alternative
information when asking a question to satisfy their needs in online Q&A services. The
grounds for looking for additional or alternative information through the questionanswering interactions for an asker’s needs may be twofold. First is related to the nature
of an asker’s contextual information needs, which attempt to seek diverse answers for his
or her question. For instance, one of the prominent cognitive-based motivational factors
for asking a question is to seek others’ advice or opinions for making decisions. In other
words, people utilize online Q&A services to form discussion-oriented or open-ended
question-answering interactions in order to seek and share a broad array of information,
experiences, or knowledge based on an asker’s needs. The second use is to find

214
alternative information or second thought from other online Q&A users on an asker’s
situations. Online Q&A services may not serve as an asker’s sole information source that
allows him or her to seek information through the question-answering interactions, but
one of many information sources that online Q&A users employ to find satisfactory
information for their needs. In other word, online Q&A users still use other information
sources (e.g., search engines, virtual reference services, etc.) to seek information, while
they may employ online Q&A services to ask a question to find another information for
different purposes. For example, they may first attempt to search information through
search engines (e.g., Bing, Google, Yahoo, etc.), then use their preferred online Q&A
services to ask a question to get alternative information for verifying information
provided from search engines, or view different aspects of an asker’s situations through
responses from other online Q&A users.
6.1.3. Relationship between Motivation and Expectation
The study finally focused on investigating the relationship between motivations
and expectations when people ask a question in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. It
was found that there were dynamic relationships between motivations and expectations
for asking a question in online Q&A services based on an asker’s unique contextual
situation in which different motivational and expectation-based factors take place in an
asker’s questioning behavior in online Q&A services. Six different types of information
seeking were identified based on the relationship between user motivations and
expectations: (1) fast information for needs; (2) additional information for needs; (3)
accurate information for needs; (4) supports for situations; (5) social assurance for

215
confirming ideas; and (6) finding authoritative information for needs. These findings
represent how differently users’ needs are articulated based on their unique contextual
situation in which different favorable expectations would be manipulated to judge answer
quality.
Additionally, even though the survey data analysis indicated that personal and
social integrative needs were statistically correlated with the cognitive-based expectations:
(1) looking for quick responses; (2) looking for additional or alternative information
needs; and (3) looking for accurate or complete information in only WikiAnswers,
analysis of the interview data did not specifically reveal any significant differences in the
relationships between motivations and expectations between Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers. This may signify that how the relationship between motivations and
expectations for asking a question are developed may be not inherent to a specific type of
online Q&A service the users choose to ask a question, but related to an unique
contextual situation in which they are motivated to ask a question to satisfy their needs
with a certain expectation from other users with respect to their answers to a question in
online Q&A environments.
One of the findings in the relationships between motivations and expectations is
that while the data analysis indicated affective needs were predictably correlated to
expectations for social and emotional supports, this motivational factor was also
statistically correlated to other expectations. Especially, the diary analysis also confirmed
that the cognitive-based expectations: (1) looking for quick responses; (2) looking for
additional or alternative information needs; and (3) looking for accurate or complete

216
information, were frequently correlated to affective needs. This indicates that when
online Q&A users receive answers to their question, they may also find socio-affective
supports from such question-answering interactions to receive factual information,
professional advices, or others’ personal experiences or opinions. This is supported by the
findings from the previous research study (Holland, Dukes, & Holahan, 2003), indicating
that people have their high desire to get accurate information from experts in order to
receive social supports for their health related issues.
Moreover, even though looking for trustworthy sources was highly correlated to
cognitive needs, suggesting that people may tend to look for authoritative information to
satisfy their need in a cognitive state (e.g., seeking professional advice, finding objective
information, etc.), people less likely looked for trustworthy sources as their main
expectation to satisfy their needs during the diary data collection; it was found only two
incidents presented the relationship of looking for trustworthy sources with cognitive
needs and one incident for the relationship between affective needs and looking for
trustworthy sources.
“It could be wrong so that's not reliable for facts and for coming to understanding
of certain things.”
“…. I don’t really think that yahoo answers is a good place for validation or
fulfilling some sort of need so I prefer to just use it when I really need an opinion
that ties into something I’m doing or maybe advice from someone who has had
experience so I want something concrete that is usable.”
Even though the previous study confirmed that cognitive authority was a
significant factor to evaluate information quality in the online environments (Rieh, 2002),
people who ask a question in online Q&A do not always perceive the service as a reliable

217
information resource in which trustworthy sources could be given to questions. However,
it was also found that having external links within the content of the answer increases
authoritativeness of information in online Q&A services.
“…. if they can support their information or back it up I actually do appreciate
that because you can’t just add your own information you need factual backup
information good sources to back it up…. some people can answer and not back it
up and it could be a wrong information and not verify and some people do put
external links….”
This may suggest that even though looking for trustworthy sources are not an
askers’ key expectation from others with respect to their answers to a question, they may
be still more likely to evaluate answers with external links as a high quality of
information, which fulfill their needs.
6.1.4. Comparison of Motivation and Expectation
In this dissertation, two different types of online Q&A services were used as the
test beds: (1) Yahoo! Answers, and (2) WikiAnswers, which respectively represent
community-based online Q&A services and collaborative Q&A services. Although there
was no intention to compare these two online Q&A services in this dissertation, analysis
of the data was also focused to examine the extent of differences and similarities in user
motivation and expectation for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.
In terms of motivation for asking a question in Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers, even though analysis of the survey data did not identify a statistical
difference in cognitive needs between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, analysis of the
diary data and interviews found that the Yahoo! Answers participants are more likely to

218
ask opinion- or advice-seeking questions to satisfy their cognitive needs, while the
WikiAnswers participants more likely ask fact-finding questions to satisfy cognitive
needs. This also supports the finding from the previous study (Choi et al., 2012) where
the study found that information-seeking questions soliciting factual information is the
most frequent question type people ask in WikiAnswers, whereas opinion- or adviceseeking questions are the predominant question type in Yahoo! Answers. One possible
explanation of frequency of asking different question types in Yahoo! Answers and
WikiAnswers may be related to the ways of how answers are received to a question in
each online Q&A service. Yahoo! Answers allows users to participate in providing their
own answer in a question-answer thread, which more than one answer could be
potentially delivered by multiple Yahoo! Answers users. Whereas, WikiAnswers users
voluntarily participate in paraphrasing an answer given to an asker’s question, which
indicates that only one answer is ultimately given to a question. Therefore, Yahoo!
Answers users tend to ask either opinion- and/or advice-seeking questions that stimulate
open-ended discussion through the question-answering interactions with others, while
WikiAnswer users may more likely ask fact-finding questions that is deigned to gather a
definitive-based answer, which has little alternative but to provide factual or objective
information.
Additionally, even though analysis of the survey data did not identify a statistical
difference in personal integrative needs between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers,
analysis of the diary data and interviews found that the WikiAnswers participants more
frequently asked a question for satisfying their personal integrative needs, while the

219
Yahoo! Answers participants more frequently asked a question for satisfying their social
integrative needs. This finding infers that Yahoo! Answers may be the more appropriate
place for those who tend to have social interactions or conversations with other people to
seek and share their thoughts or ideas. This may be because potentially diverse answers
by multiple users could be given to a question within a question-answer thread in Yahoo!
Answers, which Yahoo! Answers users have opportunities to initiate social conversations
based on an asker’s question topic. This may be also related to the facts that Yahoo!
Answers users more likely ask opinion- or advice-seeking questions for open-ended
discussions in which interactions with others through the question-answering processes
may be needed. Another possible explanation of higher frequency of social integrative
needs in Yahoo! Answers may be related to question categories where Yahoo! Answers
users intend to share ideas or thoughts on their specific interests. For example, as the
Yahoo! Answer participant indicated, there is a specific sub-category called ‘polls and
surveys’ in Yahoo! Answers where users are able to ask their own conversational
questions (Harper et al., 2009) for finding a basis for conversation and social interaction
in order to satisfy their social integrative needs.
In WikiAnswers, personal integrative needs were identified as one of the frequent
motivational factor, indicating that WikiAnswers users may be motivated to ask a
question for gaining insights into themselves, or reinforcing their personal values by
acquiring information through the question-answering processes. As fact-finding
questions that solicit factual or objective information are the most frequent question type
asked by users in WikiAnswers, it may infer that personal integrative needs may engage

220
WikiAnswers users into the question-answering interactions in which they more likely
look for factual or objective information in order to not only find supports for their own
value by verifying their existing knowledge with an answer given to their question, but
also gain insightful ideas through definitive information in WikiAnswers.
In terms of expectations between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, the
dissertation attempted to investigate the extent of differences in expectations between
Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers because each online Q&A service provides
differentiated features of how answers are given to a question although Yahoo! Answers
and WikiAnswer share the fundamental notion of human information behaviors for
seeking and sharing information, experience, and knowledge for an asker’s information
needs. However, analysis of the data confirmed that there were no significant differences
between Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers. Especially, it was found that people who
use WikiAnswers rated looking for additional information as one of the most prominent
expectations when they ask questions. Because people potentially receive only one
answer, and other WikiAnswers contributors collaboratively paraphrase an answer in
WikiAnswers as opposed to receiving different answers in a question-answer thread in
Yahoo! Answers. However, people commented during the interviews that people usually
receive an email notification each time WikiAnswers contributors add or revise
information in an existing answer, thus they feel like they receive additional information
by each time their answer being paraphrased.
Nonetheless, it was also found from the incident diary analysis that looking for
additional information was identified as more frequent expectation in Yahoo! Answers,

221
while looking for quick responses was more frequent one in WikiAnswers. With analysis
of the interview data, the participants confirmed that they prefer to use Yahoo! Answers
to get more personalized opinions or advice, whereas the WikiAnswers participants
argued that they prefer the site because it provides quick and concise information to their
question. These results may also support that in the diary data collection the social
integrative needs were more frequent motivational factor in Yahoo! Answers, while
personal integrative needs were more frequent motivational factor in WikiAnswers. In
other words, while WikiAnswers users attempt to ask a question in order to satisfy their
personal integrative needs through obtaining concise information for verifying their state
of knowledge, or gaining insights into their personal values, Yahoo! Answers users may
look for additional information through the question-answering interactions with other
users based on an attempt of satisfying their social integrative needs, which indicates that
Yahoo! Answers users may try to find social connections or conversations through asking
and answering questions in Yahoo! Answers.
6.2. Sequential Mixed Method of Analysis
This dissertation proposed mixed method analysis, employing sequentially the
Internet-based survey, diary, and interviews to understand askers’ contextual
backgrounds of asking a question. This section includes the advantages and
disadvantages of each research method employed in the sequential mixed methods in this
dissertation. It also examines how these methods could complement one another for
addressing the research questions in this dissertation.
First, the internet-based survey was conducted for the quantitative data analysis.

222
The main strength of the internet-based survey is that it helped to overview the general
characteristics of online Q&A users, as well as questioning behaviors with emphasis of
their motivation and expectation. Analysis of the survey data allowed the researcher to
not only investigate the prominent motivational and expectation-based factors for asking
a question, but also identify different representative groups based on the survey
participants’ responses, which helped to recruit appropriate participants for the other
methods – diary and interviews in the dissertation. The literature review helped to
identify several motivational and expectation-based factors that allowed the researcher to
investigate a variety of users’ unique contextual backgrounds in their information seeking
behaviors in online Q&A environments.
However, a disadvantage of the Internet-based survey is that this technique is
limited to explore in-depth meanings of why they to ask a question and how they employ
their own personal evaluative criteria to judge information quality, as well as infer such
dynamic changes in user motivation and expectation for asking a question in contexts of
each unique problematic situations behind a questioning behavior. Therefore, analysis of
the interview data provided a complement to the Internet-based survey on a focus of
qualitative approach to explore and understand different incidents of users’ questioning
behaviors and their contexts in online Q&A services.
Second, the diary method was used before conducting the interviews with a group
of the survey participants who represented different cases of user motivation and
expectation. Whereas the findings of the Internet-based survey provided a big picture of
online Q&A users’ questioning behaviors with identifying a broad range of choice in

223
motivation and expectation for asking a question in online Q&A services, the diary
method in this dissertation provided real-time contextual information about the
participants’ motivation and expectation for each time they asked a question in online
Q&A services. Thus, the diary method provided a complement to the interviews in terms
of collecting the recent data about asking a question in online Q&A services, which
helped not to primarily rely on their recalls of previous experiences on asking a question
in Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers.
Finally, the major strength of the interview method is to focus on qualitative
analysis of online Q&A users’ contexts with emphasis on their motivation and
expectation for specific situations where they decided to ask a question in online Q&A
services. Analysis of this method gave the researcher insights into a variety of contexts of
the participants’ information seeking behaviors through the question-answering
interactions. In addition, the interview method complemented the Internet-based survey
since it could be paired with the Internet-based survey in order to gain a better
understanding of perceptions of the question-answering interactions in order to satisfy an
asker’s information needs through the participants’ point of view (Cobb & Hagemaster,
1987). Another advantage of this method in this dissertation is that the interviews helped
to identify the additional findings of how multiple motivations and/or expectations could
be formulated at the same time when the participants ask a question in online Q&A
services, which also helped to identified such dynamic relationships of motivations and
expectations based on each participant’ unique contextual situations within the processes
of his or her information seeking in online Q&A environments.

224
As Sieber (1973) argues, integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches
could be effective not only to develop the research design, but also to help data collection
and analysis in this dissertation. Thus, this type of sequential mixed method that employs
quantitative and qualitative research approaches with conducting the diary method
collecting real-time data to overcome potential issues related with participants’ inaccurate
recall of their previous events would be recommended for those future studies that
attempt to reveal people’ contextual backgrounds and situations behind their information
seeking behaviors in a variety of contexts.
6.3. Limitations of the Research
Despite the findings of user motivations and expectations for asking a question
within a unique context of online Q&A environments, the study also discovered several
limitations. First, the study employed the uses and gratifications theory in order to
investigate different an asker’ needs behind asking a question. To do that, five
motivational factors: (1) cognitive needs; (2) affective needs; (3) personal integrative
needs; (4) social integrative needs; and (5) tension free needs. However, participants
indicated that they were sometimes not sure how their need could be described within of
these five needs. In other words, there could be another contextual situations in which
people have different need for asking a question in online Q&A services.
Similarly, previous research studies in the field of LIS were examined to find six
criteria that people employ to judge information quality in the study: (1) quick responses;
(2) additional or alternative information; (3) accurate or complete information; (4) social
or emotional supports; (5) verification of own belief or knowledge; and (6) trustworthy

225
sources. However, the participants had to choose one of items in these criteria to describe
their expectation each time they ask a question in Yahoo! Answers or WikiAnswers.
Even though the main objective of providing certain criteria was to develop a systemic
standard to measure and investigative user motivations and expectations, it might be
limited to explore different contextual perspectives of an asker’s motivations and
expectations. The qualitative analysis with phone interviews partially helped to identify
the time when the participants had more than one motivational and/or expectation-based
factor. But, it was still based on those preconditioned factors to determine motivations
and expectations in the study.
This concern is related to the second limitation in the methodology used in the
research study. As the above section discussed, the dissertation used mixed methods that
sequentially employed the Internet based survey, diary, and interviews. This
methodology was useful to identify general backgrounds of characteristics of the online
Q&A users, as well as their motivations and expectations, followed by collecting and
analyzing interviews with selected participants in order to explore deeper understandings
of how and why they asked a question at different times to seek contextual information
for an asker’s unique situation. However, different sequential methods could be
conducted to overcome the limitations of selecting motivational and expectation-based
factors. For instance, it would be of value if diary data and interviews were employed
first in order to discover a variety of characteristics of the participants’ motivations and
expectations, followed by identification of mutual themes of these factors in different
times of asking a question among the participant. Then, it would be beneficial to recruit a

226
large number of online Q&A users for the Internet-based survey to perceive how these
findings from the interviews could be generalized. This approach may be useful to
substantiate additional motivations and expectations for asking a question in the context
of online Q&A.

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION
As online Q&A services have rapidly grown in popularity, these unique
information resources have impacted people’s information seeking behaviors in virtual
environments. Yet, fundamental questions of user motivations and expectations for
information seeking in online Q&A services still remain even though numerous previous
research studies have focused on understanding various perspectives of the services.
The study was designed to understand contextual backgrounds of people’s
information seeking by human-to-human interactions, especially with the individuals who
they do not know one another in the online environments. Thus, conceptualizing contexts
and situations of users’ information seeking behaviors within the context of online Q&A
in the study was an endeavor that focuses on developing a more holistic framework of
investigating users’ information needs and information assessments through involving
not only information contents, but also their unique situated contexts in information
seeking.
The results of the study, which employed both quantitative and qualitative data
collection and analysis, revealed a variety of insightful ideas of how online Q&A users
are motivated to ask a question and what they do expect from other online Q&A users for
their question. In this chapter, a discussion of implications proposed based on the
findings in the study is presented, followed by future research studies to expand a scope
of our understandings of user motivations behind asking a question, as well as
expectations towards answers in the online Q&A environments.
7.1. Implications of the Study

228
The study focused on user motivations - why do people visit online Q&A services
to ask a question, as well as expectations - what are the users’ expectations with respect
to the responses to their questions. The study employed the uses and gratification theory
to identify five major needs for using online Q&A to ask a question and examined metaanalysis to develop six expectation-based variables that people use for evaluating
information quality. These findings from the study provide a useful step in a number of
areas of impact, including four implications discussed here, which would help to improve
the experiences of the question-answering interactions in such an unique online
environment: (1) question routing; (2) context sharing; (3) automated question-answering;
and (4) answer quality.
First, question routing could be developed with a better understanding of user
motivations and expectations identified in the study. As the original concept of question
routing is referred to as “routing newly posted questions to potential answerers” (Li et al.,
2011, p.2041), previous studies have focused on how to efficiently identifying subject
experts for routing questions (see Bouguessa et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2005; Pal & Konstan
2010 for examples for identifying experts in the online Q&A environments). However,
Pomerantz et al. (2003) also pointed out the potential developments for routing questions
to not only another systems, but also another individual. Knowing contextual information
of each asker’s need and criteria to measure information quality would be beneficial to
developing more comprehensive systems for routing questions to more suitable online
Q&A service or subject experts based on understanding characteristics of his/her
motivations and expectation for asking a question. For example, the general steps in the

229
model of question routing were investigated in order to examine factors that affect the
triage process when routing questions to another reference service (Pomerantz et al.,
2003). This study identified fifteen factors that may be important to take into account
when routing questions within the triage process. This approach, however, did not
consider users’ unique contextual backgrounds of how and what they seek contextual
information to address his or her unique situation. Thus, it would be valuable if asker’s
needs and expectations are added as factors affecting question routing systems that help
to search either most appropriate online Q&A services and/or answerers who have
expertise in an asker’s topic.
Context sharing is that information seekers attempt to signal their information
need to other people when they seek information (Hsieh et al., 2008). Thus, other people
who may provide information would have a better understanding of a seeker’s
information needs. To apply this conception of context sharing into online Q&A services,
Hsieh (2009) proposed ‘social tags’ to inform an asker’s information need to potential
answerers in online Q&A services. Nonetheless, social tags are not a new feature in the
online environments. Previous research studies have focused on the strengths and
weaknesses of social tags in wide range of topics within different research areas. The
examples include music information retrieval with social tagging (Lamere, 2008), social
tag prediction in social bookmarking (Heyman et al., 2008), and social tag in a search
browser (Kammerer et al., 2009).
In the online Q&A environments, providing users’ motivations and expectations
identified in the study may be beneficial to develop the concept of social tags that provide

230
additional contextual information about why an asker asks a question what he/she looks
for, as well as support answerers’ exploratory search for unanswered questions. In other
words, delivering additional information on an asker’s motivations and expectations
would let users answer a question accordingly through identifying both what an askers’
need is in a unique contextual situation and how they tend to evaluate information quality
(e.g., additional information, quick information, etc.) in online Q&A services.
Third, the findings related to online Q&A users’ motivational and expectationbased factors in the study may be beneficial to develop automated question-answering
systems, which help to identify appropriate answers and automatically provide them to a
question. There have been a rich body of research focusing on developing better systems
of question-answering (Dalmas et al., 2003; Hirschmann et al., 1999; Woods, 1968),
including introducing different extractions to provide multiple answers (Light et al.,
2001; Voorhees et al., 2002), and proposing the new prototypes of the system in order to
measure effective automated question-answering (Hecht et al., 2012; Kim & Kim, 2008).
Since one of the challenges to develop the automated question-answering systems lies in
natural language processes that are required to improve comprehension of such systems,
the findings from the study focusing on online Q&A users’ contexts and situations behind
asking a question may help to implement more semantic aspects of why people ask a
specific question and what they expect from other Q&A users for the answers, and to
identify suitable answers to a question.
Even though a focus of the study was users’ questioning behaviors, this study also
has implication for studying answer quality. A rich body of literature has focused on

231
evaluating answer quality in the field of online Q&A studies (Chen et al., 2010; Harper et
al., 2008, Jeon et al., 2010; Shachaf & Rosenbaum, 2009; Shah and Pomerantz, 2010).
Yet, most studies heavily relied on a content of answer to judge to evaluate
answer quality with little consideration of how an asker intends to evaluate information
given to the question. It was found from literature review that people have different
criteria to judge information quality, and it can be also assumed that these criteria of
evaluating information would be different in each time when people have different
contextual situations to seek information. Therefore, integrating users’ expectation-based
factors that present how they evaluate information quality into other criteria of evaluating
answers quality (e.g., answer content, information sources, etc.) will support to develop
an approach to evaluate information by examining not only how good information is
delivered, but also how well an asker’s expectation is met.
7.2. Suggestions for Future Research
The study provided some exploratory results about askers’ questioning behaviors
with a focus on contextual backgrounds of what motivates people to ask a question to
unknown people in order to seek information to satisfy their needs. In turn, they expect to
receive responses to their question in online Q&A. Even though the findings from this
dissertation may shed light on understandings of seeking contextual information to
address users’ unique situations, more research studies focusing on users’ information
seeking behaviors in such unique context of online Q&A should be continued. Further
study is necessary in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of users’ contextual
information needs and evaluative criteria to judge answer quality for developing better

232
and effective question-answering processes. This indicates that the future studies
focusing on askers’ motivation or information needs behind asking a question in online
Q&A should attempt to explore more diverse contextual backgrounds of their needs
beyond the five motivational factors identified from the theoretical framework of uses
and gratification in the study. Thus, the future studies may include not only askers’
internalized motivational factors influencing online Q&A use for asking a question, but
also other external influential factors that may affect their questioning behaviors.
Additionally, even though the study has mainly focused on askers’ contextual
backgrounds of seeking information to understand their motivations and expectations, it
should be also focused on answerers’ motivations and any other information sharing
behaviors in a wide range of topics or areas in order to thoroughly examine different roles
of users, motivations for seeking and sharing information, and strategies for providing
contextual information and judging information quality in the context of online Q&A.
Therefore, the future studies might consider developing more systematic approaches to
synthesize online information behaviors of both askers and answerers in online Q&A
services, which help to develop better question-answering interactions.
Human-centered research approaches on information seeking behavior have
emphasized situations or contexts behind users’ information needs and seeking in
different information settings. Even though online Q&A services have become in
popularity to seek and share information, the studies of an asker's information needs and
seeking in context within online Q&A environments have been neglected. In the
dissertation, it was found that an asker's questioning behavior in online Q&A services

233
could be initiated in various contexts. In other words, different needs for asking a
question and different expectations towards answers did arise depending on an asker's
such a unique contextual situations of information seeking in online Q&A services. Thus,
an understanding of an asker's information needs and seeking in context could be a
critical endeavor to gain a better understanding of information seeking behavior through
question-answering interactions in online Q&A services.
Human driven online Q&A services such as Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers
provide a unique environment where people are able to seek information through humanto-human interactions. These interactions allow them to seek different forms of
information, ranging from factual information, to personal opinion or advice, to social
supports or interactions without explicitly looking for information. This may indicate that
contexts of information needs and people’s information behavior have become
complicated and could differ, depending on an asker’s situation in online Q&A
servics. Since the dissertation focused on understanding an asker’s different contexts by
analyzing their motivation and expectation, there is hope that the findings may help to
expand our understanding of contexts in people’s information seeking behaviors in
general online environments.
