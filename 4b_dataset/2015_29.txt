In the past fifteen years, there has been a dramatic increase in the availability of
online legal resources and information specifically targeted toward low-income
individuals. A network of statewide legal information websites now plays a central role in
the access to justice movement in the United States. While these websites now exist in
some form throughout this country, it has been more than a decade since they were last
studied in depth. This study uses the perceptions and experiences of individuals involved
in developing, implementing and maintaining statewide legal information websites (the
“Information Providers”) as the primary lens through which to explore how these
websites facilitate self-help users’ access to vital legal information. Three general
research questions guided this study:
RQ1: What are the principal activities that Information Providers engage in with
respect to statewide legal information websites?
RQ2: What are the different ways in which states have approached these
activities?
RQ3: What program development and operational issues have Information
Providers faced?
Data collection involved three interrelated efforts: a pilot case study, an online
survey, and interviews. Themes related to infrastructure, design and implementation
strategies, and operational practices emerged and evolved throughout these data

collection efforts. Key themes include 1) the role of collaboration in several key areas; 2)
barriers to information access faced by target users (and Information Providers’ strategies
to overcome these barriers); and 3) Information Providers’ existing knowledge about
users and site usage.
In terms of policy and practice, the prevailing lack of connection between
Information Providers and their users is perhaps the most significant current challenge.
This lack of connection impedes efforts to conduct meaningful program evaluations, thus
calling into question the ability of Information Providers to demonstrate the effectiveness
of their websites. Thus, this study concludes with a proposed framework for usercentered program evaluation that leverages existing collaborative relationships to provide
Information Providers with the information they need in order to provide effective
assistance to self-help users.

DEDICATION
To Lawrence M. Garten (1952-2006), who gave me this advice when I first started
practicing law: “We learn the most when we do things that make us uncomfortable.”
Little did he know that I would carry his words with me each and every day of my life.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I started the doctoral program in the Fall of 2011 with a clear idea of what I wanted to
study – equitable access to legal information – because of two individuals who showed
me time and time again that there is a “human” side to the law that often gets lost in the
opinions and statutes we read in law school. During the years I spent working alongside
Judge Lawrence F. Rodowsky (Maryland Court of Appeals) and Judge Paul Mannes
(United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland), I saw how they treated
everyone who appeared before them with respect and compassion, taking the time to
make sure that all parties understood what was happening at every stage of the case. And
so the idea of exploring the intersection of access to justice and access to information
took root long before I changed career paths.
The decision to follow a different career path was not an easy one, and there are many
people whose support along the way has been invaluable. Paul Jaeger, my advisor, set
everything in motion. Since I added his Information Policy class at the last minute in the
spring of 2007, Paul has been my teacher, my advisor, my mentor, my co-author, and so
much more. With every challenge I have faced over the past few years, he has helped me
to remain focused on what matters. The words “thank you” are inadequate but they will
have to suffice.
Each member of my committee – John Bertot, Beth St. Jean, Ann Weeks, and Irwin
Morris – has been instrumental in shaping my dissertation. Many thanks to each of them
for their thoughtful comments and questions. This study became a reality because of the
support of Steve Anderson of the Maryland State Law Library, Liz Keith of Pro Bono
Net, and their wonderful colleagues, as well as the legal services providers and librarians
who participated in surveys and interviews. They all inspired me with their passion for
and commitment to their work – it has been a privilege to tell their stories.
I am also indebted to my colleagues at the College of Information Studies and
Information Policy and Access Center – especially Natalie Greene Taylor, Diane Travis,
Liz Larson, Brian Real, Amanda Waugh, Becca Oxley, and Ruth Lincoln. Thank you for
the conversations about research, the impromptu therapy sessions, and – most of all – the
many laughs. The past four years would not have been nearly as enjoyable without all of
you, and I look forward to our paths crossing again in the future.
On a personal note, I am so grateful to family and friends who have helped out in
countless ways over the past few years. I would like to thank my parents, Peter and
Ursula Gorham, for their unwavering love, support, advice and encouragement as I have
found my way in this world. It is, however, my “three boys” to whom I owe the most.
My husband, Tony, had enough faith to take this leap with me (and enough patience to

iii

deal with the moodiness that inevitably accompanies sleep deprivation). My sons, Joseph
and Dillon, were actually the reason that I chose to go back to school at a time when our
lives were already so very full. Neither of them will probably ever fully understand how
much they have taught me about courage and resilience over the past eleven years.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
A. BACKGROUND
Over the past 25 years, the fast-moving expansion of the Internet has produced
unprecedented opportunities for knowledge acquisition in all quarters of American
society. Beyond the invention of new tools and techniques for accessing sources of
information, the quality and quantity of data now available is impacting even casual
Internet users in ways that could not be imagined just one generation ago. While lawyers
and other professionals have developed powerful new resources to guide their work as
experts in their chosen fields, the Internet has produced a counter-force to their efforts –
the rapid development and deployment of self-help applications. Within the legal field,
this development is a direct result of the unavailability of legal services for a large part of
the population. This study addresses the application of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) to help lay persons navigating the legal system on their own,
particularly in circumstances where the lack of financial resources precludes the expert
services of a private sector lawyer. It is an investigation into the new means available for
the acquisition of technical knowledge and skills needed by persons who decide to
advocate for themselves in an unfamiliar and complex legal environment.
The use of ICTs offers a cost-effective way to transform an overburdened system
by turning legal knowledge into online information and tools that are readily accessible
by individuals who face barriers to legal services (Zorza, 2012b). These potentially
transformative technologies, however, could fall short of these aspirations if they do
nothing more than compile vast amounts of information that are indecipherable by – and

1

therefore of little value to – the average self-help user. After all, the value of information
in this context lies in its ability to help people solve a problem. As observed by Scott
(2000),
Information is a step along the way, not a product, People want their problem
solved, they do not want a piece of information. It is not enough to simply provide
web sites with legal information on them, no matter how well the information is
packaged. Information is only of value if it is found, used and understood (p. 28)
In the United States, the impetus for this particular marriage of information,
technology and the law can be traced to an overburdened legal system. The concept of
equal access to justice is generally touted as one of the foundations of the American legal
system, with many people believing it is achievable under most circumstances. In its
most basic form, access to justice refers to “the ability to avail oneself of the various
institutions, governmental and non-governmental, judicial and non-judicial, in which a
claimant might pursue justice” (Galanter, 2009, p. 115). A significant gap, however,
exists between our expressed commitment to this principle and the harsh reality facing
many individuals who struggle to find their way into and through this nation’s legal
system. The civil legal services delivery system in the U.S. is failing for many, as
evidenced by reports that 80% of the civil legal needs of the poor go unmet (Engler,
2011; Houseman, 2001; Landsman, 2009; Legal Services Corporation, 2009; Spieler,
2013).1 This figure stands in sharp contrast to prevailing perceptions about access to
counsel in civil cases, with nearly four out of five Americans erroneously believing that a
right to counsel exists in civil cases and only one-third of Americans believing that lowincome individuals would have difficulty obtaining legal assistance (Rhode, 2004).

For a comprehensive overview of the current legal services delivery system in the United States
(as well as in each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia), see Sandefur and Smyth
(2011).

At the root of this crisis is what has been termed a supply and demand problem
(Legal Services Corporation, 2012; Morris, 2013). The Legal Services Corporation
(LSC), an independent nonprofit corporation, was established by the United States
Congress in 1974. As the successor to an Office of Economic Opportunity program
financed through War on Poverty legislation in the 1960s, it is the largest funder of civil
legal services in America, distributing grants through a competitive process to various
organizations that provide legal services to low-income populations and monitoring the
organizations’ use of these funds (Johnstone, 2011). LSC grantees generally provide legal
services in the areas of family law (e.g., divorce, custody, and domestic violence),
housing, and consumer issues (Staudt, 2009).
Although Congress has appropriated $300-$400 million to LSC on an annual
basis, LSC has never been able to fully achieve its goals due to inadequate resources. It
was initially the beneficiary of steady increases in federal funding, with its budget
growing to $321 million within the first five years of its existence (Johnson, 2009). Since
then, however, LSC has experienced repeated and significant budget cuts (Smith &
Stratford, 2012), never returning to its earliest funding levels in real, inflation-adjusted
dollars (Johnson, 2009). In fact, when inflation is taken into account, LSC funding has
dropped by one-third over the past fifteen years (Rhode & Bam, 2012). During the 1990s,
these budgetary cuts were also coupled with reform efforts that led to restrictions in terms
of the clients that LSC-funded organizations could serve and the types of cases they could
take (Rhode, 2009).
Notwithstanding LSC’s restricted operations in an increasingly constrained
resource environment, nearly one in five Americans now qualifies for LSC-funded legal

3

assistance (LSC, 2012). In general, the maximum income level for legal aid eligibility is
125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines promulgated by the Department of Health and
Human Services (Legal Services Corporation 2014 Income Guidelines). As a result, a
household with four members in the continental United States must have its total income
below $29,813 in order to qualify for legal aid assistance.
At the same time, a growing number of eligible individuals need legal assistance
due to rising rates of foreclosures, bankruptcies and unemployment in the wake of the
recent global recession, as well as to regulatory changes in government benefit programs,
such as Social Security, Medicaid, and public housing (Cohen, 2013; Jefferson, 2013;
Johnstone, 2011; Rhode & Bam, 2012; Staudt, 2013). This growth in demand for services
– coupled with the pressure of diminishing resources – has placed the legal services
community in an untenable position. Both the percentage of attorneys providing civil
legal services (less than 1% of U.S. attorneys) and the budgets for which these attorneys
work (less than one-half of 1% of total expenditures on attorneys in the U.S.) are small
fractions of what is required to meet current demand (Johnson, 2009; Rhode, 2004). As a
result, at least 50% of eligible individuals who seek assistance from LSC-funded
organizations are currently being turned away (LSC, 2012).
The end result is a persistent “justice gap”, defined by LSC as the “difference
between the current level of legal assistance and the level which is necessary to meet the
needs of low-income Americans” (LSC, 2007, p.1)2. LSC-funded organizations continue
While this definition of the “justice gap” is the one most frequently used throughout the literature, it
should be noted that other legal scholars and practitioners have raised questions about certain terms
contained therein. Rhodes (2009) and Haddon (2014), by way of example, emphasize that the justice
gap increasingly includes individuals of moderate income, and Kritzer (2009) calls into question
conventional notions about what constitutes “unmet legal needs” (i.e., not every problem with a legal
dimension merits a legal professional’s help. These variations in how we define the “justice gap”
suggest differences in how we define the underlying problem – Are we only concerned with low2

4

to face bleak budgetary situations and, to date, efforts by the private bar have not been
successful in narrowing this gap (Rhode, 2009; Zorza, 2012b). The funding situation is
further aggravated by the absence of political clout on the part of individuals with civil
legal needs who cannot afford counsel, due largely to the lack of any cohesive group
identity (Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007).
To compensate for reduced funding from LSC, many states have identified
alternative sources of funding, including Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (IOLTA)
programs and private organizations (Johnson, 2009; Rhode, 2009). Despite this influx of
funding from other sources, the justice gap lingers, leading two leading legal scholars to
declare that
“Equal Justice Under Law” is one of America’s most widely embraced and
frequently violated legal principles. It appears over countless courthouse doors
but by no means describes what goes on behind them. It is a shameful irony that
the nation with the world’s highest concentration of lawyers does so little to make
them accessible to those who need them most (Rhode & Bam, 2012, p. 3).

A dichotomy in legal practice is now emerging wherein there is too little litigation by
those with valid legal claims but without the financial means to obtain counsel, and too
much litigation by those with the financial means to pursue frivolous claims (Glater,
2006). In 2001, Berenson noted that the majority of Americans – those who fall between
the poorest 20% of the population (who qualify for legal aid) and the richest 10% (who
can afford to pay for legal representation) – have unmet legal needs. Furthermore, recent
statistics indicating that from 40%-60% of the legal needs of middle-income individuals
go unmet shed light on another rarely acknowledged facet of the justice gap (Landsman,
2009; National Center for State Courts [NCSC], 2006; Spieler, 2013).
income individuals? Should we prioritize certain legal needs over others? These questions, while
relevant to discussions about the purpose of statewide legal information websites, are beyond the
scope of the current study.

Neither the existence of the justice gap, as reflected in the foregoing statistics, nor
efforts to overcome this societal problem are a new phenomenon. The concept of access
to justice began to gain traction in the late 1970s (Galanter, 2009) but misperceptions
about the availability of counsel in civil cases (as noted above) and growing discontent
with the litigious nature of American society precluded the plight of Americans with
unmet legal needs from garnering widespread attention (Rhode & Bam, 2012). The
landscape began to shift with the formation of statewide bodies to address access to
justice issues, a development that paved the way for the justice gap to be defined as a
problem in need of workable solutions (Rhode, 2009).
Although these task forces and commissions were initially concerned primarily
with legal aid funding issues, their missions are increasingly encompassing broader
access to justice issues (Zorza, 2009a). Statewide access to justice bodies are a means to
bring together different stakeholders (e.g., courts, bar associations, legal aid
organizations) to address issues that impact each of them (Self-Represented Litigation
Network [SRLN], 2008). The ability of the various stakeholders to work together,
however, can be hampered by their differing concerns, which often translates into
different research and policy priorities: “To take only the most obvious example, the
organized bar has a much stronger economic interest in promoting lawyers’ services than
in promoting research and policies that support greater reliance on qualified non-lawyers
and procedural simplification” (Rhode, 2013, p. 533).
These differences are but one factor contributing to the current lack of consensus
within the legal community regarding both the definition of the problem and the viability
of the various solutions that have been proposed. In order to define the problem, it is first

6

necessary to transform the rhetoric of “equal access to justice” into something upon
which we can act. However, as described by Rhode (2013) and Wolf (2012), the
vagueness of the term itself can pose problems. For example, does it encompass fair legal
processes and just outcomes? Despite such reservations, a range of initiatives that
embrace four main targets for action have emerged:


Access to justice equals access to counsel. Support for the establishment of a
civil right to counsel (referred to as “civil Gideon”3) grew in tandem with the
legal community’s increased scrutiny of the justice gap (Engler, 2006, 2010;
Gardner, 2006; Lidman, 2005). In recent years, bar associations and statewide
access to justice bodies have voiced their support for an American Bar
Association (ABA) resolution that calls for the provision of counsel, at public
expense, to low-income individuals in certain civil cases where basic human
needs (e.g., safety, shelter) are at stake (Engler, 2010). As civil Gideon remains an
unrealized aspiration, more limited initiatives – such as increased funding of legal
services providers and enhanced pro bono requirements – are championed as an
acceptable alternative for the time being. Critics of this approach, however,
suggest that such initiatives fail to alleviate the burdens of the vast majority of
low-income individuals with unmet legal needs, therefore doing little to advance
the cause of equal justice (Pearce, 2004).



The availability of different types of limited assistance is sufficient to ensure
access to justice. This category encompasses services for self-help users with
traditional means (e.g., in-person assistance), through emerging ICTs (e.g.,
hotlines, legal information websites), and by the use of limited representation
(often referred to as unbundled legal services) (Hilbert, 2009; Jennings & Greiner,
2012; Struffolino, 2012; Zorza, 2010). The latter is typically described “as a
system in which a client can choose from an ‘a la carte’ menu of attorney services
and can hire an attorney to assist with particular elements of a case when full
representation is either undesired or unaffordable” (Steinberg, 2011, p. 461).



Appropriate judicial engagement is a key component of access to justice. The
existence of a relationship between the public’s trust and confidence in the court
system and the manner in which courts treat litigants proceeding without counsel

In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, under the
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, state courts are required to provide defense
attorneys to indigent criminal defendants.

(often referred to as “self-represented litigants”) necessitates a closer examination
of the court’s interactions with this group of litigants (George & Wang, 2008;
Greacen, 2005; Staudt & Hannaford, 2002; Steinberg, 2011; Udell & Diller, 2007;
Zorza, 2007). The creation of a court culture that encourages respect for selfrepresented litigants, encompassing everyone from judges to clerk’s office
personnel to self-help center staff, is central to this approach (Goldschmidt, 2008;
Judicial Council of California, 2007; Zorza, 2004). Judicial buy-in, in particular,
is important – judges have the credibility, reputation, and leverage needed to bring
about cultural change within a court system (Engler, 2011). In the spirit of
enhanced judicial engagement, many courts have adopted a bifurcated approach
that allows them to focus on the substance (rather than the form) of filings by selfrepresented litigants. This approach, commonly referred to as the “liberal
construction rule,” applies “hard” procedural bars (e.g., statutes of limitations,
time for filing appeals) but a less rigorous standard of review to the form and
content of the documents submitted by self-represented litigants (Albrecht,
Greacen, Hough & Zorza, 2003; Buhai, 2009; Goldschmidt, 2008; Gray, 2007;
Landsman, 2009; Schneider, 2011).


System-level reform is needed to ensure access to justice. Calls to reform the
judicial system are quite varied, ranging from the increased use of alternative
dispute resolution mechanisms (Brodoff, McClellan & Anderson, 2003; Galanter,
2009) to the expansion of small claims courts to provide a venue where low and
moderate income individuals could bring claims that otherwise would be
economically unfeasible to pursue (Finney & Yanovich, 2006).

Within the access to justice community, many of these initiatives are viewed as
complementary to one another (Engler, 2011). As noted by Zorza (2013), self-help
services and unbundling services can function in a coordinated manner, as the former
enables an individual to take on tasks that are outside the scope of the agreed upon
limited representation. Together, these strategies decrease the burden on legal services
providers, who are then able to focus their efforts on those who have the greatest need for
counsel.
In the past fifteen years, there has been a dramatic increase in the availability of
online legal resources and information specifically targeted toward low-income

8

individuals (Cabral et al., 2012). Legal services and court websites now function as
primary mechanisms for delivering information to self-help users about their legal rights,
as well as about legal processes, courtroom procedures, and appropriate forms (Greacen
& Jones, 2013). As articulated by the Washington State Access to Justice Board in its
Access to Justice Technology Principles (2004):
Access to justice requires that the public have available understandable
information about the justice system, its resources, and means of access. The
justice system should promote ongoing public knowledge and understanding of
the tools afforded by technology to access justice by developing and
disseminating information and materials as broadly as possible in forms and by
means that can reach the largest possible number and variety of people.
The stark reality and consequences of the justice gap are now making self-help
services and resources a desired component of many access to justice initiatives, while
advancements in technology are making them available to greater numbers of individuals
with legal needs. Legal scholars and practitioners alike have become increasingly focused
on the practical implications of providing services to self-help users.4 Pertinent
observations include:


“[T]he deployment and encouragement of self-help legal services necessarily
raises an important if not central question about consumers' capacity to participate
in their own legal service delivery. 'Capacity' here relates to factors such as

The users of self-help services and resources are often referred to as pro se or self-represented
litigants, as evidenced by the use of that term throughout the literature discussed in Chapter 2.
The State Justice Institute defines a self-represented litigant as “[a] person (party) who advocates
on his or her own behalf before a court, rather than being represented by an attorney” (2014).
However, many individuals with legal needs never officially enter the legal system (Morris,
2013). In 2013, Sandefur conducted a study of the civil justice experiences of the American
public, finding that two-thirds of the sample experienced at least one civil justice situation
(related to, e.g., housing, employment, money, or insurance) in the preceding eighteen months
(Sandefur, 2014). But, because these individuals rarely turn to lawyers or courts for help in
handling these situations, they never become self-represented litigants. For that reason, this study
generally adopts Morris’s use of the term “self-help user” (p. 170). Many of the survey
respondents and interviewees, however, use the term “self-represented litigant;” thus, that term
appears frequently in direct quotes provided in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.

willingness to participate, ability to participate, and availability of resources (such
as time)” (Giddings & Robertson, 2003, p. 109).


Self-help services raise the related question of the extent to which self-help users’
capacity impacts their ability to achieve the desired legal outcome (Cantrell, 2002;
Smith & Stratford, 2012).



Self-help services focus on “reach” rather than “richness,” providing a limited
amount of assistance to a greater number of individuals than could be served by
one-on-one assistance (Berenson, 2001; Clarke & Borys, 2011; Johnson, 2009).



Self-help services, in many cases, represent an extension of traditional programs
(e.g., legal clinics) designed to close the justice gap (Aaron, 2012; Flaherty, 2002;
Gordon, 2001; Henderson, 2003; Houseman, 2001; Ledray, 2013; NCSC, 2006,
2012; Owens, 2013; Rhode & Bam, 2012; Wolf, 2012; Zorza, 2012b).



The reach of technology-based programs is already considerable, with LSC
estimating that almost 21 million people have received assistance through them,
as compared to the 7 million that received in-person assistance from LSC-funded
legal aid organizations (Zorza, 2012b).

Statewide legal information websites, as one of many technology-based self-help services
that have emerged in recent years, seek to address self-help users’ need for legal
information that facilitates problem-solving.
B. STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM
Although the development of technology-based self-help initiatives only dates
back to the turn of this century, statewide legal information websites now exist in some
form throughout the United States. These websites serve persons who represent
themselves in court and at regulatory hearings, as well as the larger universe of self-help

10

users. To date, however, there has been minimal investment in efforts to understand what
is actually taking place within website operations across the country. To fully
comprehend the role that statewide legal information websites play within the broader
access to justice movement, it is necessary to open up the “black box” underlying their
Internet presence. Thus, drawing upon the experiences of individuals who have been
involved in the development, implementation, and operation of these websites (the
“Information Providers”), this study sought to identify not only the different issues and
challenges Information Providers face but also how they work to address those issues and
challenges.
The network of statewide legal information websites that spans the 50 states, the
District of Columbia, and several U.S. territories is a direct result of LSC’s Technology
Initiative Grant (TIG) program (Aaron, 2012; Cabral et al., 2012; Hornsby, 2010; Morris,
2013; Owens, 2013; Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007; Staudt, 2005, 2009; Zorza, 2012b).
Among the requirements set forth by LSC has been the development of a website
intended for use by the public, as well as sites for advocates and pro bono attorneys. 5
Through the provision of funding and support needed to make these services operational,
the TIG program has also been credited with helping courts to work around institutional
barriers (e.g., limited funding; infrastructural elements not conducive to change) and
make progress toward fulfilling their access to justice mandates (Staudt, 2005). As one
observer commented:
While this technology project sounds a bit prosaic, even boring, the creation of a
single authentic LSC backed legal aid Web site for each and every state had
profound implications. By funding statewide Web sites, [the] TIG program
ensured that in each state, there was one location on the Internet where the public
5

The present study focused exclusively on websites intended for the general public.

11

could find authentic legal information and ultimately legal services …. The
program officers of LSC kept the costs of these statewide sites down, and
established a floor of quality and service by insisting that most states use one of
two templates for the statewide Web site … These statewide sites are now a
fixture of the national legal aid infrastructure.” (Staudt, 2009, p. 109-110)
The two templates referenced by Staudt were created by Pro Bono Net and Kaivo
Software.


Pro Bono Net is a national nonprofit organization that partners with nonprofit
legal organizations throughout the U.S. and Canada to increase access to justice
for poor and moderate-income individuals. Statewide legal information websites
that use the LawHelp template are hosted by Pro Bono Net, enabling states to
focus on content development and management, rather than on software and
hardware issues. The template complies with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1998 and has undergone extensive usability testing. The
LawHelp template is flexible and customizable, providing for the incorporation of
document assembly functions, multi-media materials, and XML. As noted in a
2007 report, however, there are limits to its customizability as “all changes to the
platform must flow through Pro Bono Net and will affect all users collectively”
(Weber, 2007, p. 8)



Kaivo Software developed the Open Source Component Framework template for
use by TIG program grantees. The template permitted states to build a website
that addressed their specific needs in terms of content and navigation while
incorporating features (such as an event calendar) that were developed to be
modular and reusable. For states using the Open Source Component Framework,
it was suggested that they have an internal web service infrastructure sufficient to
host the site (or a hosting agreement with an external internet service provider)
and sufficient expertise (or the capability to acquire such expertise) to maintain
and enhance the site at low cost.
Since its inception in 2000, 570 grants totaling more than $46 million have been

awarded through the TIG program. TIG funding has fluctuated over the years, ranging
from a high of $7 million in 2001 to a low of $1.2 million in 2006 (Staudt, 2009). Since
2011, however, TIG program funding has remained relatively steady in the range of $3.2$3.4 million (LSC, n.d., “LSC Funding”). Increasingly, the TIG program is funding

12

projects that have no relationship with statewide legal information websites. In 2012, for
example, Colorado Legal Services received approximately $44,000 to develop a mobile
application to help attorneys sign up for volunteer assignments and the Legal Assistance
of Western New York, Inc. received approximately $74,000 for an initiative that will
provide the means for Social Security Administration hearings to be held via
videoconference ( LSC, n.d., “2012 TIG project descriptions”). Other TIG projects focus
on integrating the statewide legal information website into other online services offered
by the grantee organization. In any event, by 2003, it was evident that the long-term
sustainability of the websites was dependent on the acquisition of additional sources of
funding, due to a range of maintenance costs. These costs include software fees as well as
staff to develop website content, build support for stakeholder relationships, and engage
in marketing activities (Melton, Snider & Zorza, 2005).
In the years since LSC first provided funding through the TIG program, the
network of statewide legal information websites has evolved dramatically, as states have
adopted unique approaches to both development and implementation, leading to
significant variation in terms of operation, design, and content. Despite fluctuations in
funding, many statewide legal information websites have become an integral part of their
states’ access to justice strategies, evolving from primarily static collections of resources
(often electronic versions of print materials) and basic links, into dynamic websites that
often incorporate automated legal form and document preparation systems, such as A2J
Guided Interviews6 and the Interactive Community Assistance Network (“I-CAN!”)7. A

Developed in 2005 by the Center for Access to Justice and Technology at Chicago-Kent College
of Law and the Center for Computer-Assisted Legal Instruction (CALI), A2J Guided Interviews
employs HotDocs document assembly software to build a form based on the user’s answers,

growing number of sites now offer remote assistance capabilities, such as instant
messaging programs that put self-help users in contact with trained specialists (Aaron,
2012; Cabral et al., 2012; Johnson, 2009; Morris, 2013; NCSC, 2006; Rhode & Bam,
2012; Staudt, 2009; Widdison, 2013; Wolf, 2012; Zorza, 2009b). Given the intensive
development now taking place on the technological side of statewide legal information
websites, it is important to ask whether these advances are contributing to the creation of
websites that meet the needs of users.
C. RATIONALE FOR PROBLEM CHOICE
In December 2013, LSC issued a report detailing findings from the Summit on the
Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice. The Summit brought together 75 leaders
from all parts of the access to justice community (e.g., legal services, courts, libraries,
and academia). Participants of the Summit commenced work on a strategy for the
creation of an integrated legal services delivery system,8 a key component of which is a
statewide access portal that will use an automated triage process to guide individuals in
need of legal assistance to appropriate information and services. The report envisions that
existing statewide legal information websites will serve as the building blocks for these
portals. In developing this strategy, the Summit participants were guided by the
following mission:
utilizing one of the approximate 2,300 templates stored on the national LawHelp Interactive
(LHI) server (Cabral et al., 2012).
7

Since the program was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, seven states have
adopted it and almost 200,000 pleadings have been uploaded. This system is explicitly designed
for individuals with limited computer experience and literacy skills (e.g., employing audio
prompts for each question).
8

The other enumerated components of the strategy are document assembly, mobile technologies,
business process analysis, and expert systems.

14

To explore the potential of technology to move the United States toward
providing some form of effective assistance to 100% of persons otherwise unable
to afford an attorney for dealing with essential civil legal needs (p. 1).
Given the momentum that is beginning to build around realizing the vision for an
integrated legal service delivery system, the stage is set to examine how statewide legal
information websites are contributing to the realization of this vision.
In general, however, research in the area of legal services in the United States has
long been the subject of sharp criticism. Rhode (2013) offers the following description of
the current state of affairs:
American legal aid lacks independent, well-developed research capacities. The
Legal Services Corporation’s Research Institute lost funding in the 1980s and has
never been reestablished. Decision making often proceeds without reliable
information about the amount, type, and funding of services provided, the
dimensions and drivers of unmet needs and the relative effectiveness of different
delivery models along multiple dimensions. Although we do not lack for studies
on certain topics, much of the data we have is too limited in scope and
methodology to supply a rational basis for policy making. And much of what we
know is not presented or disseminated in ways that adequately inform delivery
structures or political debates about subsidized legal services” (p. 533).
Charn and Selbin (2013) offer a similar assessment, noting that there has been
insufficient empirical study of both demand side issues (e.g., consumer needs, user
preferences, and problem-solving behaviors) and supply side issues (e.g., funding,
services, quality, outcomes, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness). In recent years, critics
have increasingly focused on the lack of studies that examine the outcomes of access to
justice initiatives (Birnbaum & Bala, 2012; Buhai, 2009; Rhode & Bam, 2012; Smith &
Stratford, 2012; Steinberg, 2011). The lack of outcome data, it is argued, leads to an
insufficient understanding of the efficacy of existing programs (Cantrell, 2002; Selbin,
Charn, Alfieri & Wizner, 2012; Smith, 2013). The absence of evaluative efforts has
become increasingly problematic as, in the current policy environment, service providers

15

are increasingly called upon to demonstrate the effectiveness of what they are doing to
funding entities, decision-makers, and the public (Aaron, 2012; Selbin et al., 2012).
Rather than utilizing empirical methodologies typically employed in the social sciences
for purposes of evaluation, however, policy decisions in the legal services realm typically
rely heavily on anecdotal evidence focused on the success of individual programs
(Cantrell, 2002; Engler, 2010). Sound resource allocation decisions, however, based upon
accurate information about the utility of different access to justice initiatives are essential
(Abel, 2009; Blasi, 2004; Engler, 2010).
The recently released President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2016 offers evidence of
growing awareness of the need for civil legal research. In addition to requesting $2.7
million for research on civil justice issues, the President is also requesting $5 million for
a Civil Legal Aid Competitive Grant Program that “will provide funding, training, and
technical assistance to incentivize civil legal aid planning processes and system
improvements, as well as research that supports innovative efforts to improve civil legal
assistance services at the state, local, and tribal levels” (United States Department of
Justice, 2015, p. 16). Each project funded through this project would have to meet
certain evaluation requirements, furthering “the Administration’s efforts to use evidencebased decision-making to improve results” (p. 246). In a recent blog entry, access to
justice scholar Richard Zorza opined that, notwithstanding the fact that these proposals
are not likely to succeed at this time, they are laying the groundwork for change in
coming years (Zorza, 2015).
As might be expected, much of the legal services research conducted has focused
on the impact of practitioner representation, with comparatively less attention paid to

16

legal self-help services (Rhode, 2013). The appeal of self-help services and other forms
of limited assistance is clear – they allow more individuals to benefit from some level of
legal assistance. But, as the initial focus has been largely on making these services
available, the legal community has only begun to examine whether these services are
actually meeting the needs of self-help users or are merely deemed acceptable due to the
unavailability of representation to all who need it (Selbin et al., 2012). As articulated by
Abel (2012),
The spectrum of self-help services is a necessary innovation in light of the
extreme shortage of counsel for low-income communities. At the same time, we
lack an evidence base to determine the scope and efficacy of self-help services.
Some worry that self-help services will provide the appearance of a solution to the
pro se crisis when in fact pro se litigants still cannot effectively assert their claims
(p. 812).
Increases in the number of self-help users, and the attendant increase in programs to serve
this population, has led to calls for more intensive study of both the user population and
the programs now in place (Albiston & Sandefur, 2013). To date, however, these calls
have remained largely unanswered.
The need for research focused on statewide legal information websites is greater
than ever given the central role that these initiatives are expected to play in the delivery
of legal services in the future. These websites, as characterized by Staudt (2010), can be
the “foundational building blocks for transformational delivery changes” (p. 110). This
assessment appears to have merit in light of the strategy developed at the LSC Summit
calling upon integrated statewide portals to be built upon existing statewide legal
information websites. If, however, these websites are to serve as the proverbial giant
upon whose shoulders a future legal services delivery system will be built, research that

17

enhances understanding about the existing network of statewide legal information
websites is essential.
This study is itself a building block for a comprehensive research agenda. The
recent focus on measuring effectiveness is valid, given the growing emphasis on
outcomes in the policy arena. But, before one can measure outcomes and impacts of a
service effort, it is essential to understand the different components of these initiatives.
[T]o consider only questions of program outcomes may limit the usefulness of an
evaluation. Suppose evaluation data suggest emphatically that the program was a
success. You can say, “It worked”! But unless you have taken care to describe the
details of the program’s operations, you may be unable to answer a question that
logically follows such a judgment of success: “What worked?” If you cannot
answer that, you will have wasted effort measuring the outcomes of events that
cannot be described and therefore remain a mystery. Unless the programmatic
black box is opened and its activities made explicit, the evaluation may be unable
to identify strengths or suggest appropriate changes (King, Morris, Fitz-Gibbon,
1987).
Thus, efforts to determine if statewide legal information websites provide effective
assistance will remain dependent upon anecdotal stories if there exists just a limited
understanding about the different pieces that come together in the creation and
implementation of these websites. Without a more complete understanding of what has
taken place, those working on the next generation of technology-based self-help legal
services will not be able to benefit fully from the experiences of their predecessors,
thereby severely limiting the practical impact of research going forward.
This study aimed to open up the “black box” of statewide legal information
websites, while highlighting both the commonalities and differences among the
approaches adopted by states. By honing in on a particular group of initiatives that has
been recognized as essential but has not served as the subject of an in-depth study in over

18

10 years, it makes a valuable contribution to a body of research that seeks to improve the
plight of low-income individuals with unmet legal needs. The perspectives of experts in
this area – the Information Providers – served as the primary lens through which to
understand how statewide legal information websites facilitate the access of self-help
users, including self-represented litigants, to vital legal information. The study therefore
was guided by the following general research questions:
RQ1: What are the principal activities that Information Providers engage in with
respect to statewide legal information websites?
RQ2: What are the different ways in which states have approached these
activities?
RQ3: What program development and operational issues have Information
Providers faced?
In order to extract a sufficient amount of data for analysis, the research involved a series
of interrelated data collection efforts, consisting of a pilot case study, a survey of
Information Providers, and follow-up interviews with survey respondents and other
Information Providers. Themes identified in the pilot case study, together with a
theoretical framework developed by Detlor, Hupfer, and Ruhi (2010) within the egovernment literature, guided the development of survey and interview questions.
Specifically, the data collection efforts were designed to learn more about:


The legal information and services currently being provided by Information
Providers to benefit self-help users;



Information Providers’ understanding of target users’ information needs and the
barriers they face in accessing information via statewide legal information
websites;



Information Providers’ knowledge regarding actual users; and

19



The practices and strategies employed by Information Providers to compile and
present information that they believe is needed by their users.

Inasmuch as experiences of Information Providers lie at the center of this study, questions
in the survey as well as in interviews asked them to serve as “surrogates” for website
users so as to promote discussion of user needs. While this information may be limited in
accuracy, it is a useful introduction to the identification of potential gaps between
information sources in place and the information actually needed by users. A limited
evaluation of a select number of websites provided additional insight into these potential
gaps.
D. IMPLICATIONS OF STUDY
This study has immediate implications for both practice and policy. Currently,
knowledge tends to be very fragmented among legal services providers, as the demands
of their day-to-day professional responsibilities take precedence over growing a
community knowledge base. By bringing together the perspectives and experiences of a
wide range of Information Providers, this study encourages the entire community of
Information Providers to think critically about their current practices and operations.
While it does not identify best practices, it does offer insight into how different
Information Providers have chosen to address common challenges and issues, potentially
suggesting courses of action not yet considered. This study also lays the groundwork for
future policy research in this area. Once we understand what lies within a program’s
“black box,” we can move on to the questions of effectiveness with which the legal
services community is primary concerned.

20

The insights gathered from Information Providers, however, will have
implications beyond the narrow realm of statewide legal information websites in two
important ways. These websites are but one tool with which legal services providers are
currently working to reach a greater number of self-help users. The modes of service
delivery may differ but central to all of these initiatives is a commitment to understanding
what self-help users need and then using available resources to best meet these needs. By
exploring the paths that different statewide legal information websites have taken to reach
this understanding, this study focused not on the technology per se but rather on the role
that technology has played in enabling legal services providers to connect with self-help
users. Given the commonalities that exist, study findings will be of value to those
working on more “traditional” programs (e.g., in-person self-help centers) as well as
other technology-enabled self-help services (e.g., initiatives to assist self-help users in
navigating courts’ electronic filing systems).
In addition to being a subset of access to justice initiatives, statewide legal
information websites can also be viewed as part of a larger universe of services that
government and community organizations now make available through various
information technologies. This universe is vast, including large-scale initiatives seeking
to reach a wide range of users (e.g., Healthcare.gov) as well as the efforts of community
organizations to meet the needs of a specific audience (e.g., domestic violence survivors,
returning veterans). As with statewide legal information websites, the primary users of
many of these services may face one or more barriers in their attempts to access
information or complete a transaction. From the service providers’ perspectives, there are
similarities as well – often, they must provide both legal information and practical “how-

21

to” information in a manner that guides their target users through a problem-solving
process.
Citizen and immigration services offer one example of how connecting
disadvantaged populations to a blend of legal information, social services, and
government services can present challenges to both providers and users. Individuals
seeking to become U.S. citizens need to understand the procedural elements of the
naturalization process (e.g., what documents to file and when to file them) while also
undertaking preparations for the naturalization test. Limited English language
proficiency, as well as limited experience with computers and/or the Internet, may
hamper their ability to address these different issues. In addition to the United States
Citizenship and Immigration Service, community organizations and libraries play a vital
role in meeting the needs of this population, through initiatives such as the offering of
English as a Second Language classes and the provision of affordable legal advice from
reputable and experienced attorneys (Gorham, Bertot, Jaeger & Taylor, 2013; Jaeger,
Gorham, Bertot & Sarin, 2014).
Each of these entities – the government agencies as well as the providers of legal
and social services – is part of this larger universe in which statewide legal information
websites operate. And, as an increasing number of these entities are relying upon ICTs to
extend their reach, they too are facing questions regarding the effectiveness of their
chosen means to deliver information and services. Within the area of e-government
services, for example, there are increased calls for “citizen-centered e-government.”
Central to this concept is a “commitment, a desire to measure service quality, and a
willingness to implement the lessons learned” on the part of government agencies (Bertot

22

& Jaeger, p. 153). Among the most important lessons to be learned are those that pertain
to how organizations can connect with those users facing the most pernicious barriers as
they strive to access much-needed information resources and services. Ultimately, this
study yielded lessons of that very nature.
The goal of Chapter 2 therefore is to demonstrate how statewide legal information
websites fit within both the realm of access to justice initiatives, as well as within the
larger realm of government and social services. The review of the literature spans sociolegal studies and information studies, emphasizing the extent to which each field
contributes to an understanding of the problem and identification of relevant issues.
Chapter 3 outlines the study design, linking this research to key studies identified in the
literature. A description of the three stages of the study is provided, highlighting the
complementary nature of the data collection efforts. Chapter 3 concludes with a brief
discussion of the limitations, goals, and outcomes of the study. Chapters 4, 5, and 6
summarize findings from the pilot case study, the online survey, and the interviews,
respectively. The evolution of key themes links the analysis in each of these chapters
together. Chapter 7 then brings these key themes together, offering a discussion of how
the current situations in which statewide legal information websites reside (both
infrastructure elements and the external environment) impact current and future practices.
Chapter 8 further explores these impacts, offering policy recommendations that address
current challenges facing Information Providers. These recommendations, which coalesce
around a call for user-centered program evaluations, highlight the need for further
research and several possible avenues for future exploration are presented.

CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
This chapter provides a review of four areas of research pertinent to this study:


The connection between increasing rates of self-representation and the growth
of legal self-help services;



The general development, implementation, and empirical examination of legal
self-help programs;



The development, implementation, and empirical examination of technologybased legal self-help services; and



The provision of information to underserved populations.

Given the lack of in-depth research into statewide legal information websites, it is
necessary to draw upon work done in the areas of information studies and e-government
to better frame the discussion on the information needs of users and the barriers users
face in meeting these needs. These four strands of research, taken together, place this
study within the broader context of the access to justice research agenda, while also
demonstrating how e-government and information studies research can offer different
approaches to studying online legal self-help services.
A. INCREASE IN SELF-REPRESENTATION, INCREASE IN LEGAL SELF-HELP SERVICES
A.1. The Phenomenon of Self-Representation
The right to be heard, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, lays the foundation
for the right of self-representation. Initially codified by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and
later in 28 U.S.C. § 1654 (1994), the right to represent one’s self in court proceedings is a
defining characteristic of the American legal system (Schwarz, 2004; Swank, 2004).

24

Underlying this right is the belief that “all individuals, no matter their status or wealth,
are entitled to air grievances for which they may be entitled to relief. Access, then, must
not be contingent upon retaining counsel, lest the entitlement become a mere privilege
denied to certain segments of society” (Schneider, 2011, p. 586). In other words, the
right to have one’s day in court is not dependent upon one’s ability to obtain legal
counsel (Zimerman & Tyler, 2010).
The steady growth of self-represented litigants since the turn of the century has
been described by Landsman (2009) as an “inexorably rising tide” (p. 440) and Hilbert
(2009) as an “explosion” (p. 547). As early as 2002, commentators were reporting an
increase in the number of self-represented litigants in certain areas, such as domestic
relations, landlord/tenant and small claims cases (Johnstone, 2011; Snukals & Sturtevant,
2007; Staudt & Hannaford, 2002; Steinberg, 2011). Numerous sources cite family law
cases as the primary generator of the recent growth in self-represented litigants, with well
over half of all cases in this area involving one or more such litigants (Berenson, 2001;
George & Wang, 2008; Shepard, 2010). Although this increase has been documented
through studies conducted by individual court systems (Judicial Council of California,
2004; Maryland Judiciary, 2007; State of New Hampshire Judicial Branch, 2004) and
nationwide surveys of judges (Morris, 2013; Zorza, 2009a), there is limited empirical
data on self-represented litigants due to the absence of any nationwide tracking system
and the deficient records kept by many states (Glater, 2006; Van Wormer, 2007).9

It should be noted, however, that the NCSC and the Conference of State Court Administrators
currently are working together to establish a consistent approach to reporting cases with selfrepresented litigants, with the goal of producing comparable data within and among jurisdictions
(State Justice Institute, 2014). To date, they have compiled definitions, counting rules, and
reporting guidelines for cases involving self-represented litigants. Information about this
9

25

Along with an increase in the overall number of self-represented litigants, there is
a growing perception that the population of self-represented litigants is more diverse than
once thought. It has long been recognized that, in many cases, self-represented litigants
enter the legal system at a disadvantage due to their socio-economic status and then face
compounding barriers due to language, literacy, disability, and/or age (Engler, 2011).
This group of litigants, however, now includes a growing number of individuals with
varying levels of education, training and financial resources (Flaherty, 2002; Greacen,
2005; Sims, 2004).
The overall growth of self-represented litigants and the increasing diversity seen
within this population can be attributed to economic and social trends in the U.S.
(Judicial Council of California, 2007):
Cost: The practical cause of the previously identified “justice gap” is that many selfrepresented litigants both lack the financial resources to hire an attorney and fail to
qualify for free legal services (Hannaford-Agor and Mott, 2003; Sims, 2004; Swank,
2004; Zorza, 2009a). Moreover, many legal services organizations lack the resources to
provide assistance to every eligible individual. Thus, for many people, self-representation
is not a matter of choice but rather due to financial necessity (Engler, 2011; Smith &
Stratford, 2012; Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007; Zorza, 2004).
A “Do-It-Yourself” mentality: It has been observed that the growing perception that
lawyers are not always necessary to pursue a legal action can be traced to two related

anything as well as the expert” (Landsman, 2009, p. 445). The phenomenon of
disintermediation – which obviates the need for “middlemen” – is not unique to the legal
field (Greacen, 2011; Judicial Council of California, 2007). Disintermediation in the legal
field is closely related to de-professionalization, which refers to social, political,
economic, and demographic trends that undermine claims to autonomy, monopoly, and
social privilege once enjoyed by well-established professions (Holland, 2013; Rothman,
1984). Traditionally, the monopoly held by duly licensed attorneys was protected by legal
sanctions as well as by the reluctance of members of the public to undertake legal tasks
for themselves (even when able to do so) or to rely upon non-lawyers for these services.
In recent years though, the public’s perception about what services require the
assistance of any attorney has been shifting (Hannaford-Agor & Mott, 2003). Snukals and
Sturtevant (2007) and Rothman (1984) both cite a decrease in the “competence gap,” due
to rising education and literacy levels in the U.S., as another factor contributing to the
growth of the DIY mentality towards legal proceedings. This belief that some cases are,
in fact, simple enough for a layperson to handle is shared by members of the legal
profession (Schneider, 2011). At the same time, however, lawyers view the emergence of
the DIY mentality in the legal field with a degree of trepidation. Their comprehensive
expert knowledge “legitimiz[es] [their] professional prerogatives” (Rothman, 1984, p.
187). If laypersons are capable of doing their work, the extent to which lawyers retain
expert authority is called into question.
Driving the processes of disintermediation and de-professionalization in law has
been a growth in the amount of legal information to which laypersons now have access,
due to the Internet and related ICTs (Berenson, 2001). Members of the public thus are

27

increasingly embracing the notion that access to these resources will enable them to make
adequate preparations for their day in court (Berenson, 2001; Hale-Janeke & Blackburn,
2008; Kritzer, 1999; Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007).
While cost and a DIY mentality are the most frequently cited reasons for selfrepresentation, other perspectives abound. Widdison (2013), for one, draws distinctions
between “lumpers” who are proceeding without counsel because they have no other
choice and “self-helpers” who have (or have the means to acquire) the knowledge to
successfully navigate the legal system. Other less frequently cited reasons for selfrepresentation include an increase in litigiousness, coupled with a negative perception of
lawyers (Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007). The latter, in particular, correlates to the idea of
self-representation as an empowerment tool: “[I]n theory at least, self- representation can
serve to solve many of the difficulties and sources of dissatisfaction that characterize the
legal experiences of represented litigants (the feeling of passivity and lack of control, the
inability to tell one's story, or the difficulty of communicating with lawyers)” (Zimerman
& Tyler, 2010, p. 499; see also Barclay, 1996).
A.2. Impact of Self-Representation Phenomenon on the Legal System
The unprecedented growth of self-represented litigants presents a number of
challenges for courts. In some courts, a lingering perception of self-represented litigants
as “nuts,” “pests,” or an “increasing problem,” whose very presence creates havoc for the
judicial system, persists (Schneider, 2011; Swank, 2004). This remains true despite
growing acceptance that a lack of representation generally is not indicative of the merits
of a litigant’s claims, as well as evidence that self-represented litigants do not actually
derail legal processes and courtroom procedures (Greacen, 2014; Schneider, 2011). Even

28

within courts that take a more favorable view of self-represented litigants, however,
institutional and administrative requirements create barriers that may be difficult to
overcome (Hannaford-Agor & Mott, 2003). The use of unfamiliar legal terminology, for
example, imposes a barrier for many self-represented litigants (Judicial Council of
California, 2007).
Underlying these barriers is the fact that, despite the longstanding nature of the
right of self-representation, legal and court processes were not designed with selfrepresented litigants in mind (Zimerman & Tyler, 2010). Many self-represented litigants
struggle with reconciling these rules and procedures with the common sense and social
instincts that guide their behaviors and interactions in everyday life (Zimerman & Tyler,
2010). This struggle gives rise to feelings of confusion as self-represented litigants
attempt to navigate the complex court system and later frustration when they feel as
though the court is not treating them with the respect to which they are entitled
(Henderson, 2003; Rasch, 2011). With no legal writing experience, self-represented
litigants’ pleadings often contain “emotional language, legal jargon, tangents, and less
direct or incomprehensible assertions of fact,” while neglecting to include a proper
statement of their claims (Schneider, 2011, p. 602). Previous studies have shown that
self-represented litigants’ preference for stating their claims using language with which
they are comfortable (i.e., a narrative approach to tell their story) can result in omissions
that adversely impact the disposition of their cases (Goldschmidt, 2008; Schneider, 2011;
Spira, 2009; Zimerman & Tyler, 2010).
Giddings and Robertson (2003) assert that effective self-represented litigants
demonstrate determination, persistence, a high level of emotional stability, and

29

confidence. However, as observed by Brodoff (2008) and Acosta and Cherry (2008),
many self-represented litigants must overcome significant emotional hurdles in order to
clearly articulate their claims and prove the necessary facts. Heightened emotions stem
from the circumstances that gave rise to the legal situation, as well as from the anxiety
caused by having to find one’s way through an often intimidating court environment
(Tait, 2011; Widdison, 2013). The trepidation with which laypersons navigate the legal
system is starkly different from the dispassionate, informed perspective that guides
lawyers’ representation of their clients, as well as their interactions with the court and
other parties to the case (Pettinato, 2008). As described by Zimerman and Tyler (2010):
[T]he encounter between lay people and the legal system is challenging for both
sides, and pro se litigants are usually perceived as a problem - both to the courts
and to themselves. From the litigants' side, there are the obvious difficulties of
having to manage within a highly professionalized system whose rules, language
and practices they do not know. There is the fear then that pro se litigants' rights
and interests are left unprotected. From the courts' side, pro se litigants are
considered a burden; the need to deal directly with litigants (rather than
professionals) requires modifications in routine processes and court personnel to
deviate from their traditional roles and provide additional assistance. (p. 479).
Frequently lodged complaints against self-represented litigants include the
following: intake delays in the clerk’s office due to incomplete or indecipherable court
documents; unfamiliarity with courtroom protocol; overreliance on clerk’s office staff for
assistance; unrealistic expectations regarding available legal remedies, filing and service
of process errors; protracted and/or rescheduled hearings due to self-represented litigants’
lack of preparation; and, discovery difficulties (Berenson, 2001; George & Wang, 2008;
Greacen, 2005; Hannaford-Agor and Mott, 2003; Henderson, 2003; Rasch, 2011; Spira,
2009).

30

It has been reported that individuals with limited English proficiency (“LEP”)
face particularly acute challenges in navigating the legal system (Cohen & Weiss, 2009;
Rhode, 2004).10 These challenges exist beyond the individual’s intellectual ability to
understand the legal issues present in his or her case (Greacen, 2005). Self-represented
litigants with LEP often are unable to communicate with court personnel, conduct legal
research, read their opponents’ legal papers, or understand and participate in court
proceedings (Udell & Diller, 2007). In many cases, however, the persistence of these
barriers is due not to a lack of awareness but rather to limited resources available for
translation services and interpreters (Rhode, 2009; Udell & Diller, 2007). The latter is
complicated further by the growing universe of foreign languages found in many
American communities.
For judges, interacting with self-represented litigants brings to the forefront the
challenge of balancing the competing duties of maintaining judicial neutrality and
ensuring equal access to justice for all litigants (Berenson, 2001; Engler, 2011;
Goldschmidt, 2002; Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007). Rule 2.2 of the Model Code of Judicial
Conduct (2011), promulgated by the ABA, requires judges to act fairly and impartially.
Comment 4 to that Rule expressly states that "[i]t is not a violation of this Rule for a
judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to
have their matters fairly heard.”
While there has been a movement among state judiciaries toward adopting
language in line with that contained in the Model Code (Engler, 2011), there remains a
dearth of clear guidance regarding the parameters of acceptable judicial behavior
The federal government defines LEP individuals as those “who do not speak English as their
primary language and who have a limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English”
(LEP.gov, n.d.).
10

31

(Goldschmidt, 2008). In recent years, a number of scholars, including Zorza (2004),
Buhai (2009), and Engler (2011) have warned against focusing on the appearance of
judicial neutrality inasmuch as doing so may discourage judges from providing
acceptable assistance to self-represented litigants. Judicial engagement is not the
antithesis of judicial neutrality but rather a means to ensure that neutrality is, in fact,
maintained. Zorza and Engler, in particular, advocate for a shift away from the pure
adversary model toward the paradigm of judge as “active umpire.” Upon adopting that
role, judges can then act in a way that minimizes the likelihood of procedural errors
depriving the court of relevant evidence and legal arguments (Pearce, 2004).
In addition, others within the court – most notably clerk’s office staff – are often
forced to make determinations regarding how much assistance to self-represented
litigants is appropriate (Johnstone, 2011; Schwarz, 2004). As court personnel, it is
permissible for them to give out legal information, but not legal advice – the line between
the two, however, is blurry and subject to interpretation (Flaherty, 2002). In an effort to
avoid stepping over the line, court personnel may err on the side of giving out the bare
minimum of information and, in so doing, place self-represented litigants at an even
greater disadvantage (Berenson, 2001; Schwarz, 2004). Furthermore, the extent to which
non-judge court personnel are well-equipped to assist self-represented litigants is a
subject of discussion. While Johnstone (2011) suggests that they are less vulnerable to
accusations of breaching impartiality and could lessen the burden on judges by providing
more assistance to self-represented litigants, he also raises the question of whether court
personnel possess the necessary knowledge, competence and qualifications to provide a
greater level of assistance. Spira (2009) draws attention to other skills that are necessary

32

when working with self-represented litigants, noting that “[c]ourt personnel … are not
typically trained to deal with ‘the anger, fear, frustration, and communication barriers’
common to pro se litigants” (p. 188).
B. DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION OF LEGAL SELFHELP PROGRAMS
B.1. Overview of Programs
The increase in self-representation and the attendant stresses that this phenomenon
places on the courts led the access to justice community to turn to self-help services as
one possible means to bridge the justice gap. Unlike other initiatives aiming for systemic
change, self-help services seek to improve the ability of self-help users to navigate the
existing system.
Self-represented litigants struggle primarily because they are laypersons in a system
designed for professionals who can operate in that system with ease (Landsman, 2009;
Rhode, 2009). Self-help services address this problem head-on by attempting to
minimize the unknown. The core of these services is thus the provision of information
that aims to level the playing field for all litigants (Brodoff, 2008; Goldschmidt, 2008;
Schwarz, 2004). There is general agreement that effective self-representation requires
that self-represented litigants have access to information about the relevant substantive
law as well as about applicable legal processes and procedures (Hale-Janeke &
Blackburn, 2008; Pettinato, 2008; Staudt and Hannaford, 2002; Van Wormer, 2007;
Wolf, 2012). As described by Lawler, Giddings and Robertson (2012), it is important to
distinguish

33

between process oriented information which we refer to as “procedural
information” the focus of which is on “knowing how” to do something (including
knowing what to do and when to do it) and “propositional information” which
seeks to explain the relevant substantive law, legal concepts and legal structures
and therefore speaks to the “knowing why” to do something within the self-help
process. By way of illustration, information which seeks to explain how to fill out
a form would, in our characterisation, be a form of “procedural information”
while information which explains that a particular tribunal has jurisdiction to hear
a type of legal matter would be a form of propositional knowledge in that it
increases a person’s understanding of why their claim can be dealt with by that
tribunal (p. 207).
Brodoff’s description of the experiences of benefit recipients at administrative
hearings (2008) highlights the central role that “propositional information” plays in legal
proceedings. Focusing on administrative hearings related to Medicaid eligibility, he
observed that the relevant body of law is so complex that, even if a self-represented
litigant has access to the text of the applicable statutes and relevant case law, he would
not be able to decipher it enough to present a cognizable claim. The inherent complexity
of the law itself puts a self-represented litigant at a disadvantage vis-a-vis a trained
agency representative.
Among the types of procedural information most often sought by self-represented
litigants are forms and formal rules of procedure governing court proceedings, such as
service of process, preparation of orders, and enforcement of judgments (Berenson, 2001;
Henderson, 2003; Hilbert, 2009; Judicial Council of California, 2007; Shepard, 2010;
Staudt, 2005; Staudt and Hannaford, 2002). Both forms and rules of procedure, however,
run the risk of being rendered incomprehensible by the use of legal jargon. An individual
may struggle with finding the form that applies to his situation or with completing the
form, particularly in the absence of clear instructions (Berenson, 2001; Owens, 2013). As
described by Greacen (2011),

34

The form identifies the information needed to request a particular form of legal
relief, but does not provide the litigant with the ability to assess whether s/he has
adequate grounds to obtain that relief, how to pursue the matter within the court
once it has been filed, or how to obtain satisfaction or enforcement of a judgment
if one is obtained. In effect, the provision of a form enables a litigant to open the
front door to the courthouse, but does not help her or him to decide whether to
open that door or, if the door is opened, how to proceed through the courthouse
and to exit the court with an enforceable remedy (p. 9).
(2011) characterized the information needs of self-represented litigants slightly
differently, describing Tait three broad categories of information-related activities in
which self-represented litigants typically engage. These three categories encompass both
substantive and procedural information:


Informing litigants: provide orientation and general background information about
courts; offer general guidance in navigating the court system



Assessing legal options: help self-represented litigants understand their specific
situation; inform individuals about alternatives to litigation; inform individuals
about the implications of proceeding without representation



Pursuing the case: assist with the process of filing court documents; provide
information on follow-up events; assist with resolution and enforcement

Against the backdrop of this emerging understanding of the information needs of selfrepresented litigants, courts have taken the lead in developing self-help programs to
provide assistance to this group of litigants (Goldschmidt, 2002; Schwarz, 2004; Shepard,
2010; Spieler, 2013; Van Wormer, 2007; Zorza, 2009b, 2012a). Courts’ assumption of
this leadership role is reflected in recommendations made by the American Judicature
Society in 2003 for courts to “study the composition and greatest needs of the selfrepresented litigants they serve, and design services to effectively meet those needs,”
“[d]evelop[] programs to assist self-represented litigants [as] a collaborative effort of the
bench, court staff, the bar, and the public,” and “train court staff on how to assist selfrepresented litigants” (Henderson, 2003, p. 590).

35

As early as the mid-1990s, a select number of state courts (e.g., California,
Maryland, Michigan) were in the early stages of developing self-represented litigant
programs (Downs, 2004). Courts’ progress in this area has been rapid with Spieler (2013)
recently noting that 1) almost every state court system now provides some court forms
and basic information through its website, and 2) over two-thirds of state court systems
provide services to the public, including self-represented litigants, through at least one
staffed center located in a courthouse. And, even as courts’ budgets have come under fire
in recent years, self-represented litigant programs (despite being relatively new) have
fared better than other programs, providing some evidence of their perceived value
(Zorza, 2009b).
Self-help centers, in which information about court procedures and the law is
provided on a one-on-one basis or in workshops, are the backbone of many programs for
self-represented litigants. While self-help centers often provide written materials through
pamphlets and handouts, and may even house legal reference materials, the focus is
generally on the provision of personal assistance (Schwarz, 2004). Although these centers
often use volunteer or paid staff attorneys, this assistance does not constitute legal advice
or create attorney-client relationships; rather it generally involves answering basic
questions and guiding self-represented litigants through the process of completing forms
(SRLN, 2008; Fritschel, 2007)11. Several key best practices have been identified in
connection with the operation of self-help centers, including:

In August 2014, the ABA’s Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services released a
report in connection with a nationwide survey of self-help centers, detailing variations among
states in terms of staffing (including volunteers), funding sources, languages offered, the use of efiling, service methods, substantive areas of law in which services are provided, and volume of
clients served.

36



Availability of computer terminals (Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007);



Use of subject matter-specific self-help materials written in plain English,
including explanations of court processes, instructions for filling out forms, and
pamphlets that explain how to bring common causes of action & related
evidentiary requirements (Clarke & Borys, 2011; Greacen, 2011; Rhode & Bam,
2012; Schwarz, 2004; Snukals & Sturtevant, 2007);



Assistance with completing forms, incorporating the use of online document
assembly tools when available (Engler, 2010; Morris, 2013);



Careful consideration of community needs, with particular attention paid to
vulnerable populations, including LEP and rural populations (Malcomson & Reid,
2006; Rhode & Bam, 2012; Zorza, 2007);



Development of rules that clarify the responsibilities of program staff and the
scope of services (SRLN, 2008); and



Coordination among self-help center staff and judges regarding the type of
information that should be provided to self-represented litigants: “If self-help
centers and the judges communicate about procedures and the types of facts that
judges will take into consideration, handouts can be created and litigants will have
been told or informed of many of these things at different times, in different
settings, and by different methods. This will reinforce the information and help
create consistency so that litigants will know what to expect” (Judicial Council of
California, 2007, p. 6-22). As part of this coordinated effort, judges see to it that
self-represented litigants know about available self-help resources (Gray, 2007;
Zorza, 2004).

Due to the limited nature of the assistance provided through self-help centers and
other self-help programs, however, critics have raised the following objections to them:


They are nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt by the legal community to
foist off its responsibility for low-income litigants (Berenson, 2001)



Depending on the nature of the legal issue and the abilities of the self-represented
litigant, the provision of the information, by itself, does not constitute meaningful
assistance (Giddings & Robertson, 2003; Lawler et al., 2012).

37



Turning laymen into lawyers is impossible because there is a “‘ceiling on lay
efficacy’” (Hilbert, 2009, p. 6). "Quickie" legal education can “rarely can turn
even a college-educated litigant – to say nothing of the typical lower income
individual – into someone capable of constructing and presenting a persuasive
case consistent with the rules of evidence and focused on the issues critical to
making the correct decision. Those critical factual issues, in turn, are defined by
the law - the legal principles governing this particular dispute, which lawyers, not
pro se litigants, are trained to know or identify through research. Yet this is what
the adversarial system counts on from the opposing litigants” (Johnson, 2009, p.
415).

Nevertheless, court-supported self-represented litigant programs are generally viewed as
striking an acceptable balance between a court’s duty to provide all litigants with
meaningful access to justice and its duty of impartiality. As a visible sign of a court’s
commitment to the ideal of access to justice, these programs work to increase the public’s
trust in the court system, primarily by demonstrating collaboration among the bench, the
bar, and court staff (Berenson, 2001; Engler, 2006; George & Wang, 2008; Goldschmidt,
2002; Greacen, 2005; Henderson, 2003; NCSC, 2012, Zorza, 2010). Moreover, self-help
programs take the onus off of clerk’s staff having to navigate the grey area between legal
advice and legal information (NCSC, 2012), while also minimizing the extent to which
judges must “lean over the bench” to level the playing field for SRLs (Engler, 2011;
Judicial Council of California, 2007). And, as a practical matter, self-represented litigants
who are better informed should be better prepared to litigate their cases, leading to fewer
filing and other procedural errors that wreak havoc in the clerk’s office and in the
courtroom (Albrecht et al., 2003; Flaherty, 2002; NCSC, 2012; SRLN, 2008; Zorza
2009a).
Working together with courts in developing programs for self-represented
litigants are a range of government bodies, as well as professional and community-based

38

organizations (e.g., state bars, legal aid organizations, and libraries) (Acosta & Cherry,
2008; Cordova, 2010; Lawler et al., 2012; Malcomson & Reid, 2006; NCSC, 2006;
SRLN, 2008; Zorza, 2009a, 2010). As community access points, legal aid organizations
and libraries, in particular, play an important role in connecting self-represented litigants
with the legal information they need by removing barriers created by geography,
language, and technology and by providing emotional support (Mancini, 2014; SRLN,
2008). In recognition of the value of collaborating with librarians to provide self-help
services, more state court systems are inviting librarians to serve on their self-help task
forces and access to justice bodies (Fritschel, 2007).
Both public libraries and public law libraries are natural partners in the provision
of self-help services (NCSC, 2012; Warren, 2004; Zorza, 2010). Public libraries are more
likely to be the initial point of contact but staff may lack the necessary skills and
experience to facilitate self-represented litigants’ access to legal information (Fritschel,
2007) and may be unsure of the parameters of acceptable assistance to self-represented
litigants (Zorza, 2010). Public law library staff’s familiarity with operating in a legal
environment is highly advantageous. They are well-versed in the law as well as tools and
resources that can help self-represented litigants understand the law; they understand the
process of legal research; they can help users navigate the world of online legal
information; they routinely make community service referrals; and they can navigate
legal information websites (Houseman, 2001; SRLN, 2008; Warren, 2004). Moreover,
law librarians generally have a clear understanding of the distinction between legal
advice and legal information (Pettinato, 2008). The expert services available at public law

39

libraries, however, are not always utilized because members of the public are often
unaware of their existence.
The expanding role of law libraries in the access to justice movement was
explored in two recent publications: a July 2014 white paper published by the American
Association of Law Libraries (AALL) and an April 2014 report detailing findings from a
study conducted by the Law Librarians’ Working Group of the SRLN in the summer of
2013. The latter highlighted different ways that law librarians can partner with courts
(e.g., by acting as a distribution point for court forms) while also making the important
point that the general services they provide, such as public computers with Internet access
and multi-lingual resources, also support the work of the court. Similarly, AALL’s report
described several key benefits of housing self-help centers in law libraries:
The self-help center in the law library… benefits from the additional resources
and services of expertly trained information staff, computers, print, and online
resources, often in multiple languages, which can be folded into services provided
to the self-help center users, depending upon the user’s needs. If someone visits a
brief advice clinic held in the law library and the attorney volunteer recommends
a certain form to be completed, the user can consult with the librarian about
accessing and completing the form in the law library. The packaging of document
assembly technologies with a self-help center depicts one of the unique strengths
that law libraries contribute to centers located within them. Libraries that are more
equipped both on the staffing and resource end can assist even more. Some law
libraries provide scanners for patrons who must now e-file documents to the court
(p. 26).
In recognizing that many libraries lack the resources to serve as a full-fledged self-help
center, the report describes varying levels of service along a continuum. Other options for
libraries to consider include 1) the creation of an educational environment that maximizes
available space and offers problem-solving materials, and 2) a collaboration with partners
from the legal services community through which the library hosts legal clinics and

40

seminars and develops information packets comprised of forms, instructions, and other
resources. Through such collaborative efforts, access to justice partners can circumvent
resource constraints while capitalizing on their different organizational strengths to
provide an array of information resources and services to self-help users.
B.2. Empirical Studies of Programs
The development of legal self-help programs over the past decade has given rise
to questions about how they are faring. Much of the research in this area has focused on
the evaluation of individual programs. Examples include Blasi (2004) (evaluation of a
California self-help center, using a control group of unassisted litigants); George and
Wang (2008) (evaluation of family law courthouse facilitator programs in operation in 35
Washington state courts); Spira (2009) (study of settlement assistance program in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois); and, Smith and Stratford
(2012) (case study of brief advice family law clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah sponsored by
two legal aid programs). The growth of evaluation research has been uneven across the
states, due to the varying levels of resources that jurisdictions have made available to
study self-represented litigant programs.
Early program evaluations typically employed a “survey-based methodology that
focused on gathering information on the volume of clients seen by the project, some
client demographic information, and a general assessment from the client on whether the
program's services were easy to use and were helpful” (Cantrell, 2002, p. 1582-1583).
Based on the growing number of individual program evaluations, there is a general
sentiment that self-help programs are heavily used and have a positive impact on the legal
system as a whole (George & Wang, 2008). Capturing the perspectives of self-

41

represented users, however, is notoriously difficult, as discussed by Cantrell (2002);
Engler (2010); George and Wang (2008); Lawler et al. (2012); and Smith and Stratford
(2012). They are a hard to reach group for several reasons, including their reluctance to
talk about personal legal issues and the reality that many never actually make their way
into the legal system; they may, for example, be deterred from filing suit because they
cannot figure out how to fill out the required forms.
Thus, most data collected from self-represented litigants to date has focused on
their satisfaction with the services they received (Cantrell, 2002; Engler, 2010; Rhode,
2013; Rhode & Bam, 2012; Selbin et al., 2012; Smith & Stratford, 2012), with studies
typically finding high levels of client satisfaction (Engler, 2010; Rhode, 2009). Client
satisfaction data provides some information about the experiences of self-represented
litigants inasmuch as “satisfaction matters because a wealth of psychological research
makes clear that people’s subjective perceptions of how their concerns were represented
affects the legitimacy of the legal process.” (Rhode, 2013, p. 536). Moreover, low levels
of satisfaction can help providers identify when and for whom self-help resources are not
adequate (Smith & Stratford, 2012).
There are numerous limitations to client satisfaction data, however, as noted by
Cantrell (2002), Selbin et al. (2012), and Rhode (2013). The high levels of satisfaction
may have more to do with self-help users’ sense of relief from having received some
assistance rather than with the actual impact of this assistance (often referred to as a “halo
effect”) (Cantrell, 2002). Smith and Stratford’s study of a brief advice clinic (2012)
demonstrates the aftermath of the halo effect. While 84.8% of users who received a form
reported a high level of satisfaction, a substantial decline in this initial satisfaction was

42

noted during the follow-up period after users had actually attempted to complete the
forms.
Due to the focus on client satisfaction data, little is currently known about under
what circumstances and for whom self-help resources and services are most useful
(Lawler et al., 2009 & 2012). There is some evidence that people with a legal information
need are likely to turn to other people for assistance before consulting written materials
(Hunter, Banks & Giddings, 2009; Scott, 2000). But, as to self-represented litigants who
look beyond their friends and family for legal information assistance, we know little
about whether they are able to make effective use of self-help materials (Bruce, 2000;
Malcomson & Reid, 2006; Scott, 2000; Spieler, 2013).
Comprehensive studies undertaken recently in Canada (MacFarlane, 2013) and
Australia (Lawler et al., 2012), however, demonstrate the feasibility of gathering more
nuanced data about the experience of being a self-represented litigant. The latter – a three
year exploratory study of self-help legal resources and practices within Australia –
focused on the extent to which there is a match between the information being provided
through self-help resources and the articulated needs of self-helpers. The central research
question explored in this study involved
whether, at a point of legal exigency, the needs of individual users for basic
process oriented and solutions focused self-help resources (a common recurring
need expressed by self-helpers throughout each of the four case studies we
explored) conflict with and potentially undermine the importance providers attach
to imparting sufficient legal knowledge, information and skills to allow the user to
work through the required legal processes as an “informed citizen” (p. 186).
Key findings from this study include:
1) Resources targeted at helping individuals at a “point of legal exigency” (e.g.,
individuals experiencing a current legal problem) differ markedly from

43

community legal education resources that seek to increase awareness about
legal rights and processes in a more general manner;
2) Self-helpers want information geared specifically toward helping them with
their current problem and are not interested in engaging with the legal system
in a way that will have a broader impact on their lives (i.e., users are not
seeking empowerment or transformation through self-help);
3) Self-helpers assess the utility of a resource based on how closely it matches
their motivations for undertaking self-help (i.e., does it provide easy access to
the legal system?); and
4) Self-helpers are more interested in learning about how to navigate legal
processes and less concerned with information that explains the relevant
substantive law.
Based upon these findings, the authors recommended that providers involve users in the
development of self-help resources so that they are not solely reflecting the “provider’s
perspective of what a layperson would need to navigate the legal system” (p. 219).
With the notable exceptions of comprehensive overviews of self-represented
litigant programs by Greacen (2011) and the SRLN (2008), as well as the SRLN’s more
recent study focused on the services that law libraries in the United States provide to selfrepresented litigants (2014), the emphasis on individual programs has contributed to the
lack of cohesiveness that permeates this body of research in the United States (Greacen,
2002). As Zorza (2007) noted, “the extensive innovation and experimentation that is
going on in this field is largely uncoordinated and undirected. Innovators in one state
often find it hard to discover what others have done, and what information that is
available is usually focused on one program or innovation” (p. 81). The end result is that
states are not taking full advantage of the opportunity to learn from one another through
the sharing of best practices and lessons learned.

C. TECHNOLOGY-BASED SELF-HELP SERVICES
C.1. Overview of Services
There are many similarities between technology-based services, such as statewide
legal information websites, and more “traditional” court-based, in-person services. Both
types of programs generally share the same goals (i.e., the provision of information, not
advice) and thus must remain attuned to the information needs of self-help users. The
literature also reveals that, similar to traditional services, collaboration among courts,
legal services providers and other community organizations underlies technology-based
initiatives (Acosta & Cherry, 2008; SRLN, 2008). The New York statewide legal
information website (LawHelp NY), for example, works closely with the court system in
posting information and provides training to public and law libraries so as to leverage
their experience in conducting outreach to populations that may not be aware of available
legal resources (e.g., individuals with LEP) (Zorza, 2010). Collaboration can also be seen
in the way in which document assembly software is being deployed. In a number of states
(including Idaho, New York, and Vermont), court forms that are accessible through state
court websites have been loaded into LawHelp Interactive (LHI), which is maintained by
legal services organizations. Massachusetts state courts, in collaboration with the
Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University (the Berkman Center), are
utilizing LHI to develop modules for child support, domestic violence, protective orders,
and small claims (Greacen, 2011). Similar to the provision of forms at self-help centers,
however, document assembly functions have been criticized for failing to provide selfhelp users with adequate context. At least one commentator has suggested that we remain
cognizant of their inherent limitations, citing the ABA’s concerns that such functions do

45

not adequately inform self-represented litigants of available options and thus provide
little guidance in the decision-making process (Owens, 2013).
Traditional self-help programs and technology-based self-help services contend with
similar struggles as well. Both must find a way to meet institutional goals and client
needs at the same time (Hunter et al., 2009; Lawler et al., 2009; VanWormer, 2007).
Collaborators in both contexts must often work through the general problems of staff
resistance and skepticism, funding, and training (Herman, 2007). In terms of training at
least, demonstrable progress is occurring as greater efforts are being made to better
prepare non-legal providers to assist with legal questions by increasing familiarity with
legal resources and addressing concerns about the unauthorized practice of law (Ledray,
2013).
Legal information websites (as well as other technology-based legal services),
however, also present some challenges that are not present with in-person services. The
potential of these websites to provide assistance to a greater number of self-help users is
clear; however, barriers exist that prevent at least some individuals with the greatest need
from actually accessing the information that could help them (Cabral et al., 2012; Hilbert,
2009; Lawler, Giddings & Robertson, 2012; Ledray, 2013; Owens, 2013; Rhode, 2009;
Staudt & Hannaford, 2002). The existence of these barriers initially led to some
resistance about shifting money away from traditional legal services, reflecting a
common sentiment that low-income individuals require face-to-face assistance and paperbased approaches (Ledray, 2013). The delivery of legal information through ICTs
requires
a capacity to access the system that some do not have - whether the capacity is
financial, educational, technological, physical or mental, or geographical. When

46

these access limitations outweigh the benefits of the technology, it defeats the
goal of creating greater access to courts through the use of technology (Zorza &
Horowitz, 2006, p. 249).
While Smith (2013) encourages providers of legal services not to be overly
pessimistic about these barriers, the fact remains that many self-help users contend with
multiple disadvantages that may limit their ability to access legal information available
online (Giddings & Robertson, 2003; Van Wormer, 2007). LSC explicitly acknowledges
these barriers through its requirement that content for statewide legal information
websites be developed with special consideration for those with limited literacy, LEP,
disabilities, and limited knowledge of computers and ICTs (Legal Services National
Technology Assistance Project [LSNTAP], n.d., “Statewide Websites”). In addition to
digital literacy skills (which will be discussed in Section D.2. of this chapter), self-help
users must possess several other kinds of literacy skills in order to effectively use online
legal information12:
Basic Literacy: Although websites are increasingly incorporating multi-media
components, much of the information presented via this medium is written. The ability to
use online information then is often dependent upon a user’s basic literacy (Gordon,
2001). As noted by Lawler et al. (2012), the service providers in their study
acknowledged that the use of a written form, in and of itself, can act as a barrier for those
with limited literacy skills.
English Language Literacy: The extent to which online legal self-help services meet
the language needs of the communities they serve varies. There are a number of foreign
It should be noted that challenges related to limited literacy skills can also manifest themselves
in connection with print materials provided through traditional self-help programs. They are
arguably more acute in the online environment, however, unless one is receiving assistance from
an information intermediary, such as a librarian.
12

47

language translation tools available but legal service providers are generally in the early
stages of evaluating the relative strengths and weaknesses of these tools (Hogue &
Hineline, 2013).
Legal Information Literacy: In the context of providing legal information, an
important consideration is how understandable it is by individuals with little familiarity
and understanding of the law (Abel, 2012; Hunter et al., 2009; Ledray, 2013; Pettinato,
2008; Tait, 2011). It may be difficult, however, for professionals working on legal
information websites to put themselves in the position of self-help users:
The inherent bias of legally trained professionals is towards the use of familiar and
precise legal terminology because specific legal terms are used in statutes and case
law and have acquired an accretion of accepted meaning and nuance that seems
difficult or impossible to convey in a few words of plain English. The legally trained
mind seems invariably to favor precision in legal meaning over general
understandability when choosing the words to use in a form (Greacen, 2011, p. 23).
The problem is amplified by the fact that self-help users who are novices with respect to
legal information may process any information they read differently and are more likely
to experience information overload. This is due, at least in part, to their inability to sort
through the information and determine what is relevant and important to their pursuits
(Tait, 2011). The importance of writing in a manner that is accessible to one’s target
audience cannot be overstated because, if an individual cannot understand what he is
reading, he is likely to abandon the pursuit (Mindlin, 2005). Written documents do not
present an opportunity to obtain clarification if the reader is confused (Maryland Access
to Justice Commission, 2012). Without adequate clarification, a self-help user may not
know what action is expected or required of him. The resulting failure to act can
potentially lead to an adverse outcome (Cohen & Weiss, 2009).

48

The existence of these barriers presents challenges for the developers of legal
information websites in terms of both content and design. A primary consideration is how
to package the information in a way that the target audience will understand and be able
to effectively use (Bruce, 2000; Clarke & Borys, 2011; Scott, 2000). The extent to which
this consideration has been at the forefront of developers’ minds, however, is
questionable: “[I]t appears that the most comprehensive pro se-oriented websites are
designed for the edification of lawyers and the judicial community, not for [selfrepresented litigants] themselves” (Van Wormer, 2007, p. 1008).
Because of the above-discussed barriers that many self-help users face, it is
difficult – if not impossible – for them to use online self-help resources without some
level of assistance. Their first instinct may not be to search for the information online but
rather to seek face-to-face assistance from librarians, court staff, social services
providers, and others. The providers of in-person assistance and education therefore
function as information intermediaries and become instrumental in connecting self-help
users with online legal information (Gordon, 2001; Scott, 2000). “Users’ ability to
assimilate information … depends upon their level of existing knowledge; thus, the prior
provision of face-to-face advice can build a platform for greater understanding and more
effective use of written information.” (Hunter et al., 2009, p. 16).
Librarians play an important role in helping individuals with no other means of
accessing the Internet or who have limited digital literacy skills (Jaeger, Gorham, Bertot
& Sarin, 2014; Zorza, 2012b). This will become increasingly relevant as more courts
transition to electronic filing and self-help users need assistance with navigating systems
that may not have been designed with non-legal professionals in mind. Moreover,

49

because of their expertise in this area, librarians are often able to provide feedback on the
usefulness of the site, in terms of both content and design (Ledray, 2013).
C.2. Best Practices
Early on in the development of online legal information, Bruce (2000) identified the
importance of designing websites with the needs of users in mind. User needs should be
reflected in both the content made available through a legal information website and the
design of the site.
Website Content: To be useful to self-help users, information must be accurate and
relevant (Smith, 2013; Van Wormer, 2007). The use of Internet-based materials clearly
has advantages over print materials to the extent that they are less expensive to produce,
as well as more efficient to disseminate and update (Giddings & Robertson, 2003;
Ledray, 2013; Scott, 2000). Several other key advantages to providing information to
self-help users via websites have been noted: 1) concerns regarding the grey area between
legal advice and legal information are minimized (Van Wormer, 2007); 2) information is
made available to a wider audience (Scott, 2000); and 3) content from courts, legal
services providers, and other sources is more easily integrated together (Ledray, 2013).
But, as noted by Smith (2013), “[d]elivery systems are only a means to an end. There is
no escaping the fact that the best websites … have the best advice both in terms of …
substantive content and practicality. This is absolutely crucial and is an expression of the
‘gold in; gold out: rubbish in; rubbish out’ principle” (p. 2). Decisions regarding the type
of content to include must reflect an understanding that, in many cases, self-help users
need basic information about the legal system and court proceedings above all else
(Hopwood, 2011). Van Wormer (2007) compiled a list of information resources that

50

should be available on court websites. Many of the items on the list apply equally to
statewide legal information websites, including


Access to court rules and forms,



A directory of free and low-cost legal service providers,



Links to relevant substantive laws of the jurisdiction, and



General information on areas of substantive law most relevant to self-help users.

To ensure the integrity of the website, content should be reviewed and updated on a
regular basis (Widdison, 2013; Berkman Center, 2010).
In addition to the content itself, consideration needs to be given to presenting the
content in a way that meshes with how self-help users view legal issues (Barclay, 1996;
Berkman Center, 2010). In general, their goal is not to gather information but rather to
solve a specific problem (Scott, 2000). As such, in order to be digestible by self-help
users, the information should be structured in a way that walks them through the process
of solving the problem that brought them to the website in the first place:
It is becoming widely accepted that legal guidance needs to be orientated towards
‘life episodes’ rather than traditional legal categories …. These are important first
steps, but much more is needed. While guidance has to be as simple as possible, it
should be no simpler. So, guidance should integrate as much knowledge and knowhow as is necessary in a practical, step-by-step approach to enable self-helpers to
solve their legal problems (Widdison, 2013, p. 3).
The step-by-step approach can be accomplished online through the use of hypertext links
that also work to prevent users from being overwhelmed by too much information at any
one time (Greacen, 2011). This approach can also incorporate a continuum of resources
to better serve the needs of users with varying levels of understanding, from plain
language materials to more sophisticated resources (Greacen, 2011; Scott, 2000).

51

The use of “plain language,” whenever possible, is strongly recommended when
developing written materials for self-help users in both print and online formats. In 2005,
Mindlin conducted the first quantitative study to build upon anecdotal evidence that plain
language court forms are more readable and more likely to be read.13 Finding a
statistically significant difference in readability and reading interest as measured by
readers’ perceptions of the level of difficulty of the forms, Mindlin concluded that the
treated, plain language forms were easier to understand and more completely understood
by readers. In addition, Mindlin suggested that the use of plain language forms will
benefit the court as well – self-represented litigants’ greater understanding of the forms
will lead to greater compliance (thereby easing burdens on judges and the clerk’s office
to rectify litigants’ errors). Moreover, as observed by Dyer et al. (2013), the use of plain
language forms enhances the legal system’s ability to serve LEP individuals: “It has also
been shown [by Mindlin] that interpreter services can be conducted with [40%] less
expense when translating plain language forms, as compared to other forms” (p. 108687).
While there are no specific standards governing the readability of forms and other
legal materials, online guidance is available at http://plainlanguage.gov and
http://www.writeclearly.org (Greacen, 2011; Maryland Access to Justice [A2J]
Commission, 2012). Different opinions have been expressed with respect to the
appropriate reading level to target when writing for self-help users, with Greacen (2011)
advocating for forms to be written at a third grade level and the Maryland A2J
Commission (2012) suggesting that an eighth grade level is acceptable given the inherent
Although Mindlin’s study did not focus on online materials, her findings are relevant here in
light of the increasing number of states that are incorporating document assembly functions into
their statewide legal information websites.
13

52

complexity of legal language. To ensure that an appropriate reading level is being used,
Cantrell (2002) recommended conducting readability evaluations so as to provide “some
assurance at the outset that a potential client will be comfortable with the materials. Then,
clients can be interviewed after they receive or use materials as a double check evaluation
on the accessibility of the materials” (pp. 1586-1587). According to Dyer et al. (2013),
24 states currently have extensive plain language court forms for use in family law and
other cases, with 14 of these states mandating the use of such forms.
Each of the following suggested practices identified in the literature can increase
the readability of written legal information, regardless of format:


Use of familiar words and phrases, rather than foreign, archaic, and nounheavy phrases (Dyer et al., 2013; Mindlin, 2005) (e.g., “divorce”, rather than
“dissolution”; “obey” rather than “comply with”; “rules” rather than
“provisions”);



Use of active voice and direct address (Dyer et al., 2013);



Explanation of specialized terms (Maryland A2J Commission, 2012; Mindlin,
2005);



Use of readability tools to check reading level (Maryland A2J Commission,
2012); and



Incorporation of visual aids to improve readability of layout (Gordon, 2001;
Maryland A2J Commission, 2012).

Furthermore, technology-based self-help services have the potential to address concerns
regarding the readability of legal information. As explained by Smith (2013), these
services should involve more than putting print pamphlets online but rather should
harness the power of ICTs to combine text, graphics, and multi-media elements to make

53

information more digestible. Similarly, Widdison (2013) offers the following discussion
of the incorporation of non-textual elements:
For the substantial proportion of the population with limited literacy skills, sole
reliance on text is a major additional barrier. In a multimedia digital environment
such as the Internet, purely textual representation is entirely unnecessary ….
Appropriate use of graphics in the form of diagrams and flowcharts can greatly
improve the understanding of accompanying text. Images in the form of photographs
and illustrations not only support text, they can sometimes substitute for it e.g. with a
‘comic-book’ format. Sound bites may sometimes have a useful role to play. Best of
all, surely, are video clips that e.g. provide short lectures in lay terms on relevant
issues, or show other self-helpers going through the various stages of a problem
solving strategy (p. 4).
Even with plain language content, users may still struggle with understanding the
available information, due to the inherent complexity of law or to language barriers.
Legal information websites, however, do not need to be stand-alone resources. They can
link users to additional sources of support and information through phone and/or chat
services so that frustrated users do not abandon their pursuits (Ledray, 2013; Smith,
2013). In addition, multi-lingual content should be included to whatever extent possible
(Berkman Center, 2010; Birnbaum & Bala, 2012).
Website Design: The process of website design should be a collaborative effort, at
the very least involving the input of both users and providers of legal services (Scott,
2000; Smith, 2013). Herman (2007) suggests that data can be collected about user needs
and preferences in a variety of ways:
An accurate assessment of what the user really needs from your Web site,
knowing what the user cares about the most, using the right words, and a less-ismore approach to Web site design will increase the chances that your Web site
will meet the exact needs of your user. Utilizing caseload statistics and
information from court staff to pinpoint the greatest need provides a starting point
for developing on-point Web content. Data on user needs can also be gathered
through surveys, focus groups, or an online user-feedback tool. Involving court
staff, community stakeholders, and the self-represented themselves in the

54

development of content will help to ensure useful Web sites that will meet the
ongoing information needs of this audience (p. 30).
The design process should also involve consideration of accessibility issues (e.g.,
compatibility with assistive technologies) so that individuals with disabilities have
effective access to the information on the website (Berkman Center, 2010; Birnbaum &
Bala, 2012).
Increasingly, the rise of mobile technology has implications for website design.
According to data released by the Pew Foundation in January 2014, 90% of American
adults own a cell phone and 58% percent own smartphones. Among certain demographic
groups that have traditionally found themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide –
young adults, minorities, those with no college experience, and those with lower
household income levels – smartphones are more likely to be a main source of Internet
access (Duggan & Smith, 2013). The prevalence of cell phones thus mandates
consideration of how to expand current technology-enabled self-help services to
incorporate both texting and mobile applications (Ledray, 2013).
Mobile-compatible statewide legal information websites are becoming more
common, with Pine Tree Legal Assistance being awarded funds through a TIG grant in
2008 to create the Maine Legal Aid Mobile Web, followed by Legal Services of
Delaware, Idaho Legal Aid, Native Legal Net, and Rhode Island Legal Services all
building mobile-optimized statewide legal information websites (Cabral et al., 2012).
Currently, neither A2J Author nor I-CAN! are mobile-optimized, hindering a growing
number of individuals who primarily access the Internet through their mobile devices

55

from completing and e-filing forms.14 The of use bulleted lists, fewer words, and short
paragraphs is of even greater importance now, as both reading and comprehension are
more difficult on a mobile device (Cabral et al., 2012).
C.3. Empirical Study of Technology-Based Self-Help Services
In 2000, Bruce observed that “electronic legal information spaces are arenas for
interactions about which we know little – interactions between the public and black-letter
law” (p. 31). To a large extent, this remains true today. Studies in Canada (Birnbaum &
Bala, 2012; MacFarlane, 2013) have explored the use of online legal resources by selfrepresented litigants, and Smith (2013) examined the innovative approaches adopted by
legal services communities in several countries (e.g., the Netherlands, Wales) in the
delivery of legal information to the public. In the United States, best practices regarding
the provision of information to self-help users via the Internet have been identified
(Berkman Center, 2010; Greacen, 2011; SRLN, 2008; Van Wormer, 2007) and the
barriers that such users commonly face in accessing this information are welldocumented (Smith & Stratford, 2012).
With one notable exception, however, the different paths to development,
implementation, and maintenance taken in connection with statewide legal information
websites have not been extensively studied. In 2004, the National Association of IOLTA
Programs and the New Center for Legal Advocacy undertook a project to assess the
sustainability of statewide legal information websites (the 2004 Statewide Legal
Information Website Study), using surveys and interviews to collect data. The project’s

At the time of this writing, however, CALI is currently developing a mobile viewer in
connection with the newest version of A2J Author (5.0).
14

56

final report (Melton et al., 2005) described the statewide legal information websites as the
“spine of the 21st century delivery system” (p. 5). This report also noted growing
acceptance of the importance of these websites, as evidenced by 57.6% of survey
respondents viewing statewide legal information websites as a main vehicle for furthering
access to justice goals.
The most frequent categories of users identified by survey respondents included
community/social services organizations (88.2%); the general public (88.2%); lowincome people (79.4%); lawyers in LSC programs (67.6%); and court staff (55.9%). The
most frequently cited uses of statewide legal information websites included directories of
free and low cost legal assistance (97.1%), general legal information (100%), and selfhelp materials (85.3%).
Support networks, such as those offered through Kaivo-Open Source and Pro
Bono Net, were seen as vehicles for the sharing of strategies, best practices, and lessons
learned, as well as for the building of content and market collaborations. In terms of
resources, the report stressed the importance of integrating the sites into the overall
budgets of the organizations that maintain them (so that they are seen as core functions,
rather than technology-oriented “pet projects”) and hiring dedicated staff to work
specifically on content development.
The report also highlighted various issues pertaining to the maintenance of these
sites, with the formation of partnerships seen as crucial to building the necessary political
support to obtain funding from third parties. The survey explored the different roles
played by a number of stakeholder groups, finding that:


The most common sources of funding were LSC-funded legal services
providers (56%); IOLTA programs (44%); and bar foundations (41%).

57



The most common in-kind supporters were LSC-funded and other legal
services providers (62%); law schools (50%); pro bono programs (47%);
and state bar associations (47%).



Inasmuch as libraries (59%), courts (68%), community organizations
(71%) were all seen as beneficiaries of statewide legal information
websites, the report recommended that these entities be viewed as
potential collaborators.

The report also set forth a number of key recommendations for website program
staff and managers, stressing the importance of:


Developing a partnership building strategy that reaches out to potential
and actual stakeholders for buy-in, content, marketing, access
partnerships, evaluation and funding.



Using grant assurances/conditions to encourage contributions by other
LSC programs.



Engaging statewide funders in the practical and decision-making processes
of the websites so that they have greater incentive to take responsibility for
the sites.



Developing access points in courts and community organizations.



Developing an evaluation strategy that goes beyond the self-assessments
required by the LSC inasmuch as “current evaluation strategies may focus
too little on short-term interim milestones, and not enough on the overall
comprehensibility and utility of the site” (p. 28).

This survey is now ten years old, and statewide legal information websites have
undergone dramatic changes during the elapsed time. Its themes, however, remain
relevant and were explored here. The survey and interviews, for example, examined
whether the recommendations regarding partnership building and evaluation practices
have been implemented.

D. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS
The previous sections of the literature review touched upon the intertwined
concepts of literacy and barriers to information access. This section looks beyond the
socio-legal literature to more fully explore these key concepts, as they relate broadly to
the information needs of disadvantaged individuals. It demonstrates how research from
other disciplines can benefit the legal services community as it strives to build its
capacity to conduct empirical examinations of access to justice programs and initiatives.
D.1. The Information Environment of Disadvantaged Groups
Self-help users, as noted by Engler (2011) and others, often face disadvantages
due to some combination of socioeconomic status, literacy, education, age, and/or
disability. Within the field of information studies, these disadvantages are said to be part
of an individual’s information environment (Agada, 1999; Davenport, Richey &
Westbrook, 2008; Jones, 2006; Taylor, 1991).
As described by Childers (1975), a person’s “‘disadvantage’ is a function of a
particular context, consisting of his immediate physical environment, the social norms
that impinge upon his daily activities, the economic and political atmosphere, and his
internal makeup – both what they are and what he thinks they are” (p. 8). Among the
disadvantaged groups are the poor, the elderly, the imprisoned, the disabled, the
undereducated, the unemployed, and the racially/ethically oppressed. These groups share
common characteristics that adversely impact their information environments: they often
have low reading literacy and/or low English language literacy; they are cut off from the
popular flows of information in society, creating a closed information universe that is

59

vulnerable to misinformation; their information contacts with society at large tend to be
one-way via mass media; and, they are less predisposed to view information as a means
to alter the undesirable conditions of their lives. Because of these characteristics, they
tend not to be active information seekers. This can have a significant impact upon their
daily lives because, for example, they often do not know about various services that may
be available to them.
While Childers asserts that the information needs of the disadvantaged are not
fundamentally different from that of the general adult population, disadvantaged groups
require “large remedial doses of information” (p. 35) in order to be on par with everyone
else. Some of the areas in which their information needs are the most acute are housing
(e.g., eviction, rent regulation, liability of renters/homeowners, redevelopment issues)
and welfare programs (e.g., eligibility requirements, applying for benefits, interrelation
among programs, appeals of adverse decisions). These issues have legal implications that
should not be ignored. Three primary barriers, however, often operate to prevent
disadvantaged groups from seeking legal help:


a tendency not to see a problem as having legal ramifications,



widespread apathy or downright hostility toward available formal legal services,
and



lack of information.

A recent study by Sandefur (2014) highlights the first point in particular. Finding that
people rarely seek assistance from courts or lawyers to address their civil justice
situations, she observed that this lack of action is often due to their failure to perceive of
these situations as legal issues (Sandefur, 2014).

60

D.2. Assessing Barriers to Information
The common characteristics of disadvantaged individuals listed above also reveal
differences in how social services are delivered to these populations. Alfred J. Kahn, a
noted social policy scholar, observed that defects in the doorway to information and
referral processes related to social services prevent users most in need of those services
from accessing them (Childers, 1975). Information and referral (I&R) services, often
provided by libraries and other communities institutions, can be viewed as a predecessor
to statewide legal information websites. I&R services were established to coordinate the
delivery of human services information at a community or local level, aiming to help
people navigate the maze of social services programs (Harris & Dewdney, 1994; Poe,
2006; Saxton, Naumer & Fisher, 2007).
As I&R services evolved into community information (CI) networks, through
which individuals seeking information for everyday life situations use the Internet as a
tool,15 the extent to which these networks reached the people who need such information
became a subject of study. For example, Pettigrew, Durrance and Vakkari (1999)
examined both service providers’ and other individuals’ construction of networked
community information efforts. Among the questions addressed by that study was
How do service providers perceive that the posting of CI on the Internet using
particular techniques will help (a) clients, (b) their organizations, and (c) the
community? (p. 344)
Pettigrew, Durrance and Unruh (2002) later raised questions about the extent to which CI
networks create digital divide concerns. Using sense-making theory as a lens through
The Everyday Life Information Seeking Model, developed by Savolainen (1995),
conceptualizes active information-seeking as a problem-solving, life-mastery skill that has both
cognitive and affective dimensions.
15

61

which to study these issues, the authors focused on the identification of barriers that
prevent individuals from using CI networks to fulfill their information needs. They
observed the presence of technological, economic, and geographic, cognitive and
psychological barriers that impeded Internet use. A number of information-related
barriers were identified as well:


Poor retrieval (low precision leads to information overload and questions
about relevance);



Poor interface design;



Poor information organization;



Out-of-date or inaccurate information;



Lack of authority;



Language used (English only, technical jargon); and



Security

According to Pettigrew, Durrance and Unruh, the barriers facing any given user could be
cumulative: “For any one situation or information need, a user might be confronted by
several barriers, which, collectively, can overwhelm the user and prevent him or her from
locating needed information” (p. 898).
Bishop, Tidline, Shoemaker, and Salela (1999), in their study of the role of public
libraries in CI networks, also focused on the barriers that disadvantaged groups face in
accessing networked information services. Citing a 1998 Benton Foundation report, they
raised the question of whether the “information poor” would become more
disenfranchised as government agencies, community organizations, and corporations

62

began to shift resources away from their ordinary channels of communications to the
Internet. Recognizing that training, outreach, and support services were as important as
computers and network infrastructure, Bishop et al. noted that no single organization is
likely to be effective in recruiting low-income residents into efforts to develop networked
community information. This is due, at least in part, to the need for “scaffolding,”
including convenient and hospitable public access computing facilities, that enables the
residents to participate fully in these networks, (p. 384). One solution identified therefore
was for libraries to collaborate with other community institutions, as well as members of
target groups, in the creation of digital information content and services.
Today, digital divide issues remain central to discussions of information barriers
and disadvantages. Factors such as socio-economic status, education level language,
disability, age, and geography are said to contribute to the persistence of this divide
(Freedman & Henderson, 2008; Gordon, 2001; Helbig, Gil-Garcia & Ferro, 2009;
Horrigan, 2010; Jaeger, Bertot, Thompson, Katz & DeCoster, 2012; Robinson, DiMaggio
and Hargittai, 2003; Van Wormer, 2007; Wolf, 2012; Yu, 2011). A failure to recognize
the existence of the digital divide, and its implications for providing services to self-help
users through ICTs, inevitably prevents at least some segment of the underserved
population from effectively using these services.
Lack of Internet access is not generally viewed as a significant barrier to most
people living in the U.S. (Wolf, 2012) but such access is not universal (Van Wormer,
2007). According to a Pew Foundation report published in September 2013, 15% of
American adults do not use the Internet (Zickuhr, 2013). Respondents cited the following
reasons for their non-use:

63

•

lack of relevance (34%),

•

difficulty of use (32%),

•

expense of computer and/or Internet (9%), and

•

lack of availability or access to the Internet (7%).

With respect to non-users, “[m]ost … have never used the internet before, and don’t have
anyone in their household who does.” (Zickuhr & Smith, 2012, p. 7). Senior citizens, as
well as individuals with limited English language proficiency, persons with less than a
high school education, and/or individuals living in a household earning less than
$30,000/year, are least likely to use the Internet (Zickuhr & Smith, p. 6). Given the fact
that self-representation is often tied to a lack of financial resources, the persistent income
disparity with respect to Internet usage is particularly relevant – 62% of those making
less than $30,000/year use the Internet, as compared to 97% of those making more than
$75,000/year.
It is also important to note that not all access is created equal. The rate of
broadband adoption is somewhat lower than that for the Internet in general and has
remained slow since 2009 (Horrigan, 2012). According to data released by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in May 2013, broadband is
available at 98% of U.S. households (NTIA, 2013b) but only 72% of these households
have adopted broadband (NTIA, 2013a). In the context of connecting self-help users with
the information they need, broadband is essential to support many of the advanced
technologies that help disadvantaged individuals overcome information barriers. These
include video streaming (for those with limited literacy) and video-conferencing (for

64

those unable to obtain in-person services due to disability, lack of transportation, or lack
of childcare) (Gordon, 2001).
Finally, not all individuals who have access to the Internet possess the skills
needed to use the technology, locate and retrieve useful information, evaluate the
relevance of the information, and apply the information to the problem at hand (Bertot,
2003; Thompson, Jaeger, Taylor, Subramaniam & Bertot, 2014). The concept of digital
literacy, which dates back to the 1990s, was originally viewed as synonymous with the
Internet, networking, and computers in general. More recently, the concept has been
subsumed within the notion of 21st century literacy, an overarching terms that weaves
together the threads of technology literacy, information literacy, media creativity, and
social competence and responsibility (Adeyemon, 2009). As explained in the National
Broadband Plan (Federal Communications Commission, 2010):
Though there is no standard definition, digital literacy generally refers to a variety
of skills associated with using ICT to find, evaluate, create and communicate
information. It is the sum of the technical skills and cognitive skills people
employ to use computers to retrieve information, interpret what they find and
judge the quality of that information (p. 90).
D.3. E-Government & User-Centered Design
The digital divide and digital literacy are common threads among many electronic
government (“e-government”) studies. E-government refers to the use of information
technologies by government to improve and build relationships with citizens, businesses
and other arms of government (World Bank, n.d.). The primary goals of e-government
activity include better delivery of government services to citizens, the enhancement of
citizen access to government information and services and the development of more
efficient, effective, and innovative government operations (Hernon, Cullen & Relyea,

65

2006). In the same vein, statewide legal information websites seek to enhance access to
legal information and, increasingly, to provide services (such as form and document
preparation systems) so as to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and innovativeness of
legal services providers. E-government research therefore illuminates many of the issues
related to user needs that statewide legal information websites are currently facing.
Per Verdegem and Verleye (2009), early e-government research did not focus
sufficiently on users for two major reasons: 1) “[e]lectronic public services have been
often primarily guided by supply side factors. In this approach, governments often start to
expand their portfolio of services by creating an electronic version of the existing
(offline) services”; and 2) “[t]echnological possibilities rather than user needs have
determined all too often the design of online public services. Too much attention is paid
to the technology itself, rather than to the real needs and expectations of users” (p. 488)
(citations omitted). Over the past ten years, however, a growing number of e-government
studies have focused on the users of e-government websites (de Roiste, 2013; Gauld,
Goldfinch & Horsburgh, 2010; Pietersen, Ebbers & van Dijk, 2007; Reddick, 2005).
These studies reflect awareness that increased efficiency should not be the only goal
when providing online services (Bertot & Jaeger, 2006, 2008; Davenport et al., 2008).
They also reflect a growing understanding that e-government use depends on more than
physical access to ICTs – factors such as users’ motivations and digital literacy skills
must also be considered (Pietersen et al., 2007; Slack & Rowley, 2004; Verdegem &
Verleye, 2009). As a first step, Verdegem and Verleye (2009) believe it is important to
consider the different phases through which an e-government user must pass when
acquiring new information:

66



becoming aware of the service;



making a determination regarding its perceived utility (factoring in both
usefulness and ease of use);



attempting to gain access to the service;



attempting to use the service to fulfill his/her need;



evaluating the extent to which he or she is satisfied with the service.

A careful assessment of how users fare at each phase is central to a user-centered
approach to e-government.
One often-repeated criticism is that service providers typically fail to assess the
information needs of their target users prior to launching an e-government website or
service, creating a situation in which the service provided does not match users’
perceptions of what is actually needed (Slack & Rowley, 2004; Verdegem & Verleye,
2009). To address this situation, it has been suggested that government agencies include
user assessments in their evaluation efforts to develop a clearer profile of their users and
then use this enhanced understanding to guide website development (de Roiste, 2013).
Relevant input from users includes how they seek and acquire information, as well as
how they solicit expertise (Bertot & Jaeger, 2008).
Bertot and Jaeger (2006) have asserted that the evaluation of e-government
websites should look at three main elements:


Functionality: does the site do what it is intended to do?



Usability: how do users react to and interact with the site? and

67



Accessibility: does the site provide users with disabilities with equal or
equivalent access to information and services?

Several large scale studies focused on e-government initiatives in the U.S. have sought to
address at least some of these questions. West (2005) conducted an analysis of over
17,000 U.S. government websites, focusing on features judged important by citizens:
contact information, links to publications and databases, access to services, privacy and
security, usability by populations with special needs (such as individuals with disabilities
or LEP), and readability (using the Flesch-Kincaid test). At the time this study was
conducted, the issue of physical access to the Internet loomed large, leading West to
conclude that, in order to increase citizen usage of e-government, it was necessary to
place computers in schools, libraries, and other publicly accessible places. Fagan and
Fagan’s (2004) study of state legislature websites revealed that none of the subject
websites was 100% accessible. Reasoning that this was due largely to the lack of systemwide policies regarding accessibility, they made a number of policy recommendations,
including the provision of text equivalents for audio-visual materials (e.g., text transcripts
to accompany audio and video coverage of legislative activity).
At this time, there appears to be a general consensus that more research is
necessary in the area of barriers to e-government usage. While current users can provide
information about which parts of the population are currently using e-government, greater
efforts need to be made to reach potential users who can provide insight into what, if any,
barriers are preventing them from accessing the websites (de Roiste, 2013). Bertot and
Jaeger (2006) assert that research in this area needs to
more strongly embrace the idea that studies should focus not only on whether
agencies have a web site and the volume of information and services available on

68

e-government sites, but also on the way the sites deliver those information
resources and services to the individual user and on how the web sites serve the
needs of entire communities of users within society (p. 163-164).
Similarly, Pietersen et al. (2007) argue that it is not sufficient to focus solely on the
perspectives of the “information elite.” While the views of these individuals can serve as
a starting point, subsequent user panels comprised of individuals with more limited ICT
skills are needed to “temper” the content and design suggestions offered by more
sophisticated users.
D.4. Domestic Violence Survivor Research: A Synthesis of Thought and Effort
There is one particular area of research – the provision of information to domestic
violence survivors – in which the strands of community information networks and egovernment converge, highlighting the role of information technologies in meeting the
information needs of individuals facing numerous disadvantages. The book Barriers to
Information: How Formal Help Systems Fail Battered Women (Harris & Dewdney, 1994)
is an exploration of “the information aspects of the barriers encountered by battered
women who make contact with the human-services network” (p. 2). In setting the stage
for this examination, the authors review the literature on the information-seeking
behavior of “ordinary people” and cite a number of seminal works in the field of
information studies:


Durrance (1984): Common information roadblocks include information scatter,
information glut, lack of access, and unreliable information.



Childers (1975): The “information poor” face special barriers to accessing
information.



Dervin (1976): The sense-making model unites help-seeking models with
information-seeking models by conceptualizing information as anything that
assists an individual in progressing through a situation toward her desired goal.

69

The challenge for service providers is that, to the extent that information needs are
dependent upon the user’s circumstances at that moment in time, it can be
difficult to take into account all possible situations, gaps, and uses.
Any one of a number of barriers, however, can impede the information-seeking efforts of
“ordinary people.” Information can be rendered inaccessible due to geography, lack of
awareness of appropriate information services, professional jargon, social isolation
caused by cultural differences, illiteracy, or disabilities. In addition to these accessibility
issues, certain groups (e.g., the poor, the uneducated, the elderly) may have greater
difficulty in articulating their needs and explaining the nature of their problems. To
understand user needs, service providers should be aware of the barriers that keep these
needs from being adequately addressed.
After reviewing the struggles of both human services agencies and I&R Services
to provide timely, accessible, and relevant information to all, Harris and Dewdney raise
the following questions: On what principles have these systems been designed? That is,
what are the theoretical frameworks and the assumptions about human behavior that
underlie the architecture of these systems? (p. 43). Citing Kochen (1976), they observe
that information systems must be both used and useful. This is more likely to transpire
with user-centered design, which starts with the premise that information is not an end in
itself but must be understood within the context in which it arises. When systems are
designed to be responsive to the needs of their users, rather than those who design them,
service providers are better able to guide the flow of information so as to ensure that it
reaches those who most need it.
More recently, a series of studies conducted by Lynn Westbrook and colleagues
builds upon Harris and Dewdney’s work. Together, these studies examine many different

70

facets of the role that the Internet plays in providing information to domestic violence
survivors. One study conducted by Davenport et al. (2008) examined the characteristics
and patterns of domestic violence content, information organization and navigation on
state government websites. Conducting a content analysis of official state websites and
using the Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS) model as a conceptual framework,
the researchers looked at five aspects of access to domestic violence information: search
engines, site maps, PDF formatted information, English-only sites, and cross-agency
links. Search engines and site maps were a point of focus because both can be very useful
to inexperienced searchers. The extent to which sites provide information in languages
other than English was deemed important inasmuch as non-English speaking domestic
violence survivors are particularly vulnerable. Key findings from this study included the
following:


“The current site maps are clearly engineered from the perspective of the
agency, not from the perspective of a possible user. A problem perspective
(e.g., “How can I feed my children if I leave my abuser?”) and a common
service perspective (e.g., “Where do I go to get a legal order to make my
abuser stay away from me and my kids?”) would both fit the ELIS
perspective more effectively” (p. 912).



Affective tone is particularly important when presenting information to
domestic violence survivors, due to the mixture of emotions they
experience (e.g., fear, low self-confidence, anger and frustration) during
interactions with law enforcement and social services agencies.



The use of intermediaries, such as the United Way and public libraries,
can help bridge the gap between the general information presented on the
state websites and survivors’ need for specific, local information.

Westbrook then addressed the role of e-government in providing support to
domestic violence survivors in another 2008 study. This study analyzed 172 police

71

department websites in terms of 16 content items, 5 access elements, and link-path depth.
Noting that a primary purpose of e-government was to increase efficiency and
effectiveness of governmental operations, Westbrook sought to explore the extent to
which these goals made it difficult to design a website that met the needs of both
domestic violence survivors (taking into account their varying levels of physical,
logistical, and intellectual access to the Internet) and the professional and social services
providers who support them. Westbrook concluded that
E-government's next iteration must build from the user's world view in the
provision of social service support. Responsive, flexible, and substantive
information support can link citizens to the resources and services that best meet
their needs. Such an approach demands that e-government website designers
recognize the dynamic situations in which their sites are used. To become
effective information gatekeepers, e-government site designers must provide
cognitive and affective support for individuals in crisis. Understanding the
information needs of each progressive crisis situation is the essential first step
towards the goal of effective e-government service (p. 35).
In a third study, Westbrook (2009) focused on the information needs of domestic
violence survivors. Through interviews with survivors, police officers and shelter staff,
Westbrook sought to triangulate the various perspectives and identify commonalities that
guided the implementation of information delivery to domestic violence survivors. In this
study, Westbrook applied Allen’s person-in-situation model16 so as to better understand
this population’s information needs in terms of common triggers (e.g., being stalked
creates a need for information about personal safety) and affective elements (e.g., fear of
the abuser silences the survivor). She surmised that

16

This model, building upon Dervin’s work, centers around the premise that information needs
occur in a social and situational context that influences information-seeking behaviors,
preferences, and experiences (Allen, 1996).

72

[u]sability research is needed on the more effective means of helping survivors
move through these processes. What level of detail is most useful? When do
videos of the inside of a courtroom provide reassurance and when does a checklist
of required actions encourage behavioral change? What should come from the
shelter staff, the police, and/or a web site? (p. 111)
In this study, Westbrook raised the question of what role public libraries play in
providing integrated support to survivors, revisiting themes from a previous study. In a
2006 study, Westbrook had examined one facet of the public library’s role in this arena,
focusing on how they support domestic violence survivors through referral to community
information resources via email reference services. While recognizing that survivors tend
to prefer informal information and support services, Westbrook suggested that email
references services could serve as a bridge to the social services that could assist them.
Conclusion
Research from three bodies of literature – socio-legal studies, information studies,
and e-government – informed this study’s research design. Many of the studies discussed
herein highlighted the role of collaboration in meeting community needs and the
importance of assessing barriers to information access. As will be discussed in later
chapters, both of these themes emerge from the data collected throughout this study,
ultimately laying the foundation for the recommendations set forth in the concluding
chapter.

73

CHAPTER 3: STUDY METHODOLOGY
A. INTRODUCTION
The literature review revealed that few studies have focused specifically on
statewide legal information websites, with the most comprehensive one to date – the 2004
Statewide Legal Information Website Study – now over ten years old. The lack of
empirical research in this area is problematic because, as noted by Cabral et al. (2012),
[t]o be most effective, courts and organizations deploying access to justice
technologies need to be able to build on and leverage [others’] experiences and
best practices to design and implement their projects as state-of-the-art and
integrated solutions, rather than reinventing the wheel and making avoidable
mistakes. Beginning new projects from the strongest possible knowledge base
prevents organizations from going down technology paths that end up conflicting
with or excluding other valuable options and avoids wasteful mid-course
corrections (p. 313).
Thus, the overarching purpose of this study was to build upon the existing, highly
fragmented knowledge base in a way that could impact both practice and policy. As an
exploratory study drawing upon the perspectives and experiences of Information
Providers, three research questions were chosen to guide this study:
RQ1: What are the principal activities that Information Providers engage in with respect
to statewide legal information websites?
RQ2: What are the different ways in which states have approached these activities?
RQ3: What program development and operation issues have Information Providers
faced?
The broad nature of these questions was purposeful, as the contents of the “black boxes”
underlying statewide legal information websites was largely unknown at the outset of this
study.

74

To address these questions, data were collected primarily through a series of
interrelated efforts, namely, a pilot case study of one statewide legal information website,
an online survey of Information Providers, interviews with survey respondents and other
Information Providers, and limited evaluations of a select number of websites. As
illustrated in Table 3.1, RQ1 and RQ3 were explored at each stage of data collection,
whereas findings related to RQ2 emerged through an analysis of data collected through
the latter two stages (as well as the limited website evaluations).

What program development and operation

The design of this study was inspired by methods employed by Gil-Garcia (2006)
in his mixed-method study of state e-government initiatives. In that study, Gil-Garcia
conducted a partial least squares analysis to evaluate the impact of contextual factors
(regarding the state’s political environment, economy, and demographics), organizational
structures and processes, and institutional arrangements on the websites’ functionality.
Based upon this analysis, two states were selected for case studies (with data collection
occurring through semi-structured interviews and document analysis).

75

As with Gil-Garcia’s study, this study used different methods to capture the
complexity and challenges of providing services via ICTs. However, the research design
was reconfigured to incorporate primarily qualitative methods. As the population of
Information Providers is small, there was an opportunity to work with these experts to
develop a detailed picture of the current organization and practices of a range of websites
that have different approaches. Contextual factors related to infrastructure and the
external environment that could impact website practices and operations were identified.
But, as the limited nature of Information Providers’ knowledge about their users emerged
throughout the data analysis, it was determined that it would be premature to attempt any
assessment of whether the presence or absence of any of these factors has an actual
impact or effect on the delivery of legal information and services to self-help users.
Moreover, the role of the case study was altered. Here, rather than being used for the
purpose of triangulation, a case study was used to help identify themes and issues to
explore with the broader group of Information Providers.
B. DATA COLLECTION
B.1. Pilot Case Study
Case study research calls for the exploration of a bounded system or systems
(Creswell, 2007). The case may be an event, a process, or a program (Stake, 1995). Each
statewide legal information website is an access to justice program currently serving a
specific state and therefore fits within the definition of a bounded system. In his study of
state e-government initiatives, Gil-Garcia noted that “it seems clear that there is no one
path to e-government success. The two case studies … had very different histories,
managerial approaches, and division of labor among actors. They were embedded in

76

different institutional frameworks, and were influenced by different economic, social, and
political factors” (p. 8). In a similar vein, statewide legal information websites have
followed different paths. Given the inductive nature of the case study approach (Hamel,
Dufour & Fortin, 1993), it was a logical starting point for this study’s investigation into
these different paths. A pilot case study was thus conducted to develop an in-depth
understanding of one state’s path so as to create a baseline understanding of the different
elements that come together in the development and implementation of a statewide legal
information website.
Case study research requires multiple sources of information in order to provide
depth to the analysis (Creswell, 2007). According to Yin (2009), there are six sources of
evidence that are commonly used in case study research: documentation; archival
records; interviews; direct observations; participant-observation, and physical artifacts.
Given the nature of the case here (i.e., a website), the pilot case study relied primarily on
two sources of evidence: interviews and documentation. Along with Information
Providers, other key informants (e.g., stakeholders from throughout the legal services
communities and information intermediaries who use the website) were also interviewed.
Details of the interview are provided on pp. 96-97. Each interview was audio-recorded
and transcribed for analysis as soon as practicable after its conclusion. The case study
also involved a review of relevant documentation, including website content, written
procedures and protocols, promotional materials, and minutes from stakeholder meetings.
B.2 Online Survey
Building upon the pilot case study and the 2004 Statewide Legal Information
Website Study (discussed on pp. 56-58), the survey sought to identify themes related to

77

the design, implementation, and operation of statewide legal information websites. In
addition, a conceptual framework developed by Detlor et al. (2010) in a study of
municipal community portals in Ontario, Canada was instrumental in the development of
the online survey used in the current study. That framework, it should be noted, drew
upon previous research conducted by one of the authors (Detlor & Finn, 2002), as well as
the aforementioned study by Gil-Garcia (2006) and a study by Devadoss, Pan and Huang
(2003). Detlor et al.’s framework provides nine internal factors that influence the
adoption and use of government websites: partner cooperation; ability to change internal
work processes; IT workforce; funding; citizen participation in design; portal strategies
and policies; leadership; marketing; and governance. This framework proved useful to the
extent that the municipal community portals, like the network of statewide legal
information websites, had similar goals (“improved information access and sharing
within their communities”) while also exhibiting differences in terms of “technology
platforms, governance structures, partner compositions and … IT workforce
arrangements.” (p. 124).
Using Detlor et al’s framework as a guide, a preliminary conceptual framework
for statewide legal information websites was developed, consisting of three major
elements. Several potential constructs were identified as to each element, based upon
Detlor et al’s framework and themes that emerged through the pilot case study, as well as
findings from and key recommendations made in the 2004 Statewide Legal Information
Website Study:
Governance:



Presence of leadership;
Structure that allows participation by all stakeholders

78

Strategies:






Partnership building;
Outreach;
Identification of user needs;
Identification of barriers to information access;
Evaluation activity

Practices:





Involvement of multiple stakeholders in developing and updating content;
Adherence to processes for developing and updating content;
Responsiveness to users;
Use of access intermediaries (e.g., public libraries).

The purpose of this exercise was to provide a structure for the survey and, later, the
interviews. The survey – a mixture of open- and close-ended questions – followed a
chronological order, starting with questions about the development of the statewide legal
information website (e.g., how were user needs initially identified?) before focusing on
current policies and practices, such as processes for creating and updating content and the
collection and analysis of user feedback. The full survey is attached as Appendix A.
In lieu of a formal pre-test, the survey was reviewed by three individuals who
have extensive experience working on statewide legal information websites. Similar to
that utilized by Westbrook (2013) in her study of Internet access and use concerns of
domestic violence agency administrators in Texas, this approach was chosen due to the
small population size and the highly specific subject matter of the online survey.
The survey, which was administered via Qualtrics software licensed by the
University of Maryland, was sent to a non-probability, purposive sample of Information

79

Providers (Miles, Huberman & Saldana, 2013).17 Using purposive sampling, the goal was
to describe the range of variability that exists within the population of Information
Providers (Guest, MacQueen & Namey, 2012; Seidman, 2006). More specifically, expert
sampling was the purposive sampling technique chosen because only those who have
been directly involved with statewide legal information websites can provide the insights
necessary to address the articulated research questions (Daniel, 2011). Seeking to reach
at least one individual affiliated with each statewide legal information website, the
sample was comprised of two groups:
Group 1: Information Providers identified through contact information available on
statewide legal information websites and by requests made through online submission
forms (approximately 50 individuals).
Group 2: Subscribers to the LawHelp listserv maintained by Pro Bono Net and the
listserv maintained by states using a Drupal open source template (DLAW)
(approximately 150 individuals). The latter group is often referred to as the “OST [Open
Source Template] community.”
The two groups are not mutually exclusive, as many Information Providers subscribe to
at least one of the listservs. The extent of the overlap, however, is not known.
Following guidelines developed by Dillman, Smyth and Christian (2009) for
online surveys, each individual in Group 1 received a personalized invitation via email
that described the goals of the survey and why they are being asked to participate, along
with a link to the survey. Individuals in Group 2 received a recruitment message,

for 7 weeks.

80

delivered by the listserv moderators, containing identical information, minus the
personalization. Both the personalized invitations to members of Group 1 and the
recruitment message to members of Group 2 included a request to forward the message to
any former or current Information Providers with whom the recipient has contact. One
reminder was sent out via email several weeks after the initial recruitment message. At
the conclusion of the survey, respondents were asked if they would be willing to
participate in a follow-up interview.
B.3. Interviews
Interviews were held with survey respondents who indicated a willingness to
participate as well as individuals recruited for the survey who expressed a preference for
participating in an interview (rather than the survey). Several additional potential
participants were identified during the course of interviews. Snowball sampling (Babbie,
2013) was deemed appropriate at this stage of the data collection, as the collaboration
underlying statewide legal information websites is not always readily apparent and thus it
was difficult to ascertain who (beyond the contact person designated on the website)
could be a potential interview subject.
The semi-structured interviews explored key themes from the survey in greater
detail, including the roles of various stakeholders and the kinds of evaluation activities
undertaken. In addition, every website was reviewed in advance to determine if any
particular services or features raised questions to explore during the interviews (e.g., one
site’s inclusion of resources specifically for librarians). Given the exploratory nature of
this research, the draft interview guide evolved in “real time” during the course of each
interview (Guest et al., 2012). For those individuals who had not participated in the

81

survey, the interview guide was to modified to include questions about background
information that had been solicited through the survey (e.g., how long ago was the
website developed?).
All but two of the interviews were conducted via telephone; more details about
the interviews are provided on pp. 165-166. Each interview was audio-recorded and
transcribed for analysis by the researcher as soon as practicable after its conclusion. In
certain cases, interviewees were contacted after review of the transcripts to clarify
comments made during the interviews.
B.4. Website Evaluations
A select number of website evaluations were conducted following the survey and
interviews. Survey respondents and interviewees revealed a number of different
dimensions across which statewide legal information websites can differ (e.g., platform,
organizations involved, infrastructure surrounding site); yet, notwithstanding these
differences, Information Providers tended to express similar ideas about the most
important elements underlying statewide legal information websites. Five statewide legal
information websites were chosen for this activity, seeking to capture not only different
approaches to developing and maintaining their websites but also diversity in terms of
geography and demographics. The scope of the evaluations was very limited, focusing on
key best practices that had been identified in the literature (Berkman Center, 2010;
Greacen, 2011; Van Wormer, 2007) and throughout the earlier data collection efforts: a
problem-solving orientation; the use of plain language, the incorporation of multi-media
elements, and the availability of court forms. Thus, the primary goal of the website
evaluations was to make limited findings about the extent to which these best practices

82

are currently incorporated into statewide legal information websites, rather than to assess
the effectiveness of the different approaches.
In Fall 2014, evaluators were recruited from the Government Information
Management and Services specialization within the College of Information Studies at the
University of Maryland. Individuals within this specialization have experience with
evaluating government websites and therefore were deemed well-equipped to undertake a
similar review of statewide legal information websites. The program director sent the
recruitment message via an email reflector to individuals affiliated with the
specialization. One follow-up email was sent two weeks later. Four students and one
instructor agreed to participate in the study. Each participant was asked to perform certain
tasks on two or three websites and then fill out an evaluation worksheet in connection
therewith. A sample evaluation worksheet is attached as Appendix B.
B.5. Human Subjects Protection
An application for approval of the online survey and interviews described above
was approved by the University of Maryland Institutional Review Board (the IRB) in
February 2014. Subsequently, in October 2014, a request to modify the application to
include the website evaluations was approved. Copies of Part II of the Application and
the Amendment Application, in which the issues of consent and confidentiality are
addressed, are attached as Appendix C and Appendix D, respectively. Each interviewee,
survey participant, and evaluator filled out an informed consent prior to the collection of
data. All confidential documentation generated in connection with this study (e.g., signed
informed consents, completed surveys, interview transcripts and recordings) is currently

83

stored in a password protected computer; hard copies of interview consents are stored in a
private residential office.
C. DATA ANALYSIS
The pilot case study was a means to explore key conceptual topics that had been
previously identified in a broad subject area (i.e., technology-based access to justice
initiatives) (Yin, 2011, p. 31). As observed by Yin, the use of a pilot study ensures that
exploratory research follows some “exploratory theory” (which he defines as the “design
of research steps according to some relationship to the literature, policy issues, or other
substantive source”) (p.28). When constructing theory through the use of case studies, it
is important to refrain from approaching the research problem with a firmly established
theoretical perspective: “[I]nvestigators should formulate a research problem and
possibly specify some potentially important variables …. However, they should avoid
thinking about specific relationships between variables and theories as much as possible,
especially at the outset of the process” (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 536). Similar to Eisenhardt
and Bourgeois’ study of strategic decision-making in top management teams (1988), this
study began with the identification of several potentially important constructs from the
relevant literature, which were used to formulate survey and interview questions.
However, no assumption was made that any or all of these constructs would, in fact, be
important. By refraining from making such assumptions, themes and patterns emerged
from the data, all of which were explored through subsequent data collection efforts.
Thus, open coding was used to allow a theory – as defined by Yin – to emerge as to the
key conceptual elements of statewide legal information websites.

84

The analysis of the survey and interview data proceeded in a similar manner.
Descriptive statistics were generated in connection with the analysis of the responses to
the closed-ended survey questions. These statistics provided basic information about
previous and current practices undertaken by Information Providers. The majority of the
analysis, however, focused on the open-ended survey questions and the interview data.
Applied thematic analysis was employed so as to “present[] the stories and experiences
voiced by study participants as accurately and comprehensively as possible” (Guest et al.,
2012). Applied thematic analysis shares important similarities with grounded theory
analysis, namely, an emphasis on supporting claims and interpretations with the data. To
the extent that the data collected in connection with this study highlighted gaps in
existing knowledge that precluded the development of a theoretical model at this time,
however, applied thematic analysis is a more appropriate characterization for the
methodology employed in this study. Ultimately, a “real world” problem in need of a
workable solution was identified (Guest et al., 2012).
As this was an exploratory analysis, the interactions with survey respondents and
interviewees were the driving force behind the development of codes and the
identification of key themes. A priori themes – those that emerged from an existing
theoretical understanding of the phenomenon under study – also played a role in data
analysis (Ryan & Bernard, 2003). Specifically, the 2004 Statewide Legal Information
Website Study, as well as themes identified in the bodies of literature discussed in
Chapter 3, provided the “skeletal conceptual framework” for data collection. This
framework operated as a “scaffold to explore the internal structure and dynamics” of key

85

concepts, which served to “focus[] inquiry but … not sharply define its limits.” (Guest et
al., 2012).
The process of open coding undertaken with both the open-ended survey questions
and the interviews is described in greater detail in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively.
Generally speaking, the data was first organized to forge an understanding of the
development, implementation, and maintenance of each statewide legal information
website (Miles et al., 2013). The next stage of analysis involved looking across the
websites so as to identify the different dimensions across which the websites vary. In
addition, the data were analyzed to determine code frequencies so as to highlight patterns
among responses and identify key themes: “[C]ode frequency may be read as a proxy of
salience of relevance of a given theme to a particular analysis.” (Guest et al., 2012, p.
134). The themes and patterns that emerged from the analysis frame the discussion in
Chapter 7, which weaves together critical ideas related to what Information Providers are
doing, how they are doing it, and the struggles they face in their ongoing efforts to
address user needs.
D. VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY
Among qualitative researchers, there is debate about the use of the term “validity”
(see, e.g., Patton, 2002; Stenbacka, 2001). The need to demonstrate the “truth value” of a
qualitative study, however, is not contested: “Do the findings of the study make sense?
Are they credible to the people we study and to our readers? Do we have an authentic
portrait of what we were looking at?” (Miles et al., 2014). Triangulation through different
forms of data collection was the primary means through which an effort to enhance
validity was made (Creswell & Miller, 2000; Miles et al., 2014). As observed by Yin

86

(2009), the use of multiple sources of evidence allows converging lines of inquiry to
develop. Here, because of the interrelated nature of the data collection efforts, a number
of key themes identified early on in the pilot case study were reaffirmed through the later
data collection efforts. In addition, the data are linked to theoretical constructs identified
in previous studies, tying together concepts from information science and legal studies to
present a set of findings that coalesce around these key themes (Ryan & Bernard, 2003;
Yin, 2011).
Within the context of an exploratory qualitative study, reliability is less important
than validity, as it is expected that lines of inquiry will open as the study proceeds.
Notwithstanding the exploratory nature of this study, the ability to demonstrate
consistency and stability in terms of methods employed remains important (Miles et al.,
2014). Here, the semi-structured interviews involved a significant amount of inductive
probing (Guest et al., 2012; Ryan & Bernard, 2003). An interview guide, however, was
used to ensure that a core set of topics was addressed in each interview. An effort to
enhance reliability was made through reliance on verbatim transcripts and the use of
direct quotes to support themes and interpretations. Moreover, with respect to quotes
from survey respondents and interviewees used throughout this report, participant
identification numbers were included to establish variability within the data set and to
show how themes cut across a broad range of Information Providers.

87

E. LIMITATIONS
This study provides insight into the different paths that states have taken in
developing, implementing and maintaining statewide legal information websites. This
insight was derived primarily from data gathered from Information Providers (as well as
other key informants) through the survey and interviews. In choosing this particular lens
through which to study statewide legal information websites, the perspectives of users
admittedly is not captured. For this study, however, the user perspective is not essential.
Its central aim was to examine what states are doing (i.e., open up the programmatic
“black box”) and how they approach the different activities underlying the website.
Information Providers, not users, are in the best position to answer these questions. Their
perspectives on users, as well as the website evaluations, interject user issues into this
study, highlighting the need for future studies that shift the focus from Information
Providers to users. This study, as will be explored in later chapters, suggests one
important reason why such studies have yet to be conducted. A key challenge currently
facing Information Providers is their lack of connection with users; and, until such time
as this particular challenge is overcome, user-centered studies focused on outcomes and
effectiveness will have to wait.
Another limitation related to the reliance on Information Providers is the small size of
this community. Out of this small community, only 26 surveys provided sufficient data to
be included within the analysis of results. Although a concerted effort was made to
design a concise survey that would pose a minimal burden on respondents, anecdotal
feedback from survey respondents indicates that the length of the survey may have been a
deterrent to some Information Providers. Moreover, the lower than expected response

88

rate may have been due, at least in part, to a reluctance among legal services providers to
participate in studies because of their belief that researchers do not understand the nature
of their work (Charn & Selbin, 2013; Selbin et al., 2012).
When survey data is combined with interview data, however, the experiences of
Information Providers from 28 states – to varying degrees – were collected.18 The
combined sample reflects diversity in terms of geography, population size, and
demographics (as set forth on Appendix E), as well as in terms of key dimensions across
which websites vary (e.g., platform, stakeholders involved). This diversity serves as a
counterbalance to the relatively small sample size, allowing an understanding of the
breadth of different approaches adopted by Information Providers to emerge.
Moreover, there are several key weaknesses often associated with the use of
interviews as a data collection method. These weaknesses include the interviewer effect
(“the sex, the age, and the ethnic origins of the interviewer have a bearing on the amount
of information people are willing to divulge and their honesty about what they reveal”
[Denscombe, 2007, p. 184]) and the presence of demand characteristics (when responses
are influenced by the interviewee’s perceptions about what is required of him or her
[Gomm, 2004; Newton, 2010]). At least in the case of interviewees who also participated
in the survey, however, internal consistency was evaluated by examining survey and
interview data together (Newton, 2010).
It is important to remember that research efforts in the area of technology-enabled
access to justice initiatives remain at a nascent stage. Because the amount of research that
has been conducted on statewide legal information websites in particular is extremely

Of the 41 individuals who participated in the latter two stages of data collection, 14 participated by
survey, 15 by interview, and 12 by both survey and interview.
18

89

limited, there are more questions than answers at this time. No one study can provide
answers to all of those questions, but that fact should not deter opening a line of inquiry
with potentially far-reaching consequences for legal services providers and self-help
users.
F. GOAL AND OUTCOME OF STUDY
The ultimate goal of the study was to paint a detailed picture of the complexities
surrounding the development, implementation and operation of statewide legal
information websites. Looking across the themes that emerged from the data collected
during the three stages of this study, the key conceptual elements imbedded within those
themes are capable of supporting the development of a theoretical framework that
explains how different internal and external factors impact the effectiveness of statewide
legal information websites. At this time, however, its value lies in its implications for
practice and policy.
The immediate outcome thus is a set of recommendations to guide future policymaking and practice with respect to statewide legal information websites. These
recommendations can serve as a much-needed bridge between research and practice.
Statewide legal information websites, like all access to justice initiatives, exist to close
the justice gap that currently prevents far too many people living in this country from
receiving the legal assistance that they need. Now, more than ever, recommendations
supported by empirical research are crucial as statewide legal information websites are
increasingly viewed as the foundation for the next wave of technology-based access to
justice initiatives.

90

Without an understanding of what does and does not matter in the development
and implementation of statewide legal information websites, there is likely to be
unnecessary trial and error. As noted by Cabral et al. (2012) “[d]eveloping concrete
mechanisms for better collection, curation, and dissemination of knowledge, experience,
guidance, case studies, and best practices would be a valuable step toward lowering the
knowledge barrier and promoting technology implementation that is holistic and
strategic” (p. 315). This study, by developing recommendations built upon the knowledge
acquired by those who have played a crucial role in building the existing network of
statewide legal information websites, serves as an important step in lowering this barrier.
While Information Providers are the immediate beneficiaries of this enhanced knowledge
sharing, those who are currently denied equal access to justice ultimately stand to reap
the greatest benefits from technology-enabled self-help services that are optimally
designed, implemented and operated to meet their needs.

91

CHAPTER 4: PILOT CASE STUDY
A. PURPOSE AND RATIONALE
To develop a baseline understanding of how statewide legal information websites
serve self-help users, a pilot study was conducted of one of these websites – the People’s
Law Library of Maryland (PLL). In selecting a pilot study, “convenience, access, and
geographic proximity can be the main criteria” (Yin, 2009, 93). Initial discussions with
employees at the Maryland State Law Library (MSLL) revealed their willingness to
participate in the study. The ability to interview at least some of the interviewees in
person (as opposed to via telephone) was another important consideration. The reasons
for selecting PLL, however, were not based solely on access and geographic proximity.
The site’s longevity was another key reason: PLL “was an early example of a statewide
website for legal information and delivery of web-based legal services aimed directly at
self-represented low-income customers of the justice system …. Its success offered
validation for the LSC initiative to try to stimulate the creation of these platforms for
justice innovation in every state.” (Staudt, 2005, 74). Also contributing to the selection
of PLL as the pilot case study is the fact that Maryland is the first state to organize and
maintain its legal information website through the state law library (Maryland Judiciary,
Court Information Office, 2008).
As the literature review revealed that different types of libraries are become
increasingly active in the access to justice arena, a program in which a library was at the
epicenter of a program for self-represented litigants and other self-help users was of
particular interest. Notwithstanding the fact that Maryland adopted a novel approach in

92

maintaining its statewide legal information website, an assumption was made that the
issues that PLL’s Information Providers have faced at different stages of development
and maintenance are similar to those faced by Information Providers across the country.
This assumption was based largely on the fact that the literature places PLL firmly within
the existing network of statewide legal information websites: “As a result of leadership
from the [LSC], every state has a statewide legal information gateway. In most states,
these are administered and maintained by a coalition of organizations, and aim to
comprehensiveness of content with respect to civil access to justice. Indeed, in Maryland,
the statewide website….is operated by the State Law Library” (Zorza, 2012, 33).
Moreover, a preliminary review of the content on PLL and other statewide legal
information website revealed similarities in terms of basic content and scope. Like many
other statewide legal information websites, PLL is organized around topic areas, namely,
consumer issues (e.g., contracts; debts); domestic violence; education; employment;
family law; government benefits and services; health; housing; motor vehicles; senior
citizens; wills/estates/probate; youth law; and, other legal issues (e.g., immigration,
personal injury). Within each topic area, issues of substantive law and procedure are both
addressed. In addition to links to official judiciary forms, key information resources
include:


Links to applicable laws and relevant information available through other
state, as well as federal, agencies;



Research guides in a number of areas that explain how to access relevant
electronic and print resources (e.g., statutes, case law, court rules,
regulations, treatises, and policy documents);



Guidance regarding court processes and procedures;



Interactive quizzes to aid individuals in the decision-making process;

93



A legal services directory that provides a listing of free and low cost legal
services providers; and



A list of other resources of possible interest to self-represented litigants,
including information on how to find representation, as well as links to
self-help services, mediation services, and non-legal assistance/community
services.

B. DATA COLLECTION
To facilitate an in-depth understanding of PLL – the stakeholders involved, the
technological considerations, the day-to-day operations, and long-term plans – data
collection occurred through two primary mechanisms: interviews and documentation
review (Yin, 83). Based upon a preliminary discussion with MSLL staff, a decision was
made to recruit interview subjects from two groups with in-depth knowledge of PLL: the
site’s Content Advisory Committee (CAC), comprised of “legal professionals from
throughout the state,” and law librarians working in circuit court libraries in Maryland.
MSLL provided lists for both groups – 7 law librarians and 32 CAC members.
Potential interview subjects were emailed in December 2012, and interviews were
held in January/February 2013. Twelve semi-structured interviews (five in person and
seven via the telephone) were conducted. Interview subjects included two MSLL
employees (one individual who provides broad oversight over PLL and the current
website coordinator [the PLL Coordinator]); three circuit court law librarians; and seven
CAC members. Of the CAC members interviewed, four are legal services providers and
three are employees of the Maryland Judiciary. The interviews ranged in length from 11
minutes to 84 minutes, with a mean time of 29 minutes and a median time of 24 minutes.
The main questions asked of interview subjects in each group (MSLL employees, CAC

94

members, and circuit court librarians) are listed in Appendices F, G, and H, although it
is important to note that the interviews were “guided conversations rather than structured
queries” (Yin, 2009, p. 106). During the analysis stage, interview data were
supplemented by a review of key documents, including the written agreement pursuant to
which MSLL assumed responsibility for PLL; minutes from CAC meetings; PLL
documentation and guidance; and written materials produced by the Maryland Judiciary
about PLL and other access to justice initiatives.
C. DATA ANALYSIS
The primary goal of the pilot case study was to identify key issues and themes to
explore through subsequent data collection efforts that would expand the scope of the
study from Maryland to the nationwide network of statewide legal information websites.
Collection of case study data occurred while the literature review was being conducted,
allowing the later data collection efforts to be “informed by both prevailing theories and
by a fresh set of empirical observations. The dual sources of information help[ed] to
ensure that the…study reflected significant…policy issues as well as questions relevant
to contemporary cases.” (Yin, 2009, p. 93-94).
Using NVivo, interview transcripts were coded. Table 4.1 summarizes the results of
this open coding analysis, which yielded five major categories: PLL history,
Stakeholders, PLL nuts and bolts, PLL current activities, PLL as part of a network, and
PLL future.

Based upon this coding scheme developed from interview data, and supplemented by the
aforementioned document review, the most prevalent themes were identified: 1) the
different ways that stakeholder organizations contribute to PLL; 2) the perceived needs of
target users and the barriers they presumably fact; and 3) the ongoing need to develop
better processes for content development and maintenance of an up-to-date website. The
discussion of each theme is amplified by quotes from interviewees as a means of
highlighting a range of perspectives.
C.1. Stakeholders
Three main stakeholder groups emerged from the data analysis: the Maryland
Judiciary (including MSLL and circuit court libraries), the legal services community, and

97

users. Collaboration among various organizations within the first two groups is at the
center of many of PLL’s current activities. Figure 4.1 depicts the various roles that these
groups play vis a vis PLL.

The collaborative nature of PLL can be traced to its origins. In 1996, with funding
from the Maryland Legal Services Corporation (MLSC) and the Open Society Institute
(together with other grant sources), the Maryland Legal Assistance Network (MLAN),
legal aid programs, community advocacy groups, and public interest attorneys developed
the site (Memorandum of Understanding Between Legal Aid Bureau and MSLL
[Memorandum of Understanding], 2007; Maryland Judiciary, Court Information Office,
2008). Responsibility for MLAN (including PLL) was transferred from MLSC to the

98

Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) on August 1, 2004. After funding for MLAN ceased in June
2007, LAB continued to operate MLAN’s projects, including PLL, on a voluntary basis.
This situation proved untenable: “[LAB] does not have the resources or expertise to
maintain and develop the PLL website. PLL’s mission to provide legal information and
self-help advocacy tools to low and moderate-income Maryland residents, is more
expansive than that of [LAB], which focuses on the needs of Maryland’s low-income
population” (Memorandum of Understanding, 2).
Accordingly, pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, MSLL assumed
responsibility for PLL’s continued operation, with LAB agreeing to update content in
certain areas in which it has expertise (e.g., housing and medical assistance). MSLL’s
decision to take over the site was based largely on a belief that its mission was
compatible with that of PLL. Stemming from the efforts of a previous director, Michael
Miller, the library has maintained a commitment to serving the public, including selfrepresented litigants [MSLL1]. Both the library’s collection and the reference staff are
available to any individual who calls or walks through the door. As another resource for
this group of individuals, PLL was envisioned as an extension of the library’s existing
efforts to serve self-represented litigants (Maryland Judiciary, Court Information Office,
2008). This is reflected in its current statement of purpose: “The purpose of the People's
Law Library is to provide self-represented litigants in Maryland state courts information
about the law, including summaries of the law, links to primary and secondary legal
sources and referrals for legal services.” The skills and expertise of MSLL staff also
appeared to factor into the decision to transfer PLL to MSLL. One CAC member
described MSLL and PLL as a

99

good match because law librarians and librarians in general are experts in
dissemination of information and in managing large bodies of information and
thinking about how people will use it and thinking about how it needs to be
organized …. [L]ibrarians have had to become experts in technology. I think it
marries the functions of the law library with the need that the state had [CAC6].
To realize this vision of PLL, MSLL has always relied upon the input and expertise of
members from both the legal and library communities. Within the legal community, the
foundation for collaborative access to justice initiatives was laid with the creation of the
statewide access to justice commission (the Maryland A2J Commission) in 2008.19 The
stated mission of the Commission was to “develop, consolidate, coordinate and
implement policy initiatives to expand access to and enhance the quality of justice in civil
legal matters for persons who encounter barriers in gaining access to Maryland’s civil
justice system.” As part of this mission, the Commission was committed to enhancing
access to the courts generally by self-represented litigants and contributing to the
development of resources for this population [CAC6]. The Commission’s mission thus
was closely aligned with PLL’s statement of purpose [MSLL1].
Along the same line, as an integral part of the Maryland judiciary, MSLL is
concerned with communicating to the public that the courts and legal services community
are available and willing to help individuals facing legal issues [MSLL1]. The
overlapping missions of the Maryland A2J Commission, MSLL and PLL clearly

The A2J Commission sunset on December 31, 2014. At that time, the Maryland Judiciary
created the Access to Justice Department within the Programs Division of the Administrative
Office of the Courts. This newly created department “provides language access services for court
users,” “develops written brochures, videos and other media to aid the self-represented,” and
“aids the Judiciary in developing resources to help those without counsel by developing self-help
centers, providing training to aid court staff in better serving the public, and aiding the courts in
effectively responding to the self-represented” (Maryland Judiciary, n.d., About: Access to
Justice Department). Inasmuch as this is a recent development, the impact of this change (if any)
on the dynamics among PLL stakeholders was not examined in this study.

highlight the existence of a community dedicated to serving those without counsel. As
observed by one CAC member who works for the Judiciary,
And, I stay abreast at what happens at the PLL and promote its use, and we crosspollinate a lot. Anything we’re doing in the courts, anything PLL is doing…we
try to make sure that we are making new resources available through PLL and
that, if PLL has something new that it can offer, that we’re letting the public know
through other vehicles and that providers are connected. It’s a network – it’s
really a community of people that manage it and make it possible. And, so you
just have to keep all of the lines of communication open. You know, we wouldn’t
work on something for [self-represented litigants] and not let PLL know or not let
PLL tap into that and make the most of it, you know [CAC6]
The sample comments provided in Table 4.2 highlight how MSLL’s ties with legal
services providers, members of the bar, and judiciary agencies provide access to a
broader segment of the general public than MSLL might be able to attain on its own.
Table 4.2: Outreach Efforts
“[MSLL] regularly has exhibited at the [Maryland State Bar Association] Solo and Small
Firm conference and I can’t remember whether we got into a conversation with people or
whether we actually had [PLL] brochures out on the table but we had several people
come up to us and say “oh, it’s so fantastic that you’ve taken on PLL. You know, I refer
inquiries to the site, for people who are calling and they’re not going to take that client or
that client can’t be helped or doesn’t want to pay or whatever. They do refer them to the
site. They’re very pleased that it’s there because it is a good community service”
[MSLL1].
“We’ve had a lot… legal services attorneys … refer, you know prospective clients that
they can’t take and inquiries to refer people to [PLL].” [MSLL1]
“And, I’m constantly calling and saying ‘hey, can you send me more brochures?’ I put
them in the library, in our clerk’s office. They’re at the self-help clinic. You know, I have
them in our courthouse annex, where our family law master is. I have them everywhere.
So…that gets word out as well.” (CAC7)

“Cross-pollination” also occurs more formally through the CAC. As part of the
MOU, MSLL agreed to “convene a ‘stakeholder group’ at regular intervals to provide
guidance regarding the future development of PLL, including the scope and nature of its

101

content.” This group, which evolved into the CAC, was a means to build upon existing
partnerships with the various legal services providers throughout Maryland that had been
contributing to PLL since its inception (Maryland Judiciary, Court Information Office,
2008). Through the years, the CAC has included representatives from both the bench and
bar, e.g., MLSC grantee organizations, the Maryland State Bar Association, clinical law
school faculty, and several departments within the Judiciary. As noted by one CAC
member, because of its composition, the committee is able to function as a conduit
between MSLL and self-represented litigants. Committee members offer their on-theground assessment of the services and information resources most needed by their clients
and the self-help users with whom they come into contact [CAC5].
In a somewhat similar manner, circuit court libraries also serve as a conduit
between MSLL and self-represented litigants. Like MSLL, circuit court libraries are open
to the public. The mission of the Anne Arundel County Public Law Library, for example,
is to “serve[] the information needs of the judiciary, court and government agencies, the
legal community and citizens of Anne Arundel County” (emphasis added). Circuit court
librarians do not sit on the CAC, but their perspectives are highly valued inasmuch as
they often work with self-represented litigants on a daily basis, functioning as
intermediaries who help them find, evaluate and use legal information (Hale-Janeke and
Blackburn, 2008; NCSC, 2006). One librarian offered her perspective on providing
services to this group of litigants:
So, we try to be really helpful and really respectful. A lot of time when you’re
dealing with [self-represented litigants] … they go off on these tangents and it’s a
long, long, long, story. And it’s like irrelevant to us, because we’re not giving
legal advice. What do you really need? But then a lot of times – sometimes the
nicest thing you can do is hear them out. That’s really what they want. They want
to tell you what happened, and be indignant – “Can you imagine that this

102

happened to me?”…. Also, being in a court, people are really busy and we really
try to be the place – you know, a refuge where the person can come in and they
will be respectfully listened to and we will take time with them. People will work
with them and they’ll, you know, go away happy. Well, if not happy, at least as if
they’ve been heard [LIB3].
In addition to calling upon members of both the legal and library communities to assist
with content development, review and revision (as discussed in greater detail in Section
C.1.3), much of the collaboration centers around increasing awareness about the site
within both of these communities. MSLL, for example, has relied on various partners
(e.g., circuit court libraries, court agencies) to distribute promotional materials, including
posters and brochures. As noted by one MSLL employee, PLL brochures are routinely
sent to county public law libraries, MLSC grantee organizations, organizations with
which CAC members are affiliated, and clerks of the court [MSLL1]. Furthermore, by
virtue of its position within the library community, MSLL is able to work with both
public librarians and circuit court librarians on PLL outreach efforts. As one MSLL
employee explained, due to the strong connections with the public library community
cultivated by the MSLL outreach services librarian, they have been able to promote PLL
to various groups within that community, including librarians involved in chat services
(e.g., Maryland Ask Us Now!) and professional associations, such as the Maryland
Association of Public Library Administrators [MSLL1]. Additionally, each of the circuit
court librarians interviewed indicated that they routinely pointed self-represented litigants
to PLL, either by directly guiding them through the site or by giving them the PLL
brochure. As explained by the librarians, the brochure is a particularly important outreach
tool:


“[W]hen the [self-represented litigant] comes in here and I’ve helped
them with whatever the matter is timely but they need to understand their

103

issue a little bit better in the long term, then I recommend that they, you
know, access that site. And I hand them the little brochure, flier thing from
the PLL so that they can access it in the future” [LIB2].


“I found that, if you give something in their hand to them, like – the PLL
brochure, [you can] say ‘This is a place to start’” [LIB3].

MSLL therefore has leveraged its position within both the legal and library communities
to bring together individuals working within the access to justice space who have
different experiences with self-help users and thus offer different perspectives on the
needs of these users. In so doing, MSLL has been able to create multiple avenues for
promoting awareness of PLL among members of the public.
C.2. Users
Overall, MSLL has a clear idea of PLL’s target users, which has been a guiding
force in the development of content and the design of the website. Their knowledge of
actual users, however, remains rather limited.
Target Users
By virtue of being part of the state’s network of access to justice programs, MSLL
has been able to carve out a particular niche for PLL. As noted by an MSLL staff
member, a Court of Appeals report published around the time that MSLL assumed
responsibility for PLL suggested that PLL take on a role in providing services to selfrepresented litigants [MSLL1]. MSLL clearly took this suggestion to heart, as evidenced
by its aforementioned statement of purpose.
The needs of self-represented litigants thus have been at the center of the
development of PLL content. While much of the information focuses on the needs of
low-income individuals, one MSLL employee suggested that, going forward, more

104

attention would be paid to the needs of moderate-income self-represented litigants as well
[MSLL2]. At this time, the content areas with the most extensive coverage on the site are
family law, as well as landlord-tenant and other housing issues, small claims, and
employment [MSLL2]. The decision to focus on these particular areas appears wellfounded, as both circuit court librarians and CAC members identified similar areas of
need based upon their own dealings with self-represented litigants:


“I think the number one is family-oriented, you know, divorce, custody, visitation,
child support. But then we get a lot of [requests for] help with…administrative
appeals…like a MVA ruling, unemployment now” [LIB1].



“Of course, it’s family law. Questions of family law – custody, divorce…all kinds
of things that have to do with family law …. [and] probably the second is what I
would call business things – they’re usually not criminal, but civil suits. They’re
things that have to do with, that have come up from the district court, like
landlord tenant, zoning” [LIB3].



“Oh, absolutely, that would be family law. Any type of family matters - custody,
divorce, visitation, child support…that’s definitely what they’re looking for”
[CAC7].

Drawing upon their personal experiences, circuit court librarians and CAC members, as
well as MSLL staff, offered their perspectives on the information needs of selfrepresented litigants. Table 4.3 provides a breakdown of these needs: legal advice;
assistance with understanding legal terminology; assistance with navigating the legal
system; explanation of their legal rights and responsibilities; and, forms. For each
identified need, sample quotes from interviewees are provided to offer insight into the
varied stakeholder perspectives; examples of PLL content aiming to address that need are
also listed.

In discussing the needs of self-represented litigants, interviewees also touched
upon a number of barriers to information access that users may face when searching for
and using information available on PLL. In order from least to most frequently
mentioned, the barriers noted were accessibility, the digital divide, the complexity of
legal information and/or the legal system, and language access. The one CAC member
who expressed concern about the accessibility of certain PLL content (e.g., the
incompatibility of PDF documents with screen readers) acknowledged that she had
limited information about the measures that had been undertaken to remove this

108

particular barrier [CAC6]. She also recommended the posting of a disability access policy
if one is not already featured on the site.21
As for the two interviewees who explicitly talked about “digital divide” issues,
they offered rather different perspectives. One MSLL employee downplayed its
existence, stating that, “when we got the site, I immediately thought, ‘Look, the digital
divide thing can’t be something we’re interested in. That issue has already been solved.
We’re just not going to worry about it, we’re going to assume that people have access to
the site, whether it’s in the library or, you know, their own smartphone, whatever it is.
People are going to have access to the site’” [MSLL1]. A CAC member who works with
domestic violence survivors, however, suggested that courts should have public access
computers because not everyone has access to computers and the Internet. She noted that,
because her clients are often homeless, one cannot presume that they have the means to
access PLL or other online resources that may be of assistance to them [CAC4].
Intellectual access, as well as physical access, must also be considered when
thinking about whether target users can use PLL. Understanding legal information and
navigating the legal system both require a basic level of literacy, and several interviewees
recognized the danger in making assumptions about self-represented litigants’ abilities. In
speaking about the challenges facing low-income individuals in need of legal services,
one CAC member noted that some of his clients are uncomfortable reading at any level
[CAC5]. And, for those uncomfortable with reading in general, legal information is
particularly daunting. Being able to read the text of a statute or the words on a form does
not necessarily mean that one understands how the statute applies to his situation or what
information needs to be provided in the blank spaces on the form. As outlined in Table
21

No disability access policy was located during a review of the site in December 2014.

109

4.3, this lack of knowledge extends to both substantive law and information related to
legal processes. Self-represented litigants’ lack of familiarity with court rules and
procedures, combined with their “layperson” status, often leave them at a distinct
disadvantage, as they struggle to orient themselves within a complicated system governed
by a language in which they are not fluent:


“Folks really just want their questions answered in a language that they’ll
understand” [CAC5].



“[Y]ou have these pro se people and their knowledge base can be, usually
starts off at nothing …. Their main complaint is really, ‘Well, that’s not clear
to me. What does that mean? I’m reading the rule – it makes no sense’”
[LIB3].

This struggle may be best reflected in self-represented litigants’ efforts to file motions or
other documents with the court. Court forms, which generally serve as litigants’ entry
into the court system, require a grasp of both the underlying legal information and the
steps needed to navigate the legal system. As one CAC member observed,
notwithstanding the judiciary’s ongoing efforts to make forms more available, “[t]hey’re
still difficult to understand – you still have to be pretty darn literate to use them. And they
don’t tell you when to use them or how to use them, even though we have instructions”
[CAC6].
In formalized written content guidelines that were developed soon after it
assumed responsibility for PLL (the PLL Content Guidelines), MSLL stressed the
importance of making content readable for users with varying levels of literacy. Based on
the assumption that users typically have minimal experience with the law, the guidelines
call for every PLL article to explain one topic at a sixth grade reading level. Content
creators are advised to use helpful headings and subheadings, short sentences, common

110

words, active voice, bulleted lists, graphics, and neutral language [Maryland State Law
Library 2]. When asked about their opinion as to whether PLL content was readable,
however, there was some consensus among CAC members and librarians that PLL had
not quite attained its goal of creating an “easy to read resource.” The following comments
are but a few examples of opinions expressed by interviewees:


“There are a lot of acronyms, a lot of terms of art, a lot of … names of
statutes …. It can be off-putting for people. Instead of having the, you know,
Healthcare Affordability Act, 42 U.S.C. [etc.], they might say ‘The new
Healthcare Act.’ It’s not as legally correct, but for the public, who’s supposed
to be using it, it would be a lot less scary. It doesn’t look like – I think it looks
a lot like a lawyer’s website” [CAC6].



“If you’re not familiar with [the] topic at all, it’s too much …to soak in, you
know all at once. A reader may feel inundated on certain pages” [LIB2].



“I think it’s pretty accessible…but, I guess…the easier it is for a person with a
high school or less education to get in and find their information the
better….[M]aybe…it should be more in outline form or [use] some graphics
[to] catch the eye for someone who is looking for their particular problem.
Maybe more interactive” [CAC2].



“I was thinking that sometimes it seems a little … above some people,
especially the pages that…were like big, big narratives. Like a lot of text.
Stuff that could be overwhelming” [LIB1].



“I was asked to review some of the pages for [the PLL Coordinator] and it’s
like he gave me a page and it was in the middle of bankruptcy and so it was
like, I read it and it didn’t make any sense because it had all of these
abbreviations…. [but] they don’t define them …. So, if you were just looking
at that page – what is the difference between Chapter 11 and Chapter 7
bankruptcy? They were using terminology and I was going ‘What is it?’”
[LIB3].

Of particular interest are the comments that suggest that some of PLL’s content is
difficult for librarians (who have attained a higher level of education than typical selfhelp users) to comprehend.

111

For some CAC members, their recognition of users’ varying levels of literacy
guides their content review and revision work. One CAC member, who has some direct
contact with self-represented litigants through his current position with a Maryland
judiciary agency, explained how he always tried to keep in mind what he knows about the
education level of participants in the programs he manages for court-involved individuals
and their families [CAC1]. Another CAC member echoed this sentiment, explaining how
his primary goal was to ensure that the information is understandable by someone with an
elementary school education [CAC3]. This interviewee, who works directly with legal
services clients, offered some insight into his thought process while reviewing content:
“I’m taking the viewpoint that I’m going to look at the webpage from the client’s
standpoint. I’m not a lawyer myself, I’m a paralegal. And so I don’t practice law every
day. So, I know what questions clients are asking and I have a lot of the same questions”
[CAC3].
Language access was the most frequently cited barrier throughout the interviews.
Interviewees within each group – MSLL staff members, CAC members, and circuit court
law librarians – spoke of the growing need to give careful consideration as to how best to
meet the needs of self-represented litigants with LEP. As observed by one CAC member,
this is increasingly important due to changing demographics within the state.22 Issues
related to language access were coded at three different nodes: barriers to use; user
groups; and types of content. Table 4.4 provides representative comments within each
node, highlighting a commitment among stakeholders to expanding efforts to address the
According to a report released by the Commission to Study the Impact of Immigrants in
Maryland (2012), international immigration growth accounted for approximately 59% of total
population growth in the state between 2000 and 2010. The growth is uneven across the state,
with LEP individuals concentrated largely within two areas (Prince George’s County and
Montgomery County).

“So, it’s very interesting to us that different parts of the state
have different needs. So, I’m not really sure about the other
languages but it’s definitely easier and much more comfortable
for someone to read something in their [own] language.”

“Everybody across the country is dealing with that more and
more and more….I mean, we’re talking about legal immigrants

a resource that just provides basic text. But that text can be
translated – there’s no reason why that text can’t be translated.

“I believe that we do need to…be multi-lingual on the site. I
mean, I just believe that it has to be….[O]n the other hand, it’s
tough to pick and choose.” [CAC7]
“When we start translating pages, we need to think about pages
that are going to be relatively static and then translate it so that
we’re not spending money on translations every year. Or, we’re
spending different translation resources for either different
pages, new pages, or different languages.”[MSLL1]

In speaking about language access, one CAC member offered several suggestions for
how PLL could address multi-lingual content development, namely, by developing a core
set of materials in different languages and hiring a bi-lingual staff member to coordinate
translation projects [CAC6]. In making these recommendations, however, she
acknowledged that both were dependent upon PLL acquiring additional funding.
Throughout these discussions about barriers to information access, CAC members
and librarians shared a great deal of insight into the needs of populations that are too
often ignored in policy-making circles, highlighting the extent to which MSLL benefits
from the collaboration underlying PLL.

114

Actual Users
Per usage statistics provided on the site, “[e]ach month, PLL receives over
250,000 page views, 80,000 visits, and 1.3 million hits.”23 MSLL monitors PLL site
usage on a regular basis and, from this data, they are able to discern basic trends (e.g., a
five percent growth year over year). They are also able to develop a sense of the
popularity of different content areas: “A lot of the process pages show up, like you know,
“evaluate my situation” – stuff like that. But then also top pages tend to be… quite a few
housing pages and quite a few family law pages and, strangely enough, disturbingly
enough, emancipation of a minor” (MSLL2). The limitations of this data were
recognized, however. As described by one staff member, the data on page requests
provides information about what pages are visited the most but, from this data, it is
impossible to discern if the pages are top hits because they provide good content or
because people need that information but eventually leave before locating useful
information [MSLL2].
Further, usage statistics do not reveal, for example, the reason for an increase in
traffic. As an MSLL staff member noted, “it might be just Google reindexing us or
something like that. In the last few months, our numbers have actually gone up quite a
bit and so but I really don’t have an explanation for it” [MSLL2]. Usage statistics also
reveal little about the user experience – are users getting frustrated because they cannot
find what they are looking for? If so, are they not finding the information because it is not
available on the site or because, even though it is there, the information is not findable?

The most recent statistics available show a marked decrease in page views but a similar number
of unique visits. According to a recent report, there were 77,821 unique visits to the site in
November and 139,652 page views (MSLL, 2014).
23

115

[MSLL2] From the point of view of the individuals working on the site, the latter is of
particular concern as it raises questions about the extent to which the site is usable by
target users.
In seeking to learn more about PLL users, and in the absence of hard data, MSLL
staff members find themselves relying on anecdotal evidence to dissect usage trends:
We are fairly certain that this recent spike in usage in the past year is attributable
to [the] District Court self-help clinic chat service, where…someone who is
chatting with them or whatever, they’re just going to throw up a screen of [PLL]
and say “check here.” We think that that has driven a lot of usage. We at least
know that anecdotally. (MSLL1)
In a similar way, they have also learned that librarians and legal services providers, due
to their generally favorable opinions about the site, refer self-represented litigants and
clients to it [MSLL2]. In response to questions about whether they received any feedback
from people who used the site, however, interviewees generally indicated that they have
little knowledge about users’ actual experiences with the site.


“I’m usually giving the website to people I know can access it. And they – I can’t
swear that they follow up because I’m not there to see- but folks have seemed to
be able to use it” [CAC5].



“What I can’t speak to is necessarily … feedback from my clients that ‘Oh, I went
to the [PLL] website and this was helpful or this wasn’t helpful.’ So, I don’t know
[if I feel] as if I’m personally in the position to comment on how it might be
serving my clients” [CAC4].



“I have not. The only feedback I get is more of a personal level, like ‘thank you
so much, you really helped me.’ Things like that” [LIB2].



“I’ve referred people there and…I haven’t gotten any feedback that they haven’t
been able to access it or that they haven’t been successful, so I assume that
they’ve been able to navigate it” [CAC2].

116

It should be noted, however, that one CAC member who routinely points patrons to PLL
when assisting them in the circuit court library has found that people are often “somewhat
amazed that there is a free service out there…it’s like ‘you mean they have a live chat
where I can call and talk to someone?’ or ‘I can print this article?’ …. And I believe that
they think, ‘oh, this is a great tool’” [CAC7]. Based upon the majority of interviewees’
remarks, however, it does not appear that PLL stakeholders have a clear idea of whether
target users (namely, self-represented litigants) act upon the recommendations/referrals of
librarians and legal services providers (i.e., are they actually using PLL?) and, if target
users are visiting the site, whether they are able to make effective use of its information
and resources.
C.3. Ongoing PLL Activities
The two main activities related to maintaining PLL are 1) content development
and review, and 2) website design. While the former was more frequently brought up
throughout the interviews, the discussion surrounding both activities highlight the extent
to which PLL is regularly evolving to meet the perceived needs of their users.
Content Development and Review
a. Current Practices
Since MSLL assumed responsibility for the site, the development of a sound
process for creating, reviewing, and revising content has been a priority. At that time,
MSLL undertook an extensive reorganization of the site that included the restructuring
and updating of existing content, as well as the addition of new content. In the words of
one CAC member, MSLL “took … a barely usable, overly complex tool and made it into
something that is sustainable and replicable and usable and maintainable” [CAC6].

117

During the early stages of the site reorganization, MSLL identified several critical issues
on which to focus, including the establishment of criteria for inclusion, with
consideration given to both the breadth and depth of content; the need to maintain a
neutral tone throughout PLL; and the development of a strategy for maintaining and
updating the site (due to PLL’s limited staff) (CAC, “June 2008 Minutes”).
Previously, under the direction of the LAB, the primary content contributors were
volunteer attorneys and staff at legal services organizations [MSLL1]. While the current
model is similar (i.e., reliance on individuals within the legal community, mainly CAC
members and volunteer attorneys), MSLL staff and circuit court librarians are now also
involved in content creation [MSLL2]. MSLL staff members, for example, inform the
PLL Coordinator of issues and topics about which they are hearing from patrons so that
relevant information can be added to the website [MSLL1].
Over time, the nature of the work has shifted, from the development of new
content to ensuring that content on the site is up-to-date, accurate, and relevant. Updating
content, however, is not simply a matter of routine maintenance (e.g., verifying that links
are functioning) but rather requires careful monitoring of a wide range of legal subject
areas for both legislative and case law developments. It is a labor-intensive task made
more difficult by the fact that there are a limited number of individuals available to work
on the site. Per the PLL Content Guidelines, content is to be updated at least annually and
information pertaining to new legislation enacted by the Maryland General Assembly is
to be posted on the site by the time that new laws take effect, generally October 1st. One
MSLL staff member observed that the deadlines are not always met. At the time that the
interview was conducted (January 2013), the site did not reflect all of the changes from

the prior year’s legislative session [MSLL1]. The guidelines also call for PLL staff to
monitor news events and legal developments by regularly reading The Maryland Daily
Record and Amicus Curiarum (a publication that tracks major appellate decisions
rendered by the Maryland courts). The extent to which PLL content timely reflect
changes resulting from case law, however, was called into question by one CAC member
[CAC6].
CAC members currently contribute to the upkeep of the site in several key ways:


Monitoring content on a regular basis – One CAC member described how
he asks staff members to let him know when they discover outdated or
inaccurate content on PLL so that he can bring it up with the CAC [CAC3].



Reviewing certain site content, as directed by the PLL Coordinator – the
review is mainly focused on “making sure that the information that is on the
website is accurate” [CAC4]. Several CAC members described content review
in similar terms, highlighting both the technical and substantive aspects of this
work: “checking to see if the laws changed” [CAC5]; “making sure that
sentences make sense, typos are taken care of and that if there’s been a change
in law or in a link, you change it” [CAC5]; “reviewing an article that they
want to post on the website to see if it’s accurate, if I would add anything,
delete anything, or just have any general comments” [CAC7].

When discussing content review work, one CAC member who works as a direct provider
of legal services described how he often asks interns and other non-lawyers in his office
to review the content as well and solicits their opinions as to whether the information is
presented clearly [CAC3]. Another CAC member makes an even more concerted effort to
get others involved in PLL work – in addition to recruiting interns in her office to do
some “fairly random updating that no one else would volunteer for,” she noted that she
“beat my staff over the heads…that this is something that they need to incorporate into
their daily work activities, monthly work activities” [CAC5].

119

To a more limited extent, circuit court librarians also offer assistance by
monitoring site content, as well as by reviewing and revising content at the request of the
PLL Coordinator. One librarian, who noted that she does not have time right now to work
directly on the site, still makes an effort to remain in regular contact with MSLL
regarding PLL (e.g., informing them of broken links, making suggestions for new content
based on her interactions with self-help users) [LIB1]. The other two librarians
interviewed engage in content review work in a manner similar to CAC members,
verifying that information is current and suggesting additional information that is likely
to help users.
b. Current challenges
During the course of the interviews, both MSLL staff and CAC members
identified challenges related to the current processes for content development, review and
revision. Law is inherently fluid and developments in case law and the passage of new
laws all require PLL to be reviewed for accuracy and consistency on a regular basis. As
described by one CAC member, this as a “daunting task” because “the laws change every
year if not more frequently” [CAC4]. New areas of law can also develop and
consideration must be given to how – if at all – PLL will address these new topics. In
talking about the legalization of same sex marriage, one MSLL staff member noted that,
in order to fully address this topic, family law and tax issues would need to be addressed,
as well as other issues that are likely to emerge as legal precedents are set in this area
[MSLL1].
The evolving nature of the law creates an ongoing flow of work in connection with
the site and it can be challenging to find people to assist with this work. Both MSLL

120

employees noted that, while MSLL staff is willing to provide assistance as needed, work
on PLL is in addition to their regular responsibilities at the library. Volunteers, the CAC
and circuit court librarians all assist with this work as well but they too struggle with
finding time to work on PLL: “[P]eople are very busy. They are incredibly busy and even
people who work with me will say ‘Sure, I’ll work on it’ but then they get too tied up to
really help out very much. Everything I’m asking people to do is on top of other things
they have to do” [MSLL2]. Several CAC members echoed this sentiment:


“[T]he content review … really should be an ongoing process and I think others
on the Committee … are better about doing it on an ongoing basis than I can
claim to be” [CAC4].



“[T]hey relied on the advisory committee somewhat to develop the content or to
review the content and, unfortunately for me, that’s kind of onerous. My staff
would help me, and I have a very teeny-tiny staff. I’d love to do more, I’m just
not a legal content expert anymore….I’m probably not as responsive as I’d like to
be when they ask to do that. It’s OK that they ask me to do it, but I’m not as
responsive as I’d like to be” [CAC6].

Part of PLL’s current outreach efforts involves recruiting additional volunteer
attorneys from the broader legal community. Described in its current state as a loose
coalition of volunteers, MSLL has been working on the creation of a more formal process
with the help of the pro bono community throughout Maryland [MSLL2]. Working with
the Pro Bono Resource Center of Maryland (the statewide coordinator of volunteer legal
services), the PLL Coordinator has been soliciting volunteers to work on the website.
Together, they have made arrangements for this work to go toward the 50 hours of annual
pro bono work for full-time practicing attorneys recommended pursuant to Rule 6.1 of
the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. This effort is seen as a necessary step in
growing the site: “[I]n order to get larger, we do need more volunteers and we need a

121

more formal volunteer process” [MSLL1]. Several CAC members expressed their
support for this initiative:


“I know that we talked about trying to recruit people who are interested in …
fulfilling their pro bono hours, or something like that, to take on responsibility for
updating content and things like that. I think that would be great, I think it’s one
of those situations where ‘the more the merrier’” [CAC4].



“[T]here are plenty of pro bono attorneys who could donate as well and I try to
urge that as well when I have the opportunity….I mean, I dealt with at least 10
pages this year that were completely outside my realm of expertise…. And it’s
really not that difficult and you can do it from anywhere - you know, when
they’re sitting in court for an hour. Why not? So, I do try to encourage that when
I run into folks” [CAC5].

One CAC member advocated for going a step further and recruiting attorneys who do not
currently engage in pro bono work. She suggested that, in order to increase awareness
about PLL throughout the broader legal community, it could be publicized via the online
Pro Bono/IOLTA reporting system24 [CAC5]. A link about volunteering for PLL at the
bottom of the online reporting form, for example, would ensure that all licensed attorneys
in the state of Maryland are reminded about volunteer opportunity at least once a year.
The work, however, does not end with recruiting volunteers. As observed by one
CAC member, keeping volunteers engaged may be the more difficult hurdle to overcome.
Although people are sincere when they make a volunteer commitment, any number of
things can happen that prevent them from honoring this commitment [CAC4]. Various
incentives have been discussed, but those working on PLL have yet to come up with a
lasting solution to the problem of volunteer retention.

While there is no mandatory pro bono service requirement in the state, Maryland Rule 16-903
requires active attorneys licensed in Maryland to report on any pro bono activities in which they
engaged during the prior calendar year.
24

122

Ultimately, the current tension between the work that needs to be done and the
limited resources available to do this work inhibits the growth of the site (i.e., its
expansion into new areas). MSLL staff members thus are aware of the need to think
realistically about the scope of the site: “[T]he site – like a library that has its own
footprint within the walls – has to be contained so we do need to be really strategic…
[and] we can’t increase content exponentially because there’s this upkeep, sustainability
factor” [MSLL1].
Website Design
Like content development, website design is also an ongoing process. By virtue of
the fact that only the two MSLL employees work directly with the design of the website,
this topic did not receive nearly as much coverage as content development, review and
revision. An issue that was raised by two interviewees, however, was the ongoing need to
keep up with technological advancements. At the time of the interviews, the site was
hosted on the Drupal 6 platform. One MSLL employee, however, noted that plans to
move the site onto the Drupal 7 platform were in the works [MSLL2]. A major challenge
associated with being on an older platform is the lack of mobile compatibility or mobile
responsiveness. When the site was originally designed, there was no need to think about
how it would look for people who were accessing it via cellphones or tablets. This has
changed dramatically in recent years and, as noted by one CAC member, “[p]eople aren’t
even using computers anymore. If you can’t see it on the cellphone, you’re not going to
be able to use it” [CAC5].
These interviewees, as well as several others, also touched upon the current
organization of information on the site. One CAC member, who works on IT-related

123

projects within her organization, discussed current trends in website development, noting
that “it seems like the direction that many websites are going is really, really simple and
search-based, as opposed to trying to provide everything up front for people to search
through” [CAC5]. This sentiment was echoed by another CAC member, who talked
about the importance of a clean interface: “I think that’s probably the most difficult thing
when we talk about a library, a resource center, you know, you want to have everything
on there but you want to make it visually – especially that first page – very visually– get
me to where I need to go and go” [CAC1].
Most interviewees, however, only focused on the design of PLL in reference to
their own experience with using the site. The following comments highlight some of the
issues identified by CAC members with respect to the current organization of information
on the site:


“I also know that – the website seems to be pretty dense sometimes. And
it’s kind of hard to find some things – specifically, some content we
created for [self-represented litigants] using A2J author and HotDocs. It’s
buried pretty deep – I’m not sure people could find it” [CAC5].



“There’s just so much text that they’re trying to cram on the front page
that I think it’s like the judiciary’s website, which is horrible….So, for
example, the legal services directory, I have to scroll over…that little
section on the left about getting help to find that there’s a directory. And I
think that’s hard to find. And that’s one of the most important things
people need….Yeah, and they probably need images somewhere just –
they need to open it up” [CAC6].

In making these remarks, the interviewees once again brought the focus back to target
users. These issues related to design and the organization of information raise important
questions as to whether the average self-help users would be successful in navigating
PLL.

124

D. CONCLUSION
In looking across the themes identified through the PLL pilot case study, it is
evident that a nuanced understanding of the existing network of statewide legal
information websites will best emerge through a study of the people involved in different
aspects of the development, implementation and maintenance of these sites. While
statewide legal information websites have at times been viewed as technology projects,
they are much more than that. As demonstrated through this pilot case study, people –
through their collaborative efforts in content development and outreach, as well as their
perspectives on user needs based on their personal experiences working with selfrepresented litigants – are the driving force behind these websites. Moreover, the
challenges they have faced, and continue to face, cannot be solved by technology alone
but rather through ongoing collaborative efforts to facilitate access to legal information
and services through technology-enabled means. As discussed in Chapter 5, the survey of
Information Providers working on statewide legal information websites across the
country explored key issues related to collaboration, user needs, and barriers to
information access identified through the PLL pilot case study.

125

CHAPTER 5: SURVEY FINDINGS
A. DEVELOPMENT OF THE SURVEY
Based upon findings from the PLL pilot case study, a survey was designed to explore
Information Providers’ roles in developing statewide legal information websites, their
current activities, and their plans for the future, focusing on the key themes of
collaboration, information needs, and barriers to information access. To the extent that
they were complementary to these key themes, Detlor et al’s conceptual framework,
together with findings and recommendations from the 2004 Statewide Legal Information
Website Study (as discussed on pp. 56-58), also guided the development of the survey
instrument.
Table 5.1 provides a breakdown of the main topics of survey questions, mapping
each topic to categories and/or concepts from the coding scheme developed in connection
with the PLL pilot case study and internal factors provided in Detlor et al’s study. A
sample question for each category is also provided.

B. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SURVEY RESPONSES
Of the surveys initiated, 26 of them provided sufficient information to include within
the sample. Of those 26 surveys, 24 were filled out by current Information Providers, and
two were filled out by former Information Providers25 This sample was geographically
diverse, with survey responses coming from each of the following states: Alabama,
Alaska, Arkansas, California (2), DC, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois (3), Indiana, Iowa,
Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Ohio, Texas, Vermont
25

Throughout the discussion of survey results, the number of responses varies because not all
respondents answered every question. Nevertheless, data from incomplete surveys was included
in the data analysis because, in each case, they were the only data received from that particular
state.

127

Washington, West Virginia (2). One respondent opted not to indicate the state with which
he/she is affiliated. Ten of the states from which responses were received are on the
LawHelp platform maintained by Pro Bono Net.
Respondents were asked to describe their current or previous role in connection with
the statewide legal information website. They generally described this role in terms of a
job title – for example, four respondents identified as website administrators, four as
website coordinators, three as content managers, and two as project managers. Three
respondents hold supervisory positions within the organization that maintains the
website. Survey respondents therefore have varying levels of responsibility with respect
to the site, with one stating that he is responsible for everything related to the site [P9]
and others indicating a more focused role (e.g., content development). In every case, the
respondent was affiliated with a legal services organization, thus demonstrating the
central role of legal aid services in maintaining these websites. Survey responses,
however, point to different ideas about how the website fits within the broader context of
their organization, with some viewing it as an extension of their organizations’ traditional
legal services and others viewing it as distinct from these services.
The majority of the websites (n=23) were launched at least seven years ago, with over
half of respondents indicating that the site has been in existence for more than ten years
(see Figure 5.1). Although several survey respondents indicated that they knew little
about the history of the site, others were able to provide pertinent historical details (as
discussed throughout this chapter) that shed light on some of the issues and challenges
that arose during the early years of these websites.

128

Figure 5.1: How long ago was the website launched?

C. THEMES FROM THE SURVEY
Although the small number of responses received does limit the generalizability of
survey findings, a number of key themes were identified through an open coding analysis
of the open-ended questions. This process yielded seven main categories and eight
subcategories. Once the categories and subcategories were finalized, the responses were
reviewed again and codes were created for associated concepts. The major results of this
analysis are presented in Table 5.2; the number in parentheses following each associated
concept represents the number of survey responses in which that concept appeared.
Themes that emerged within each main category are presented as well. In discussing the
results of the applied thematic analysis, descriptive statistics compiled from responses to
closed-ended questions are presented to provide basic information about Information
Providers’ previous and current practices.

Many of the emerging themes identified through this analysis are similar to those
discussed in the previous chapter with respect to the PLL pilot case study, lending
support to the idea that statewide legal information websites across the country are
dealing with many of the same issues: finding and working with collaborators;

131

ascertaining the needs of target users and addressing barriers to information access that
these users face; learning more about actual users; and maintaining an up-to-date and
robust website (in terms of both content and design) in the face of resource constraints.
As the different approaches that states have adopted in addressing these issues are equally
important, they are highlighted as well. The following discussion provides a detailed
description of these issues, using the emerging themes identified in Table 5.2 to shape
the narrative.
While collaboration underlies almost every statewide legal information website, the
nature and extent of this collaboration varies widely.
Twenty-two respondents provided information about the various organizations
involved in the development of the site. Their responses indicated that, from the
beginning, statewide legal information websites have generally been the product of
collaboration among various entities. Although other legal aid organizations were most
frequently named as initial collaborators, other groups identified include family law selfhelp centers, pro bono programs, law schools, state courts, state bars, law libraries,
private attorneys and access to justice bodies. One respondent, for example, noted that
“[a] group of stakeholders from legal aid, law school, and funding communities engaged
in a planning session to determine the scope of information to be initially included on the
site” [P15].
Respondents were also asked several questions aimed at understanding the extent
to which they currently work with other organizations. Specifically, the survey inquired
whether they maintain regular working relationships with other organizations within the
state’s legal community; whether they sought input from various stakeholders; whether

132

anyone else was involved in content creation; and whether various organizations
disseminated information about the website. The majority of respondents indicated that
they maintain working relationships with state and local bar associations (n=22), law
schools within the state (n=20), and other legal services projects/programs within the
state (n=19). Through responses to various open-ended questions, different forms of
collaboration came to light, including coordinated efforts with libraries, self-help centers
and other community organizations. Table 5.3 provides a sample of these responses.
TABLE 5.3: Collaborative Efforts
“We have partnered with libraries to be sure our website is used by library patrons” [P10]
“We partner with public libraries in a "train the trainer" model. Libraries are often the
first-line of help for people seeking information” [P14]
“We go to various events and do outreach, we run workshops at domestic violence
shelters and libraries” [P21]
“We also work to open brick-and-mortar self-help centers to give people places to go to
access the internet and printers, and for those who need additional help (including those
with [LEP] or low literacy)” [P24]
"We also coordinate with librarians who are interested in helping people find accessible
legal information and self-help tools." [P22]
The ways in which other organizations play an active role with respect to the sites varied,
revealing contributions by others organizations that impact the websites at different levels
– their day-to-day operations as well as their strategic directions.


Nineteen respondents indicated that courts, libraries, and legal services providers all
disseminate information about the site. One respondent, for example, stated that
various partners distribute promotional materials for the website (e.g., flyers,
brochures, business cards) [P24].



Courts (n=20), local non-profit organizations (n=19), and social services agencies
(n=18) all provide input with respect to the websites. A few respondents specifically
mentioned advisory committees. For example, one state has “a website stakeholder
committee that consists of members from the eight largest legal-aid organizations in
the state and meets three times/year” as well as an advisory committee for its

133

Spanish-language site “which consists of members from pro-Latino organizations,
most of them legal" [P14].
Content creation and revision – often a collaborative process involving various
stakeholders – pose a variety of challenges for Information Providers.
A series of survey questions explored the processes of content creation and
revision. Inasmuch as the responses to these questions highlight the diversity of the
stakeholders involved in this process, as well as the different approaches that states have
taken in this area, each question will be discussed in turn.
What other individuals are involved in content creation? As discussed earlier in this
chapter, content development is not generally the work of one individual. Although a few
respondents stated that only their organization was involved in content creation, others
identified various organizations and individuals that contribute in this manner (Table
5.10), highlighting the collaboration that underlies a number of these sites.
Table 5.10: Content Contributors
"[L]egal aid staff at other programs, law professors at local universities and the odd semiretired legal aid attorney whom we pay when we can." (P21)
“[O]ther legal aid attorneys, private bar, state agency attorneys, and interns.” [P22]
“[P]aid content development staff…[and] volunteer attorneys” [P24]
“[L]egal aid staff, interns, externs, and … Access to Justice Commission staff.” [P3]
“[We have] a full time Legal Content Editor who reviews all of our content at least
annually … She also works with legal aid staff to ensure publications are up to date."
[P39]
“We have identified staff SMEs [subject matter experts] who I coordinate with on a
regular basis to determine [when] updates/changes are required.” [P17]

134

How often is content reviewed? Content review occurs at varied intervals, ranging from
irregularly (n=9) to at least once a month (n=5) (Figure 5.2).
Figure 5.2: How often is content reviewed?

Is there a process in place for reviewing content? More than half of respondents (n=16)
indicated that there is a process in place for identifying needed changes and updates to
the website. The open-ended responses revealed that there was a fair amount of variation
in these processes, ranging from ad hoc review in three states to highly formalized
processes in two states. In the middle were a number of states in which the review
involves a mixture of ad hoc review and formal review processes. Respondents from the
states with formal processes described in detail quality assurance procedures
implemented to ensure that content review occurs at regularly scheduled intervals:


“We have a Quality Assurance process that flags each piece of content for review
on an annual basis. Each item of content is assigned to one or more content
editors, who receive emails that review is due. They conduct a form of review

135

(either plain language, or substantive, or links review) and publish the changes to
the website" [P24].


"We have a quality assurance system in place that looks at last updated dates of a
content piece and how frequently it is reviewed. We also have an annual review
system in place where certain content is tagged to be reviewed each year (e.g.,
income tax content, food stamps content, SSI/SSDI content, federal poverty
guidelines, etc.)” [P14].

In one of these states, the quality assurance process is supplemented by as-needed
updates (e.g., changes in laws or procedures), as well as ad hoc review of content in
response to inquiries about possible errors or inaccuracies [P24]. In addition, a
respondent from a third state referenced a “content auditing system to identify material
by age that can be used to identify content that needs to be updated” [P21]. But, based
upon the response provided, the extent to which this system is automated could not be
determined.
Among the other respondents who indicated the existence of a review process,
several trends were noted. The process can vary depending on the type of content being
reviewed, with several respondents noting that certain aspects of the review were
“constant” [P4] or “continuous[]/daily” [P22] (e.g., updating information after being
notified of a change in the law or a broken link). In other states, part of the content review
process is precipitated by others within the organization (e.g., attorneys who staff the
hotline) and external stakeholders, such as the judiciary, the access to justice commission,
and attorneys from outside of the legal services community [P3; P36].
In a number of states, the review of at least certain types of content occurs at
scheduled intervals. Several respondents detailed how the annual review of content is tied
to the state legislative calendar and/or to other key events throughout the year (e.g.,

136

review of tax information every December). As noted by one respondent, after new laws
take effect (generally in either July or August), he works to ensure that the content on the
website reflects these changes as soon as is practicable. He declined, however, to state the
length of time it generally takes to do so [P10]. Other descriptions focused on the
workflow, explaining different individuals’ roles in the process and highlighting the
importance of having at least one person overseeing everything to ensure that the
necessary work is getting done [P21; P28]. As one respondent described: “Prior to the
relaunch of LH326 in December 2013, with a couple of topic specific exceptions, content
was rarely reviewed. Going forward, each of our substantive teams will review content
for updates and changes on a quarterly basis. Team leaders are given a reminder to
complete this, which is followed up with contact to confirm it was done" [P1].
What are the main challenges you face related to the development of website
content?/What measures have you taken to address these challenges? Across the board,
responses to these two questions highlight two components of the infrastructure of the
organization/program managing the site – staffing and funding levels – that are impeding
Information Providers’ efforts to create new content and update existing content.
Staffing
Every survey respondent indicated that legal professionals (both within and outside of
the legal aid organization that manages the website) play a primary role in the
development and updating of website content. This involvement, however, appears to
have been fraught with challenges since the development of the websites. One survey
respondent, who worked on one of the earliest sites designed for advocates, noted the
26

LH3 is the latest iteration of Pro Bono Net’s LawHelp platform.

137

reluctance of lawyers to embrace technology in the early part of this century: “We had to
learn how to use and maximize the capabilities of the site – so it was on us to take the
tools and try them and use them in new ways to support our work. So the challenge was
internal (adapting to new tools and change) rather than a challenge with the tools. It was a
cultural shift that we had go through" [P5]. Other survey respondents offered similar
narratives, with one stating that early challenges included "buy in - getting legal aid
programs to see the value in developing the site (it was 2001)" [P15] and another stating
that "some staff at legal services programs thought the money was better spent on more
legal aid attorneys" [P14]. One aspect of lawyers’ early hesitation in using the Internet as
a medium for communication involved their concerns about the extent to which providing
information on the Internet was tantamount to providing legal advice [P17].
Years later, the challenges they face remain more about people than technology, as
evidenced by survey respondents’ descriptions of the problems they encounter when
working with legal professionals on the websites. These problems can be loosely grouped
into two categories:
1) Legal professionals often struggle with writing content for statewide legal
information websites; and
2) Legal professionals do not always have the time to focus on work related to the
website.
Table 5.5 provides a summary of sample survey responses that highlight each of these
problems.

with writing content for statewide every possibility and trying to prepare people for
every possibility – which may end up confusing
legal information websites
people in the end” [P24].
“So many of them just throw something together
with no or little commitment or understanding that
80% of English speaking American adults cannot
read proficiently above the 7th grade level. There
is very little commitment on the part of many
editors to ensuring that the material they dash off
in a hurry is actually useful to many of our
readers” [P21].
Legal professionals do not always
have the time to focus on work
related to the website

“While an update would be welcome, without
continuing oversight, we would again find
ourselves with inaccurate information in another
year. We face the same problem internally website maintenance and content development is
in addition to regular duties, rather than being
assigned as part of regular duties" [P1].
“One challenge is carving time away from other
responsibilities. That includes myself, for whom
web site content is only a portion of my duties; and
recruiting other program staff to contribute
content; and recruiting volunteer attorneys to
contribute content" [P41].
"We struggle to get timely responses from subject
matter experts (who are usually busy legal aid
attorneys) to help us substantively update our
content" [P14].

Respondents, however, were sympathetic to the time constraints with which legal
services and other volunteer attorneys were dealing: "[Legal services] staff are the best
providers of content but have little time to develop content" [P28]. This quote highlights

139

one of the key reasons identified by respondents for current problems in the content
review process – they want “subject matter experts” to be involved in the process but
these individuals often struggle to balance the many demands on their time. According to
several respondents, these time constraints have made it exceedingly difficult to maintain
an up-to-date and accurate website:


"With a small staff (1), it is difficult to maintain all of our content. Although some
staff attorneys, attorneys from other projects, private attorneys, AAGs [Assistant
Attorney Generals], and law students all pitch in, we are always scrambling to
keep everything current" [P22].



“We engage law student interns to serve as content assistants" but "with
thousands of pieces of content, this is a difficult task" [P15].



“We tend to rely on legal aid attorneys who are committed to make sure when the
law changes, the material on the website is updated or written to reflect changes
and who take stuff down if it is inaccurate. Even so, it can take us 2 years to
update content after the law changes" [P21].

In addition, the ongoing struggle of finding people to do content review and revision
work in a timely manner has led several respondents to deviate from (and in some cases,
abandon) those processes that they have in place. As noted by one respondent, “[m]ost
structured plans for promoting more content contribution from others have not worked
well. As a result, I've pretty much resorted to only ad hoc ‘grab someone when I see them
doing something related,’ and can convince them to convert it to web appropriate
information" [P41]. The frustration felt by several respondents was evident, with one
listing a variety of strategies her organization had implemented (“paying people to
develop/edit content, pairing them with law students for support, formally recognizing
volunteers, and more ") before concluding that "none have been totally successful, and it
remains hard" [P15].

140

Survey respondents, however, continue to work on making the processes of content
development and review more workable and several described their current efforts to
improve these processes:


"Substantive teams are being asked to include website content as part of their
team duties and are harassed to include it; the reach of the site is being
emphasized to all staff to help increase awareness of what an important service
tool this can be" [P1].



As they "have not come up with a good solution for streamlining the review
process or having to rely on external substantive experts to help us," Information
Providers are looking to hire "a business process analyst to help us look at the
content development/maintenance workflow and will be revising our content
strategy and processes accordingly" [P14].

Resources
As described in greater detail later in this chapter, many survey respondents
recognized the existing gaps between user needs and current website content, expressing
a commitment to plain language writing and developing more resources that reflect a
problem-solving approach by offering situation-specific information [P7; P17; P24; P31].
One respondent, for example, described future plans to “offer[] more interactive, intuitive
environments through the use of flowcharts, guided interviews” [P3]. Content creation of
this magnitude, however, requires funds that are not always readily available [P7]. As
observed by one respondent, “Obtaining funding is always an obstacle - the level of
funding needed to maintain a website project like this does not diminish over time, and
people tend to believe that one you launch a website, the work is done" [P24]. Several
respondents elaborated on the extent to which the development of new content is
dependent upon external sources of funding, describing current efforts to obtain funding

141

to develop screen reading tools [P21] and multi-media content targeted toward LEP
individuals [P22].
Due to the ongoing work of content development and review, website design
continues to evolve as well.
The majority of respondents (n=21) indicated that their statewide legal
information websites have undergone at least one significant revision, defined as
“changes to the overall design of the site as well as site content.” Only two respondents
affirmatively stated that no significant revisions had been undertaken. In some cases,
these revisions have been very extensive (e.g., “[W]e completely redesigned the site
between 2004-2006 with a new look, new content management system, new navigation,
and mirror sites in multiple languages" [P21]; “The original site template was replaced
with a new template and content management system. The new template brought the site
up to current web design standards and added new search functionality. The content
management system was upgraded significantly as well" [P9]). Several respondents
noted that one of the primary goals of the site redesign was to streamline content so as to
provide only that information that is perceived to be the most helpful:


“With the launch of the new LH3 platform, we have removed sections
covering topics for which we do not represent clients and therefore cannot
adequately maintain….We also removed non-legal community resource
materials, again, as we cannot keep this current, and there now exists other
resources, such as 211, to fill this need” [P1].



“We are working on implementing ‘a quality over quantity’ strategy which
would cut down on the amount of resources, but make sure that no useful
information is lost. So instead of 5 one page pamphlets, there would be one
comprehensive guide covering the same area of law. More comprehensive
information and less flyers" [P36].

142

Survey responses identified three main challenges in connection with the design of the
websites: 1) Information Providers’ lack of IT experience, 2) keeping up with
technological advancements, and 3) maintaining a user-friendly site.
Lack of IT Expertise
Not surprisingly, several respondents working on older sites observed that lack of
technological know-how was a significant challenge early on. As described by one
respondent, “"It was 1996. We had no idea what we were doing. We were using a clunky
Microsoft web platform - about the only thing that was available then. We just learned as
we went along" [P22]. Lack of technical expertise, however, continues to pose a
challenge for at least some Information Providers. One respondent working on a Drupalbased site that was developed in the past five years explained how it has been a learning
experience for everyone involved, as none of them had expertise in user interface design
or website development [P24].
The majority of other comments related to website design issues were made by
survey respondents working on Pro Bono Net sites. By and large, this group of
Information Providers appears to be very satisfied with their decision to use the LawHelp
platform. This satisfaction appears to stem, at least in part, from their limited involvement
with site design issues (see Table 5.6).

143

Table 5.6: Website Design Challenges
“We haven’t had many; we are fortunate to use a platform designed and maintained by
Pro Bono Net, who offers constant help with design" [P28]
"I am not a web programmer, and we do not have one on staff. This substantially limits
the type of design we can implement, but we are supported by Pro Bono Net, which has
the staff and foundation we are able to build upon" [P36]
"[We] must rely on Pro Bono Net to meet our design needs [but are] very vocal about our
preferences and in general Pro Bono Net is responsive and able to meet or needs” [P39]

Technological Advancements
Several respondents commented on how the fast moving nature of technology
requires them to constantly think about the next redesign of the site in an effort to keep
up with the latest trends. One respondent indicated that she was happy with the current
design of the site, but acknowledged that “it is a fast-moving world and, to keep up, we'll
have to redesign in a few years, if not sooner" [P22]. Across the board, the foremost
technological advancement upon which survey respondents are currently focused is
mobile technology and the related issue of responsive design. Half of the survey
respondents indicated that their site is currently compatible with mobile devices (n=13),
with eight (8) indicating that the site was not compatible and five (5) opting not to answer
this question.
These topics related to mobile technology came up in response to several
questions, as summarized in Table 5.7.

144

Table 5.7: Mobile Technology Issues
Survey Question

Survey Response

What are the main
challenges you face
related to the design of
the website?

“Technology changes so quickly - it is difficult and costly
to keep pace with delivering well-designed pages for
people on a variety of screen sizes, internet connections,
etc.” [P14].
“Staying on or ahead of the curve regarding the increase of
mobile device and tablet usage." [P13].

What other barriers do
you think your users face
in accessing information
on the site?

“Site not optimized for mobile and 1/3 of visitors come
from mobile devices.” [P15]

Please briefly describe
actions undertaken to
overcome [barriers to
accessing information on
the site]

“We have a fully optimized mobile version of the site so
people can access it on their smart phones if internet is hard
to access any other way.” [P24]
“We have recently launched a mobile site. We only include
resources that have been optimized for mobile viewing on
this site. We spent time creating mobile versions of our
popular resources.” [P39]
“We are trying to develop more app type information.”
[P17]

Do think the lack of
compatibility with mobile
devices poses a barrier to
users? Why or why not?

“The site does not work very well on mobile devices and is
hard to use. This is definitely a barrier. We are working on
releasing a mobile version of the website that is very
simplified and easier to navigate on a phone.” [P4]
“Making the site mobile-friendly is on our agenda for the
next year.” [P25]
“As even our low income clients move to smart phones as
their primary link to the internet, we recognize this will
become increasingly important to enable them to access
our content. However, at this point we have not developed
a structured approach to designing new content that is
mobile-friendly, or converting existing content.” [P41]

145

Maintaining a User Friendly Site
Survey respondents provided a number of reasons as to why they do not consider
their current websites to be particularly user-friendly, including the organization of
information [P1], navigation issues [P25], poor search functionality [P25], or some
combination of the three. As noted by one Information Provider, “[o]ne of the major
changes with the re-launch is to make the site more user-friendly, and better organized so
that resources do not appear in categories for which they are peripherally, at best,
relevant" [P1]. According to two respondents, the underlying problem is the overall
quantity of information:


Navigation can be challenging due to "the sheer amount of information on the
site, in that we have a good deal of resources available [and] at times it may be
hard for the user to find the information right for them" [P36].



“It takes a little time and effort to find answers to specific questions because of
the high volume of resources [we] have available and the amount of detail we go
into in our publications" [P39].

Another respondent expressed concern not with the quantity of information but rather
with the format of this content – the fact that it is heavily text-based makes it burdensome
to navigate through the website [P15]. Not surprisingly, the idea of making the site more
user-friendly was linked to mobile technology as well. One respondent expressed that she
needed to restructure the “content strategy to better serve mobile users, who make up a
bigger and bigger piece of our website users" [P14].

146

Information Providers’ focus on their target users and the barriers their users face
in accessing statewide legal information websites guides content development and
website design.
The foregoing responses related to website design are but one example of the
user-centered approach adopted by many Information Providers. Almost every aspect of
Information Providers’ work focuses, on one extent or another, user needs. Statewide
legal information websites were developed with a broad audience in mind. Survey
respondents indicated that this original audience included low-income individuals (n=24);
the general public (n=23); self-represented litigants (n=23); and legal services providers
and information intermediaries (n=21). References to target users (past and present),
however, tended to focus on one or more subsets of this broad audience: low-income
individuals, individuals with “low literacy”, and “self-represented [or pro se] litigants.”
Table 5.8 provides a selection of open-ended survey responses that show the
commonalities in descriptions offered of original and current target users.
Table 5.8: Target Users
Original Target Users

The initial purpose of the site "was to be able to widely
distribute in digital format legal information on the
various topics important to low-income individuals and
families.” [P2]
Site was intended to provide "general legal information
on topics relevant to low-income people, as the same
was not otherwise provided beyond a few brochures.”
[P28]
“Legal information needs identified through a survey of
court staff and judges “to determine what types of cases
pro se litigants most often faced in their courts. Existing
legal self-help centers were surveyed about the most
popular topics of self-represented litigants; legal aid
attorneys were also surveyed about the unmet needs of
low income individuals.” [P24]

147

Original Target Users
(cont’d)
Current Target Users

The site was developed “to provide self-help information
to self-represented litigants and to connect low-income
individuals with local legal aid programs.” [P10]
The home page was redesigned “to cater more to lowincome individuals." [P3]
"Our web site has an extensive library of original content
written specifically for low-literacy individuals for use
in [our] state.” [P39]
"We provide interactive court forms and calculators. This
includes our very complex stateside Child Support
Worksheet. Although we developed it for low-income
pro se's, we know that law firms and court personnel
also use the calculator on a regular basis.” [P22]
The site is meant to provide "instructions for going to
court on your own and solving legal problems that are not
yet in court, substantive legal information in areas
relevant to lower-income populations (family law,
public benefits, housing, consumer law).” [P15]

Some Information Providers take an even narrower view of their target audience,
focusing on clients (presumably, clients of the legal aid organization that maintains the
website) [P1; P17]. Regardless of how they define their target audience, Information
Providers are aware of the myriad barriers that their users may face in their efforts to
access information. Limited literacy, limited English language proficiency, and lack of
understanding of legal terminology were the most frequently cited barriers (see Figure
5.3).

148

Figure 5.3: What, if any, barriers do you think your users face in accessing
information on the site?

Several respondents noted the persistence of technological barriers, with one
acknowledging that access to computers and smartphones remains a problem for some
individuals [P13] and another pointing out that “some of the larger self-help packets have
a large file size that may take time to download if you have a slow connection” [P39].
In addition to answering the above question, respondents were given the
opportunity to specify other perceived barriers. Several identified different facets of the
struggles that non-lawyers face when trying to locate relevant legal information – they
may not understand basic legal concepts [P28]; they may be dealing with a set of related
legal issues but “that type of combined information is rarely found on the web" [P17]; or,
they may not even understand that their problem is, in fact, legal in nature [P14].
Of the barriers identified above in Figure 5.3, many ongoing efforts to improve
access to information on the website focus on overcoming literacy-related challenges:
limited literacy, lack of understanding of legal terminology, and limited English language
proficiency. Ten survey respondents specifically referenced “plain language,” stressing

149

the need to provide content that is written at a level appropriate for target users and to
explain legal terminology and concepts in a way that is understandable to laypersons.
Table 5.9 provides a sample of responses to open-ended survey questions that highlight
Information Providers’ commitment to plain language writing.
Table 5.6: Plain Language Issues
Survey Question
Please describe any
unexpected obstacles that
were encountered during the
initial development of the site.

Sample Responses
“Recognizing the challenge of putting legal
information in comprehensible (i.e., reading level of
6th-8th grade) format.” [P41]

What measures have you
taken to address these
challenges [to the
development of website
content]?

“I will not publish most information that does not meet
a certain level of plain language. There are exceptions
but, for the most part … [w]e edit and edit and edit
until we get it to the reading level we need.” [P21]
“Our content development staff have been trained in
how to write in plain language and we strive to keep
all content at a 6th grade reading level to keep all
content accessible to self-represented people. We
brainstorm together to try to simplify concepts; we
outline our content to keep a tight scope of focus.”
[P24]
“The Legal Content Editor is trained in plain language
writing and has reviewed and rewritten most existing
content applying these techniques." [P39]

Please briefly describe actions
undertaken to overcome
[barriers].

"[We] make every effort to deliver information in
Plain English. We strive for an 8th grade reading level
on the Flesch-Kincaid scale.” [P22]
“Keeping the reading level at 6th grade to be
accessible for low literacy individuals….[and]
defining all legal terminology used”; "built a lexicon
into the site to give descriptions of commonly used
words." [P24]
"[O]ur goal is 70 to 80 on the Flesch Reading Ease
score, which is approximately 7th grade level." [P2]

150

Another aspect of access involves the extent to which a user can locate information
throughout the various sections of a website. One respondent noted that the primary role
of live chat operators, for example, is to navigate users through the site to the most
helpful information [P36].
Survey respondents also discussed measures being taken to provide more
assistance to LEP individuals. Three states have recently added Spanish language mirror
sites [P15; P24; P39]. A fourth state has developed mirror sites in six of the most
frequently spoken non-English languages and, in connection therewith, the Information
Provider is currently devoting staff resources to the management and oversight of
translation-related activities (e.g., having an Americorps member maintain a spreadsheet
to track activities and expenditures related to translations) [P21].
As for efforts to address the other observed barriers, respondents said very little.
Notwithstanding the fact that 15 respondents acknowledged disabilities as a barrier to
access (see Figure 5.3), only two specifically mentioned measures they had taken to
address accessibility issues. One respondent noted that “their website is screen readable
and accessible meeting W3C standards" [P21], while another acknowledged that “we
have not fully made our website bobby-compliant for users with disabilities, but we have
optimized many features and hope to work on this more in the future” [P24].
Information Providers use a variety of mechanisms to gather information about site
usage and their actual users that provide some insight into user needs.
In an effort to ascertain what Information Providers currently know about their
actual (as opposed to target) users, the survey asked several questions about the collection

151

of website usage data, demographic information from users, and feedback from users.
The majority of sites collect usage data, with only two respondents affirmatively saying
that they do not do so. Only four survey respondents indicated that demographic
information is collected – two inquire about location of residence, family size, income,
and race/ethnicity; one inquires only about location of residence; and one inquires about
income and race/ethnicity.
Website usage data is generally reviewed on a regular basis, with seven and nine
respondents, respectively indicating that review occurs at least once a month or once
every six months (see Figure 5.4).
Figure 5.4: How often do you analyze website usage data?

In addition to being asked to provide information about total number of visitors, total
page views, and most frequently visited pages, respondents were asked to provide a brief
summary of what they learned the last time they analyzed this data. From this series of
questions, data from 14 states were compiled, and three major trends were noted: 1) an
increase in total number of visitors from 2012 to 2013 occurred in every state where this
information was available, 2) family law and housing are the two most popular content

152

areas, and 3) mobile usage is increasing. Table 5.10 provides a summary of the
information collected in response to these questions.

In responding to these questions, several respondents noted that they were seeing
increased traffic from search engines (e.g., “Visits via search have grown steadily as well,
from about 50% in 2010 to almost 75% currently”[P41]; “More people are being referred
to our site from Google and Bing than in the past” [P24]).
A majority of respondents (n=17) indicated that they solicit feedback from users
through an online feedback form, whereas fewer respondents solicit feedback through
either email or personal discussion (n=6). Several respondents mentioned other means
utilized to solicit user feedback, including conducting “outreach workshops” [P21] and
placing a survey at the end of a LHI online interview [P24].
To better understand the nature of this feedback, survey respondents were asked to
provide examples of compliments, requests, and complaints they have received. As
indicated by the sample of responses provided below in Table 5.11, users who take the
time to provide feedback appear to be satisfied with the content that is available on the
site (in particular, the forms) but would like to see more content that better meets their
specific needs.

156

Users’ requests for situation-specific information and for assistance directly from a
person highlight their need for information that can assist them with a legal problem that
they are currently facing. One respondent, however, noted the difficulty in meeting this
particular user need: "Each individual is looking for legal information specific to their
issue and current situation. We have content in most areas that is general, but there is no
way to create specific content for each unique situation" [P13]. Despite the fact that the
provision of legal advice is outside the purview of statewide legal information websites,
several survey respondents indicated that advice is precisely what some users are looking
to receive through the website:


“They wish they could talk to someone or ask a question” [P39].



“Even though it clearly says we can't answer questions they think they can just
email in a question or can talk to someone on the website" [P4].



"We get a lot of people telling us their whole life story, seeking help. They are
looking for representation, but none is available" [P15].

In recognition of this need, several respondents also highlighted the prominent location of
legal service provider directories on their sites, the purpose of which is to connect users
with organizations that can help them with their specific legal issues [P4; P9; P39].
Although the survey did not directly inquire about whether usability testing was
conducted, respondents from two states did indicate that important feedback from users
was obtained in this way. One respondent stated that usability testing was done during a
recent redesign of the site, leading to a change “from a drill-down menu to a simple
search engine based on usability testing" [P14]. Another respondent made a reference to

157

usability testing conducted during the early stages of the project, noting that this testing
resulted in an improved user interface “to help those who are digital literacy challenged”
[P24]. The difficulty in finding target users who are willing to participate in usability
testing or otherwise participate in website evaluation/design may be one reason why more
states have not done it. This difficulty, as noted by the respondents from both of the states
in which usability testing was conducted, also explains why intermediaries (e.g., legal aid
attorneys, hotline staff) played such an important role in the identification of user needs
during the development phase – they acted as a proxy for the actual target users who
could not be reached.
And, finally, while the survey also did not specifically inquire as to how, if at all,
the Information Providers use the feedback they collect, one respondent elaborated on
how it provided her with valuable insight into user needs: “Much of our content is
determined by questions our users ask in their feedback forms; we clarify content if it
appears that people have misunderstood it or have questions about it; we create new
content if people ask questions for which we do not already have answers, if the
questions fit within the [scope of the website]” [P21]. Two respondents noted that
feedback received via various means (e.g., LiveHelp, online forms, and phone calls) was
a driving force behind ad hoc content review [P3; P13].
Based on their perception of target users’ information needs and the information
they have collected from actual users, Information Providers have defined ideas for
improving their sites in terms of both content development and website design.
The survey asked respondents to assess the extent to which the website currently
meets the information needs of users. Of the respondents who answered this question, all

158

but one believes that the site currently meets their users’ information needs “mostly”
(n=13) or “somewhat” (n=5) (Figure 5.5).
Figure 5.5: To what extent do you think the website currently meets your users’
information needs?

Notwithstanding their overall favorable views of the current generation of websites,
survey respondents generally expressed a desire to add to and improve their sites. These
improvements/additions can be grouped into three broad categories: the incorporation of
new technologies (e.g., document assembly, online intake, guided interviews, triage) to
present content in different formats; expansion into new legal content areas; and, making
the sites more useful for LEP individuals. The sample of survey responses presented in
Table 5.12 provide more information about respondents’ “wish lists” (or, in some cases,
current efforts) in each of these areas.

159

Table 5.12: The Future of Statewide Legal Information Websites
Incorporation of new
technologies to present
content in different format

“I think we need some triage tools to help guide people
to specific resources. We have started to address this
by creating 'mini-portals’ for dissolution, eviction,
foreclosure, and healthcare that group related resources
together and provide some guidance on where to start.”
[P39]
“[T]hey would like to move from information-based
content to learning-based content - if we can make our
content more interactive and engaging, then people
will be more likely to retain what they learn and be
more successful in resolving their legal issue." [P14]
“Our current approach is almost entirely based on a
model of "text on the web." We have very little
information in audio, video, animation, interview
query, or other more creative approaches. That's my
personal goal for growing our site to another level of
usefulness.” [P41]

Expansion into new legal
content areas

“Our shortcoming are the gaps, what we don't have.
There's never enough time or resources to cover
everything, and the challenge is to continuously build
out new areas of information, with more depth." [P41]
“[M]ore and more people are unable to consult an
attorney and are turning to self-help materials, we need
to add more content on more areas," including family
law, bankruptcy, and foreclosure. [P16]
"One of my current challenges is keeping up with
useful information for people facing foreclosure. We
have some good content and volunteer attorneys have
been helpful with it. But now there are new CFPB
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] rules around
loss mitigation and other continual changes with
servicing rules. We are also trying to keep up with
current consumer information around prepaid cards,
mobile banking and related topics with moving targets.
We are still looking for experts to help with this
content." [P22]

160

Increasing the usefulness of
sites for LEP individuals

“We are just beginning to try and develop translation
memory systems and tools to help keep our
translations accurate and consistent.” [P21]

Several survey respondents noted, however, that their ability to make these additions and
improvements is currently compromised by limited resources, namely, staff and money:


“We are limited by our resources - only one dedicated staff person to manage
several sites" [P22].



“For the areas we have covered, there is extremely comprehensive information,
including background information and step-by-step instructions for how to do
different legal processes. However, there are many subject areas that we still need
to cover....We are still new, and we are a staff of 5, and we cannot quickly provide
content of the high quality that we demand - it takes more time and staff" [P24].

This challenge is aptly illustrated by one respondent’s description of how, several years
ago, his organization received TIG funding to produce templates for frequently used
family law documents. Through this experience, they learned “that document assembly
requires a significant commitment of resources, to have a staff person with substantial (if
not full-time) assignment to developing and maintaining document assembly templates
and interviews" [P41].
D. THEMES TO EXPLORE IN INTERVIEWS
The survey responses described throughout this chapter shaped the development of
the next stage of data collection – interviews with survey respondents and additional
Information Providers. One issue that emerged from the survey responses – resource
constraints – brought to light the important role of the broader legal services context in
which statewide legal information websites exists, raising two important questions: 1)
How do the websites “fit” within the organization that maintains them?, and 2) How do

161

external organizations (e.g., LSC, Pro Bono Net) currently support the websites? These
resource constraints also raise interesting questions about the ability of Information
Providers to do more – many survey respondents identified innovations that they are
interested in adding to the site but do insufficient staff and funds prevent them from
doing so?
Viewing statewide legal information websites as part of the broader legal services
context also encourages a shift away from thinking of about them solely as technology
projects. Indeed, the survey responses suggest that Information Providers’ work on
statewide legal information websites has been less about the technical “nuts and bolts” of
website development and more on how to use the websites as a vehicle for delivering
information and services to their target users. Building upon this notion, interview
questions were developed to explore not only what activities they are engaging in but also
how they are doing so.
The overarching purpose of the interviews was to explore states’ different paths in
greater depth, honing in on key themes related to collaboration, content development and
website design focused on lowering barriers to information access faced by target users,
and the current state of knowledge about actual users. The interviews thus were carefully
designed to examine issues related to infrastructure elements and current practices,
seeking to develop a clearer idea as to how these different pieces can fit together to form
a program designed to provide legal information and services to self-help users.

162

CHAPTER 6: INTERVIEW FINDINGS
The interviews, as the final stage of data collection in this study, sought to explore
the different ways in which states have engaged in content development, website design,
outreach and evaluation – the four principal program activities identified through the pilot
case study and the survey. Having developed an understanding of what Information
Providers are doing, the interviews were essential in answering the question of how they
are approaching these activities. By using the experiences of Information Providers to
develop this understanding of “how,” we can then begin to build a knowledge base that
aids policy and practice now, while also enabling future studies focused on effectiveness
to have practical value. It does little good to know that what one state is doing is effective
(i.e., providing meaningful assistance to self-help users) if we have only a limited
understanding of how they have approached principal program activities.
A. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT INTERVIEWS
Interviews were conducted with 27 individuals – 22 interviewees are current
Information Professionals, 1 is a former Information Provider, 3 are staff members at Pro
Bono Net, and 1 is a former Information Professional and former Pro Bono Net staff
member. Interviewees came from the following states: Colorado, Connecticut (2),
Florida, Idaho, Illinois (2), Indiana, Kansas (2), Massachusetts, Maine (2), Maryland
(2),27 Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Tennessee (2), Texas, Vermont, and West
Virginia. Current Information Providers hold various professional positions, as set forth
in Table 6.1:
Individuals currently working on the People’s Law Library of Maryland were interviewed at this
time so as to explore the themes identified through the survey.

Throughout June and July 2014, 25 interviews were conducted via telephone, and
2 were conducted in-person. In two instances, two Information Providers were
interviewed at the same time. The interviews ranged in length from 10 minutes to 65
minutes, with a mean time of 31 minutes and a median time of 28 minutes.
Twelve of the interviewees had completed the survey prior to the interview.
Although the interviews with “new” interviewees included more background discussion
(e.g., about the initial development of the site), the same general topics were covered in
all of the interviews: the role of the LSC; funding; staffing; processes for content
development and review; interactions with other organizations; outreach efforts; program
evaluation; and recommendations for the future. In addition, Information Providers who
work on LawHelp sites were asked to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using that
particular platform.

164

During interviews with individuals who had completed the survey, certain topics
brought up in response to open-ended questions were explored in greater depth. For
example, several survey respondents indicated that they had worked in some capacity
with libraries and/or domestic violence advocacy organizations. Accordingly, during the
interviews, interviewees were asked to provide more details about these particular
collaborations. Table 6.2 provides sample questions that were asked in each of these
topic areas. For more detailed information about the interview questions, sample
interview guides for survey respondents and “new” interviewees are attached as
Appendix I and Appendix J, respectively.

The purpose of the interviews with Pro Bono Net staff members was two-fold: 1) to learn
more about online forms (one of the features brought up frequently in the surveys),28 and
2) to explore the role that Pro Bono Net has played – and continues to play – in fostering
collaboration among statewide legal information websites.
Information about 17 states was collected through interviews. Using Nvivo,
interview transcripts were coded.29 The codes used in connection with the analyses of the
PLL pilot case study and the open-ended survey responses served as a starting point for
the analysis of interview data; however, open coding was also employed to allow new
themes and ideas to come to light. This process yielded six main categories and sixteen
sub-categories. These categories reflect many of earlier themes, although they have
undergone a substantial reconfiguration. Once the categories and sub-categories were

28

Pro Bono Net, in collaboration with LSC and the Ohio State Legal Services Association,
maintains LHI, a website developed to facilitate document assembly initiatives across the
country.
29

In those instances in which two Information Providers were interviewed together, only one
transcript was produced. Thus, 25 transcripts were analyzed, but each interviewee has a separate
designation.

166

finalized, the interview transcripts were reviewed again and codes were created for
associated concepts. Table 6.3 presents the major categories, sub-categories, and key
associated concepts that guided the thematic analysis of interview data. The number in
parentheses following each concept represents the number of interview transcripts in
which that concept appeared.

After identifying the categories and associated concepts, data from each transcript were
analyzed to determine which nodes were most frequently used during the process of
coding. This created a “rough outline” of the way Information Providers responded to
interview questions, facilitating a better sense of the main areas of focus during each
interview (Guest et al., 2012). For each transcript, the five most frequently used codes
(based on percentage coverage) were recorded. Using the coding scheme laid out above,
Table 6.4 presents the principal findings from this analysis, namely, key concepts within
each main category that were a focal point during more than one interview. The number
in parentheses is the number of interview transcripts in which that particular node was
one of the top five.

“A2J stakeholder organizations” are organizations with which Information Providers work that
are located within the same state as the statewide legal information website.

The breadth and depth in which certain topics were discussed, as captured in Tables 6.3
and 6.4, offer important insight into Information Providers’ perspectives on the current
and future state of affairs of their websites. The following discussion uses the coding
scheme as a framework for organizing the main themes that emerged from the interview
data. Its primary focus is an exploration of the three interrelated topics that were covered
in most of the interviews with some depth: Infrastructure, Current Activities, and
Collaboration. The other topics – People, External Environment, Current Website, and
Future – were often discussed within the context of these three topics and thus will be
woven in throughout the discussion.

169

It should be noted that a number of the Information Providers interviewed do not
directly deal with website design. It is often handled by either an IT support person
within the organization that maintains the site or an outside contractor. Website design is
indeed a key program activity but currently does not appear to be creating significant
challenges or issues for the Information Providers interviewed. As such, the topic of
website design was typically discussed in rather general terms, such as when interviewees
were providing background information on the development of the site [P6; P10; P13;
P17; P22; P23; P26; P28] or describing the increasing importance of having a mobile
responsive site [P14; P34; P37; P41]. To the extent that these issues were largely
addressed in the previous chapter, only a select number of findings related to website
design will be discussed here.
Where relevant, data from the interviews with Pro Bono Net staff members and
materials provided by interviewees are introduced as well to enhance the discussion of
specific findings. Pro Bono Net staff members, in some cases, were able to provide a
broader context for the discussions of infrastructure and external environment elements
that emerged during many of the interviews. Because they are not focused on any one
particular state but are privy to what is going on within the operations of many websites,
Pro Bono Net staff members were able to offer valuable insight into the issues and
challenges that span across the network of statewide legal information websites.

170

B. MAIN THEMES
B.1. Infrastructure
Funding
Funding – past, present, and future – is at the forefront of Information Providers’
minds. In the context of statewide legal information websites, LSC is often at the center
of any discussion of funding. Accordingly, interviewees were asked to talk about the role
of the LSC in developing and maintaining their websites. Information Providers from 12
states confirmed that the LSC, through the TIG program, was initially a primary source of
funding. For those states without an existing website, the sizeable grants offered by LSC
in the early years (approximately $500,000, according to one Information Provider)
created the impetus to develop an online presence [P17]. In other states, TIG money
provided them with the means to bolster their existing online presence through outreach,
partnership building, and related activities [P28] or to build up an infrastructure around
the website (e.g., create an IT support position) [P41].
The extent to which states have continued to rely on TIG money since that initial
grant cycle varies, with one Information Provider estimating that they received funding
for at least another three to six years [P28] and another discussing the different uses to
which they have put TIG money over the years (e.g., website development initially and
then community outreach focused on libraries) [P6]. Several interviewees also indicated
that current technology projects related to the websites are being funded with TIG money
[P13; P14; P21; P22; P23; P36; P21]. One state, in particular, has several ongoing TIG

171

projects including the development of 1) videos to incorporate into the statewide legal
information website, and 2) a mobile website and apps [P22; P23].
What is clear, however, is that TIG money did not remain the sole – or even a
primary – source of funding for long, forcing Information Providers to find alternative
means to support the continued operation of their websites. Several different approaches
to dealing with this transition were identified throughout the interviews. The approach
adopted by legal services organizations in several states has been to treat the website
essentially as an operating cost and move it “in house” [P13; P17; P18; P28; P29]. As one
Information Provider explained, with no funds being earmarked for the site, the
responsibility for maintaining it has been folded into staff members’ other job duties
[P18]. In some cases, Information Providers now use grant funds received for broader
initiatives to make related website enhancements:
Right now, [money] comes from wherever we can get it from … you can see a
DV [domestic violence] helpline on our site, we use the funding from that grant to
upgrade the information on that service that we provide. If there’s foreclosure
information, we use that funding and so on and so forth. But, there’s no funding
dedicated to this website right now [P29].
Among those who continue to seek external support for the operation of the website, state
bar foundations were most frequently cited as an important source of funding [P6; P7;
P10; P24; P36]. Other sources of funding mentioned by interviewees include the State
Justice Institute, a non-profit corporation established by Federal law31 [P6]; general LSC
funds [P37]; state government agencies [P37]; lawyers’ trust funds (i.e., IOLTA) [P14];
and donations from law firms and individuals [P14]. State government money, in some

31

The State Justice Institute “award[s] grants to improve the quality of justice in State courts,
facilitate better coordination between State and Federal courts, and foster innovative, efficient
solutions to common issues faced by all courts” (State Justice Institute, n.d., “About SJI)

172

instances, has been tied to certain initiatives, such as healthcare [P37] and mortgage
foreclosure settlement [P14]. One of the most recent statewide legal information websites
to launch was originally funded with TIG money but is now funded by a local chapter of
a national non-profit trade association. That organization currently has approximately
$17,000 in funding to maintain a statewide website for social services referral
information. Through this partnership, the legal services organization has developed a
website that includes both social services and legal information and is now using the
available funds to maintain and market the site [P34].
In a number of cases, discussions of the fluidity of funding sources segued into
broader discussions about the instability of the legal services environment. It was, in fact,
this instability that spurred the development of statewide legal information websites in
some states [P23; P31]. The political environment of the 1980s drove some legal services
providers to consider more cost-effective means of service delivery32:
Well, one of the things that precipitated our moving to the Internet, were funding
cuts…for the program as a whole. I’m not real good at time but…sometime during
the Reagan years, there was a threat that we would be reduced to zero funding and we
just didn’t know what our future was going to be, what service we would be able to
continue to provide and we viewed this as a way that, if we were severely cut back,
we could still provide a level of service to our clients with the fewest personnel, if
you will, that we would need to maintain that level of service [P23].
More recently, this country’s economic climate of the past few years has ushered in
another wave of budgetary contractions within the legal services community. The end
result for some Information Providers is a prohibitively small budget [P6; P7; P10; P29].
According to the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA), “[t]he Reagan
Administration was openly hostile to legal services and initially sought its complete
elimination….In response to pressure from the White House, Congress reduced funding for
[LSC] for 1982 by 25%....[T]his reduction[] coincided with a national economic recession and a
marked reduction…in programs affecting poor people, substantially increasing the eligible
population and the demand for legal services” (NLADA, n.d.).
32

173

Statewide legal information websites in those states where funds are no longer earmarked
for the site have been particularly hard hit [P10; P14; P21; P28]. For example:


“The funding was stable and growing for the first maybe three or four years
that I’ve been in this role. But, again because we’re funded to do this work by
the bar foundation, and the interest rates have gone down, and the bar
foundation has used up its reserves, and it’s had to cut [the] statewide website
grant from a high water mark of about $144,000 down to $100,000. So … the
funding has [risen] and it’s fallen. On neither end has it been stable” [P10].



“The problem with being funded substantially through the lawyer’s trust fund
is that interest rates … have been extremely low so that’s been a flat source of
funding, [and] you know, when that’s your primary source of funding, that’s
difficult …. [A]nd then of course, the [statewide] Equal Justice Fund is
dependent entirely on sort of the legislative process and…that’s tentative
every year – we’re never sure if the funding is going to remain. If they’re
going to cut it, how much they’ll cut it. [I]t’s…been stable for the past few
years, [but] it was cut substantially about three or four years ago…and that
had an impact” [P14].

Staffing
Current funding constraints tie directly into the staffing challenges that many
interviewees discussed. As a preliminary matter, interviewees were asked about the
number of staff members working on the site. Information Providers working on two
statewide legal information websites described having dedicated staffs of twelve and five
individuals, respectively [P14; P24]. With the former, both the English and Spanish
versions of the website have a dedicated legal content manager. Other Information
Providers lack this type of dedicated staff but rely upon administrative support personnel
or “tech folks” within the organization to provide assistance with posting content to the
site and related tasks [P6; P13; P21; P28; P41]. Several interviewees initially indicated
that they were the only one currently working on the site [P17; P22] but later clarified

174

their answers to express that others contributed content and/or worked on technical issues
related to the site. Other interviewees described a situation in which everything related to
the website flows through them [P10; P13; P18; P21], with one describing herself as the
“conductor” of the site [P6]. These individuals effectively function as gatekeepers: “What
you really need to do is, as the one putting stuff up, is sort of wade through all of it and
say ‘well, this would be really good’, ‘that can just stay on their website’…and then what
you do is try to fill the gaps in” [P36]. Thus, the general sentiment among most
Information Providers is that they currently are the only ones in the organization whose
primary responsibility is the website.
Regardless of the number of people who currently work on the site, interviewees
generally expressed some level of dissatisfaction with the current level of staffing.
Several Information Providers indicated that, without more staff, they are limited in their
ability to expand the site through additional content development [P10; P17; P21; P22;
P29; P41] or outreach efforts [P7]. As one interviewee mused: “Do we have enough
people so that we have a functioning website, which we are more or less able to keep
current? Yes…Could we have a much more robust site, could we have a lot more content
on the public access [site], in particular, if we have more people dealing with it? Oh yes”
[P41]. Examples of what Information Providers would do with more staff include:


“I guess if I were going to continue to be in a fantasy land, it would be really nice
to have a halftime [employee] to either operate LiveHelp or to be a coordinator of
volunteers to provide LiveHelp because we are one of the few Pro Bono Net
states that don’t have LiveHelp” [P10]



“The most I’d like to see is more content providers. And, then on top of that, I
mean, almost equally, I would like a huge budget to edit that staff….The other
thing – almost – I’d almost put it right up there – I’d really love to have a
translation coordinator” [P21]

175



“So that’s what I would like to have…the resources to do, is to get more
attorneys…to really, you know, do specific, more complex, legal content than
what we have right now” [P28].



“[I]f I could get more people more willing to play an active role – both in writing
or in editing and review….you know, we would have more content and we would
spread this around and I think it would grow as something, ideally, grow as
something that everybody has some investment in. I’ve been talking about that
for 7, 8, 9 years now” [P41].

A related challenge is the fact that, in almost every case, the staff members (from within
the organization that maintains the site) and volunteers from other organizations that
assist the Information Provider with the site are overburdened. Interviewees described
situations in which legal services attorneys are too busy serving their clients to develop
content for the site [P6; P7; P34] or initially express interest in developing content but
then fail to follow through [P17]. Other Information Providers described volunteer
fatigue – people are continually being asked to help out more to make up for the funding
and staffing reductions that so many legal services organizations are facing and it is
becoming increasingly difficult to find people who are willing to take on yet another
commitment. As one interviewee explained, “Maybe I can come up with a couple of
people that have a grant with an outreach component and then they’ll really getting fired
up? But, at this point, we’re asking people in grantee programs who are already
volunteering for clinics, and they’re already volunteering for community ed….And, at
some point, even I don’t want to do any more volunteering” [P35].

176

B.2. Current Activities
Information Providers engage in three main program activities – Content
Development and Review, Evaluation, and Outreach – against this backdrop of staffing
and budgetary constraints.
Content Development and Review
a. Goals
In speaking about the various activities involved in currently maintaining a statewide
legal information website, Information Providers focused the most on what they are
doing to create new content and update existing content. An interviewee working on a
relatively new site, for example, indicated that her primary goal for the time being is to
build “a really solid foundation of content” [P24]. Information Providers described
different processes for building this foundation of content but an identification of user
needs, involving an examination of what was going on in legal services organizations and
courts, was a common starting point [P7; P18; P23; P24]. In the words of a former
Information Provider who worked on the initial development of a site, “The area in which
we, as a program, were – saw the most unmet need was in family law. So, we tended to
focus a lot on family law. What we did was look at the unmet need in all of the areas of
law that our clients came in contact with and tried to focus on the ones… [where] there
was the most unmet need – that was principally family law but housing as well [and]
public benefits” [P23]. A few Information Providers emphasized how the target audience
was actually composed of a number of diverse user groups, noting that different language

177

and socio-economic circumstances can give rise to different information needs [P16;
P21].
For other Information Providers, current goals are focused more on re-organizing
content in a way that is intuitive to target users33 [P19; P27; P35; P36]. One Information
Provider discussed several ways that he planned to improve the organization of
information on the site, such as highlighting the most in-demand content by creating an
“essential information” section and weeding out single page fliers/brochures that provide
too little information to be of any real assistance. He explained,
One of the problems you face with…statewide legal websites – is that first you start
off with not enough information but then you get too much. You don’t want to take
any down because it’s valuable so what you have to start doing is start highlighting
information that will help most people….So we try to make sure that the stuff we’re
going to highlight is the best stuff and the stuff that’s easy to understand. And we’re
going to show them that there is real information here, then we can link them in. Once
they know there is something real here, then they are more inclined to stay and really
find information that they need [P36].
Information Providers also discussed a desire to help users overcome their lack of
understanding as to how the legal system works (“What you see a lot of the time is that
people just file any form and they don’t understand how bad it is once you file a form –
you don’t understand that the court now needs you to file something to correct that, much
less move on” [P36]), as well as their lack of knowledge about the very existence of the
self-help resources that are available to help them [P7].
And, finally, content development is also driven by users’ technology-based
needs. Three Information Providers currently working on sites that are not optimized for

In discussing target users, self-represented litigants [P18; P24; P26; P28; P34; P35], lowincome individuals [P13; P14; P17; P18; P34; P35; P37], legal aid clients [P21; P22; P28; P29;
P31; P37], low literacy individuals [P21; P23; P26; P29] and LEP individuals [P13; P14; P21]
were all mentioned.
33

178

mobile devices recognized that this was a barrier that needed to be addressed [P6; P18;
P41]. Several Information Providers expressly cited the increasing use of mobile devices
by low-income and rural users as the impetus for their current efforts to design a mobile
responsive site [P6; P34].
b. Contributors
In a number of interviews, the topic of content development and review came up first
in response to questions about the number of staff members currently contributing to the
site. As discussed in the previous section, while there may be only one person whose
primary responsibility is the website, he or she is generally not sole person working on
the site. In terms of content-related work, interviewees typically rely upon one or more of
the following groups for assistance:
Individuals who work within the organization that maintains the site [P6; P13; P17;
P21; P22; P28; P36] – In addition to writing new content, as well as updating and
reviewing existing content, this group’s in-depth knowledge of certain areas of law (the
“substantive experts” identified by some survey respondents) can be helpful to
Information Providers who consider themselves to be generalists. This collaboration can
be facilitated by tying it to the development of the attorney’s other work projects. As
explained by one interviewee:
Let’s say that we have… a grant for an example for an identity theft project so
one of our staff attorneys will be in charge of that project and we might write into
that some additional updates to the websites in that particular area of the site so
that we can create content related to some specific substantive area and so…we
will use our attorneys to create any new substantive specific content but then
they’ll pass that on to me in an electronic format and then I’ll take that and then
create the pages or upload the documents to the website [P13].

179

A2J stakeholder organizations [P7; P10; P13; P18; P29; P34; P36] – During the early
stages of developing their sites, some Information Providers reached out to other
organizations in order to ensure that there was enough content on the site when it
launched. As described by one interviewee, after inventorying the materials available on
other statewide legal information websites, she concluded that she lacked sufficient
resources to develop enough valuable content on her own [P34]. She was fortunate,
however, because one legal services organization in the state had a strong community
education department, which had developed and already made available online a large
library of newsletters, handouts, articles, and other materials written specifically for
clients. With the assistance of this organization, as well as others, they were able to post
materials on important topics (e.g., the Affordable Care Act) in a timely manner.
In other states, A2J stakeholder organizations have been working closely with
Information Providers to develop content and resources specifically for the website,
including interactive forms and materials for specific populations, such as domestic
violence survivors [P13; P18; P34; P36]. Such collaborative efforts with “likeminded
organizations” can be grant-driven [P13]. Several Information Providers suggested that
LSC grantee organizations have an obligation to contribute to the website [P27; P36],
with one asserting that specific grant assurances create this obligation.34
Volunteers from the private bar, law schools, and other organizations [P7; P14;
P18; P21; P36; P41] – In addition to having volunteers help out with creating and

This position appears to have merit. Pursuant to the 2014 LSC Grant Assurances, LSC grantee
organizations “will work with other LSC and non-LSC funded legal services providers in the
State to ensure that there is a statewide website that publishes a full range of relevant and up-todate community education/pro se related materials and referral information, at least covering the
common topics facing the client communities on the subject matter that are the [organization’s]
priorities.”

updating written content, Information Providers rely on them for various forms of
assistance, including staffing the LiveHelp chat service that is built into the website [P14;
P24; P36]; the translation of materials for mirror sites [P14]; the development of videos
and e-publications [P21]; and the transcription of videos and archived webinars [P14]).
Table 6.5 offers a sample of quotes from interviewees about the various ways in which
individuals from each of these groups provide assistance with content development and
review.

wasn’t there a new law passed?” [P28]

“[The site launch] was right in the middle
of ramping up for the Affordable Care
Act and so some of our ready partners
that often provide materials or develop
materials for us were already committed
to providing and developing materials
around enrollment so we wanted to be
able to…connect with whatever was
developed.” [P34]

Creating New

“[T]he other thing we did with direct help
from LSC was partner with the court
system to develop interactive smart forms
for the courts and also allowed us to, sort
of, nudge the courts forward in terms of
their own involvement with pro se
assistance.” [P36]

Creating New
Content

“[Law students] go through and brief an
issue and then I’ll go over it and make
some changes, have them make more
changes – because I want them to learn,
especially if they’re law students.
Because otherwise it’s not worth their

Volunteers

182

In some cases, each of these groups plays a role in the development of a single piece of
content. As described by one Information Provider, he has used materials developed by
other organizations as a foundation for creating content specifically for his website users:
[S]ometimes…publications are written as a way to give people a general
orientation – what we do is we’ll take that publication and we’ll post it, but then
we’ll write a new publication that says straight up, “here are the answers to these
common questions.” For instance, the Department of Labor has a lot of
publications on the rights of undocumented workers, but…my co-attorney and
I…noticed that there’s some specific questions that come up all the time [during
conversations with clients] that are not specifically answered in those
publications. So…what we did, I had a law school volunteer write a publication
on the employment rights of undocumented workers and then what we did is we
had it translated in Spanish and Vietnamese [P36].

c. Challenges
Working with these different groups of individuals poses challenges for many
Information Providers. Not everyone within the organizations that maintain the websites,
for example, is equally invested in maintaining them. The website may, in fact, be seen as
the Information Provider’s project, as opposed to an organization-wide initiative:
[S]ometimes, you’re a victim of your own success. I worked hard at it early and
everybody else got used to the fact that I was working on it. They were not and they
were getting something out of it. And so, you know, then you have sort of dampened
the channels through which volunteers might otherwise flow [P41].
Other Information Providers described their early struggles to convince their co-workers
to embrace the use of technology in the delivery of legal services [P17; P23]. Years later,
Information Providers report that this problem persists as they meet with resistance from
people within their organizations who remain skeptical of technology or who have a
limited understanding of it:

183



“I know another big thing in the community is apps. I’m not a big proponent of
that – I have no clue what a poor person would do with [one], OK? I don’t know
what a poverty law app is. I mean – my boss came to me like, “we should get
money for an app” and I was like “what app do you want to make?” You just
can’t say the name ‘app’ and go ‘OK’” [P17].



“[W]ell, I hate to say this too but generally as a body, [and] there are plenty of
exceptions to this, but as a body, the legal services grantee organizations have not
grasped the concept that the legal profession is moving to an electronic-based
online based delivery. So, there’s resistance in the leadership, probably because
they don’t really get it. I’m not saying that they’re not forward-thinking, I’m
thinking that they just don’t get it. And when I got on this advisory committee, I
didn’t get it. But I knew I didn’t get it. So, I went on… the TIG site and LSNTAP
site and did all of this research and then….realiz[ed], ‘Oh, that’s what they’re
doing’ [P35].



“I think that a big missing piece for us promotionally is social media….[W]e have
to have a presence as pedestrian as it sounds – a Facebook presence of some kind,
a more robust YouTube presence, and there’s like this kind of silliness
about…YouTube things can’t be seen because they’re filtered through the
judiciary and all this kind of stuff. But somehow we have to get over some of
these hurdles about fear of social media and say that there is an appropriate way
to do this and we have to start doing it” [P26].

Volunteers, as well as staff members, can pose challenges. Information Providers
described varying levels of success in finding suitable volunteers. Four Information
Providers stated that they do not currently work with volunteers [P10; P13; P18; P28],
with two Information Providers from one state (one former, one current) indicating that
previous attempts to recruit and use volunteers were less than successful [P28; P31]. As
explained by the former Information Provider, the problem was two-fold – they lacked a
clear idea of how to use volunteers and struggled to find individuals who had a genuine
interest in working on the site [P31]. For those who currently work with volunteers, the
issue may be one of fit – while they are grateful for any assistance that people are willing
to give, several interviewees also indicated that volunteers with expertise in certain areas,

184

who can apply this expertise to the task of updating content, were highly sought after yet
often elusive [P14; P27]. One Information Provider described the predicament in the
following manner:
I don’t think that that’s something that makes sense to have, you know, new
attorneys and things like – people who we just appeal to on a sheer goodwill, pro
bono basis to do because I think that it’s terribly inefficient – they don’t know any
more than I do about that. I mean, I’m trained as an attorney and so I can struggle
my way through any given page but we have hundreds of them….The magic
bullet as far as I can tell in my head would be a very experienced attorney who
does something all the time, who [is] attuned to changes in the law in their own
practice….They can read down and say either yay or nay and if nay … they can
do a little draft up of it then. I think that, with the right person, that’s a more like a
half hour process than a major research assignment [P27].
Another Information Provider echoed this sentiment, explaining how student
interns generally lack an understanding of both the legal and technical issues (and are not
there long enough to receive the necessary training), thus limiting the projects to which
she can assign them. While acknowledging that interns can help by generating new ideas
and testing different features, a long-term volunteer who could provide assistance with all
aspects of the site would be more valuable [P7].
d. Processes
The variety of individuals who contribute to the website – both from within the
organization that maintains it and from other organizations – raises the question of how
Information Providers manage the workflow. A number of interviewees described the
processes and procedures they follow in connection with updating existing content [P6;
P17; P19; P22; P24; P27], indicating that review of at least certain types of content
occurs at regular intervals. These processes include:

185



Checking links to make sure they are still live ( “I check all the links every
couple of months” [P19]);



Verifying that any changes to the law are reflected in site content (“[W]e do…a
thorough review at the end of every [state legislative] session of all the statutes
and that’s mostly where our updates come from” [P22]);



Tagging content with a date so as to keep track of when it was last updated
(“Every piece of content that’s added to the website is tagged with [the] person’s
name who created it and a review date. And so that on that date, that person gets
an emails that says ‘your content needs to be reviewed.’ And it’s basically once a
year” [P24]); and,



Ensuring that calendar events are up-to-date (“We do have a section on legal
clinics in the community that is updated every month” [P6]).

Interviewees’ descriptions of varied processes reflect the continuum observed in the
analysis of survey data. Information Providers from only three states indicated that they
have currently have written documentation of processes related to either content
development or review [P14; P24; P26].
An Information Provider currently working on Michigan Legal Help (MLH)
provided access to the extensive documentation they have developed in connection with
content development and review. This documentation includes current website content
guidelines (as of April 2014) that address each of the following: priorities for content
development; the role of content review committees;35 the use of materials created by
other organizations; collaboration on content development; and, the posting of

MLH is advised by a number of content committees that, per the guidelines, “should contain a
mix of legal aid attorney staff, court and/or [State Court Administrator’s Office] staff, self-help
center staff (where appropriate), and private practitioners, including when possible, members of
appropriate State Bar entities.” [Content Guidelines]. There are currently committees convened in
seven (7) areas: Family Law & Protection Order; Expungement; Housing Law; Consumer Law;
Public Benefits Law; Income Tax; and Unemployment Law.
35

186

information about lawyer referrals, legal aid organizations, self-help centers, and
community organizations.
The processes adopted by MLH will be described in some detail here, as they shed
light on the many intricacies involved in content development and review, as well as
demonstrate how collaborative these processes can be. Content development at MLH
involves a series of steps in which site staff members, in-house substantive experts, and
external content reviewers all play various roles – researching, writing, editing, reviewing
for legal correctness, and reviewing for plain language. MLH currently has three staff
members who work specifically on content development. Written procedures thus call for
content to be drafted by one member of the content development staff and then turned
over to another for plain language assessment.
A tracker form (in hard copy) follows the content item/resources through every step
of the development process, from the creation of a rough draft to the posting of content
onto the site. This form ensures that everyone is aware of the process and also provides
documentation that each step is completed. Prior to content being posted on the site, there
is a one week comment period during which the content manager, as well as interested
substantive law attorneys and committee members, are given a final opportunity to
review it. For the creation of procedural instructions, additional steps are added,
including research by the drafter about jurisdictional differences (to determine how many
different versions of the instructions are necessary) and reaching out to contacts at state
courts to solicit their input about inaccuracies and suggested modifications. The process
to be followed when changes are made to existing content depends on the nature of the

187

revision, but even “minor” revisions (e.g., revising dollar amounts specified by statute)
are reviewed by more than one person before being posted on the website.
Information Providers from several other states were able to clearly detail their
current processes/procedures, notwithstanding the fact that they were no longer being
documented in writing. One interviewee, for example, described how these processes and
procedures – which varied based on the type of content being created – had been
“institutionalized” [P13] (e.g., with interactive court forms, the Information Provider
creates the “landing pages,” which are then reviewed for content by one of the staff
attorneys). Further down along the continuum, one interviewee described how he “[has]
some ideas about when things are going to happen but then otherwise it’s a lot of running
around sort of like a decapitated chicken looking for stuff” [P10]. This sentiment was
echoed by another Information Provider, who described her “process” in the following
manner: “I see stuff we ought to borrow, I develop stuff” [P18].
e. New Content Development
While the development of written content that meets the information needs of target
users remains a priority, the two topics related to current website content that generated
the most discussion were interactive features and multi-lingual content. In terms of
interactive features, online forms, by far, were discussed most frequently [P6; P10; P13;
P14; P18; P23; P24; P28; P31; P36; P37; P41]. One Pro Bono Net staff member
emphasized the central role of interactive forms in the access to justice movement,
characterizing them as an “essential underpinning” to courts’ efforts to become more
open to the public [P31]. The growth in this area has been significant – for example, Pro

188

Bono Net now supports 45 states with approximately 4,000 LHI online forms and
interviews [P5]. While several Information Providers indicated a desire to expand their
offerings in this area [P10; P21; P41], others remarked upon the significant progress they
have made to date [P23. P37]. One interviewee offered the following description of
recent work in this area:
“I’ve been working mostly with the document assembly – various kinds of document
assembly. [We do] two kinds of documents – one based on…interactive PDF
documents and the other based on HotDocs programming. “[The PDFs are]… Java
script programmed behind the scenes to do complex calculations… [the state] child
support guidelines are really complex and very difficult particularly for somebody
who’s poorly educated who is trying to handle their own case in court… The PDF
documents…became really the standard for, at least for the family law ones, the
standard for the entire bar- not only our client population used them but lots of
the…family law bar in the state began using them” [P23].
Other interactive features mentioned include online intake [P6; P7; P13; P14;
P18; P28] and chat services [P14; P18; P24; P28; P36]. Online intake is viewed as
increasingly necessary, as evidenced by the number of states who have already
implemented it or are planning to do so in the foreseeable future. As observed by one
Information Provider, “I think that more and more people are accessing services online
and so I think it’s important for the legal aid organizations to offer that as an option that
also has the advantage of being open all the time, right? I think there’s an impression that
legal aid offices are closed all the time or that they’re not available or that the hotlines …
you know, you call and you’re on hold for 30 minutes or whatever … online technology
is so scalable and that meets a need” [P14]. This idea of wanting to provide “around the
clock” legal assistance has also arisen within the context of online chat services (e.g.,
LiveHelp). These services, however, raise the question of sufficient staffing. One
Information Provider’s proposed solution is to build a volunteer program that would not

189

only expand weekday hours for LiveHelp but that would also make the service available
on the weekend [P36].
As with almost everything else related to statewide legal information websites, the
strides that Information Providers are able to make in terms of multi-lingual content are
largely dependent upon available resources. Little uniformity can be seen in the
approaches taken by states. To date, only a few Information Providers have had the
resources to create full mirror sites in other languages. One has a staff member who is
responsible for the Spanish language site and a small cadre of volunteers to do translation
work [P14], and another indicated that she had plans to hire a staff member whose time
would be split between content development and managing the Spanish language site
[P24]. One other site has multiple mirror language sites but the Information Provider does
not have a staff member dedicated to managing those sites [P21].
The more limited approaches taken by other states fall into two categories: using
machine translation and providing a selection of content in the most popular languages
[P10; P26; P36]. One Information Provider who has adopted the former approach
explained how they made the decision to highlight certain languages into which the site
can be translated:
So we basically polled our offices – what are the main languages you see people
coming in or people calling from that they speak….Google allows for fifty or so
different languages and we didn’t want to have just a huge long list that people
would have to scroll through to find their language. We may have inadvertently
left a few people out – a small minority but we decided, based on those polls of
our local offices, these were the primary languages besides English that are
spoken in our state and those would primarily be the people looking at our
website. We know it’s not the best translation – it’s a machine translation, but it’s
better than nothing [P13].

190

Manual translation requires expertise that may not reside within the organization that
maintains the website. One interviewee described a collaborative approach to translating
select content wherein he has been working with an undergraduate Spanish translation
class. After the professor went through several rounds of translation work with the
students, the Information Provider received the translations electronically, and they are
now being reviewed by court translators and others with similar expertise. The feedback
received to date has been very positive, and the Information Provider is now considering
this pilot project as a model for future translation (and other content development) work.
Evaluation
When asked to describe their current program evaluation efforts, a number of
interviewees sought clarification as to the kinds of activities that fall within the realm of
evaluation. Examples were provided (e.g., online user surveys) but the question was left
open-ended so as not limit their responses to commonly used evaluation techniques. Two
mechanisms in particular – review of site usage statistics and solicitation of user feedback
– were cited by the largest number of interviewees.
Among those Information Providers who discussed what they learned through
examining usage statistics, almost all of them specifically referenced Google analytics. In
addition to Google analytics, data can be obtained specifically in connection with the use
of online forms (e.g., how many people started filling out a form, how many people
completed the process) [P13] as well as through an online intake system [P18]. As to the
latter, one Information Provider has been working with her IT support to staff to collect
this data because she was “interested in the breakdown of cases, both cases we accept but

191

more importantly cases we don’t take or just provide advice to…in terms of topics, age
and location so that we can better respond to those issues on our website” [P17].
In general, site usage data yields insights into several key trends, including:
1) Site growth, as demonstrated by increasing site views and new users [P17; P18;
P24; P36; P41]: A number of Information Providers were able to provide
estimates of recent site statistics during the interview, expressing varying degrees
of satisfaction with the numbers they are seeing. The general tone, however, was
one of optimism: “[W]e know that we’re at just under…168,000 unique views in
the last year. So…the fact that we know that 65% of those are first time meaning
that we’re…getting growth, we’re getting lots of new folks” [P18].
2) An understanding of what users are looking for on the site (e.g., most popular
topics) and how long they spend looking for it [P7; P13; P16; P24; P27]: In the
words of one Information Provider, “we do keep track and look at first off, what’s
the primary search when people come to the site and what are the top landing
pages? It’s typically… an organic search- like Google or Bing or Yahoo – people
looking for divorce forms or something like that. So, that’s why they’re
highlighted. We also look at, you know, the number of people who land on those
pages and how long they spend there” [P13]. In the process of examining site
usage data, Information Providers can make unexpected findings – one
interviewee described how Google analytics helped her identify that certain
groups of LEP individuals appear to have distinct information needs. For these
individuals, she observed, the most frequently visited pages were not in the area
of domestic relations/family law (the most popular content overall) but rather
employment [P21].
3) An understanding of how users are finding the site. An increase in the number of
users coming to the site via search engines was observed by several Information
Providers [P17; P27; P41]. One Information Provider explained that “it’s now at
about 76% of all visits come via search engines, whereas even as recently as early
2012, it was more like 55%. So…that’s shaped my view about…how useful it is
to obsess over the real estate of the front page. Nobody starts at the front page
anymore. Three out of four people get there by doing a search for ‘divorce’ [in
this state]” [P41].
4) The type of device they are using to access the site (e.g., desktop, laptop, tablet,
smartphone) [P7; P26]: The growth in mobile access is of particular interest to
Information Providers. As one interviewee noted, “one of the things that Google

192

analytics shows [is] that we have 20-some percent accessing the site using smart
phones” [P27].
Several interviewees indicated that analytics aid them in making content-related decisions
[P16; P24]. One Information Provider, however, noted the limited nature of the
information provided by usage statistics: “I think there’s probably a lot more out there
that we don’t know. So, I use Google Analytics but…that’s just measuring the people
that are coming to the site so I don’t know what people who don’t even know about the
site are [doing]” [P21].
The second evaluation effort discussed most frequently – the solicitation of user
feedback – encompasses a variety of mechanisms that Information Providers use to
obtain information directly from users, including online surveys, online feedback forms,
focus groups, and usability testing. This data is seen as useful to the extent that it offers
some insight into what people are looking for and the amount of difficulty they are
having in finding it [P7; P36; P41]. Table 6.6 provides a selection of quotes from
Information Providers regarding their experiences using these different mechanisms for
obtaining user feedback.
Table 6.6: Feedback Mechanisms
Feedback Mechanism

Sample Comment

Online Surveys

“[W]e use Survey Monkey….I think it’s at the end of
our online application and the response rate is just
phenomenal because it pops up right after people finish
submitting the application. So we have, like a… 80 to
90% response rate. One of the questions is about income
and household size and so we get all of that data about
our users.” [P6]

193

Online Feedback Forms

“We also have a feedback form on our site and that’s
used quite heavily – most of the time it’s people
searching for legal information or advice but, even from
those … emails, we’re gleaning a lot of information
about resources that, you know – maybe somebody is
asking for a resource that we don’t have and we need to
build. Or they might be asking for a resource that we do
have and then that can maybe clue us into the fact that
we need to rename the resource because they didn’t find
it. Or they have a question that shows us that a certain
piece of content is confusing and we need to revise it.”
[P28]

Focus Groups

“We have just started doing focus groups, which is not
something that we ever tried to do as an organization.
We just had our first one last month and we’ll do another
one this month…we started with a group of Spanish
resources on the website [and] it was really an invaluable
experience and that was, you know, seven people in a
room facilitated by two of our staff people to talk about
specific questions around resources…in Spanish.” [P14].

Usability Testing

“And then they did the actual usability testing where
they recruited … between 10 and 20 people who actually
went to [a] lab and sat down for an hour and went
through – we drafted scenarios and they did the tests and
they gave their feedback.” [P24]

The two Information Providers who mentioned usability testing in their survey responses
were asked to discuss their experiences in more detail.36 Both spoke with enthusiasm
about what they learned throughout this process, with one describing how the testing they
conducted in collaboration with a human-computer interaction class at a nearby iSchool
led them to fundamentally redesign the home page [P24]. That result, as explained by the
other Information Provider, is why usability testing is such a valuable endeavor:

This is not to say that the other websites have not undergone usability testing. Per a Pro Bono
Net staff member, user testing was done during the development of LH3, the latest iteration of the
LawHelp platform.
36

194

[U]sability testing always breaks down the functions that you go into. And that’s
why it’s important to do, right, because you think one way is better and then you
test it and realize that nobody understood that that’s where the button was or
what that word or phrase meant, what they were supposed to do next. So, yeah, I
would say there’s always… something that is learned from usability testing. You
know, that’s why it’s so invaluable at this point. We need to do a better job of it…
[make it] a part of our regular business process” [P14].
In addition to the feedback mechanisms listed in Table 6.6, several Information
Providers noted the value of anecdotal evidence, which is often obtained through
informal conversations with staff at A2J stakeholder organizations or clients of legal
services providers [P16; P22; P24; P27; P35]. One Information Provider relayed the
following story of how anecdotal evidence led to new content development:
The other thing is just a single anecdote of going into the…circuit court, stopping
in at – they have a little room there when you go in, it’s like the self-help center or
something like that – there’s a paralegal behind the desk who said ….“You know
what would we could really use? We could really use a page that talks about
motions – like what a motion is. People have to file motions and they don’t know
what that means.” And so… quickly we just put to together a page on how to file
a motion in circuit court and tried to really use – we had some of those best
practices for clear writing in there in terms of interrogative question headings and
the little picture of a caption to sort of show what a caption looks like. And then
sort of a process view and things like that [P27].
Although a number of interviewees indicated that they received feedback from some
combination of the mechanisms described here (as well as others, including direct email,
LHI interviews, and an online intake system), it is not clear what they do with this data.
Several admitted that they did not have a formal process for analyzing the data from these
various sources [P18; P24; P27]. Two Information Providers discussed the extent to
which they responded to, or otherwise used, the feedback they collected [P7; P14], and a
third mentioned responding to comments about broken links and other minor technical
issues [P22].

195

Outreach
Interviewees were asked to talk about what they have done to make the website’s
presence known to the target audience and also to offer an opinion as to whether their
efforts to date have been successful. As an initial matter, a number of Information
Providers suggested that they are not doing as much outreach as they would like to do. As
one interviewee observed,
I would say that we have not done as much work with client groups and interest
groups that, you know, see our clients and that would be natural sort of allies…at
least with regard to the website. Now, I have to be careful because…we do work
with interest groups and client groups with other stuff that we do, but not
necessarily for website content. So I think that, you know, that’s kind of the thing
that I would like to spend more time doing – going to client groups, just spending
time with executive directors and groups of other…non-profits that work with our
client population [P10].
Because outreach activities are dependent on available resources and resource levels vary
from state to state, many differences among states were observed. On one end of the
spectrum are two states in which outreach has been institutionalized through a network of
self-help centers in courts and libraries [P14; P24], one of which has gone a step further
through the creation of a dedicated outreach coordinator to oversee this network [P14].
Part of the outreach coordinator’s job is to maintain regular communication with the selfhelp centers through site visits and via a listserv, keeping everyone up to date on new
content and features, important changes to the law, and any technology issues (e.g.,
scheduled website outages) [P14].
Other Information Providers use an array of outreach efforts to increase
awareness about their statewide legal information websites. While some states have
created print materials (e.g., brochures, posters) and other tangible items (e.g., magnets,

196

pens) specifically for the website [P7; P13; P14; P26; P37], others have folded outreach
for the site into the organization’s broader outreach activities:


“[B]asically we include [statewide legal information website] information in
every outreach activity that we do so we have business cards that have [the
website URL] on one side and then on the other side is our helpline
number….So, yeah, for instance … we’re going to…take a box of those cards
and pass them to not only to the people who are there to access to the services
[at the veterans’ organization] but also to other partners, community social
services agency type folks….Every…kind of outreach, kind of mailing that
we do – like we’re doing a low income taxpayer clinic mailing across the
state, we’ll include information about [the website]. So, it’s basically
integrated into all of our outreach efforts” [P28].



“Also, our staff do a lot of community outreach so they take…business cards
that have our website address on them and other fliers to promote use of the
website” [P6].



“[O]ur organization has three programs that really are designed for the same
purpose as our legal information website… that allows us when we train
people and…get the word out to talk about all of these resources, rather than
just this one. It kind of makes it more compelling for them to want to have us
tell them about this resource so that’s been a big thing” [P34].

In addition to the distribution of promotional materials, Information Providers also use
email and social media – generally targeted to A2J stakeholder organizations – to
increase awareness about the site [P13; P14; P17; P36]. One Information Provider
regularly promotes changes to the website via Facebook and Twitter [P36].
In some cases, Information Providers work with A2J stakeholder organizations
(particularly libraries, courts, legal services providers) to spread the word about the
statewide legal information website to target users. This can be as simple as these
organizations posting links to the website on their own site [P7; P10; P18; P21; P22; P34]
or Information Providers sending out regular communications to libraries, advocacy

197

groups, community action groups, social services agencies, and other outreach partners
about new content or other site updates, with the hope that they pass this information
along to the public [P13; P18; P37].
A number of Information Providers, however, have engaged in more concerted
outreach activities. These efforts include presenting on the site at conferences attended by
A2J stakeholder organizations [P13; P17; P21; P22] and holding in-person and online
training sessions [P6; P7; P13; P14; P21; P22; P34; P27]. As the following quotes
demonstrate, training sessions for libraries are common, but several Information
Providers also offered examples of outreach to other organizations that can benefit from
learning more about the websites:


“I went and did a training to legislative staff. I’m actually a registered
lobbyist for our organization - I know a lot of people down at the hill. So, I
did a training for the legislative staff and that went over really well” [P34].



“And we had one staff member go to their local libraries and talk to the
librarians about our website, and specifically the interactive court forms
for those who can’t afford a lawyer. And, so, they were given that
information and the same is true about a lot of the shelters and the other
advocacy groups, they were given some training on those” [P13].



“And so in that process of…planning and opening the legal self-help
centers, we do trainings for the librarians, the circuit clerks, anyone on the
court staff who is interested and anyone else in the community who wants
to come, basically” [P14].



“I got together with the state library…which is sort of the umbrella group
for all of the public libraries in the state to present. We did two things –
we did a webinar series for librarians [across the state] and we also went
on a road show and did in-person trainings about the legal resources
available online, including of course…our website” [P10].

198

Looking to the Future
At the close of the interview, Information Providers were asked to talk about 1) the
projects they were currently working on, and 2) what they would most like to do in the
future, if funding or staffing did not pose an issue. Several interviewees spoke about their
plans to add content in certain areas in which they are seeing more demand (e.g.,
consumer debt collection, unemployment) [P22; P24]. In a number of interviews,
however, it became clear that the changes that Information Providers most want to see
(and, in many cases, were already working on) did not involve minor modifications to
site content but rather a re-envisioning of the role that statewide legal information
websites are to play in the delivery of legal services in the future. As one Pro Bono Net
staff member explained, in an increasing number of states, “it’s no longer just about
‘Hey! We’re delivering, you know, [information about] your rights.’ It’s ‘come here to
get access to … more of like a virtual services model’” [P33].
In terms of projects currently in development, Information Providers mentioned
working on online intake and triage systems most frequently, followed by interactive
features, portals, and online classrooms. Table 6.7 provides descriptions of projects in
each of these categories.

Description

Online triage system

“We’re working with [Pro Bono Net and
others]… to build a server that will direct
clients…to simple interviews we can come
up with for at least the four major areas that
most clients come to us for and that’s
family law, housing law, consumer law,
and… public benefits cases and then
try…to match up their responses in ways
that also looks at the geographic data and
the demographic data to try to make the
best guess at which agency is going to
actually provide the service to them so we
get it right the first time and not bounce
them around from one place to another.”
[P29]

Interactive tools

“I’m working with [a] game design
department… to build a game – a serious
game – it’s in quotes, a “serious game” –
for…self-represented parties going to court
– what to expect to do, what to do, how to
address the judge, how to submit
evidence.” [P8]

Portals

“[W]e’re going to have four indexed miniportals – one in English, one in Chinese,
one in Vietnamese, and one in
Spanish….[S]o what we’re going to do is
put [translated content that] cover[s] most
of what you would need if you’re coming
to [the website] and…you click one button
and you’ll see a variety of information
available on a variety of issues in your
language.” [P36]

Online classrooms

“[W]hat we would be doing is partnering
with [CALI] to take our online classrooms,
which are sort of a next generation of
online learning [and] … build a national
site which CALI will over time maintain where legal aid programs and…law schools
can partner up – it would serve as sort of a
repository for classrooms.” [P7]

200

The idea of creating a more interactive experience embodied in many of the
projects discussed in Table 6.7 reflects a problem-solving approach: “[I]nstead of just
[providing] a long list of keywords or a search box, trying to ask questions – what did
you come here for? What’s your specific need? Let’s narrow that down – is it one of
these three choices? So, it’s a simple, you know, logic system or a triage system and you
try to specifically generate content for them based on the unique individual” [P13].
Further development of online forms is seen by some Information Providers as a
necessary step toward transforming the websites into problem-solving tools [P10; P13;
P18]. One interviewee observed that “It’s all fine and good to have a tutorial about what
is a divorce all about but I want the person to be able to go from that legal information
phase in to a legal action phase, to be able to create their own forms – print them, file
them and then have a good outcome in their case” [P10].
Information Providers described this idea of integrating the statewide legal
information website into the broader legal services system in different ways [P5; P7; P22;
P34; P35; P37]. But, a common thread among Information Providers’ visions of
integrated legal services was the capacity to usher people through the necessary legal
processes and procedures by providing more streamlined content. One Information
Provider, who is currently building an online triage system, described a scenario in which
a website visitor could access relevant information before being transferred to the intake
unit. At that point, the user’s data would be entered into the case management system as
well. The integration of these systems, he surmised, should ease the transition from
website user to applicant to client [P37]. Similarly, a Pro Bono Net staff member
described a current project that involves connecting API content feeds from the websites

201

with case management systems at legal services organizations. The end result of building
these bridges between currently separate systems could be something like this:
[S]omebody who’s on the phone with a hotline worker or an advocate who’s on
the phone with somebody who’s being evicted, can be entering their record in the
case management system for them and setting up….a legal services appointment,
[while] at the same time, pulling in through that record, like a set of … the top 3
eviction resources on the [website] and being able to quickly say “Hey, I’m going
to send you links to three booklets for your appointment [P33].
For others, the idea of integrated services means developing a better
understanding of how people’s legal needs intersect with other needs: “[W]hen someone
has a civil legal problem, it’s a real driver for them to find help of all kinds and so…it
sort of made sense for us to … combine the social services issues with the legal problems
so we sort of tried to broaden what we include on the site to include those links to social
service resources” [P34].
It is important to recognize that, in states with particularly challenging environments,
many of the projects described in Table 6.7 are aspirational. Triage systems [P34] and a
streamlined process for filing online forms [P13] are still “wishlist” items for some
Information Providers. Other interviewees talked about how they would like to add more
interactive features to the site [P10; P17; P21; P27] (“I’d like to come up with something
… like an Angie’s list for poor people in terms of resources” [P17]); incorporate more
multi-media resources (“I’d like to add more video resources on there because I think a
lot of times no matter how clear we think we’ve been on the text, a lot of clients with low
literacy levels or other barrier have a hard time absorbing anything beyond more than,
you know, a few paragraphs” [P29]); conduct additional outreach efforts [P7; P10; P21;
P24] (“I’d also like to connect with the adult education department …in the government
at the state level and see if there is a way that we can work our website into their

202

curriculum” [P21]); or, use the website as a means to promote in-person legal clinics
hosted by other organizations [P16; P36].
B.3. Collaboration
As detailed in Chapter V, the survey responses revealed that, in many cases,
statewide legal information websites are made possible through different types of
collaboration. At the broadest level, collaborative efforts can be divided into two
categories: 1) the work that Information Providers do with other organizations within
their state, both within the legal services community and beyond (referred to as “A2J
stakeholder organizations” in Tables 6.3 and 6.4), and 2) the work that Information
Providers do with organizations outside of the state that are involved with statewide legal
information websites in some capacity or another. The interviews thoroughly explored
both types of collaborative efforts.
Collaboration among A2J Stakeholders within a State
As laid out in Table 6.3, the A2J stakeholder organizations that generated the most
discussion among interviewees were legal services organizations (both direct service
providers and statewide support organizations), courts, libraries (generally public
libraries and public law libraries), and law schools. Although other collaborating
organizations were mentioned less frequently, their work in connection with statewide
legal information websites raises important questions about the contributions that less
“traditional” A2J stakeholders can make: domestic violence survivor shelters/advocacy
organizations; colleges and universities; and technology centers.

203

Several interviewees noted that having a longstanding cooperative relationship with
other legal services entities in the state paved the way for collaboration with respect to
the website [P8; P36]. In some states, there is more than one website that provides
information for self-help users [P6; P22]. Cooperation among A2J stakeholders that
maintain websites for the public (notably, courts, libraries and legal services
organizations) is one way to minimize duplicative efforts. One Information Provider
described how the high level of collaboration among legal services providers in their state
increases efficiency: “[W]e’ve made a big push…with all of the different organizations
creating web resources to try to not duplicate effort so that we can maximize the use of
the staff and the money that we have. So, we’ve actually created an inventory of
resources that people can access to look at before they decide to develop a resource” [P6].
a. Nature of Collaboration
The different contributions that A2J stakeholder organizations make to statewide
legal information websites was discussed in the previous section on “Current Activities.”
The way in which they engage in these activities is worth describing as well, given that
much of the current collaboration appears to occur outside of formal channels (i.e.,
advisory committees/councils). Information Providers in several states indicated that
earlier efforts to maintain an advisory committee had fallen to the wayside [P21; P28;
P41]. Information Providers from only five (5) states indicated that they currently have an
advisory committee specifically for the website [P7; P14; P24; P26; P34]. Information
Providers from three of those states emphasized the diversity of committee membership:


“[W]e have people from…each legal aid organization, our major bar foundation
funder, people at different law schools, and social services organizations that

204

work directly with our client populations, and also technical people from our legal
aid organizations” [P7].


“[W[e have…a representative from the state bar. We have several judges. We
have a couple of people from legal services organizations. We have a couple of
people from self-help centers. We have a couple of people from the state court
administrative office and someone from the [state] Judicial Institute and …
someone from the state bar foundation. ” [P24].



“Well, we originally had a librarian – we had sort of the director of the regional
library, one library director, one of our IT people. We’ve got a few of those
information people that tend to do community education for legal aid programs.
We have someone from the administrative office of the courts” [P34].

The role of advisory committees varies, with one interviewee describing its duties as
broad oversight (noting that many members are executive directors of legal services and
other non-profit organizations and therefore lack the time to “micromanage” [P7]) and
others indicating a more active role for the committee: “[T]he role of the stakeholder
committee is really to guide our programmatic priorities and to…engage them in the
work of the websites. And so…we often use them as, as sort of our first point of contact
for when we’re looking to update a piece of content, right? So we send [it] out and say,
‘We need to update this content on how to get custody of a child,’ for example. And,
folks will respond to us with their suggestions from their respective organizations” [P14].
As with content development and other work associated with the websites, however, it
can be challenging to maintain a high level of involvement across the entire committee
and some members will inevitably remain more engaged than others [P34].
In other states, Information Providers’ collaborative efforts with other
organizations were more or less ad hoc from the beginning [P13; P18; P37]. In discussing
their relationships with A2J stakeholder organizations, several Information Providers

205

described how they maintain open channels of communications through which informal
conversations about the needs of self-help users and other potential site users occur [P10;
P18], thus reducing the need for formal structures to facilitate cooperation. As noted by
one interviewee, the decision not to have an advisory committee specifically for the
website was due to solid existing relationships with the organizations with which they
were most likely to collaborate:
[M]any of our interested stakeholders are involved with us in other committees
and commissions. For instance, [the] access to justice commission, selfrepresented litigants committees, etc. So, generally, all of the input about [the
website] generally comes out during those meetings. As well as…we just have
great weekly, if not daily, you know dealings with our state bar, our law library,
other access to justice folks, so just those conversations happen really
naturally….[S]o, basically we felt that trying to have a stakeholders meeting once
every quarter or whatnot was overkill – it wasn’t necessary. It was happening
already in other forums [P28].

b. Challenges
Information Providers discussed various challenges they face in connection with
developing and maintaining collaborative relationships. As with content development,
lack of time and resources can impede collaborative efforts, as government agencies and
non-profit organizations have been impacted by broader economic forces as well. An
additional challenge noted is staff turnover. One Information Provider, who had
cultivated a relationship with staff members at the state department of health and human
services and was working with them to avoid posting duplicative information, described
how management changes in that department slowed progress as the new leaders did not
understand the process in place [P28]. Yet another challenge noted was the existence of
divergent interests among stakeholder groups, which can lead to differing opinions as to

206

the proper scope, purpose, and future directions of the site [P5]. By way of example, one
Information Provider noted that, as members of the private bar struggle to make a living,
they are less inclined to champion self-help resources aimed at their potential clients:
And, so right now, the trial lawyers are hurting real bad because the Republicans
have taken over the statehouse and the state senate and the governor. So one of
the first things that happened was that the pro-business strategy by the new
government, the new administration was to totally revamp worker’s comp and
trial lawyers – that’s always been there bread and butter – it’s gone, you know.
There’s still a system but the stream of income is gone, so they’re all looking
around for a new practice area…[B]ut the reality is that the idea that people will
be doing their own divorces, custody, they’re not happy with this. So I don’t
know what the court is hearing from that but they’re not cooperative on the
ground in my area [P35].
In some cases, interests among A2J stakeholder organizations have diverged to the point
that collaboration is not feasible. The friction among legal services providers described
by several interviewees stands in stark contrast to the majority of interviewees who
described generally amicable relationships within this community. One interviewee
explained that
If you have a good working relationship, you know, know California from the
get-go was working closely with their court system…[but] there’s a lot of animus
between pretty much everyone and our program, so there wasn’t a real likelihood
– the state ended up funding pro bono in the most unique way, largely in part so
that the funds did not get to come to our program….[This] is an extremely,
extremely conservative state that frowns upon federal funding for anything – one
of our peer legal service programs … within the first three sentences of its
promotional stuff says “we’re not federally funded” [P17].

Collaboration Among States
Statewide legal information websites are often referred to as a network that was
created through the TIG program. Across this network, several clear leaders – Maine and

207

Illinois, for example – have emerged [P7; P24; P37]. Other “pioneers” mentioned during
the course of interviews were Washington, Minnesota, California; and New York [P10;
P17; P33; P37]. Illinois Legal Aid Online, it should be noted, is atypical in several key
ways – it is run by a non-profit organization supported by legal services organizations
throughout the state and there are a comparatively larger number of individuals currently
working on the site. Several interviewees expressed the opinion that, among statewide
legal information websites, Illinois Legal Aid Online is fortunate to have a sizeable and
relatively stable budget [P6; P10]. In the words of one Information Provider, “of course,
everyone looks to Illinois – no one has the budget that Illinois has so I sort of look at
Illinois with my nose pressed up against the window” [P10].
The relationships among Information Providers, however, extend beyond the pioneers
and leaders providing inspiration for the rest of the community. Among various groups of
Information Providers, there are a number of ongoing collaborative efforts. Speaking in
general terms, several interviewees emphasized their commitment to sharing content with
other statewide legal information websites [P8; P18]. Focusing on the specific website
platforms, Information Providers discussed how LSC, through the TIG program,
encouraged states to follow one of two paths by adopting either the LawHelp platform
developed by Pro Bono Net or the open source platform developed by Kaivo [P17].
Those who opted for the latter [P13; P17; P41] formed a community of practice that
several interviewees referred to as the “OST community.”37 There is also a third group of
states – those that do not currently affiliate themselves with either the LawHelp or the
OST community. As with the OST community, the emergence of this group appears to be
According to information provided on the LSC website about 2013 TIG grantees, the DLAW
template (i.e., the OST) currently powers over 20 statewide legal information websites (LSC, n.d.,
“2013 TIG Project Descriptions”).
37

208

tied to a strong level of technical expertise within the organization that maintains the
website [P13]. Several Information Providers provided their rationales for choosing this
particular path:


“[W]e have sort of gone off on our own. We have a separate hosting person – we
use our own programmer now …. to some extent, we are part the group [but]
we’re not using their templates really anymore” [P37].



“You know – our site has become highly specialized in tweaks to our program’s
needs that we’re no longer an active participant in the [OST community]. Our IT
people are so skilled and they have built so many add-ons themselves to our site
and tweaked it for so many different functions that we do that other people don’t
that frankly there’s not a lot to be gained from – we’re not very reliant on the
combined efforts of the [OST community] creating an updated platform from time
to time. So, we’re not really very active in that anymore” [P41].



“We never did [participate in the OST community]…. part of that was because
when [the first website content coordinator] got here and was doing it, he was so
far ahead of anyone else who was doing it in Drupal – it was just kind of not
worth our while….And…now that we’re going kind of independently of [that
platform], which gives us a lot more flexibility, I think, we’re going to stay that
way and we’re not going to do LawHelp because I think we have more features
than LawHelp does” [P26].

One Pro Bono Net staff member offered her opinion as to the different considerations that
may have come into play as states were deciding which platform to adopt:
And I think…what influenced the decisions for states at that time was…probably
two major things. One was…just sort of their philosophy about the project and
whether they wanted to created something more homegrown and they had the
capacity to basically take an open source system and kind of stand that up and
manage that in house versus something that was more of a centralized web-based
platform that they could kind of adapt for their needs…. Or they wanted to be part
of...there is an open source network but the LawHelp network, I think, is much
more networked, both in terms of the technology piece of it as well as the….just
support and community part of it [P33].

209

Information Providers’ answers as to why they chose the path they did fell in line with
this assessment – the presence or absence of in-house technical expertise was often noted
as a main reason. Information Providers from several LawHelp states, indicated that the
fact that are able to devote more time to content development, rather than technical
issues, was appealing to them [P6; P28; P36]. Alternatively, Information Providers
working on Drupal-based sites characterized LawHelp as a “cookie cutter approach”
[P17] that was not flexible or adaptable enough for their needs [P26].
Among all interviewees, there was considerable discussion about the role of Pro
Bono Net in inter-state collaboration. At this time, the LawHelp network is relatively
stable, currently comprised of 22 states and 2 territories (Guam and Micronesia) [P32;
P33]. In the past ten years, only three states have left the network, opting to develop their
own platform [P33]. During the early years of statewide legal information websites, the
creation of the Circuit Rider program38 was instrumental in helping a sense of community
among LawHelp states to emerge. This program was developed in connection with a TIG
received by the Northwest Justice Project (in Washington state) to provide project
assistance to statewide legal information websites using the LawHelp platform. As
described in a 2007 report (the Circuit Rider Report),
Circuit Riders help state justice communities understand how to take full
advantage of their template software, to generate and maintain legal content, to
involve and work with a wide array of community stakeholders, to market their
sites, and to evaluate their sites’ effectiveness. Circuit Riders also develop
resource materials, facilitate regular meetings among state partners, make site
visits to problem-solve project issues, and conduct outreach to diverse audiences.
They also serve as a link between statewide website efforts in different states,
“Circuit-Riding is a term of art in the technology industry. It comes from ‘riding the circuit,’ or
traveling on-site among various programs and providing in-depth assistance.” (LSNTAP, n.d.,
“Definition of Circuit Riding”)
38

210

allowing website developers to tap into and learn from similar efforts elsewhere
(Weber, 2007, p.9].
Circuit riders facilitated interstate communication through a variety of means, including
in-person visits, remote assistance (via email and the telephone), monthly
teleconferences, and a listserv.
An evaluation of the Circuit Rider program conducted by Pro Bono Net in 2006
consisted of online surveys of website coordinators and website stakeholders, as well as
interviews with and a focus group session with coordinators (Weber, 2007). Findings
from this evaluation revealed that coordinators and stakeholders value both the project
assistance and template support services provided through this program, although the
latter services were relied upon less frequently. The extent to which the program’s goals
with respect to outreach, stakeholder engagement, and evaluation were met, however,
was called into question. The report expressed concern that many coordinators did not
understand how to conduct or engage in any of these activities.
Although the Circuit Rider program was disbanded, the sense of community among
LawHelp states remains. Several Information Providers from LawHelp states described
the benefits they receive through being part of this network:


“We have a sense of community with the other LawHelp states – whenever we’re
looking at things we want to do to improve our websites, we don’t have to look
far because, you know, there are people all along the spectrum, in terms of where
they are in their development and …they’re willing to help and you know help
each other out. And then of course I can’t forget to mention the Pro Bono Net
staff, the LawHelp staff – it’s just really tremendous to have experts on call….It’s
just great to know that if I have a question or I have a feature request or I have an
idea or I need support, it’s just an email or phone call away. It’s just truly
incredible” [P10].



“[B]asically, any time we have a question or…we’re looking for a way to do
something particular, we can reach out to anyone we know basically who [is]

211

maintaining [a] LawHelp website and get that help. Everybody is very
forthcoming in sharing tricks and tips and information and content, which is
amazing…. I’ve never felt that I couldn’t reach out to a coordinator even if I
didn’t know him or her and have a good response. And I think that we do benefit
from the acquired knowledge from the group, you know, certain LawHelps will
try one thing and either succeed or fail and be very open about that and so we can
kind of learn, you know, without doing” [P28].
LawHelp Information Providers also noted how different options made available through
the LawHelp platform (e.g., LHI, mini-portals) were valuable additions [P6; P36]. When
asked about drawbacks to the LawHelp platform, one interviewee cited cost [P10]. More
commonly, Information Providers focused on the limitations of being on a platform that
is used by a large, diverse group of states, noting that changes did not generally occur in
the absence of consensus [P28; P36]. They were quick to point out, however, that Pro
Bono Net works with them to accommodate their requests whenever possible. As one
Information Provider described,
[T]he stuff I would want [the customizability] for is just stuff that’s cosmetic…
and even that, I can sort of work around it….[L]ike I wanted a purple icon for
domestic violence – that’s the DV color in the nation – and that purple icon sticks
out because it’s the only thing that’s purple on the page when you get there so the
DV victims, everyone who comes to the site, your eyes are drawn to the purple.
And they made that change for me. So, the only thing is….well, we can’t design
it. But you know what? It’s about helping people … and I like the way it looks
anyway. I don’t really consider it a drawback but I would call it a trade-off [P36].
In addition to developing the LawHelp platform, Pro Bono Net has also been involved in
a variety of community events and grant-funded projects related to statewide legal
information websites, partnering with LawHelp states as well as those on other platforms
to develop new features and tools (e.g., online triage; text-based information referral
services) [P3; P29]. In choosing projects in which to participate, Pro Bono Net is most
interested in those which foster replication and improvement [P32].

212

Several Information Providers who consider themselves to be part of the OST
community discussed their experiences in being part of this network [P13; P18].
Although this network is less formal than that created by Pro Bono Net, Information
Providers have developed various means to connect with one another, including meetings
at TIG annual conferences, a listserv, and conference calls. In the early 2000s, LSNTAP
developed a circuit rider program for the OST community (similar to that described
above for LawHelp states). More recently, as described by one Information Provider,
through collaboration, they have been able to secure grant funds to create an updated
open source template:
[I]n [an earlier grant], we wrote into the milestones, that we would have monthly
meetings, tele-meetings or webinars or go-to-meeting type things – get people in
[the OST] community involved and brainstorming and decision-making and just
up to date and so I guess the infrastructure of the group, the community was
already in place. We just leveraged what was already happening and started
having more frequent meetings via telephone and computer and since we ended
up writing the first grant, it just fell on us to continue the follow-up grants to build
more, to update the template, and so on and so forth. And now we’re on our…
fourth Drupal grant. [W]e…don’t have the meetings on a monthly basis anymore
but we do have them about once a quarter to update people. But, there [are]…
emails and phone calls going out back and forth and, at this point, we’re just
trying to find people out there that, either didn’t move their website from one
platform to the newest or went out on their own and now just kind of have an old
Titanic iceberg floating out there that they need to update [P13].
This example underscores how collaboration among statewide legal information websites
can offset, at least to some extent, a tense environment within one’s own legal services
community.

213

Conclusion
As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, Information Providers approach each
of the four principle program activities – content development, website design,
evaluation, and outreach – with the goal of delivering website content that connects selfhelp users with the legal information and services they seek. To date, they have struggled
with achieving this goal. Information Providers are routinely confronted by challenges
created by limited budgets and staffing, while also facing resistance from stakeholders
who fail to understand or appreciate how the website provides assistance to self-help
users. Thus, while they recognize that they have yet to successfully overcome all of the
barriers to information access created by language and literacy, many Information
Providers currently lack the capacity to turn their ideas about overcoming these barriers
into action items. The silver lining described by many interviewees, however, is the
collaborative efforts they have undertaken with A2J stakeholders, as well as with other
Information Providers. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7, collaboration is a
possible solution to one of the most significant problems facing Information Providers
revealed during this study – their lack of connection with the users of statewide legal
information websites.

In sum, the pilot case study opened up the programmatic “black box” of one
statewide legal information website. From the interviews and document review emerged
an understanding of the range of stakeholders involved; the stakeholders’ perceptions of
website users and of the barriers that users face in accessing information on the site; and,
the activities and resources underlying the site that are integral to its continued existence.
This nascent understanding led to a shift from thinking about statewide legal information
websites as technology projects that exist within the access to justice realm to conceiving
of them as access to justice initiatives that employ technology to deliver information and
services to a defined group of users. This understanding was refined through the survey
and then the interviews as various questions related to “how?” came to the surface:


How do Information Providers work with various A2J stakeholders?

216



How do Information Providers seek to overcome the barriers to information
access they have identified?



How do Information Providers address issues related to content development,
website design, outreach, and evaluation?



How do statewide legal information websites fit within the broader access to
justice realm of which they are a part?

The exploration of these questions led to another shift in the focus of this study. A
key outcome of this study, as originally envisioned, was the development of a conceptual
framework based on the work of Detlor et al. (2010). Their conceptual framework, as
discussed in Chapter 3, focused exclusively on internal contextual factors that impact the
adoption and use of community municipal portals (e.g., presence of leadership, adherence
to processes). While these factors were explored in questions asked in the survey and
during the interviews, the emergence of several key findings led this study in a somewhat
different direction:
1) Each statewide legal information websites is a product of its environment, which
is comprised of internal elements (i.e., the infrastructure built up around it) and
external elements (i.e., the legal services community that surrounds it, as well as
the broader economic and political forces that impact this community).
2) Collaboration shapes this environment, by providing an opportunity for
Information Providers to overcome infrastructure challenges related to budget and
staffing.
3) This environment, together with Information Providers’ focus on target users, in
turn, shapes how Information Providers engage in key program activities, namely
content development, website design, evaluation, and outreach.

217

These findings are related to the research questions posed at the outset of this study. The
principal activities of Information Providers have been identified, and differences were
observed in terms of how Information Providers engage in each of these activities. These
differences stem from the fact that no two Information Providers have the same level of
resources, nor the same amount of support from the legal services community, nor the
same relationships with A2J stakeholder organizations. Notwithstanding these
differences, one common thread among Information Providers emerged: their lack of
connection with website users. This lack of connection impedes evaluation efforts,
raising questions about the ability of the access to justice community to assess the impact
of statewide legal information websites.
The following discussion will explore the links between Information Providers’
current activities, the environments in which statewide legal information websites exist,
and the role of collaboration in overcoming the challenges Information Providers face.
The findings enumerated above demonstrate the shortcomings of focusing only on how
internal contextual findings impact use. The significance of the environment in which a
statewide legal information website exists (both the infrastructure and external
environment elements) cannot be overstated. If each website is indeed a product of its
specific environment, any analysis of outcomes or impact must take this fact into
account.
With that in mind, the following discussion incorporates a preliminary assessment of
how different environments yield different websites. This assessment is comprised of a
small number of evaluations conducted on websites with different internal and external
environments, focusing on the presence or absence of a select number of “best practices”

218

identified in the literature. It provides some insight into the strengths and weaknesses of
the sample websites, suggesting potential areas of focus for future evaluative studies. The
need for such studies becomes clear when one considers the lack of knowledge that
Information Providers currently have about who is actually using their websites.
Collaboration, however, provides an avenue through which Information Providers can
rectify this situation.
B. UNDERSTANDING THE ENVIRONMENT
B.1. Infrastructure
The challenges that Information Providers currently face with both staffing and
funding were discussed in Chapter 6. Interviewees were asked if they felt they had
adequate staffing and funding – the term “adequate” was generally interpreted to mean
enough to keep the site up and running. While many Information Providers initially
indicated that they felt that the site, in its current form, was sustainable, they then went on
to say that limited staffing and funding were impeding efforts to enhance their sites in
any number of ways. Most interviewees ultimately expressed a degree of discontent with
the website in its current state. One Information Provider offered the following
assessment of these challenges:
[H]ere’s the thing about the website…that I think sometimes people lose sight
of…people look at technology and they think it’s this magic bullet, [but] it’s only
as good as the people you’ve got working on it. So, we have enough staff to keep
it going but we’re getting more staff to really do more….[I]t requires man hours
as far as tedious work – let’s update this resource…making sure the links still
work and making sure that everything is there. I mean, at a certain point, a
website is just a delivery system [P36].

219

The law is not static and so these sites cannot be static. Having outdated forms on the
website, by way of example, can have adverse impacts for self-help users if the clerk’s
office refuses to accept a filing because an improper form is used. As one Pro Bono Net
staff member observed, sustainability in this context involves maintaining an updated
website, the costs of which (in terms of both time and money) are not always adequately
considered at the outset: “But, the other thing too is to realize is that these things cost
money…don’t start a project that you’re not going to sustain. Don’t put a form out there
that you’re not going to have the wherewithal to change when the law changes” [P5].
The long term outlook for statewide legal information websites is dependent upon
the organizations maintaining them continuing to view them as a priority. It was
comparatively easy to think strategically about the website when the TIG program
provided the funding for a dedicated staff person. A few states continue to have one or
more individuals whose sole responsibility is working on the site, but this study suggests
that this is not the norm. Moreover, as discussed in Chapter 6, some organizations now
treat the site as part of their general operating costs, whereas others depend upon external
grant money to create new content, add new features, and otherwise keep the site up-todate and relevant. Both of these scenarios raise issues related to sustainability. For
Information Providers in the former group, it can be difficult to maintain the visibility of
the site and make a convincing case that additional resources should be devoted to it. It
depends, in large part, on the extent to which decision-makers (both within and outside of
the organizations) see the value of the website as compared to the value of traditional
services:
[I]t is the priority for [the legal services organization]…we’re going to fight tooth
and nail to keep the website. I know that we’ve made…personnel decisions and

220

human resources decisions based on, you know, do we lose the website or do we
lose, you know, a staff position? Our board is very protective of the website
because it does serve so many people [P28].
Not all organizations place the statewide legal information website in such high esteem,
however, and the situation has deteriorated in some states to the point where no one
individual has responsibility for the site. One Information Provider explained how he can
see the quality of the website deteriorating due to neglect but currently lacks the
resources to have a dedicated staff member managing it [P29]. The more typical scenario
is that there is still a “point person” for the site but that this person is finding himself or
herself spread very thin these days, as the legal services community find themselves in a
state of continual contraction. That person is often responsible for other projects that may
or may not be related to the website:
[I]t might be “OK, now you’re coordinating the LiveHelp project” or “Now,
you’re also going to be managing the development of multi-media videos or of
online forums”…. [B]ecause …dedicated funding is no longer available from
LSC and the funding contractions in the field in general, I think that those
coordinator positions are now wearing many more hats than they were in their
early days [P33].
In one sense, giving the Information Provider responsibility for a suite of related
initiatives fits well with the idea of integrating the website into the core activities of the
organization. For some, the idea of integration is not new – several Information Providers
indicated that, from the beginning, the website was conceived as a way to share
information with those potential clients to whom they could not provide direct services
and, ideally, enable them to deal with their legal problems on their own. This mindset
encourages Information Providers, as well as others within the organization, to view the
website as another means of service delivery to the client population, potentially paving
the way for it to be an important component of an online triage system.

221

The addition of other responsibilities to the Information Provider’s workload,
however, forces them to make decisions about where to devote their time and energy.
Conceivably, the website can fall to the wayside as other, more immediate needs demand
staff members’ attention. One Information Provider described how his efforts to go
forward with automated documents – something he believes will significantly improve
the website - languished because there was no one person devoted to this particular
project. He appears to be making some headway, however, as the organization’s current
strategic plan calls for the creation of a new staff position that would be focused at least
one-third of the time on automated documents [P41].
These changes to the level of, as well as the types of, resources dedicated to
statewide legal information websites impact their current operations in several ways:
Information Providers are struggling with how to create the “next generation” of
their websites. Information Providers would like to do more but, without additional
funding, improvements and additions are not feasible. They can articulate what they
would like to incorporate into the site (e.g., interactive features) and previous outreach
efforts they would like to revive (e.g., to domestic violence shelters and senior centers)
but they recognize that all of these efforts require more money and/or staff than is
currently available. For example, one Information Provider, when asked about what was
preventing the incorporation of LiveHelp functionality into the site, cited the current lack
of available funding to hire additional staff [P10]. This sentiment was echoed by other
interviewees who struggle to find sufficient resources to develop multi-media content:
“[M]y budget is tiny and so, you know, if I’m working on a video, it can be challenging

222

to find a place to shoot. If I want to find art, it’s expensive to get stock art so trying to
create something out of nothing can be a bit challenging” [P7].
Notwithstanding these constraints, Information Providers are generally anxious to
move beyond the status quo, as evidenced by the current and future projects related to
enhancing interactivity, adopting a problem-solving approach, and similar advancements
discussed during the course of the interviews. It is impossible to speak of one status quo
existing across the current network, however, as there currently exists a continuum from
sites that only provide information to those in which some aspects of an online intake and
triage system are already in place. Early on, there was a tendency to treat statewide legal
information websites as “clearinghouses,” storing any and all legal information for selfhelp users. Some states have moved further away from this model than others. While
there is now a growing emphasis on quality over quantity, there is still a fair amount of
clean-up work to be done on many sites. As described by one former Information
Provider,
[M]ost people went for breadth over sort of some really good content and so we
had, I think that there were ten different areas that we were looking at in terms of
content and that certainly – family law was a priority…[B]ut there were still other
[areas] like…social security related things, disability law, [and] education. Those
sorts of things that were included on there but generally were fairly poorly
covered. And I wonder sort of, in thinking back, if…instead of spending the
resources on trying to review those extra pieces of content that were very sort of
light, not focused … and didn’t necessarily always answer the questions that
people were coming to our site for, we had focused more… on divorce and
parenting plans, on… adoption things … on landlord tenant issues, and those
consumer law issues – that they might not have improved more quickly [P31].
A Pro Bono Net staff member agreed with this assessment, observing that the early
impulse to aggregate all possible legal information has created “dead weight” for many
websites now [P33]. She noted, however, that the clearinghouse approach made more

223

sense early on because other organizations in the non-profit sector were not maintaining
that information and so the legal services organizations were meeting an important
community need. That is no longer the case though, and so it is incumbent upon current
Information Providers to think not only about the types of content they would like to
develop but also to review existing content to determine whether it still furthers the site’s
mission.
A key component of this transition away from the clearinghouse model involves
focusing on helping users solve their specific problems, rather than providing information
of a more general nature. This shift, however, makes the site a more labor intensive
venture, as it is easier to provide links to other websites than to craft detailed guidance
that walks users through the steps they must take in order to address a specific legal
situation.
Changes in sources of funding impact content development. In perhaps the clearest
example of this phenomenon, one Information Provider described how the site’s current
primary source of funding is a national association affiliated with the social work
profession. Because of this arrangement, they expanded the scope of the website to
include non-legal information, thus providing legal information within the broader
umbrella of social services information. More typically, even those sites that have been
folded in to the organization’s general operating budget are increasingly relying on
external funding to make improvements that move them further down along the
spectrum, away from being a clearinghouse of legal information. These improvements
include the current projects in development summarized in Table 6.7 (e.g., online intake
and triage systems). Many of these projects involve Information Providers working with

224

A2J stakeholders within their state, as well as other Information Providers and
organizations across the country, to do things that would likely be impossible to
accomplish on their own. One interviewee, for example, enthusiastically talked about two
TIG applications that were currently pending – one for developing an online game with a
local university, and one for working with law students to create online tutorials for selfrepresented litigants that could be used by legal aid organizations in other states [P8].
A reliance on external grant money, however, raises questions about the longterm sustainability of the site. As noted by one former Information Provider,
I think that that is the challenge for most programs, particularly the part
afterwards of being able to maintain the content. And…I don’t have a really good
solution for that – it’s just an area that particularly after the grant runs out, I have
a feeling that there’s a lot of content out there that doesn’t get updated….either
because they’ve contracted out and haven’t planned for future updates or just
because priorities change and … staff turn over and some of the content is
forgotten” [P31].
In addition to the constantly shifting priorities engendered by a reliance on external grant
money, grant-driven content development can take its toll on Information Providers in
other ways. By way of example, when asked whether she had any “wish list” projects,
one interviewee described how difficult it was to think about anything other than the
grant on which they are currently working:
[W]e’re just running so hard, so fast with stuff, and trying to get the grants
coming in so that we can keep going. And…always trying to be on the cutting
edge of developing new stuff and now we’re eyeball deep in online intake and
triage. I used to kind of resist that and when I was sort of second in command, I’d
say…“Let’s just not put in a grant this year. Let’s just catch up, figure out where
we are,”… [but], since [the former boss] left, I’ve just kind of been swept along
and have become him. It’s like [wer’re] running, running, running [P22].

225

In the current environment, external grants are the way for sites to innovate and are
central to efforts in many states to realize a vision of integrated legal services delivery
that includes the statewide legal information website. At the same time, however, the
pressure to find this grant money – in addition to a multitude of other responsibilities – is
always present. This creates stress for at least some Information Providers as they find
themselves needing to shape content development around grant-funded projects, which
may or may not align with the needs of their target users. One interviewee, for example,
opined that LSC’s emphasis on mobile app development a few years ago was somewhat
of a misfire:
[W]e jumped in early on the apps…to just again experiment and so we did this
national legal aid news app and a national legal aid finder app. The first one got
into both doors, but the second one – Apple kind of turned up their noses at. It
wasn’t entertaining enough. And it wasn’t “appy” enough. Interesting….I think
that apps have their place and can fit for very specific targeted sort of purposes.
but I think generally having experimented with apps, that we have more recently
put more effort into responsive design …. and we’ve more recently again put
more emphasis on that [rather] than more app development [P22].
Decreases in funding and staffing have led to less formal processes and procedures
in a number of states. A number of Information Providers described a situation in
which, from the beginning, it was difficult to get buy-in from individuals within the
organization, as well as from throughout the broader legal services community. Their
early efforts to encourage people to get involved in content development and to
institutionalize stakeholder support through advisory committees met with varying
degrees of success. Regardless of their success (or lack thereof), however, many of these
early efforts have been replaced by increasingly informal ways of conducting business
related to the website. As described in Chapter 6, only a few states currently have

226

carefully documented procedures that require action on the part of various staff members
as well as of outside substantive experts. For the majority of states in which one person is
responsible for the day-to-day operations of the site, however, formal processes are not
seen as necessary. As explained by one interviewee,
[E]arly on, we did create some written protocols about content review, content
contribution, all that sort of thing. But, the reality was that we never – we, I
should say I - was never able to get enough different people involved in
contributing on a repeating basis that those protocols contributed to efficiency.
They didn’t. I was the one who was doing it and so I was the one who was able to
look through pieces – review both for substantive accuracy and for readability,
usefulness in terms of who the intended audience was going to be [P41].
New Information Providers thus have a fair amount of latitude to try different things,
rather than being tied to existing practices and procedures. The absence of formal
processes can be problematic, however, to the extent that it allows work associated with
the site to become less defined (e.g., content is developed on a “catch as catch can”
basis), which can lead to a neglected site. A neglected site, in turn, may lead others within
the organization, as well as external funders, to question its value.
B.2. Legal Services Environment
Information Providers have typically relied upon other organizations within the
legal community to support the website in one way or another, whether it be developing
content, promoting the site to their clients, or assisting with the LiveHelp service. Table
7.2 shows the different roles that A2J stakeholder organizations play in connection with
statewide legal information websites. The numbers represent the number of states in
which a type of organization fulfills that particular role. Certain boxes were shaded to
highlight the roles most frequently played by different types of stakeholder organizations.

227

In brief, 1) Legal services providers, law schools, and the pro bono community are the
most frequent contributors to content development, in line with Information Providers’
interest in having substantive experts involved in this process, and 2) Courts, libraries,
and non-profit organizations (to a lesser extent) engage in outreach activities targeted at
increasing awareness about the site, particularly among the self-help users with which
they come into contact.

Courts and libraries, in particular, provide the scaffolding that is needed for self-help
users to be able to physically and intellectually access content and services on statewide
legal information websites. This concept was explored by Bishop et al. (1999) over
fifteen years ago and is no less relevant today.
The idea of navigators was discussed in several interviews in connection with
self-help centers. The basic concept, however, is broader than that type of formal
structure – at its core, it’s about having “people on the ground” who can guide selfrepresented litigants through the court system. Information Providers increasingly see
librarians as ideal navigators. As described by one interviewee, “[L]ibraries are seen as
kind of natural places where people come to get information and help from a librarian,
you can get free internet there – so they [are] just natural community hubs” [P34].
Several Information Providers mentioned that a conference in Austin, Texas a few years
ago was instrumental in building bridges between the legal services and library
communities. Following the conference, Information Providers made presentations to
libraries on this topic, bringing promotional materials for their websites along with them.

229

More recently, libraries were front and center during the development of one
statewide legal information website, which was expressly designed to aid librarians in
their intermediary role. Prior to developing the site, a legal services organization within
the state conducted a survey to assess librarians’ needs related to the provision of legal
information. Through this survey, they learned that many librarians did not feel qualified
to answer the legal questions they were being asked, despite having received some
training on how to distinguish between legal advice and legal information. In addition to
incorporating resources specifically for librarians into the site, the Information Providers
working on the site have conducted numerous training with librarians throughout the
state. This continues today on a smaller scale (by phone and one-on-one sessions), as they
train new librarians and offer refresher courses. One interviewee noted that librarians’
responses to the site have been generally positive. In one library where they hold monthly
pro bono clinics in conjunction with a local legal services organization, the librarians
“have been ape” over the website because it is a resource to which they can point patrons
who come in with legal questions throughout the month [P35].
Conceiving of libraries as intermediaries has brought them into the fold of the
A2J community. Information Providers in some states, however, are now envisioning an
expanded role for public libraries – one that includes integrating access to justice work
into their services. The self-help centers operating out of public libraries in certain states
are one example of this integration. In another state, the training director at the legal
services organization that maintains the site routinely conducts training for libraries on
online legal resources. These trainings focus on more than the statewide legal information

230

website, highlighting the potential for sustained collaboration between libraries and legal
aid organizations.
Table 7.2 also illustrates the different approaches to collaboration – this involves
non-traditional A2J stakeholder organizations (e.g., technology centers, places of
worship) as well as new ways to expand upon existing partnerships. One interviewee, for
example, has partnered with a law school brief advice clinic – he provides clear writing
training to the students, they draft content for the website, and he continues to work with
them on incorporating clear writing principles through several rounds of drafts before a
substantive expert weighs in. This Information Provider has also started offering clear
writing training to summer interns at legal services organizations. These efforts, he
explained, serve various purposes, namely, community service, marketing, and
“preparation for getting people involved” in the website as they start their legal careers.
Others are also increasingly thinking about the role that law students can play. One
interviewee, for example, is currently developing a project that would work the website
into the curriculum of adult education (including English as second language) classes.
The Information Provider envisions law students conducting these presentations and thus
playing a central role in this outreach effort [P21].
The existence of these partnerships obscures, to some extent, the uphill battle that
many Information Providers face. This is true even in those states in which the various
A2J stakeholders “play well in the sandbox together.” Among those who expressed the
greatest discontent with their current situations, the underlying problems varied. One
interviewee noted that her organization was the only legal services provider in the entire
state, whereas others had a distant (and, in one case, contentious) relationship with other

231

legal services organizations in the state. In the latter cases, the Information Providers
expressed skepticism about the value of building stakeholder relationships. A Pro Bono
Net staff member offered the following frank assessment of the situation in some states:
“[It] is all based on local resources….So, if you don’t have a good relationship
with the bar, if you don’t have a good relationship with the courts, if your courts
don’t care or believe that self-help resources make sense, how are you going to
create the network to allow these people to proceed to court on their own? So, it
takes a village, you know, to get the person through. In some states, that’s been
done well. And, in other states, it is, you know, an evolving process. Rome was
not built in one day and we’re building Rome [P5].
She described, for example, how the success of forms projects varies from state to state,
often depending on the extent to which history and politics prevents groups from being
flexible with their demands and willing to trust one another.
Even organizations that work together well can have conflicting interests. Some
courts’ reluctance to embrace the use of automated forms is one example of this type of
conflict. Several Information Providers indicated that the courts’ stance was a significant
impediment to progress in this area, citing it is a primary reason for their decision not to
include a full suite of online forms on their websites. Cooperation is particularly
important in this context though, as the court is the ultimate arbiter of whether a given
form will be accepted.
Moreover, many A2J stakeholders are supportive of statewide legal information
websites in theory but appear to be shying away from playing a more active role. One
Information Provider’s description of the library community’s waning involvement in the
site aptly illustrates this point. “[W]e really urged them [librarians] to participate in the
trainings and have a presence on our site and very few of them really took initiative to do

232

that. They use the resource but they really didn’t see why they should care about having a
presence on our site” [P34].
In some states, for example, working on the website is promoted as a way for
attorneys to fulfill their pro bono hours. Several Information Providers, however, report
that attorneys tend to gravitate toward direct client services for their pro bono hours,
feeling that it is a more valuable form of volunteer service. Repeated unsuccessful efforts
to gain traction within the legal services community have left several Information
Providers feeling discouraged. They have good ideas, such as one interviewee’s earlier
outreach efforts focused on low-income teenagers, based on her belief that teenagers are
likely to be the ones going online to search for information needed by other family
members. But, Information Providers’ inability to gain support for their ideas – from
those within their organizations as well as within other A2J stakeholder organizations –
creates an impasse that they do not know how to overcome.
This impasse is even more problematic in light of ongoing efforts to build online
intake and triage systems that are integrated with statewide legal information websites. A
number of interviewees suggested that some members of the legal services community
are not ready to make this leap to a system that encompasses both in-person and virtual
services. As one Pro Bono Net staff member noted, “Even phone intake is in some places
is disparaged, right? So this notion of changing the way we practice law and how we
provide services, not everybody is there yet” [P5].
These difficulties appear to stem, at least in part, from the fractionalized nature of
the legal services community in some states. As one Pro Bono Net staff member
described, other organizations may be creating online resources for self-help users but

233

there is no integration with the statewide legal information website. The reasons for this
lack of cohesiveness, ranging from the lack of a statewide technology support group to a
history of lack of cooperation among legal services organizations, were touched upon
during interviews but a thorough exploration of these reasons is beyond the scope of the
current study. Regardless of the reason, a fractionalized system is problematic within the
context of statewide legal information context to the extent that it leads to duplication of
efforts. Moreover, it does a disservice to self-help users as they have to go from site to
site to obtain the various information resources and services for which they are looking.
The solution, according to one interviewee, is the development of online portals that
bring together multi-media resources, forms, content written pursuant to the principles of
plain language, and chat services all in one place. While there is progress being made in
this area, there are still far too many stand-alone websites, the existence of which detracts
from efforts to convince members of the legal services community to focus their efforts
specifically on the statewide legal information website. As a result, many Information
Providers finding themselves unable to pull together a committed corps of individuals
who are invested enough in the site to contribute to it on a regular basis.
Information Providers working in states with fractionalized systems talked about
the lack of a shared vision and the role of the access to justice commission (or similar
statewide entity) in remedying this situation. In some states, it appears as though the A2J
commission has been instrumental in bringing awareness to self-represented litigants and
has embraced the statewide legal information website as instrumental to efforts to better
serve this population. One Information Provider, however, painted a bleaker portrait,
explaining how the vision of the A2J commission in her state conceives of the needs of

234

self-help users in a way that does not quite mesh with the mission of the statewide legal
information website. She offered the following example to illustrate this point: “[A] lot of
the content that we might develop might be how to represent yourself in a [Medicaid]
hearing. Well that doesn’t help the [A2J] Commission at all because they don’t care what
happens in administrative hearings. They only care about what happens in the public
court system” [P35]. The extent to which A2J commission is able to create a shared
vision among diverse organizations within a legal services community obviously varies,
but the very existence of such a body helps to shape the external environment
surrounding statewide legal information websites.
It should be noted that lack of cohesiveness was discussed in another way that
extends beyond the legal services community. In some states, the legal systems are
fractionalized to the point where different jurisdictions have different rules, forms, and
case management systems. This poses distinct challenges for Information Providers
working on statewide websites in those states, as it is crucial to make sure that users
know about the variations and are pointed towards those resources that can be applied to
their situation particular. This, of course, makes content development more arduous.
Creating plain language forms, for example, becomes much more labor-intensive when a
different set must be created for every jurisdiction within the state.
The collaboration that shapes the external environment surrounding statewide
legal information websites extends beyond state boundaries. Because legal services
organizations exist in an environment in which there are never enough resources for them
to accomplish everything they want to, individuals working in these organizations are
known for coming up with creative ways to accomplish their goals. One Pro Bono Net

235

staff member described the community of Information Providers as a mixture of people
who “love technology for technology’s sake” and people who view technology as a
means to provide better services to clients. These two groups balance each other out, with
the former group encouraging innovation and the latter group ensuring that the focus
remains on the users [P32].
As Information Providers struggle with budget and staffing issues, they keep an
eye on what their counterparts in other states are doing, and the importance of replication
was observed by a number of interviewees. The LawHelp and OST communities
facilitate learning and knowledge sharing among Information Providers, and more than
one interviewee spoke of the importance of sharing their experiences and innovations so
that others do not have to reinvent the proverbial wheel. Pro Bono Net, in particular, was
acknowledged as a driving force behind much of the collaboration among current and
former Information Providers.
LSC also continues to supports the growth of statewide legal information websites,
notwithstanding its diminished funding role in recent years. As described by one
interviewee, LSC has “been useful in terms of [being] a sounding board and keeping us in
touch with other programs who are also developing websites or changing websites
and…they’ve created a forum for discussion of the whole and they certainly have been
encouraging innovation around the websites” [P37]. LSC, in addition, holds an annual
TIG conference that facilitates an ongoing dialogue about many of the issues identified in
this study. This year’s conference, for example, included a training session on HotDocs
and A2J Author that was designed by the Ohio State Legal Services Association and Pro
Bono Net.

236

B.3. WEBSITE EVALUATIONS
The variation in terms of the environments in which statewide legal information
websites exist raises an interesting question as to whether these differences translate into
observable differences in the websites themselves. As a preliminary effort to address this
question, evaluations were conducted on a small number of websites. The sample was
purposive, with the goal of including states with markedly different environments, in
terms of infrastructure and external environment. Descriptions posted on each site reveal
differences in terms of how the sites are maintained and the stakeholders who are
involved in maintaining them:
LawHelp California is a “collaborative project with policy oversight from the CalJustice
Advisory committee and assistance from advocates at legal aid programs throughout the
state,” including the Legal Aid Association of California (the statewide membership
organization of legal services nonprofit organizations).
Idaho Legal Aid Services is a nonprofit statewide law firm and community education
organization. It differs from the others within the sample to the extent that the statewide
legal information website in Idaho is Idaho Legal Aid Services’ website.
The People’s Law Library of Maryland is housed within the law library, an arm of the
state government, as described in Chapter 4. It is “supported by Maryland’s non-profit
legal services providers, Maryland pro bono attorneys, and the legal academic
community.”
Michigan LegalHelp is managed by the Michigan Poverty Law Program (a joint effort
of Legal Services of South Central Michigan and the University of Michigan Law

237

School) that provides state support services to legal aid programs and other poverty law
advocates throughout the state.
Montana LawHelp is a project of the Montana Legal Services Association, and the
website lists a number of partners: the Montana Credit Unions for Community
Development, State of Montana Law Library, the State Bar of Montana, and the Montana
Supreme Court.
In selecting websites to include in the sample, several observations made by
Information Providers were also given careful consideration: 1) There are two main
nodes of the network of statewide legal information websites – the LawHelp community
and the OST community – but the former is more cohesive by virtue of having a national
non-profit organization (Pro Bono Net) oversee everything; 2) Some states charted their
own course from the beginning, and 3) There are leaders in the field – from the LawHelp
community, the OST community, and those which have gone their own way – to which
others look. Within this sample, two of the websites (California and Montana) are on Pro
Bono Net’s platform. They demonstrate the diversity that exists within that specific
network, representing legal services communities of radically different sizes. Idaho is
part of the OST community, and the other two states (Maryland and Michigan) have
charted their own courses, although Michigan has adopted several of the key program
elements developed by Illinois Legal Aid Online. Thus, notwithstanding the small size of
this sample, they are diverse in terms of how they are managed, the collaborations that
support them, and the platforms they use.
As described more fully in Chapter 3, these evaluations were limited in scope,
focused only on a small number of best practices identified in the literature, as well as by

238

survey respondents and interviewees. Each website was reviewed by at least three
individuals, using one of two scenarios. The scenarios revolved around hypothetical
legal issues in two areas in which self-help users tend to seek assistance – landlord-tenant
disputes and domestic relations matters. Evaluators were asked to complete a separate
worksheet for each evaluation, and the results were compiled in a matrix to compare
findings across the sites. Key findings from this analysis include the following:


Evaluators were typically able to find at least some information relevant to the
hypothetical situation on all of the websites with minimal difficulty.



The websites varied in terms of the extent to which they provided information
about procedural steps. All evaluations of Michigan and California content
indicated that this information was available, whereas four out of the five
evaluators of Idaho content could not location this information.



Evaluators had different opinions as to whether key legal terms were defined.
For example, two evaluators of Idaho’s domestic relations content stated that
terms were not defined, whereas a third noted that key terms were “linked to a
pop-up bubble that explains the tem in plain language.”



On each site, at least one evaluator had difficulty locating forms (or links to
forms). In some cases, the evaluator concluded that this information was not
available on the site. Other evaluators noted that they eventually located the
information after “drilling down” into the site. One evaluator described the
numerous steps he had to take to find any relevant forms on Maryland’s site,
concluding that “I think most people would give up looking after a few
minutes.”



At least one evaluator was able to locate multi-media resources on every
website except Montana LawHelp.



Contact information for legal services organizations was findable on every
website.

239

At the end of the evaluation worksheet, evaluators were asked to share any additional
thoughts or comments on their experiences in completing this exercise. Table 7.3
provides a selection of comments made about each of the websites.
Table 7.3: Evaluator Comments
State

Comments

California

“A bit cludgey on the second level with the multiple pages of options
under housing that are not clearly organized - it was one click less to get
here than the Michigan page, but less clear when I got here.”
“I really like the way LawHelp California presents the various topics its
users might be seeking information on — the use of icons is really helpful.
LawHelp California actually links to the California Courts (courts.ca.gov)
website for the step-by-step guide to eviction actions, but since the
California Courts’ website presents the information so well, there’s really
no reason for LawHelp California to recreate it on their own website.”

Idaho

“Kind of a jumbled site – interestingly they use a wordpress template, so
providing a best practices example based on this common template could
be a good outcome of your work”
“The information on child support wasn’t very useful for my purposes.
The Child Support Services Application and Booklet are useful for a firsttime applicant, but …[t]he only mention of modifying a child support
order in the booklet is the cost of filing such a petition with the court, but
doesn’t describe how to do it. It also seems a bit cumbersome that the
booklet launches as a pdf. Creating an HTML web page to match the rest
on the site would be more useful and accessible….The link to the “How
Child Support Services Can Help Your Family” page on the Idaho
Department of Health and Welfare contains some useful general
information….From that page, I did find a link to a page on “Changing a
Child Support Order,” which is the information I needed, but it took so
many clicks to get there, that the average user would have probably given
up on finding the information before they ever saw a link to this page.”

Maryland

“An interesting comparison to a library site rather than a nonprofit center
site - info was pretty text heavy and not very well cross linked, but

240

thorough.”

Michigan

“The experience of using these web pages, as opposed to the others in this
evaluation, is very much a problem of access and responsibility. It shares
many of the same deficiencies that I associate with library guides. It is
organized in a way that makes sense if you come at the information
finding problem with a structural approach: How is the information
organized in relation to either other sources of knowledge or the
governmental structure. The problem is most people, in my experience,
come at their information problems from the perspective of what they
don’t know, and then figure out the easiest/efficient way to get the least
amount of information in order to “resolve” the problem. Web pages
structured in the way the Maryland pages might be assume people want to
be taught how to find information.”
“Interesting site! The language was a tad legal-y (subsidized vs. nonsubsidized housing for example) - some of these terms may be clearer
within the user base though, due to their use by other agencies and orgs.”
“I found these web pages represent an excellent mid-point between the
best aspects of a minimalist approach to deliver complicated information
in a clearly efficient fashion and a bit more structured approach for people
who need more guidance, suggestions, and help in sorting through a
complicated set of data, explanations and discussions of legal
circumstances and situations. The problem I have with any kind of web
site of this type, however, is the huge expectation of literacy any user must
bring to the table to search and understand what is found…This web site is
better at addressing this literacy gap than most. But it still requires a great
deal of prior understanding of legal concepts.”

Montana

“The website was pretty straightforward and easy to use. It made me want
to search and see if they had a site like this for my home state.”
“There were a higher number of broken links on the Montana pages [and]
reliance on other info sources from other organizations with no clear
explanation that you were no longer on the MontanaLawHelp.org web
space”

These evaluations were too limited in scope to support even preliminary conclusions
about the effectiveness of the different approaches. Evaluators looking for the same

241

content, at times, appeared to have markedly different experiences, with none of the
websites emerging as the clear favorite among evaluators. The evaluations did, however,
cite some of the same concerns expressed by Information Providers regarding the ease
with which information can be found their sites and the readability of this content. There
are, for example, forms (or links to forms) and multi-media resources available on each
of these sites, but not all evaluators were able to locate them. As the evaluators have
attained a higher education level than typical self-help users, this raises questions about
whether the sites are meeting the needs of individuals facing barriers to information
access created by language or literacy. The evaluations thus point to the need for usercentered program evaluations, as discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8.
C. UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF USERS
In addition to these infrastructure and external environment elements, Information
Providers’ current activities are shaped by their perceptions of the information needs of
target users. As discussed in the findings, the way in which Information Providers define
target users vary to some degree from state to state, but the core is fundamentally the
same: low-income self-help users. At a very basic level, Information Providers’
perceptions of users guide content development in terms of substantive content areas. In
line with both the literature and survey responses, interviewees most frequently
mentioned domestic relations/family law, consumer issues, and housing specifically as
areas of priority.
In terms of types of content, nearly every Information Provider mentioned forms
as being one of the features that their users look for the most. Forms, however, are not
stand-alone items and content must be built up around forms in order to make them truly

242

usable. In thinking about developing forms, as well as other content, Information
Providers are generally aware that many target users face one or more barriers to
information access, due primarily to literacy and language issues. Stemming from this
recognition, a number of survey respondents and interviewees stressed the importance of
making content readable, often through the use of plain language techniques (or the
closely related techniques of clear communication and clear writing).
Closely related to the use of plain language is the importance of identifying target
reading levels and then making every effort to target that level, as well as the value of
offering content in different formats: “I think a lot of times no matter how clear we think
we’ve been on the text, a lot of clients with low literacy levels or other barrier have a
hard time absorbing anything beyond more than, you know, a few paragraphs” [P29]. The
use of multi-media content is not only a way to overcome literacy-related challenges but
also to guard against information overload. Not everyone, however, wholeheartedly
embraces the use of these newer formats. As one interviewee explained, there is the
danger of focusing on technology for technology’s sake:
We had one person on our [advisory committee] talking about, like, the comic
book thing and all that stuff and that’s fine but I don’t know if we need to go
there. There’s some degree of just … this is the law. Some of the processes
benefit from flowcharts but, you know, the photo novella thing – it’s like a big
thing. Yeah, maybe? They do role playing videos so, it’s like, well, if you can tie
it in with a good Youtube presence, maybe you’re going to help some people but I
don’t know [P27].
Information Providers, through their survey and interview responses, expressed a
commitment to providing resources that will be of assistance to their target users. The

243

evaluations, however, suggested that there is room for improvement in terms of how
content is being presented. There are several factors that may be at play here:


Not everyone who develops content for statewide legal information
websites appears to write with target users in mind. Attorneys are
substantive experts but may lack the skills to communicate their
knowledge to “laypersons.” For Information Providers who have a greater
understanding of the information barriers that their target users may face,
this can be frustrating:
Sometimes…I'll email [legal services providers in the state] and say,
“I’m looking for people to do such and such.” Or “what do you think
is important but not being addressed?”…. And so, if they want
something out there broadly, statewide, they’ll get in touch with me
and say “We want this on [the website]” and then they’ll get cross
because I’ll say, “If you want something on [the website], it has to be
readable.” Some people are up for that, and some people aren’t, you
know? …. And they work on it, but they just don’t have the patience to
get it where it needs to – patience or skill to get it where it needs to be
[P21].



Because of the inherent complexity of the law, even Information Providers
who are not attorneys may still struggle with creating content that is easily
understandable by laypersons.



Technology may be outpacing the implementation of strategies for content
development. Information Providers, for example, know that a growing
number of individuals are accessing their sites via mobile devices. They
also know that this shift has implications for website design (“it’s on a
much smaller screen, people have a much lower tolerance for what they
can read and what they can see and so we have to be very strategic about
how the information is architected” [P14]). Accomplishing the necessary
changes, however, may be difficult due to resource constraints.

Information Providers’ perceptions about target users also guide their outreach
efforts. These efforts appear to be principally focused on getting information out to A2J
stakeholder organizations that are connected, in some way or another, to their target
users. As discussed earlier in this chapter, A2J stakeholder organizations (notably, courts,
libraries and non-profit organizations) thus act as intermediaries through which

244

Information Providers can increase awareness about their websites. What is less clear
from the interviews, however, is the extent to which Information Providers use
intermediaries to actually connect with users. Only one Information Provider described
how the relationships they have built with community organizations enable them to work
directly with the individuals to whom those organizations provide services. In that
situation, an organization serving Spanish-speaking populations was instrumental in the
Information Provider setting up a focus group for a Spanish language mirror site.
Inasmuch as this type of dialogue between Information Providers and target users does
not appear to be the norm, we must consider the implications of Information Providers
engaging in content development, website design, and outreach without input from either
individuals within groups that make up the target audience or actual users. Information
Providers know that people are finding them via search engines; however, as evidenced
by the following quotes, questions remain about the level of awareness about the sites
among their target users:


“I really have a sense, a hunch that it’s not well known – that the site is still not
well-known…[a]mong any group. I don’t think any group you could name knows
it as well as we would think….And even though we’ve been around for ages and
there are people who are very supportive in the access to justice commission
community… [a]nd still you go into clerk’s offices and they’re like, ‘oh, wow,
this is new.’ And it’s not” [P27].



“I don’t know if people even think to go on the website for a legal problem” [P7].

Information Providers therefore know that site usage is increasing but they can only
speculate as to the reasons for this growth. Based upon the survey and interview data, it is
not clear if they are “circling back” to the intermediaries to find out what these
organizations are, in fact, doing (e.g., are librarians who have received training on the site

245

showing it to patrons?). Nor is it clear whether the outreach efforts are actually working
(e.g., are the patrons then using the site?). Because of this lack of knowledge, there is a
tendency among Information Providers to make assumptions that what they are doing is
working based on the site usage numbers they are seeing.
This lack of knowledge, in turn, negatively impacts Information Providers’ ability
to conduct any sort of program evaluation. In most states, there is not an established
history of ongoing, regular evaluation efforts in connection with statewide legal
informant websites. The LSC, which previously played a more significant role because of
the TIG program, did require grant recipients to engage is some type of evaluation
activity. Now, however, states do not have as many resources available for evaluation,
nor do most have a clear idea of how to proceed in this area (as first identified in the
Circuit Rider Report). As a substitute for formal evaluation efforts, Information Providers
solicit feedback from various A2J stakeholder organizations – namely, courts, legal
services organizations, social services agencies, and libraries – and rely very heavily on
Google analytics as either the main or only source of information about how they’re
doing. One Information Provider, for example, described how site usage data is presented
to the program’s primary funder as evidence of the “good work they’re doing” [P36].
Whether or not site usage data does provide such evidence is debatable though – such
numbers show that people are visiting the site but do not establish whether these visitors
are the people they are trying to reach. And, if they are not the intended users, the site is
not doing what it is supposed to do, raising the question of whether funders would, in
fact, view this as “good work.”

246

The reliance on these numbers, however, stems from the fact that they do not have
other data with which to make their case. This is due to the difficulties that Information
Providers face in connecting with website users who, for the most part, are anonymous.
Even one of the few interviewees who has conducted focus groups in connection with the
website noted the difficulty in recruiting participants. Part of this difficulty, she
suggested, is due to the life circumstances of many self-represented litigants, leading the
Information Provider and her staff to try different approaches:
I’m always surprised by [the difficulty with recruiting participants] because…we
recruit people through our legal aid partners and through self-help desks through the
courthouse – these are people clearly who are lower income, who, you know, 20
dollars for an hour of their time should be meaningful, right? And, we still have a
very difficult time getting people and I think that it’s largely [that] the nature of that
demographic group is that, you know, when you are sort of living in an uncertain
environment…it’s not easy to plan anything because you never know what’s going to
happen tomorrow and so I think that’s the reality of the people that we’re trying to
serve and we just need to find a little better way to get them engaged and maybe we
could try to do…the usability less formally. We can just sort of do it ad hoc – like,
today we’re going to go over to the court and pull people who are ready and put them
in a room and talk to them. Just listen to them really [P14].
Another Information Provider echoed this sentiment about the difficulty of getting users
more directly involved – she expressed an interest in including clients of legal services
organizations on the site’s advisory committee but acknowledged that, for many of them,
participation would be difficult (i.e., are they willing and able to miss work to attend an
advisory committee meeting?).
Given these difficulties, the reliance on site usage data is understandable. Information
Providers, however, specifically mentioned that a key limitation of Google Analytics is
that this data cannot tell them if the people using the site are members of their target

247

audience. Other information that cannot be gleaned from site usage but that Information
Providers would like to know includes:
Is the information on the site helpful? “[H]ere’s what I would love to know – I would
love to know if it’s helpful information. You know, the only time I hear from my users is
when they’re frustrated or when they’re not finding what they need or what they think
should be there….so I would love to know what’s going on with the other people who
have come to the site and downloaded the brochure or gotten a form or found a referral
to their local legal services program, I would love to know down the stream if [it] was at
all useful to them. I assume so, I’d like to think so, but I don’t know” [P10].
Can they use the information? “I would like to know if they have the ability to use
what we’re making or creating for them and if it’s really helping them. I would love to
know what the outcome is of the situation – you know, if somebody is getting evicted and
they find the eviction pamphlet, can they actually, you know, advocate for themselves?
And what happens at the end? And…I’d like to know if…when they read the pamphlet,
are we really explaining things to them – you know when you’re kind of reading
something and all of a sudden you realize that you’re understanding it and getting it? You
kind of realize, ‘Oh, ok, this is making sense.’ I kind of wish there was some way I could
gauge that” [P7].
What else would help them? “I wish they’d give us more feedback about what would
make the website better….I’d love to get more information about what else they need,
what else they would want” [P24].

248

How did they use it? “[I]t would be really helpful to know if there was – if the content
that people found is content they used and how did they use it. Did they just use it to
inform themselves or understand the law better, what their rights and responsibilities are?
Or did they use it to create a document that they sent to another person or to a company
to help them accomplish x, y, z? Or did they use it to create a document that they brought
to court and then did it work? You know, was it any good? So, that’s the kind of
information that would be really useful to me because I would want to then try to develop
more materials along those lines” [P16].
Each of these questions center around whether or not the site is meeting the needs of its
target users. They are, in effect, asking about the impacts of the resources and services
Information Providers are providing through statewide legal information websites. The
overarching question then becomes: How do you measure impact in this environment?
One interviewee, in talking about evaluation activities, suggested that measuring
outcomes was impossible with statewide legal information websites because the
population served is comprised of anonymous website users.
LSC and Pro Bono Net, however, have become increasingly focused on
assessment activities. And, as one interviewee noted, this is trickling down to the rest of
the legal services community [P32]. LSC, for example, provides detailed guidance about
the evaluation plans that must be submitted by TIG grantees (LSC, n.d., “Evaluation
Plans”). LSC recommends the use of multiple evaluation methods and data sets,
including administrative data (e.g., website usage data, descriptive data about the types of
outreach conducted and training provided), survey data (collected from users, staff
attorneys, and court staff), and qualitative data collected through interviews, focus

249

groups, and observations. Pro Bono Net, in connection with the LHI project, makes
evaluation reports available to individuals working on document assembly initiatives.
The LSC guidance, in particular, is promising as it tacitly recognizes the
limitations of relying too much on website usage data. To answer questions about
whether target users are able to effectively use resources and services available through a
statewide legal information website, Information Providers must bridge the gap that
currently exists between themselves and their users. This study revealed how
collaboration underlies most Information Providers’ efforts in the areas of content
development and outreach. In contrast, it appears that only a few states have implemented
evaluation efforts that leverage the resources and connections of the organizations with
which they typically collaborate. The efforts undertaken to date, however, aptly
demonstrate how other A2J stakeholder organizations can expand their intermediary role
– they can move beyond increasing awareness about the website to connecting
Information Providers with actual users and/or individuals with unmet legal needs who
could benefit from using the site.
To date, most of the collaborative evaluation efforts have involved tracking online
forms. The following description of one such pilot evaluation study was provided by an
Information Provider:
[W]e tried to get some feedback from people after they completed a form. We
asked them to fill out a survey and then we circled back and followed up with
them after they would have at least filed it or hopefully gone through the court
system and we tried to get a feel for … how did it work for them? Was it the first
time? Did it seem better or worse than when you handwrite it?....We also
surveyed judges, court assistance officers, and clerks, and attorneys to try to get a
feel for what was the value of the interactive forms – did it seem like the people
that were using the interactive forms had a better experience than ones who just
kind of found a form and handwrote the information or typed the information? So,

250

we do have that type of data as far as value and use but we don’t have just the
metrics, I guess, the numbers of exactly how many are filed and that kind of stuff
[P13].
MLH is currently conducting a similar evaluation study, funded through the TIG
program. Of particular interest to other Information Providers is a statement within the
project description posted on LSC’s website that it “will be promoted to the national
community so that lessons learned will inform self-help initiatives across the country
(LSC, n.d., “2013 TIG project descriptions”).
This study involves the review of divorce court filings in three categories:
complaints drafted on MLH; complaints drafted by an attorney; and complaints drafted
by a self-represented litigant on non-MLH forms. For selected files, researchers will
collect the following data about the parties (e.g., did the plaintiff’s representation change
at any time during the case?), service of process, the ultimate disposition (e.g., was the
case dismissed? If so, why?), and the pleadings used (e.g., did both parties use MLH
pleadings?). Researchers have also been looking to obtain files from the time period
before divorce forms and other web tools were available via MLH so as to identify
changes that may be attributable to the website.
In addition to the review of files, researchers will conduct interviews with court
clerk staff, judges and their staff, and self-help center staff, seeking to learn more about
their interactions with self-represented litigants and to gather their impressions of how
these interactions have changed since the launch of MLH. They will also be soliciting
their input about what points in the process self-represented litigants have difficulty and
how MLH could better address those issues. Through several different avenues (e.g.,
online surveys, interviews), researchers are also obtaining data directly from users. The

251

online survey asks questions about the type of legal matter, whether or not the user had a
lawyer for any part of the case, whether the user feels as though the court understands
what he/she is trying to do, whether the user feels as if he/she were able to make his case
before the court, and whether MLH helped in handling the legal matter. In this evaluation
project, both the courts and self-help centers are instrumental in connecting MLH with
individuals who would otherwise be anonymous.
The success of this type of project, however, clearly depends on cooperation from
the courts. A previous attempt to track online forms ran into problems when the courts
stopped doing their part:
We used to get some information from our Supreme Court about filings – they
had a specific code system…and we have those codes on the forms – and the user
prints them out so they take them to the court and file them and the court clerks
are supposed to type into their system the code and that was supposed to give us a
rough idea of how many of those…interactive forms are filed…[then] the
Supreme Court kind of quit keeping track of that stuff – the court clerks just
didn’t do a very good job. You know, they get a divorce petition – they just put in
the number off their head and they wouldn’t really look at the form so the
numbers were always a little bit skewed or suspect [P13].
These efforts represent one way that Information Providers can work with A2J
stakeholder organizations to measure the impact of statewide legal information websites.
There are a number of unexplored avenues here, however. Chapter 8 provides a
framework from a user-centered program evaluation that leverages existing collaborative
relationships to provide Information Providers with the information they need in order to
provide effective assistance to self-help users.

252

CHAPTER 8: RECOMMENDATIONS & DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
A. RECOMMENDATIONS
As explained in Chapter 1, a key rationale for this study lies within the LSC’s strategy
calling for statewide legal information websites to serve as a platform for integrated legal
services delivery systems. Having been identified as an integral part of future legal
services, the need to develop a better understanding of what these websites currently do
to facilitate access to legal information by low-income individuals is clear. Building upon
these websites without an understanding of their current practices (or the issues and
challenges Information Providers face) could potentially undermine the LSC’s carefully
constructed vision.
There is a mismatch, however, between this vision and the current situation in many
of the states from which data were collected. The survey and interviews revealed that
these websites are not often seen as a priority by everyone within the organization that
maintains them, leaving them vulnerable in the face of ongoing budgetary and staffing
reductions. At the same time, the economic constraints permeating the legal services
community have led to increasing calls for programs to justify their existence by
demonstrating their effectiveness. Statewide legal information websites have not been
immune from these calls, as Information Providers in many states still struggle to gain
traction within their own organizations as well as the broader legal services community.
Many Information Providers find themselves in a difficult position, due to a lack of
connection with their actual users that precludes them from demonstrating their

253

effectiveness beyond website usage data. Given the struggles they described in gaining
support within their organization, as well as within the broader legal services community,
it is all the more important for Information Providers to be able to make stronger, more
convincing cases for the value of statewide legal information websites.
Since the early years of the websites’ development, Information Providers have been
encouraged to incorporate evaluation into their regular activities. Several
recommendations set forth in the report summarizing findings from the 2004 Statewide
Legal Information Website Study specifically reference evaluation. For example:
Recommendation Seven: A Partnership Strategy
Website staff and managers should have a clear partnership building strategy that
reaches out to the key actual and potential stakeholders for buy-in, content,
marketing, access partnerships, evaluation and funding.
Recommendation Fourteen: Evaluation
Website staff and managers should have an evaluation strategy that provides the
feedback necessary to strengthen the sit [sic], and maximizes its service capacity and
effectiveness.
The report encouraged website managers and staff to design a strategy that focuses on the
“overall comprehensibility and utility of the site” (p. 28). Ten years later, there has been
some progress toward the development of this kind of strategy in some states, as
evidenced by the evaluation projects discussed as the end of Chapter 7. Across the
network of statewide legal information websites, however, the progress is markedly
uneven. As noted in the 2007 Circuit Rider program, website coordinators tend to focus

254

on content development, rather than activities that are viewed as more peripheral, such as
outreach and evaluation. Moreover, this failure to develop a culture of ongoing evaluative
efforts very much reflects a pervasive problem facing the legal services community,
namely, “deep-seated obstacles to effective program assessment—‘the lack of clear and
objective standards” and “the insufficiency of data concerning the satisfaction of clients,
the quality of assistance, and its impact on the individuals and communities served’”
(Alfieri, 2013).
To date, evaluation activities in many states have principally involved an ongoing
review of website usage statistics. The importance of this data is not being contested;
however, as observed by several Information Providers, those numbers fail to tell the
whole story. In the interest of filling the existing gaps in information that preclude
Information Providers from knowing how they are doing, we must introduce a paradigm
shift, whereby the websites are viewed as programs and evaluation activities are designed
and implemented accordingly. Underlying this recommendation is the perspective that
these websites are an extension of traditional legal services, rather than technology
projects that exist somewhat separately from these traditional services. This
recommendation is also premised on an understanding that the so-called “human” issues
related to development and maintaining these websites (e.g., partnership building,
identifying user needs) are central or, in the words of one Pro Bono Net staff member,
that “[i]t’s not just all about the technology” [P5].
A.1. Making the Case for Program Evaluation
In making this paradigm shift, the first hurdle to overcome is defining statewide
legal information websites as programs – they exist in a somewhat gray space, as many

255

individuals within the legal services community still struggle to understand why they
exist and how they fit into the broader access to justice framework. Royse, Thyer, and
Padgett (2010), however, define a program as “an organized collection of activities
designed to reach certain objectives” (p. 5). Statewide legal information websites – the
majority of which have a statement of purpose or mission listed on the site that is related
to the provision of legal information and services to their target users – fit within this
definition. The extent to which they have an identity distinct from the organization that
maintains them varies from state to state, due to differences in funding and staffing.
Almost every website has a distinct presence (even if it is part of the organization’s
general website) and presumably has an impact that can be measured apart from the
organization’s other activities.
Their current situation will influence the type of evaluation that Information
Providers feel prepared to undertake at this time. Common evaluation strategies include
needs assessment, formative evaluation, process evaluation and outcome evaluation
(Patton, 1987; Rossi & Freeman, 1989; Royse, Thyer & Padgett, 2010). A formative
evaluation, for example, may be beneficial to Information Providers working on recently
launched or redesigned websites who are interested in gathering information to improve
their current operations. Given the legal services community’s focus on demonstrating
effectiveness, however, outcome measurement may be the most important type of
evaluation activity for many Information Providers.
In recent years, practitioners and scholars within the non-profit sector have become
increasingly focused on the measurement of outcomes (Herman & Renz, 2008; Morino,
2011; Penna, 2011) and Information Providers can benefit from the rich literature in this

256

area. The results of the program (i.e., what has changed) are the outcomes (Ridge, 2010).
Morino (2011), using key concepts from leading works in the area of outcomes
assessment, defines outcomes as “[s]ocially meaningful changes for those served by a
program, generally defined in terms of expected changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes,
behavior, condition, or status” (p.11). Outcomes are closely related to effectiveness,
defined by Berk and Rossi (1990) as “the extent to which a policy or program is
achieving its goals and purposes” (p. 15).
The first – and arguably most important – task is selecting an appropriate outcome to
measure. The current evaluation activities of Information Providers focus on outputs,
rather than outcomes. Website usage data is an output, comparable to client counts and
attendance in evaluations of traditional social services programs (Saxton et al., 2007). As
observed by Patton (1987),
[i]t makes sense to count … the number [of people] who receive or report some
concrete benefit from the program. There are many attributes of programs, however,
that do not lend themselves to counting. Even the scaling of quality attributes is an
inadequate way of capturing either program quality or the effect of a program on the
quality of life experienced by participants following the program (p. 29).
What then are the effects upon which Information Providers should focus? There is
growing recognition within the legal services community that effectiveness cannot be
narrowly defined in terms of legal outcomes (i.e., whether someone prevails in court)
(Albiston & Sandefur, 2013). This is certainly true within the context of statewide legal
information websites. A statewide legal information website user, for example, may not
prevail in court because the respondent raises a valid affirmative defense. In this scenario,
the legal outcome has nothing to do with whether the site effectively provided the user

257

with information applicable to his situation and/or within guidance on how to bring this
matter into the legal system.
Information Providers are likely to think of outcomes in different terms, given the
various approaches they have adopted in developing and maintaining their statewide legal
information websites. Currently, the website exist along a continuum, with some focusing
primarily on providing information resources and others using the website as a vehicle to
provide legal services to eligible individuals. The latter approach is reflected in the
growing number of initiatives that seek to integrate the website with online intake and
triage services. Underlying these different approaches are different ideas about the
purpose of the site – Is it to provide basic information? Is it to facilitate transactions with
the court (e.g., through online forms)? Or, is it to transform the relationship between
individuals with legal needs and legal services providers?40
Notwithstanding these differences, all Information Providers need to think about the
specific user needs that the site aims to address. Saxton et al. (2007) developed a logic
model in connection with assessing the effectiveness of 2-1-1 services. This model set
forth a range of outcomes (short-term, mid-term, and long-term) for individuals,
organizations, and society. By way of example, short-term and mid-term outcomes for
individuals include immediate answers and comprehensive solving of problems,
respectively. In a similar vein, one possible outcome associated with statewide legal
information websites is that a user is able to locate information on the website that
answers the question that brought him to the website and that he is able to understand

This concept of transformation is borrowed from the e-government literature: “[T]ransformation
means that e-government will cause or permit the relationship between citizens and governments to
fundamentally change in positive ways, generally producing much more citizen-centric and
responsive government” (Coursey & Norris, 2008, p. 524). See also Baum & Di Maio (2000).
40

258

how that information applies to his particular situation. The evaluations conducted as part
of this study (as discussed in Chapter 7) raise questions about the extent to which
statewide legal information websites are currently achieving this outcome.
Other Information Providers may be more concerned with outcomes related to online
document assembly. Regardless of the specific outcome identified, however,
effectiveness should be measured from the point of view of users, as well as of
Information Providers and other stakeholders (e.g., external funders). Different
stakeholders are likely to have somewhat divergent interests. Information Providers, for
instance, are operating within resource constraints about which users may be unaware.
As such, it is prudent to identify outcome measures for different stakeholders (as done by
Saxton et al.).
For many Information Providers, identifying the outcome to measure may be less
problematic than figuring out how to actually measure it. That Information Providers are
trying to gather information from typically anonymous website users, rather than clients
who are walking through the door, is a significant challenge. In many cases, however, the
users may have direct interactions with any number of the A2J stakeholder organizations
with which Information Providers collaborate. Building upon this premise, below is a
brief outline of user-centered program evaluation activities that require Information
Providers to leverage existing collaborative relationships to connect with users. It has
elements of both “community-based participatory research” (CBPR) and “participatory
action research” (PAR). As described by Charn & Selbin (2014), “CBPR has emerged as
a new paradigm to make research more inclusive and relevant by bringing together
academics and communities to address community priorities. PAR strives to produce

259

knowledge and change at the same time. Challenges abound, but so do opportunities. The
potential…to help answer pressing questions about community needs, delivery models,
and service efficacy has never been greater.” (p. 169).
A number of the Information Providers interviewed indicated that their current
limited evaluation activities were due not to a lack of interest, but rather to a belief that
they lacked the resources to do more at this time. Like content development and outreach
though, evaluation can be a collaborative effort, as described below. Moreover,
Information Providers do not have to reinvent the wheel when planning evaluation
activities – both LSC and Pro Bono Net have made tools and resources available to
Information Providers and states can look to what others have done in terms of evaluation
activities. Both organizations, for example, make project evaluation reports available that
can serve as guidance for Information Providers trying to identify appropriate evaluation
methods and data collection strategies. LSNTAP also provides general guidance on
evaluating technology projects, as well as reports of specific initiatives (e.g., the online
survey tool used in Georgia deployed to obtain feedback from a dispersed population).
A.2. A Proposed Framework for User-Centered Program Evaluation
The proposed framework for user-centered program evaluation draws from current
practices identified by Information Providers, as well as from research done in the area of
user-centered e-government (Bertot & Jaeger, 2006; de Roiste, 2013; Pietersen, Ebbers &
van Dyk, 2007) and information services (Fisher, Durrance & Hinton, 2004; Saxton et al.,
2007; Sim & Rocha, 1998; Windle et al., 2010). These evaluation activities can provide
more substantial evidence of value than the Google Analytics upon which many
Information Providers rely; it can lay the groundwork for the next iteration of statewide

260

legal information websites that are designed with the “user’s world view” at the center of
the process (Westbrook, 2008, p.35). This framework is not intended to be a detailed
prescription for Information Providers to follow but rather to offer general guidance on
how they can engage in evaluation efforts that will provide them with information about
the effectiveness of their current efforts. As illustrated in Figure 8.1, it calls for
Information Providers to assess the current legal information needs of their users; the
readability and understandability of current site content; the usability of the site overall;
and, the quality of documents created with the assistance of services available through the
site.

Identification of current user needs
Several Information Providers indicated that findings from legal needs studies
were used to identify areas of focus during the initial phase of content development. As

261

noted by Sandefur and Smyth (2011), however, “in most states, the public‘s civil legal
needs are not routinely assessed and no entity can ensure that services in specific areas
match the needs of the eligible populations in those areas” (p. v). Moreover, these general
legal needs studies, even if current, may not tell Information Providers everything they
need to know. For example, a legal needs study conducted in Kansas in 2011 addressed
issues such as whether individuals have Internet access, as well as their interest in
accessing legal information online, but did not address potential barriers to intellectual
access (i.e., whether individuals could understand and apply the legal information they
read online).
The needs assessment recommended here has a somewhat narrower focus than the
legal needs studies conducted to date. While needs assessments are typically seen as a
preliminary evaluation activity (Royse, Thyer & Padgett, 2010), needs evolve over time
and Information Providers may want to verify that the initial needs identified are still
prevalent today. The data collected through a needs “reassessment” would guide the other
evaluation efforts – what are the legal issues that lead users to the website? What types of
resources are they looking for? What are the difficulties they face in accessing
information on the site (in terms of both physical and intellectual barriers)? The
collection of this information would involve reaching out directly to the various
stakeholders with whom Information Providers collaborate – e.g., courts, libraries, legal
aid and other non-profit organization, social services agencies. Information Providers can
turn to tools developed by the LSC (as part of its Client Website Evaluation System) to

262

assist with conducting this type of community needs assessment.41 The Community
Provider Survey, for example, can be used to gather “information from other legal
services providers, social services providers and community groups about the visibility
and usefulness of the website. Questions include: 1) For what type of legal issues do you
refer those who you assist to the Web site, and 2) What do users typically have trouble
with or ask for help with when using the Web site?
These community stakeholders, in addition to providing their perspectives on user
needs, can serve as a direct link to users. LSNTAP, in training materials posted on its
website, suggests that students in community education courses, law school clinic clients,
and HUD Neighborhood Network users can play an important role in evaluation
(LSNTAP, n.d., “Website Functions, Stakeholders, Partners, and Resources). Whether or
not an Information Provider has access to any of these groups depends largely upon their
existing relationships, however. The previously referenced focus group convened by one
Information Provider in connection with her state’s recently developed Spanish-language
site is an example of this approach. Although the proposed evaluation framework
emphasizes the importance of connecting with actual users, gaining input from
individuals who belong to target user groups is valuable at this early stage.
There are ways, however, that actual users may be reachable at this stage.
Information Providers in several states have conducted outreach at domestic violence
shelters and public libraries; others work closely with self-help centers throughout their
state. The Community Provider Survey would provide information about whether partner
organizations are, in fact, telling their clients and patrons about the site. If that is the case,
Although LSC only requires recipients of new and renewal website grants to complete these
evaluations, they provide a useful framework for all Information Providers as they think about
implementing more rigorous evaluations.
41

263

Information Providers could then work with staff members at these partner organizations
to talk with a group of clients (or patrons) about their information needs and their
experiences with using the statewide legal information website.
This type of needs assessment is a significant step above the anecdotal evidence
upon which many Information Providers currently rely, even if does not involve
collecting data from random samples of either community stakeholders or website users.
As noted in the instructions for the Community Provider Survey, “even if the data
produced from such samples cannot meet the requisite criteria for scientific reliability,
they nonetheless can provide program managers with valuable practical knowledge with
which to assess system design and operations and make appropriate adjustments.”
Assessment of readability of existing content
Once the Information Providers have a clearer picture of their users’ information
needs and the barriers they face in accessing information, based upon the community
needs assessment outlined above, they can turn their focus to evaluating the extent to
which the website meets those needs. This involves examining content available on the
site to determine if it is readable and understandable by users.
This part of the evaluation can be comprised of two strategies. The first is a
systematic review of a selection of content in the legal content areas identified as most
important during the community needs assessment, using one of the available tools for
analyzing reading grade level, such as 1) the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Score (in Word
or WordPerfect) or 2) OpenAdvocate WriteClearly (a free web-based tool). In addition,
using plain language resources available online (e.g., the Maryland A2J Commission’s
“Writing for Self-Represented Litigants” [2012] or Legal Assistance of Western New

264

York, Inc.’s “The Essential Plain Language Collection” [n.d]), Information Providers can
create a checklist of plain language best practices and review the selected content items
against this checklist. The Plain Language Checklist used by Michigan Legal Help
(attached as Appendix K) has two sections – “Checking Word Choice” and “Checking
Writing Structure” – that are likely to be helpful to Information Providers.
In conducting this part of the evaluation, Information Providers may want to
leverage existing relationships with laws schools. As discussed in Chapter 6, one
Information Provider is currently providing clear writing training to law students enrolled
in a brief advice clinic, as well as working with them on writing content for the statewide
legal information website. This approach has been praised by Staudt (2013), who has
been advocating for law schools to develop clinic-based opportunities through which
students can “learn core competencies needed in an increasingly technological
profession, while they build tools and write content to help low-income, self-represented
litigants overcome serious barriers in their pursuit of justice” (Staudt, 2013). Similarly,
Charn and Selbin (2013) and Alfieri (2013) call for an expanded role for law school
clinics in empirical research. Several of the reasons they cite – their ties to client
communities and their access to expertise and data – highlight why clinics could play a
role in program evaluation. Involving law students in plain language review is just one
way that they could contribute to evaluation efforts, while also providing them with
marketable skills that will make them more effective practitioners when they enter the
workforce.
These readability assessments could be supplemented with focus groups that
ideally, once again, would be comprised of website users with whom Information

265

Providers can connect through their partners. During focus group sessions, users can be
asked to review a small number of articles, brochures, or other written materials and then,
as a group, asked questions aimed at assessing whether they comprehended what they just
read. For example, after having participants read an article about obtaining a
garnishment, questions can be asked about whether they understand what a garnishment
is and what information is needed in order to complete a Request and Writ for
Garnishment.
Assessment of Website Usability
Bertot and Jaeger (2008) cite usability testing as a key methodology to be
employed in user-centered e-government evaluations.42 Usability testing is not a novel
concept with statewide legal information websites – Pro Bono Net conducted it before
rolling out the latest iteration of the LawHelp platform and two Information Providers
discussed their experiences with this form of evaluation. It, however, has not been part of
the evaluation efforts of the majority of Information Providers who participated in this
study.
Usability testing is related to the readability assessments described above and, in
fact, can be viewed as the other piece of the puzzle of figuring out whether users have
intellectual access to site content. As observed by Bertot and Jaeger (2006), usability
testing can explore whether “navigation and orientation are intuitive; elements of the site
perform as users anticipate; elements of the site are clearly labeled; [and] instructions are
Accessibility testing, another important methodology noted by Bertot & Jaeger, can involve
both user testing and expert testing. To the extent that Information Providers may find it difficult
to connect with users who have disabilities (even with the assistance of collaborators),
accessibility testing is not part of the user-centered evaluation set forth here. It is worth noting,
however, that Information Providers’ very limited discussion of accessibility in response to
survey and interview questions raises interesting questions about their awareness of the particular
needs of individuals with disabilities that are worth exploring in a future study.
42

266

meaningful and easy to follow” (p. 165). Thus, while the readability assessments focus on
specific items of content, usability can look across the site to evaluate if users can address
the information need that brought them to the site. This is particularly important as
statewide legal information websites become increasingly interactive, with the addition of
online forms and intake systems. For example, usability testing can provide valuable
information about whether a step-by-step process for completing a form is intuitive or
likely to leave a user frustrated due to a failure to define key legal terms or provide
detailed instructions. Usability testing, as noted by Westbrook (2009), can help identify
what helps people move through a problem-solving process.
One option for Information Providers to consider is approaching undergraduate or
graduate classes in computer science or information science departments about making
usability testing a project for one of their classes. This approach was employed in both
states where usability testing has been conducted and is similar to the translation projects
developed by one Information Provider (described on p. 191). Those Information
Providers with usability testing experience, however, acknowledged the difficulties they
have had in recruiting participants. To overcome these challenges, one suggested a more
informal approach. If the problem is getting participants to commit in advance to coming
to a usability testing at a designated time, one possible solution is to move the usability
testing into a self-help center operated out of a library or courthouse. Participants would
not have to make an advance commitment but rather only have to spend extra time at the
self-help center that day (i.e., after they have addressed the purpose of their visit).
Moreover, conducting the usability test at a self-help center may make it a less

267

intimidating experience for users as they will already have some familiarity with the
environment, thus removing another potential barrier to participation.
Review of documents filed by website users
The fourth component of the proposed evaluation framework requires
collaboration with a different A2J stakeholder – the courts. The previous chapter
described several pilot projects in which Information Providers are working with courts
to track documents filed by users as they make their way through the court system. Here,
the purpose of tracking documents is not to determine the legal outcome but rather to see
if the user is able to navigate their way through the system to the point at which a
judgment is rendered. The user’s success, for example, in completing a divorce petition
through an automated document preparation system built into the statewide legal
information website is evidence that he was provided with sufficient information to
navigate that particular process. If the website leads users through the process of
electronically filing documents, a successful filing is further evidence of the helpfulness
of the instructions and guidance offered through the website.
There are several limitations to this particular evaluation effort – it can only be
employed with those statewide legal information websites that provide some type of
access to online forms. Moreover, the ability to track the forms is dependent upon users
only being able to create them through the automated document preparation system or the
court making some type of designation when it accepts a document for filing. As a
practical matter, even if Information Providers could recruit law students to assist with
this venture, it is a labor intensive endeavor that could only be undertaken in connection
with a limited set of case filings. When combined with the other evaluations efforts

268

described above, however, a pilot evaluation study of this nature could provide valuable
information about what users are actually able to accomplish through the website.
B. DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
At the outset of this study, it was anticipated that the different approaches that
Information Providers have taken in developing and maintaining statewide legal
information websites would yield a select number of categories, thus laying the
groundwork for future studies that would examine the effectiveness of these different
approaches. Findings from the study did reveal a number of dimensions across which the
websites vary (e.g., infrastructure, platform, managing organization, collaboration with
community stakeholders), any of which could theoretically serve as the basis for a
comparative analysis. This study also opened the “programmatic black box” and
identified what Information Providers are doing.
It also, however, identified what Information Providers are not doing, namely,
program evaluation. The proposed framework for user-centered program evaluation
described above can be used to assess the effectiveness of the approach adopted by any
given state. For Information Providers, the proposed evaluation activities, together with
findings from the current study about the role of collaboration in overcoming challenges
related to funding and staffing, can enhance their understanding of the current state of
affairs. Each user-centered program evaluation can also provide a roadmap for other
states that may be interested in adopting a similar approach.
In addition, the study revealed that the specific environment in which a statewide
legal information website exists shapes what Information Providers are able to do. As
such, once we have a better understanding of the current state of affairs of individual

269

websites, we can engage in a comparative analysis that squarely address the question of
the extent to which different environments yield different websites. One potential line of
inquiry is whether a relationship exists between different environmental factors (e.g.,
sources of funding; partnering organizations; political landscape) and the effectiveness of
a given website.
Looking beyond statewide legal information websites, future research should also
include in-depth explorations of how various community stakeholders (e.g., courts,
libraries) are working together to connect self-help users with the legal information they
need. Libraries are increasingly seen as a natural partner in access to justice initiatives,
but little is known about what these partnerships look like in practice. Such research
would not only build upon this study but also upon previous research in the area of
community-based partnerships that seek to provide enhanced services through innovative
uses of technology (Jaeger, Taylor & Gorham, in press; Taylor, Gorham, Jaeger & Bertot,
2014). Empirical studies that shed light on how libraries work with legal services
organizations and courts (which may have quite different goals and priorities) would be
an important step toward building a model of legal services-library collaboration that
could be replicated in a variety of contexts. A multi-site case study, for example, could be
conducted of self-help centers housed in public law libraries.
These are but a couple of the paths that future research in this area may take. In
the Introduction, it was observed that the legal services community has been criticized for
its lack of empirical research upon which to make decisions about resource allocation.
Progress is being made though, and opportunities abound for research that bridges theory

270

and practice to examine the delivery of legal services in this country. Almost a century
ago, Reginald Heber Smith, in Justice and the Poor (1919), observed that
a well-funded, well-administered civil legal aid system is of direct concern not
only to the fair administration of justice, but to the well-being of the nation. It is
of high importance that such developments be encouraged and supported, not for
the sake of the legal aid organizations themselves, . . . but because in them, with
all their faults and weaknesses, is contained our best immediate hope for a
realization of our ideal of such an equal administration of the laws that denial of
justice on account of poverty shall forever be made impossible in America (p.
249)
This remains true today, and community-based research that brings together the full
range of access to justice stakeholders – from the administrators of the highest courts to
self-represented litigants – may be our “best immediate hope” for making definitive
progress toward closing the justice gap.

Appendix C: IRB Application, Part II (Original)
1. Abstract:
This research is being undertaken in connection with an exploratory study of the
network of statewide legal information websites in the United States that developed
through funding from the Legal Services Corporation’s Technology Initiatives Grant
program. Through an online survey of individuals involvement in the development,
implementation, and maintenance of these initiatives, together with follow-up
interviews with a select number of survey respondents, this study seeks to determine
key factors influencing the development of statewide legal information websites and
identify current “best practices” in connection with providing legal information through
these websites. This study uses the practices, perceptions and knowledge of this group
of key individuals as a lens through which to better understand the experience of
website users as well as to examine the role that statewide legal information websites
play in expanding access to justice for self-represented litigants and other traditionally
underserved populations.
2. Subject Selection:
a.

b.

c.

The survey will be sent to individuals who have been in the past or are currently
involved in the planning, implementation, and management of websites (hereinafter,
the “Legal Information Providers”) identified by the Legal Services Corporation
(LSC) as “statewide legal information website[s]” (hereinafter, the “Legal
Information Websites”). The researcher has identified relevant Legal Information
Providers through contact information provided on the Legal Information Websites
and by requesting information through online submission forms. Survey respondents
will be asked if they would be willing to participate in a follow-up interview that will
explore key themes from the survey in greater detail. Individuals who participate in
follow-up interviews will be asked to recommend other potential interview subjects.
We will not recruit individuals under age 18.

The survey will be sent to approximately 50-60 individuals directly, as well as to
individuals that subscribe to a listserv maintained by Pro Bono Net. Follow-up
interviews will be conducted with approximately 25 individuals.

284

3. Procedures:

Survey of Legal Information Providers: The survey (see Appendix 1) will be
administered online with Qualtrics. Individuals identified as being currently involved
with a Legal Information Website will be recruited via email (Appendix 2) and will be
provided with a link to the survey in the initial email message. In addition, a
recruitment message (Appendix 3) will be sent out via a listserv maintained by Pro
Bono Net, a national non-profit organization that works closely with non-profit legal
organizations throughout the U.S. A reminder will be sent out via email two weeks after
the initial recruitment message.
It is anticipated that the survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.

Follow-Up Interviews with Legal Information Providers: Survey respondents will be
asked to participate in follow-up interviews. Other interviewees recommended by
voluntary participants also will be recruited via email, with the participants making the
initial contact.

These interviews will be semi-structured and follow the interview protocol attached as
Appendix 4.

5. Benefits:
There are no direct benefits to participants. Findings from this study, however, are
likely to be of interest to survey respondents and interviewees to the extent that they will
add to the existing body of knowledge about this network of Legal Information
Websites to which all of participants have contributed. When completing the survey,
participants will be given the researcher’s email address and encouraged to contact the
researcher for information about the results of the survey.

6. Confidentiality:
Survey: Unless if the respondent agrees to a follow-up interview, no personally
identifiable information will be collected through the survey. Survey data will be stored
in the researcher’s password-protected Qualtrics account. Any printed documents
containing survey data will be kept in a private residential office and will only be
accessible by the researcher. The data will be destroyed upon completion of all research
papers to be written in connection with this study.
Follow-Up Interviews: Interviews transcripts and audio recordings will be kept in a
private residential office and on a password protected computer. Any written
documentation will also be kept in the private office. Because it is important to know
the role that each respondent/interviewee played with respect to the Legal Information
Website, transcripts will not be de-identified but will only be accessible by the
researcher. The data will be destroyed upon completion of all research papers to be
written in connection with this study.
7. Consent Process:
Survey: Participants will be shown consent language (Appendix 5) prior to beginning
the survey and will be required to answer in the affirmative that they have read and
agree to the terms of the consent. If they do not agree, they will be taken out of the
survey. Participants may print a copy of the consent form for their records.
Follow-Up Interviews: Written informed consent (Appendix 6) will be obtained from
each interviewee. A consent form will be emailed in advance of our scheduled
interview and the interviewee will be requested to 1) return it via mail or 2) scan the
document and return it via email. All participants may keep a copy of the consent form
for their records.

APPENDIX D: IRB AMENDMENT APPLICATION

UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND COLLEGE PARK
Institutional Review Board
Amendment Application
To ensure an accurate and streamlined review of your Amendment Application, please
provide the following information:
1) State what is being proposed and where in the protocol and/or consent what was
changed.
As originally designed, the study focused on the practices, perceptions, and knowledge of
individuals involved in the development and implementation of statewide legal information
websites (the “Information Providers”). To build upon what I have learned through the
surveys and interviews, I am now proposing to evaluate a limited number of websites (4)
along several dimensions, including the use of plain language, the incorporation of multimedia elements, and the availability of court forms. Relevant information about the website
evaluations is provided below:
Recruitment of Evaluators – The evaluations will be conducted by Masters of Library Science
students in the College of Information Studies who are currently enrolled in the eGovernment specialization. There are 18 students in this specialization. Over the past six
months, these students have reviewed various government websites and therefore are wellequipped to undertake the proposed evaluation of statewide legal information websites. A
recruitment message will be sent to them via email (see Appendix 7).
Procedures: Evaluation participants will be asked to perform certain tasks on four (4)
websites and to fill out an evaluation worksheet in connection therewith. A draft of the
evaluation worksheet is appended as Appendix 8. It is anticipated that each evaluation
should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.
Risks: There are no known risks associated with participation in this study. Evaluation
participants will not be be identified by name in any article, report or presentation of data.
Benefits: There are no direct benefits to evaluation participants.
Confidentiality: The evaluation worksheets will be stored in the researcher’s password
protected computer. Any hard copies of the evaluation worksheets will be kept in a private
residential office and will only be accessible by the researcher. The data will be destroyed
upon completion of all research papers to be written in connection with this study.
Consent: Written informed consent (Appendix 9) will be obtained from each student who
agrees to conduct website evaluations. Before conducting the evaluations, evaluation

289

participants will be requested to 1) return the consent form via mail or 2) scan the document
and return it via email. All participants may keep a copy of the consent form for their
records.

2) Provide the rationale/justification for the change.
Based upon data collected from the Information Providers, I have been able to group
the statewide legal information websites into a select number of groups. By
evaluating websites from each of these groups along a select number of dimensions
(e.g., three or four “best practices” that have been identified in the literature and
through my data collection), I will be able to make some limited findings about the
extent to which these best practices have been incorporated into statewide legal
information websites.
3) State what impact the change has on risks to participants. Please state the number of
currently enrolled participants and if the changes will require re-consent. If the changes
will not require re-consent, please state why.
This amendment will have no impact on individuals who have participated in the
surveys and/or interviews. The data to be collected through the proposed
evaluations will serve as a supplement to the survey and interview data.
4) State whether the change has an impact on the scientific integrity of the study, (i.e.
decreases, increases, no impact).
No impact
5) List the documents included with the application that have been modified (consent
forms, flyers, data collection forms, surveys). State what has been changed in each
modified document.
Existing documents have not been modified. New documents include 1) the
recruitment message (Appendix 7), 2) the evaluation worksheet (Appendix 8), and 3)
the informed consent to be completed by evaluation participants (Appendix 9).
6) If adding a student and their project (in the domain of the currently approved
project), please request addition of their name to the Approval Letter.
