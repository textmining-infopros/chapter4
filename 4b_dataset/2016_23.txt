ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
The Research Paper in the Digital Age:
Educating Digitally Literate Students in the Academic Library Environment
by GOUN KIM

Dissertation Director:
Daniel O. O’Connor

The academic research paper as a mini-research article has had tremendous
benefits in teaching students how to prepare work in a model that met the standards of
scholars and the requirements for business. The research paper has long roots and an
established history going back over a century as a mechanism to summarize knowledge,
similar to the journal article that it emulated.
Today’s journal literature has a growing graphic and digital presence. Some
medical journals now exist solely in video format. It is possible that student work may
follow a similar trajectory. That research paper is now in the process of undergoing major
changes as the text-based world rapidly transforms into a digital landscape.
The primary goal of the proposed study is to map past and current practices with
likely futures moving from traditional research papers to digital products. This
exploratory study used an online survey and personal interviews in a study involving
three groups of individuals—professors, librarians, and teaching assistants—from four

ii

academic subject areas—humanities, social sciences, sciences, and professional schools.
The survey sample included 148 participants and the in-depth interview sample consisted
of 16 volunteers. The sample included professors who had published in peer-reviewed
video journals.
Analyses of responses have revealed that position, academic area, age, and
technology use of respondents are indicators of acceptance of new digital multimedia
formats and how these might define an educated person in today’s society. Models
include all cases followed by analyses of the sub-groups. This study used a mixture of
exploratory quantitative and qualitative data analyses to suggest hypotheses for later
investigations.
This project is significant because it looks at the changes to research papers in
academia and what it means to be an educated person in a multimedia digital
environment. Such an understanding would assist in educating library and information
professionals and in serving undergraduate students as the definition of an educated
person continues to evolve. It is hoped that ‘educated’ students will have a beneficial
impact on society through communication of knowledge as it progress toward a dynamic
multimedia digital environment.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

What Does It Mean to Be An Educated Person?
The former president of Harvard University, Derek Bok (2006), stated that many
students are now being graduated from college “without being able to write well enough
to satisfy their employers… reason clearly or perform competently in analyzing complex,
non-technical problems” (p. 8). The quality of undergraduate education in this country is
being scrutinized not only by educators, but also by policy makers, practitioners, the
public, and stakeholders in the higher education system who have increasingly come to
raise similar questions about the very meaning of being a college graduate (Arum &
Roksa, 2011). Two core issues emerge when these topics are addressed: competency in
the workplace, and competence in contributing to society as an educated individual.
Does the content of higher education stay parallel to the needs of society? In 2010,
Ali and Katz created two surveys to assess perceived assessments of students’
information and communication technology (ICT) literacy skills by human resources (HR)
consultants and business school faculty. The results of the study showed differing
expectations for students’ ICT literacy skills between these two groups. Ali and Katz
(2010) noted that “employers seek ICT-literate workers, yet business schools might not
be teaching these skills.” (p. 17). They also commented that “business school faculty
involvement is critical to any initiative for curricular change because faculty hold a key
position as a link among the various stakeholders: school administrators, employers, and
students. Faculty should work closely with library staff, who traditionally have been the
primary instructors of information literacy and ICT literacy skills, to develop course

2
activities and assignments that provide critical ICT literacy training.” (Ali & Katz, 2010,
p. 17). Other researchers also criticized business schools’ as not preparing their students
for the workplace (Abraham & Karns, 2009; Pfeffer & Fong, 2002; Syed, Mingers, &
Murray, 2010). According to Arum and Roksa (2011), “business leaders have begun to
ask whether graduates have acquired the necessary skills to ensure economic
competitiveness.” (p. 1).
Meanwhile, “… educators within the system itself have begun to raise their voices
questioning whether organizational changes to colleges and universities in recent decades
have undermined the core educational functions of these institutions” (Arum & Roksa,
2011, p. 1). Almost 80 years ago, Hutchins (1936b), who created a radically different
curricular model for The University of Chicago, stated that “learning at the college level
should have no vocational aim. It should provide a common stock of fundamental ideas.”
(p. 116). He said “one purpose of education is to draw out the elements of our common
human nature” (Hutchins, 1936b) where “wisdom and goodness are the aim of higher
education” (Hutchins, 1943). There are mixed reviews about “whether students are
actually developing the capacity for critical thinking and complex reasoning at college. In
a rapidly changing economy and society, there is widespread agreement that these
individual capacities are the foundation for effective democratic citizenship and
economic productivity.” (Arum & Roksa, 2011, pp. 1-2). In this regard, Bok (2006)
described that “with all the controversy over the college curriculum… it is impressive to
find faculty members agreeing almost unanimously that teaching students to think
critically is the principal aim of undergraduate education” (p. 109).

3
Then, what does it mean to be an educated person? What do professors require as
essential components of their courses to educate a person who will be considered
“educated”? Hodgson (2010) discussed this question and responded by asking “how the
value of being an educated person is currently understood, and further, how it might be
understood differently” (p. 109). Today, there might not be universal explanatory
definitions of what constitutes an educated person. Boyer (2009) stated that in order to
answer to this question, it should consider “not the curriculum, but the human condition.”
He suggested the curriculum might be organized on the basis of “core commonalities.”
He explained this by adding the importance of “universal experiences that make us
human, experiences shared by all cultures on the planet” (Boyer, 2009). The eight
commonalities that Boyer (2009) envisions are: 1) the life cycle, 2) language, 3) the arts,
4) time and space, 5) groups and institutions, 6) work, 7) natural world, and 8) search for
meaning. With these commonalities, Boyer (2009) finally concluded, “above all, being an
educated person means being guided by values and beliefs and connecting the lessons of
the classroom to the realities of life. … I realize that remarkable changes must occur for
this shift in goals to take place, but I hope deeply that in the century ahead students will
be judged not by their performance on a single test but by the quality of their lives. It is
my hope that students in the classrooms of tomorrow will be encouraged to create more
than conform, and to cooperate more than compete.”
There appears to be a tension between a notion of universal core commonalities
and the immediate needs of a society to have a competent workforce. Further reflection
of the time we live in would need to add the value of being an educated person in a
digital age. Bacow, Bowen, Guthrie, Lack, and Long (2012) reported that most colleges

4
and universities provide distance education via online courses to better serve students’
needs rather than to save on costs. They comment that “digital technology has already
changed the way colleges and universities function, but no matter how significant those
changes feel today, real transformation is just beginning. Every day, a new program in
online learning is announced, and on the horizon is the promise of using new adaptive
learning technologies … to educate more students than ever before at lower cost and with
similar or even better learning outcomes” (Bacow, Bowen, Guthrie, Lack, & Long, 2012,
p.2). As this digital age began to take root, the Association of College and Research
Libraries (2000) pointed out that information literacy is a key component of lifelong
learning and an important goal of higher education (p. 4):
Developing lifelong learners is central to the mission of higher education
institutions. By ensuring that individuals have the intellectual abilities of
reasoning and critical thinking, and by helping them construct a framework for
learning how to learn, colleges and universities provide the foundation for
continued growth throughout their careers, as well as in their roles as informed
citizens and members of communities. Information literacy is a key component of,
and contributor to, lifelong learning. Information literacy competency extends
learning beyond formal classroom settings and provides practice with selfdirected investigations as individuals move into internships, first professional
positions, and increasing responsibilities in all arenas of life. Because information
literacy augments students' competency with evaluating, managing, and using
information, it is now considered by several regional and discipline-based
accreditation associations as a key outcome for college students.

In a 2013 Ithaka S+R library survey of U.S. academic library directors the
statement receiving the highest agreement (97%) as very important to all types of
institutions was “helping undergraduates ‘develop research, critical analysis, and
information literacy skills’” (Long & Schonfeld, 2014, p. 14). It can be assumed that this

5
activity represents a core mission of US academic libraries. It was not stated how this
goal was assessed for its impact.
Again, perhaps there is no universal, explanatory definition of what constitutes an
educated person today. However, one point that merits consideration may be “the
connectedness of things” as Mark Van Doren (1943) wrote over 70 years ago, “the
connectedness of things is what the educator contemplates to the limit of his capacity” (p.
115). He concluded by saying that a “the student who can begin early in life to see things
as connected has begun the life of learning” (Van Dore, 1943, p. 115). Hutchins (1936a)
also stated that “the aim of education is to connect man with man, to connect the present
with the past, and to advance the thinking of the race.” (p. 131). Perhaps, it seems that
one of the answers of what does it mean to be an educated person is all about connections.

Statement of the Problem
It is interesting to consider how something so common as the research paper
emerged as a vehicle to communicate how students understood knowledge and how they
were able to contribute to it. It is even more fascinating to speculate if the research paper
can survive in a digital, multimedia era. In the area of student learning, there have been
three primary ways to represent students’ understanding of independent research. They
are test, research paper, and presentation. The academic research paper has been
perceived as a microcosm of journal articles and book chapters in order to benefit
students who prepare work in a model that met the standards of scholars. The research
paper has long roots and a history going back over a century, but now it is in the process

6
of undergoing major changes as the text-based world rapidly transforms into a digital
landscape as it is estimated that most of the world’s information is now digital.

New and emerging information and communication technologies are having a
profound impact on how students access, use, communicate, and share information. The
trend toward using digital information is affecting the way we live, learn, work, play, and
interact socially. In particular, videos and still photographs for scholarly communication
in science or medical journals are increasingly used as supplementary data to support
work that cannot be communicated by published text. Dissertations are now embedding
video making such work not reducible to text.

It is expected that college students’ research paper requirements may soon follow
such journal article examples because, in times past, research papers had been a student
simulation of journal articles or book chapters or corporate reports. Today’s journal
literature has a growing graphic and digital presence with text supplemented by web
based data and displays. A look at new journal articles being produced reveals two
interesting aspects: (1) science journals now go beyond text to present complex images,
charts, graphs, and data on supplementary web sites to show microscopic data, video, and
other media products; and, (2) there are now video journals in the medical area. These
represent a new and vibrant model for the research paper of the past as it evolves and
morphs into a digital, electronic, or multimedia form.

It was recognized some years ago that the research papers using multimedia
products can become the general or formal research term project of future colleges or
universities (Mitchell, 2005). In recent years, PowerPoint and equivalent presentation

7
mechanisms exist as outputs to represent students’ research processes. PowerPoint is
joined by such products as Keynote, Prezi, Haiku Deck, and SlideShare (Clarke, 2013). It
is also likely that the research paper served as a model for the corporate report which is
also undergoing change as PowerPoint and similar display mechanisms replace text based
papers.
This study aims to explore how and why professors, librarians, and teaching
assistants perceive and evaluate the research papers in any format over time. The primary
goal of the proposed study is to map past and current practices with likely futures moving
from traditional research papers to digital products. This is an exploratory study to
examine professors’, librarians’, and teaching assistants’ perception and evaluation in
changes to research papers according to the passing of time: 1) what their experience was
with research papers when they were undergraduate students; 2) what changes have
occurred in the past five years; 3) what their current practices are with research papers or
equivalent requirements; and, 4) what changes might be expected in the next five years.

Research Significance
This project is significant because it looks at the changes of research papers in
academia. This pointed to the products being produced by undergraduate students which
often included PowerPoint presentations or other digital presentation tools. Such efforts
are not microcosms of research reports (for example, journal articles) as research papers
had been. If the purpose of higher education is to prepare informed citizens then the new
research paper model may need to create meaningful summaries of scholarly work in a

8
digital environment similar to the multimedia science journals. Such an understanding
would assist in educating library and information professionals and in serving
undergraduate students. It may also address part of a larger issue identifying what it
means to be an educated person in our society.

Literature reviews have indicated that research papers emerged as summary
documents similar to journal articles. As noted above, many journals now incorporate
digital formats even to the point of requiring video presentations or documentation. It is
expected that research papers may be changing to emulate journal articles and this
knowledge would be of benefit to a larger academic community. Traditional research
papers may have their place in some disciplines but be less evident in other subject areas
(e.g., humanities vs science). This study employs a mixture of exploratory quantitative
and qualitative data analyses to suggest hypotheses for later investigations.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

Journals and Research Papers
History of Journals
Many early journals were involved in scientific societies and organizations
(Hessenbruch, 2000). According to Kronick (1961), the origin of scientific and technical
journals dates from 1665. He traced the history of journals from the French Journal des
sçavans and the English Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society when they first
published research results periodically in the 17th century. Hessenbruch (2000) stated that
“the journal evolved not only as a form of communication, but also as the centre of a
system of quality control based on what is now called peer review” (p. 390). Editorial and
refereeing practices have been gradually developed to provide appropriate and accurate
material to the readership (Hessenbruch, 2000). Hessenbruch (2000) described that “the
scientific journal was not born fully formed, but instead evolved from private and
informal literary communications, and only gradually acquired modern forms of editorial
and quality control” (p. 390). Although the peer-review system became common for
science funding allocations in the 20th century, the current peer-review already evolved
from the 18th century (Benos et al., 2007).
In the 18th century, over a thousand journals were published and since then the
number has increased by geometric progression (Kronick, 1976). However, many earlier
publishing efforts have since failed. Meanwhile, such established journals as Science and
Nature have survived and benefited from reliance on web-based documentation.

10
In the 19th century, many journals were published on a weekly basis. Among
them, Nature was the most successful weekly publication and became a prime model of
commercial journal publishing (Hessenbruch, 2000). It spans more than fourteen
decades—the first issue of the journal Nature was published in 4th November 1869
(Nature Publishing Group, 2014a). According to the 2012 Journal Citation Reports
Science Edition, Nature is the most highly cited science journal (Thomson Reuters, 2013).
It has been continuously published on a weekly basis and is one of the most prestigious
international and interdisciplinary journals in all fields of science and technology. Now
Nature has encouraged researchers to include multimedia services using the internet, a
Podcast, and video journal articles.
In the 20th century, scientific works continued to accelerate in number and variety
resulting in a marked growth of periodical publications. Journals are often considered
significant “as publishers of record, and as systems of quality control”; yet scientists have
also depended on immediate and informal communication (Hessenbruch, 2000, p. 390).
In the middle of the 1990s, the increased popularity of the Internet brought new media
platforms and opportunities to experiment in various interdisciplinary areas. Electronic
journals started to be accessed via electronic transmission. Defelice (2006) noted that
“scholarly electronic journals are different from print journals in form and access mode,
and vary far more than print journals. However, the role of the scholarly journal has not
changed with the form. User requirements for ease of access and reliability of content are
still important considerations.” In this connection, since the late 20th century, researchers
have become accustomed to accessing a large variety of electronic journals. Many
journals quickly evolved to be published in electronic format, usually on the Internet. The

11
electronic journals were, at first, 1) online versions of printed journals, but it was soon
realized that 2) value-added components could be embedded in the online product. Hot
links to other sources from the journal article and its references became an area of
attention as the online journal quickly evolved. That evolution now includes the
embedding of multimedia images and video within the article or appended to it.
With the growth of electronic journals, university libraries have rapidly moved
toward electronic journal collections (King, Tenopir, Montgomery, & Aerni, 2003). Over
several decades, the transition from print journals to electronic journal collections exerted
an effect on information seeking and reading patterns of faculty members, particularly
among science faculty (King, Tenopir, Montgomery, & Aerni, 2003; Tenopir, King,
Edwards, & Wu, 2009). The research showed that “the average number of readings per
year per science faculty member continues to increase, while the average time spent per
reading is decreasing” (Tenopir et al., 2009, p. 5). King et al. (2003) reported “scientists
appear to be more advanced in their use of electronic journals than other faculty, but
changes are taking place within all faculty disciplines.” Due to its convenience and time
savings, electronic journal use has greatly increased, especially when available in library
collection (King et. al., 2003). Patterns in the use of technologies by faculty are
undergoing small but gradual changes as documented by an Ithaka study of 5,261
respondents: "Small but non-trivial shares of respondents use technology in their
undergraduate teaching. But while most recognize the availability of resources to help
them do so, many respondents do not draw upon resources beyond their own ideas or feel
strongly motivated to seek out opportunities to use more technology in their teaching"
(Housewright, Schonfeld, & Wulfson, 2013, p. 6).

12
In the late 20th century, open access journals and repositories also offered “a
public place where scholars and researchers can make their work available at any point in
its development process” (Weinberger, 2011, p. 183). There has been an issue of
abundance of information. But, the matter of information overload problems might be
resolved by creating “more information: metadata” (Weinberger, 2011, p. 185).
Weinberger stated “providing metadata for what you post in the new public of the Net
enables it to be found more easily” (Weinberger, 2011, p. 185).
In this 21st century, many more journals now incorporate various digital formats
even to the point of requiring image or video components. In the new millennium, the
journal Nature started to provide the Nature Podcast service and produced internet video
pieces and other web innovations to accompany major papers. Nature Publishing Group
(2014b) stated that “The Nature video archive now features many scientists describing
their work in their own words, from the discovery of juvenile hominid remains, Pluto’s
moons, to the development of brain–machine interfaces for paraplegics.” Likewise,
science or medical journals are increasingly used as supplementary data to support work
that cannot be communicated by published text. This phenomenon reflects a new mode of
scholarly communication for academic work, and it is beginning to embody the dynamic
environment that might link the scholarly presentation at a conference to the academic
journal article providing more substantive evidence of research findings. Today’s
journals keep expanding their media landscape and, in particular, their work is
transformed to formats for digitally literate people in this digital age.

13
History of Research-Based Term Papers
The phrases ‘term paper’ and ‘research paper’ have often been used
interchangeably in colleges and universities. But, not all term papers involve academic
research and also not all research papers are term papers. According to Oxford English
Dictionary Online, a ‘term paper’ is “an essay or dissertation representative of the work
done during a single term.” Term papers are ordinarily intended to describe a concept or
topic, make observation or evaluation, analyze a perspective, organize ideas, or argue a
point. They are often due at the end of a term—semester or quarter. That is why it is
usually referred to as a term paper. At this point, research means “a systematic process of
investigating a topic and its context by strategically gathering data and analyzing them,
and then sharing findings and recommendations. Research can be considered as an
extension of problem-solving.” (Farmer & Stricevic, 2011, p. 8).
For this investigation, a research paper means a ‘research-based term paper’
which is a thesis driven original work on a particular subject. The reading materials may
come from several academic sources. We will assume that an academic journal article is
a prototype of the research term papers and that college research papers have been
perceived as microcosms of such things as journal articles, book chapters, dissertations,
or documented technical reports. Such work can be a tool for developing critical thinking
skills.
The idea of research papers can be traced to the 19th century. Prior to the 1870s,
there were few references to writing, but it appeared that composing was the copying of
the teacher’s or another expert’s writing (Burrows, 1977). Brereton (1995) wrote that
“classes were conducted by the recitation method, with students mastering a text for

14
homework and reciting it” (p. 3). Composing by itself was not seen as a necessity and not
taught directly, but it was mostly regarded as derivative for oral recitation (Moulton &
Holmes, 2003; Russell, 1991). However in 1876, the course of American education
changed following the German model which was more tightly focused on the creation of
new knowledge (Moulton & Holmes, 2003). German students conducted research based
on their studies and submitted written reports rather than focusing on oration,
memorization, or presenting recitations (Russell, 1991). Since then, following the
learning/ research/ writing model of the Germans, a research-based term paper came to
America. During the thirty years from 1870 to 1900, American education was
reconstructed as “writing became the method of discourse and research the hallmark of
learning” (Moulton & Homes, 2003, p. 365). Finally by 1910, the research term paper
developed its familiar form (Russell, 1991). A problem of plagiarism and the sale of the
research term paper also emerged (Russell, 1991), but as the end-of-term-assessment, the
research term papers became a preferred and frequently used method in higher education.
In scientific and technical areas there was an equal emphasis for students in laboratory
classes to produce reports based on their experiments.
In the new millennium, research term papers increasingly ask for digital literacy
skills in today’s students (Whitley-Grassi & Hoefler, 2012). In this study, a ‘digital
research paper’ is defined as a product that goes beyond traditional text or text with
graphic images on paper to include new digital formats such as video, sound, and other
digital presentation methods available through websites or embedded in presentation
tools such as PowerPoint.

15
Video Journals in the Digital Age
The advent of digital technology brought about changes in the way people learn,
present, and share knowledge. In particular, videos have opened up new possibilities
regarding knowledge sharing on the Web. This may be due to the immediacy of visual
information as a notably efficient method of communicating knowledge. It is dominant
when the perceptual power of the image appears together with the written or oral forms
of language (Barry, 1997), since “the part of the brain devoted to processing and
analyzing input from the eyes is larger than the parts devoted to processing the input from
any other sense” (Pasquali, 2007, p. 712). Reading text does involve the visual senses but
multimedia may also include aural senses. Examining bacteria moving on a microscopic
slide may inform the observer with more information than a still image or reading text
about such motion. Due to such fundamental attributes of visual information, using video
for communicating information can give benefits beyond those offered by reading text.
Pasquali (2007) described the possible advantages when scientists use new
technologies, especially video to communicate scientific methods, protocols, and results
instead of traditional verbal descriptions. The use of video can highlight aspects of
science as it produces an exact replication of the evidence used to support a research
decision. It transmits the diverse details of a new protocol or explains complex technical
laboratory work with the honesty and integrity of the author (Pasquali, 2007). The
reliability of the video recording makes scholarly knowledge communication a more
accurate and powerful way to convey a finding, especially in the sciences and technology.
It is expected that this is also extendable to the social sciences and humanities to present
its evidence at a primary level.

16
There is an expanding literature that videos are efficiently used by academics for
teaching and learning (Bryan & Recesso, 2006; Friel & Carboni, 2000; Hattie, 2009;
Picci, Calvani & Bonaiuti, 2012; Rich & Hannafin, 2009; Santagata & Guarino, 2010;
Seago, 2004; Sherin, 2004; So, Pow & Hung, 2009; Ullrich, Shen, Tong & Tan, 2010).
Nonetheless, video also improves scholarly communication as noted earlier with videos
increasingly including supplementary data to support work that cannot be communicated
by nor rely solely on published text (Kousha, Thewall, & Abdoli, 2012). Indeed, even in
the early twentieth century during the technological development of film, scientists and
anthropologists began using ‘moving images’ to record their work and added an
important component to data collection with this methodology (Mead, 1963; Pasquali,
2007).
Journals such as Nature, the Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE), and the
Video Journal and Encyclopedia of GI Endoscopy now go beyond text to present
complex research processes with videos and publish them on their public websites. As
noted, the journal Nature publishes submissions through its online site while open access
journals have adopted similar practices and grown expeditiously in stature and
importance (Weinberger, 2011).
JoVE was found to be the first video-based scientific journal as continues to grow
as a prestigious journal in science. JoVE is “a peer reviewed, PubMed indexed journal
devoted to the publication of biological, medical, chemical and physical research in a
video format” and its mission is “to increase the productivity of scientific research”
(JoVE, 2013). It states that the “written word and static picture-based traditional print
journals are no longer sufficient to accurately transmit the intricacies of modern research,”

17
and JoVE asks that each published manuscript be accompanied by a video film recorded
in the author’s own laboratory (JoVE, 2013). The video film can be produced by the
author or by JoVE’s professional team of science and video editors. Such frontier video
journals that allow for the direct visualization of various experiments, overcome “the
inherent limitations of traditional, static print journals thereby adding an entirely new
parameter to the communication of experimental data and research results” (JoVE, 2013).
Video Journal and Encyclopedia of GI Endoscopy, published by Elsevier, is a
peer-reviewed and open access video journal available both online and with mobile
devices (Video Journal and Encyclopedia of GI Endoscopy, 2016a). The first volume of
the journal was started in 2013 and two volumes have been completed since then. The
unique format of this journal provides two elements: 1) an expert video encyclopedia, and
2) a scientific video journal. The aims of scope of the Video Journal and Encyclopedia of
GI Endoscopy describes:
Modern endoscopic imaging offers a plethora of detailed visual information and
[sic] endoscopic procedures are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex.
Therefore endoscopists need a new appropriate tool for visual transmission of
proceedings in endoscopy. The innovative Video Journal and Encyclopedia of GI
Endoscopy takes these developments into account and aims to be the premium
and first choice international reference for endoscopic findings and procedures.
The focus on high-quality video demonstrations of endoscopic findings and
procedures offers a completely new way of presenting the work of GI experts and
allows for easy comprehension of information. (Video Journal and Encyclopedia
of GI Endoscopy, 2016a)

The editorial board of this video journal is international: USA, UK, France,
Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Poland, Norway, Japan, Australia,

18
Portugal, and Chile. Some of the complete expert encyclopedia and selected videos from
this video journal are also available on YouTube channel.
Indeed, video journal articles by Nature, JoVE, or the Video Journal and
Encyclopedia of GI Endoscopy have been increasing in use by science or medical
researchers. Recent examples of video journal articles are films of a study of video game
training for enhancing cognitive control in older adults as reported by Nature (Anguera et
al., 2013), initiating differentiation in immortalized multipotent otic progenitor cells by
JoVE (Azadeh et al., 2016), and pancreatic necrosectomy through a novel double-flange
lumen-apposing covered metal stent (video) by the Video Journal and Encyclopedia of
GI Endoscopy (Sanchez-Yague, A., 2014).
Yet in order to view most Nature and JoVE articles, a subscription is required
similar to gaining access to many academic journals. However, the Video Journal and
Encyclopedia of GI Endoscopy is an open access journal that is “immediately and
permanently free for everyone to read, download, copy and distribute.” Although there
are “no subscription charges, a fee is payable by the author or research funder to cover
the costs associated with publication” (Video Journal and Encyclopedia of GI Endoscopy,
2016b). Authors of the video journal articles will hold their copyright with scholarly
usage rights, and the publisher Elsevier is granted the rights of publishing and distribution
of the video journal (Video Journal and Encyclopedia of GI Endoscopy, 2016b). Rapid
knowledge transfer through video technology can increase dissemination of research
results while improving the productivity of researchers. This can benefit both the research
community and the general public since videos can capture and transmit the complexity

19
of life science research and it may also lift the laboratory time sink which consumes
significant time.

The PowerPoint Presentation
There is a Chinese proverb, “tell me and I’ll forget; show me and I may remember;
involve me and I’ll understand.” Nowadays, PowerPoint has been used as one of the main
methods to present students’ understanding of independent research. Further, the use of
PowerPoint is so widespread not only in higher education but also in business
presentations. It is regarded as an effective presentation technique for telling, showing,
involving people with a presented topic. The PowerPoint presentation has been used not
only for presenting research works but also for communicating effectively with audiences
with visual aids. Collins (2004) described the PowerPoint presentation as “techniques to
encourage audience participation include questioning, brainstorming, small-group
activities, role-playing, case-based examples, and directed listening. It is first necessary
to motivate and gain attention of the learner for learning to take place.” (p. 1185). Even in
2001, Parker stated that to “appear at a meeting without PowerPoint would be unwelcome
and vaguely pretentious, like wearing no shoes” (p. 2).
Given the widespread adoption of PowerPoint and its effectiveness, there are also
conflicting accounts about the effectiveness of PowerPoint on student performance in
higher education although these are the smaller number of authoritative studies. Rankin
and Hoaas (2001) reported that there is no significant benefit of PowerPoint presentations
on student grades. It indicated that teaching with PowerPoint did not lead to significantly

20
better student performance than by teaching with more conventional methods. Contrary
to this, Lowry (1999) reported that classes with PowerPoint lecturing “achieved better
grades than the traditional-lecture cohort […] and students exposed to PowerPoint
lecturing had a positive attitude towards the method” (pp. 20-21).
From a different standpoint, Szabo and Hastings (2000) found that over 90% of
students said that PowerPoint “is more attention capturing than the traditional method of
lecturing,” and 85% found that “PowerPoint lectures are more interesting than traditional
lectures” (p. 179). But, this early study did not show that better academic performance
accompanied students’ preference for PowerPoint lectures. At least in some
circumstances, PowerPoint lectures have entertainment features that may enhance student
preferences but might not prove to provide additional educational benefits over more
traditional lecturing methods.
Using research that is now dated, Bartsch and Cobern (2003) provided a review of
the empirical evidence (p. 78) underlying the effectiveness of PowerPoint and computer
presentation:
Overall research indicates that students prefer PowerPoint type presentations from
transparencies (Cassady, 1998; Perry & Perry, 1998; Susskind & Gurien, 1999;
West, 1997). Unfortunately, information on whether computer presentations
improve student performance is much less clear. Several studies point to the idea
that graphics improve student recall (ChanLin, 1998; 2000; Lowry, 1999; Szabo
& Hastings, 2000, Exp. 2). However, many courses that adopted multimedia
presentations have not shown a corresponding increase in student performance
(Stoloff, 1995; Susskind & Gurien, 1999; Szabo & Hastings, 2000. Exp.1 and 3;
West, 1997). In fact, one study demonstrated a decrease in student performance
when the instructor switched from transparencies to PowerPoint (Bartlett, Cheng,
& Strong, 2000).

21
However, these older studies may not be generalized to the challenges now
confronting digitally literate students today. Although PowerPoint has a debatable
reputation with limited empirical evidence on whether or not it is effective in enhancing
students’ learning, Craig and Amernic (2006) argued that “PowerPoint should be
recognized as a new communication medium that is fundamentally changing the nature
and dynamic of how we teach.” (p. 156). Furthermore “a major challenge facing
educators will be to convert the generally positive disposition of students to PowerPoint
into significantly better learning and performance” (Craig & Amernic, 2006, p. 151).
But beyond all descriptions about PowerPoint’s effectiveness, it is important to
note that contemporary college classrooms have continued to offer new media for
instructional technology use (Parker, Bianchi, & Cheah, 2008). For instance, PowerPoint
or Prezi are presented rather than overhead transparencies, and whiteboards or smart
boards are used instead of chalkboards, and, moreover, electronic communications via
emails, virtual online chats, WebCT or Blackboard have become common for teaching
and learning. But here what is most important to recognize is that this represents a fluid
and changing environment for the use of instructional technology in higher education
institutions. Thus, the mediums of instructional technologies as well as their conveyance
of the contents of the academic curriculum merit special attention when examining
experiences and preferences of professors, librarians, and teaching assistants in this
digital age.

22
Multimedia Digital Research Papers in the Digital Age
In the academic library environment, students learn multiple ways to
communicate to others through their research papers. Yet, producing multimedia digital
research papers might better and more fully convey what words alone might accomplish.
Several researchers have already noted that the form of the research term papers will get
replaced by digital, electronic, or multimedia forms in the digital age (Mitchell, 2005;
Olinzock & Okojie, 2006). In other words, research term papers using multimedia
products can become the general or formal research term paper of future college or
university students (Mitchell, 2005).
In recent years there has been a noticeable shift from the use of a paper-based
portfolio to an electronic portfolio (also known as ePortfolio) in educational and
professional learning contexts (Avraamidou & Zembal-Saul, 2006; van Wesel & Prop
2008a; 2008b). Portfolio-based learning has been increasingly implemented for
monitoring students’ professional development worldwide—especially in medical
education and related health fields (Challis, 1999; Prop, Shacklady, Dornan, & Driessen,
2007; van Wesel & Prop, 2008b). The term ‘portfolio’ is used as a collection of students’
work and achievements during their academic career (Challis, 1999; Chen, Yu, & Chang,
2007). Most paper-based portfolios are produced in a word-processing application with
original attachments in printed format, but an electronic portfolio is a website portfolio
with attachments in digital format; it is also called a Web-based portfolio (van Wesel &
Prop, 2008a).
An electronic portfolio provides many advantages to its paper-based counterpart
(van Wesel & Prop, 2008a; 2008b). Benefits include hyperlinking navigation, increasing

23
portability and remote access, a fun aspect with images possible, increasing ICT
competences, more compact format, adding multimedia, and the ease of sharing and
maintaining multiple versions (van Wesel & Prop, 2008a). An electronic portfolio also
brings “better educational outcomes afforded by the ability to annotate and contextualize
items in the portfolio” (Lambert & Corrin, 2006, p. 441). In particular, the study of van
Wesel and Prop (2008b) showed the positive effect on students’ learning outcomes. The
result was “the average grade of the students working with an electronic portfolio
(n=153), based on the six block assessments, is significantly higher than those of the
students working with a paper-based portfolio (n=177)” (van Wesel & Prop, 2008b). It
“suggests a deeper level of reflection among the students using an e-portfolio” (van
Wesel & Prop, 2008b). The ePortfolio has been developed over the same period of time
as student learning outcomes needed a repository to demonstrate evidence of academic
accomplishment and knowledge.
Dissertations in electronic formats have also emerged as valuable places which
can embed motion pictures of biological slides, surgical procedures, engineering
technologies, and even dance and drama. Such additions could not have been included in
print formats. As noted earlier, an electronic dissertation that included video files was
published by Giraldo in a December 2010 doctoral thesis in plant pathology. This work
included nine video files in her doctoral dissertation. Fosberg (2011) stated that “because
her research has global impact on agriculture and hunger, Giraldo’s dissertation includes
video files that let the reader view images of fluorescent proteins and the infection
mechanisms. The images might make it possible for researchers who would not otherwise
have the means to view and understand the development of the disease. In addition to the

24
content videos, the dissertation also has an eight-minute video of the techniques Giraldo
used to inoculate rice plants and prepare the diseased tissue for imaging.” Her work
already has been published in several refereed journals as well as being presented at
national and international meetings (Fosberg, 2011). This electronic dissertation earned
Kansas State plant pathologist an elite award from the Networked Digital Library of
Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) in 2011. NDLTD have actively encouraged and
promoted publishing electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) in order to enhance the
sharing knowledge worldwide.
Lastly, Beryle (1998) reported that Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences
theory provides “implications for planning new curricular, especially for children with
dyslexia” and the theory “allows an open-ended approach to assessing dyslexic children’s
intelligence” (p. 34). With this understanding of multiple intelligences, higher education
students with dyslexia who are intelligent but have difficulties in learning to read also can
be helped by multimedia digital research papers. It can be noted that universities and
academic libraries can now serve those with dyslexia by providing them with multimedia
alternatives. This includes moving print to audio files.

Academic Libraries and Information Literacy (IL)
History of Academic Library Instruction
From the 17th to 19th Centuries, German library literature records various
examples of library instruction (Lorenzen, 2001). In 1880, during his third year as

25
Harvard University librarian, Justin Winsor (1880) stated that libraries have been the
center of the university and the natural location to teach classes. Observing a new interest
in academic ‘libraries as educational agencies,’ Winsor (1880) proclaimed that the
college library had embarked on a ‘new career.’ His contribution in the profession of
librarianship includes library use instruction as it related to the broader, higher
educational goals during the past century. In the Winsor model, user instruction may have
been merely one response to changing circumstances, but he still embraced library use
instruction as the symbol of the arrival of a new age. The new ideals of graduate research,
disciplinary specialization, and scholarly production were accompanied by another
development that had profound implications for how books and libraries would be used.
That is the advent of seminar instruction.
In 1886, Melvil Dewey (1886) stated that “professor after professor sends his
classes, or goes with them to the library and teaches them to investigate for themselves
and to use books, getting beyond the method of the primary school with its parrot-like
recitations from a single text.” The librarians who along with professors had been caught
up in the swirling change and growth that marked that age continued to seek concepts for
the academic library that would help them earn a place in the academic community.
Winsor (1880) proclaimed the library’s new career as the instruction of students in the
use of the library. After the turn of the century, higher education solidified the gains it
had made in the previous century and these had an impact on the how the role of the
library intersected with the roles of faculty and students. From 1875 to 1917, Arthur E.
Bestor, Jr. (1953) described the period as a time of transformation in American
scholarship. It is the ideals of research, technical training, and liberal education in all of

26
their diversity became fully operative, achieving professional, intellectual, and
bureaucratic stability (Bestor, Jr., 1953).
Given the history of its growth and development, academic libraries have gone
through a paradigm shift from functionally as information repositories to learning
enterprises (Bennett, 2009; Lewis, 2007; Oakleaf, 2010). Oakleaf (2010, p. 37) stated that
“in the new paradigm, academic librarians articulate student learning outcomes” through
the teaching and learning activities of their institutions. Academic librarians emphasize
student learning outcomes not only as service providers, but also as educators (Bennett,
2009; Bundy, 2004). The Institute of Museum and Library Services (2000) defined
outcomes as the “benefits or changes for individuals or populations during or after
participating in program activities, including new knowledge, increased skills, changed
attitudes or values, modified behavior, improved condition, or altered status” (p.20). In
the distinctive roles of academic librarians, they have been actively participating in both
the planning and implementation of student learning outcomes as information specialist,
teacher, and instructional consultant.
In the last quarter of the 20th century, teaching librarians became increasingly
common. Several researchers reviewed in detail the scholarly literature on bibliographic
instruction in academic libraries (Hardesty, Schmitt & Tucker, 1986; Kirt, 1975; Tucker,
1980; Oakleaf, 2010). By 1974, the term information literacy was coined by Paul
Zurkowski to describe the “techniques and skills” known by the information literate “for
utilizing the wide range of information tools as well as primary sources in molding
information solutions to their problems.” The term reflected essential technological
changes and the impact on modern life, but it took several decades to come into general

27
use in the library community. In 1989, Tuckett addressed the issues facing academic
librarians who need to teach information literacy with computers. It connected
information literacy directly to computer technologies. Tuckett (1989) believed that
academic librarians need to teach both finding and evaluating information using
computers, so both information literacy and computer training needed to be jointly
addressed in academic institutions. Today’s academic libraries put emphasis on
information literacy along with information communication and technology (ICT). Also
used is the term digital literacy when librarians provide students with library instruction.
Definition of Information Literacy
According to the Oxford Dictionaries Online, ‘literacy’ means “the ability to read
and write.” The various definitions of literacy such as “the ability to read and write,” now
include the basis of how people learn. The North Central Regional Educational
Laboratory and the Meteiri Group (2003) reported that traditional or basic literacy is still
necessary for literacy in the digital age. Yet, the past decade has found that rapid growth
of Internet usage with technologies advances have altered the new generation’s definition
of learning and literacy. Before discussing the definition of information literacy, it might
be instructive to address what is meant by learning and literacy.
What is learning? Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett, and Norman (2010)
summarized and defined learning from Mayer’s (2002) article. They defined “learning as
a process that leads to change, which occurs as a result of experience and increases the
potential for improved performance and future learning” (Ambrose, et al, 2002, p. 3).
Three critical components to this definition are: 1) “learning is a process, not a product”,
2) “learning involves change in knowledge, beliefs, behaviors, or attitudes”, and 3)

28
“learning is not something done to students, but rather something students themselves do”
(Ambrose, et al, 2002, p. 3). Today’s definition of information literacy would need to
reflect on how learning works and how people learn in the digital age.
Then again, what is literacy? Beyond the ability to read and write, UNESCO
(2004) defined literacy as “the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create,
communicate, compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying
context. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve
their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their
community and wider society.” (p. 13). The term ‘literacy’ has changed its type and
meaning over time as values in society transform.
The development of the original idea of ‘information literacy’ can find its roots in
the 19th century that emerged relatively early in the minds of librarians who framed
library user instruction (Adler, 1897; Dewey, 1891; Green, 1876; Mathews, 1877;
Perkins, 1876; Robinson, 1880; Winsor, 1880; Winsor, 1884). The term and the concept
of information literacy gained popularity in the 1990s and have been actively promoted
by the academic library community.
The most frequently used definition of information literacy comes from the
American Library Association (ALA)’s first national report on this issued in 1989. ALA
reported that information literacy is a set of abilities requiring individuals to “recognize
when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively
the needed information” (ALA, 1989). ALA’s definition became the basis for later
approaches to information literacy (ALA, 2000; Bawden, 2008). Beyond this definition

29
of information literacy, ALA (2000) also posed new challenges for the medium of
information literacy in the digital environment. It stated that (p. 2):
Information literacy also is increasingly important in the contemporary
environment of rapid technological change and proliferating information
resources. … In addition, information is available through multiple media,
including graphical, aural, and textual, and these pose new challenges for
individuals in evaluating and understanding it.

Under this definition, the sources of information include graphical, aural, and textual
elements. It addresses new challenges for the issues of new additional skills that are used
and presented during and after the research process.
The primary goal of information literacy is to facilitate people to become lifelong
learners as information literate individuals (Warmkessel & McCade, 1997). In particular,
ALA (2000) described an information literate individual as able to (pp. 2-3):

access the needed information effectively and efficiently
evaluate information and its sources critically

information, and access and use information ethically and legally
Information literacy is commonly used in all academic disciplines, in all learning

environments, and in all levels of education as the basis for lifelong learning (ALA,
2000). As a self-directed learner, information literate individuals are able to master
content and expand the implications of research. This latter point might distinguish print
literacy from media literacy but it does address the fluency of communication in a digital
environment.

30
In addition, for academic librarians, the main focus of student learning outcomes
is information literacy (Oakleaf, 2010; 2011). Kuhlthau, Maniotes, and Caspari (2007)
described this process: “information literacy forms the basis of how people learn in the
information environment of the 21st century. By combining the underlying concepts of
information literacy with major subject area curriculum standards, guided inquiry
prepares students for living and working in the technological information society.” (p. 91).
The American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the Association for
Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) published information literacy
standards for student learning. They defined information literacy in three standards with
indicators of students who have achieved them. The three standards illustrated that the
student who is information literate (AASL and AECT, 1998, pp. 1-3):
x
x
x

accesses information efficiently and effectively;
evaluates information critically and competently;
uses information accurately and creatively.

AASL and AECT’s (1998) standards for student learning included and emphasized
requirements for posing a question, identifying relevant sources, locating, evaluating, and
synthesizing or using information in a product.
In recent years, a number of new literacy terminologies and skills have emerged.
But still, information literacy is related to the various other “literacies of information,”
such as computer literacy, media literacy, digital literacy, e-literacy, visual literacy,
network literacy, or information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. For
instance, higher education institutions have started to identify ICT literacy “as a core
competency (as opposed to ‘information literacy’ or ‘technology literacy’)” (Tyler, 2005,

31
p.3). It might be summarized that Katz proposes that ICT literacy evolves into
information literacy in digital environments (Katz, 2005; Katz, 2007a; 2007b, Katz &
Macklin, 2007; Katz, et al. 2004). Katz (2005) stated “the most pedagogically effective
definition of ICT literacy combines both information literacy and technical competence”
(p. 3):
ICT literacy is the ability to appropriately use digital technology, communication
tools, and/or networks to solve information problems in order to function in an
information society. This includes having the ability to use technology as a tool to
research, organize, and communicate information and having a fundamental
understanding of the ethical / legal issues surrounding accessing and using
information (The National Higher Education Information and Communication
Technology Initiative, 2004).

A library perspective on ICT literacy in the 21st century begins with a view of
information literacy’s core component as “the ability to know when information is
needed, locate it efficiently, evaluate its quality, and use it to build and communicate new
knowledge,” which is based on ALA (2000)’s definition (Scharf, 2013, p. 3). Some
additional learning outcomes—such as critical thinking and research skills—are also
needed with student information literacy skills for general academic skills (Oakleaf, 2010;
2011).

Digital Learners in the Digital Age
The term and concept of “digital natives” was first coined by Prensky (2001) to
classify individuals born in or after 1980. Prensky (2001) described digital natives as
those who have grown up with and surrounded by digital technologies, such as computers,

32
cell phones, videogames, digital music players, and all the other digital devices as these
became integral parts of their lives. According to Prensky (2001), digital natives are used
to adopting new skills with digital technologies easily and radically, and they learn
differently from previous generations, so-called digital immigrants.
However, other researchers have argued against the early description of digital
natives due to the lack of empirical evidence to support such claims for these individuals
(Bennett, Maton, & Kervin, 2008; Brown & Czerniewicz, 2010; Helsper & Eynon, 2010;
Kennedy, Judd, Churchward, Gray, & Krause, 2008; Margaryan, Littlejohn, & Vojt, 2011;
Maton & Bennett, 2010; Ng, 2012; Nasah, DaCosta, Kinsell, & Seok, 2010). The
researchers argued and suggested that it may be more a matter of information or digital
literacy rather than a generational trait. Ng (2012) summarized the main points of the
arguments with this analysis (p. 1065):
x

x
x

the generation factor where those born in and after 1980 are digital natives. The
researchers argued that it is not the age that should be considered in describing the
youths of today but other more important factors such as the availability of
technology and breadth of use, prior experience, self-efficacy and education.
the availability of technology to digital natives and their ubiquitous usage. The
researchers argued that the use of technology by young people is different in
education in that most lack the skills and strategies to use them for learning.
the rhetoric that because young people have grown up in a world surrounded by
technology, their brains develop differently to the adults of previous generations.
The researchers argued that there is no empirical evidence to suggest that the
brain structure is different between adults and those who use the Internet and
other technologies frequently.
Today’s students are entering colleges and universities with a variety of

experiences involving the Internet and other digital technology. Among undergraduate
students, social media platforms, such as Wikipedia, social networking sites (e.g.,
Facebook), user reviews (e.g., reviews in Amazon.com), video sharing sites (e.g.,

33
YouTube), social Q&A sites (e.g., Yahoo!Answers), blogs, and microblogs (e.g., Twitter),
can serve as useful, important information sources for everyday-life information seeking
(Kim, Sin, Yoo-Lee, 2014; Sin & Kim, 2014).
However, research has indicated that without formal instruction, college students
struggle to evaluate critically the information they searched for in their research projects
and assignments (Graham and Metaxas, 2003). The students often lack the information
and communication technology (ICT) literacy skills necessary to apply those skills in the
context of information technology—locating, evaluating, and communicating information
and this is exacerbated with the overabundance of information available today (Katz,
2005; Katz, 2007a; 2007b; Katz & Macklin, 2007; Tyler, 2005). Margaryan, Littlejohn,
and Vojt (2011) also claimed that university students have a limited understanding of
how digital technologies can support their learning. Furthermore, lecturers’ approaches to
teaching are influenced by students’ expectations of learning with digital technologies
(Margaryan, Littlejohn, and Vojt, 2011). In addition, Ng’s (2012) investigation showed
that the undergraduates’ perceptions of their own digital literacy “improved through the
explicit teaching and learning in the course about new educational technologies and their
integration into their learning” (p. 1077). These studies indicate that students will need to
be guided by instructors in order to improve their information or digital literacy skills in
an educational environment.
Then, who is a digitally literate individual? Ng (2012) stated that “a digitally
literate individual should be able to adapt to new and emerging technologies quickly and
pick up easily new semiotic language for communication as they arise. The more digitally
literate the individual, the easier it is for him/her to adapt, that is switch to the ‘new

34
literacies’ mode” (p. 1066). According to the American Library Association (ALA)’s
(2013b) digital literacy task force which is led by the ALA Office for Information
Technology Policy (OITP), a digitally literate person (p. 2):
x
x
x
x
x

possesses the variety of skills—cognitive and technical—required to find,
understand, evaluate, create, and communicate digital information in a wide
variety of formats;
is able to use diverse technologies appropriately and effectively to search for and
retrieve information, interpret search results, and judge the quality of the
information retrieved;
understands the relationships among technology, lifelong learning, personal
privacy, and appropriate stewardship of information;
uses these skills and the appropriate technologies to communicate and collaborate
with peers, colleagues, family, and on occasion the general public;
uses these skills to participate actively in civic society and contribute to a vibrant,
informed, and engaged community.
Yet, not all digital learners in the digital age can be declared as digitally literate.

Even digital natives can be taught digital literacy (Ng, 2012). Academic libraries educate
digitally literate students to improve their learning through the relevant library
instructions.

Role of Academic Libraries in the Digital Age
Two major goals of all types of libraries are promoting users’ literacy
development and fostering lifelong reading habits (Farmer & Ivanka, 2011). These
library missions still continue, although the idea of literacy has been changed as time
goes by and it encompasses a wider range of skills, competences, or attitudes (Lankshear
& Knobel, 2008). The concepts of literacy are often closely related with the way of
learning to read and write within certain time periods (Leu, et al., 2007) and it is also

35
closely connected with librarians’ roles for student learning in an academic library
environment. In the future, significant changes may be necessary in the roles libraries
will incur in higher education; moreover, academic librarians will need to define their
role in an expanding arena involving different literacy competencies. The librarians will
need to work with a variety of academic partners to address the improvement of student
learning and the refinement of information literacy.
Today’s undergraduate students are generally able to use unfamiliar technologies
in their learning; furthermore, they are able to learn and use educational technologies in a
meaningful way with the guidance of an instructor (Ng, 2012). Hence, even today’s
digitally literate students also need to be guided (Ng 2012). Academic librarians can play
a pivotal role in mentoring for this. At this juncture, academic librarians require having
knowledge of the various digital technology tools that are beneficial for their own
teaching and for their students’ learning.
Furthermore, the value of collaboration between librarians and faculty in higher
education is especially emphasized in the digital age. In library and information science
literature, numerous researchers have advanced that information literacy is more effective
and stronger through working relationships between librarians and faculty (Arp, Woodard,
Linstrom, & Shonrock, 2006; Black, Crest, & Volland, 2001; Cunningham, & Lanning,
2002; Farber, 1999; Raspa & Dane, 2000). This is a key component to students’
perceptions of information literacy as an important aspect of their education and their
success both in and out of the classroom. According to Breivik (2005), the most practical
strategy to increase library use is that faculty “create assignments that require thoughtful
use of library sources and services” (p. 25). Clearly, both librarians and faculty will be

36
required to have more breadth and depth of knowledge and skills across the dimensions
of information literacy and other technologies in higher education. Their effective and
successful collaboration in working together will be able to lead to students’ success in
university studies and ultimately guide their lifelong learning in the digital age. Online
education is ripe for a rapid development of information technologies that enhance
learning through multimedia with a result that digital literacies can transform quickly in
this digital age.
Lastly, in order to instruct students to employ better information-related practices
and build better partnerships with faculty members, academic librarians “may need to
learn more about how real researchers do research” (Foster, 2014, p. 3). Foster (2014)
argued that “the better we understand the practices of people who exemplify information
literacy, the better we can help students to succeed in their research and be more critical
and effective in their information practices” (p. 4). Learning more about how researchers
really work will be one of the best ways to assist both students and faculty members with
research-related practices. This may also improve the foundational knowledge of
librarians who instruct faculty and students in a complex information world.

37
Theoretical Model and Research Questions
Proposed Model for Digital Scholarly Information

Figure 2-1. A Model for Digital Scholarly Information

Research Questions and Hypotheses
The overall problem area for this investigation deals with changes that may occur
in the evolution of what it means to be an educated person. It is assumed that the creation
of a competent research paper provides evidence of an educated person. It is further
assumed that the definition and format of the research paper are undergoing dynamic
changes in the emerging world of multimedia production. An important purpose here is to

38
assess if bridges exist in the understanding of research paper changes as they are linked to
past and future literacies which, in turn, redefine the meaning of an educated person.
Below are propositions that might be applied to this problem area.
RQ1. How are current knowledge and practices of educators (professors, librarians, and
teaching assistants) affected by use of multimedia digital publications (MDP)?
x

H1a. Relatively younger educators will have more use of MDP compared to older
educators.

x

H1b. Educators in the science areas will have more use of MDP than those in the
areas of humanities, social science, or professional schools.

x

H1c. Educators who have higher self-perception of their technology abilities will
have more use of MDP than those who have lower self-perception of technology
abilities.

x

H1d. Educators who are more familiar with MDP will have more use of MDP
than those who are less familiar with MDP.

x

H1e. Educators who use more digital presentation tools (DPT) will have more use
of MDP than those who use fewer DPT.

x

H1f. Educators who use digital instruction methods will have more use of MDP
than those who use traditional instruction methods.

RQ2. Are there differences among professors who themselves publish using multimedia
digital publication (MDP) formats compared to professors whose publications are in
more traditional text formats?

39
x

H2a. Relatively younger professors will publish more in journals using MDP
format than older professors.

x

H2b. Professors in the science areas will publish more in journals using MDP
format than those in the areas of humanities, social science, or professional
schools.

x

H2c. Professors who use MDP will publish more in journals using MDP format
than those with low uses of MDP.

x

H2d. Professors who use MDP will publish more in journals using MDP format
than those with low uses of MDP.

x

H2e. Professors who had one or more articles published in journals using MDP
formats will be more likely to give assignments to students using MDP formats.

RQ3. How do professors evaluate components in each of the two formats (print and
digital formats) over time?
x

H3a. Professors’ evaluation gap of ‘content and references’ in each of the two
formats will decrease over time.

x

H3b. Professors’ evaluation gap of ‘visual aids’ in each of the two formats will
decrease over time.

x

H3c. Science area professors’ evaluation gap of ‘visual aids’ in each of the two
formats will be lower than professors in humanities, social sciences, or
professional schools.

40
RQ4. How do educators (professors, librarians, and teaching assistants) define an
‘educated person’ in the digital age?
x

H4a. There will be common keywords to define an educated person.

x

H4b. There will be some differences in the frequencies of keywords used to
define an educated person according to the individual’s position and academic
area.

41
CHAPTER 3: METHODS

Research Design
The proposed research design involves a survey and interviews. The survey
portion could be characterized as a correlational study involving three groups of
individuals from different disciplines. A non-random, convenience sample is used for the
survey with each participant being queried on past, present, and anticipated practices
regarding research paper formats. Open-ended sections in the survey and selected
interviews with six volunteers will be analyzed as qualitative data to identify patterns or
categories of interest stated by individual respondents.

Sample
The population for this study would ideally include all full-time professors,
librarians, and TAs at Rutgers University with the sample randomly selected from these
groups of individuals. Such an approach assumes the availability of contact information
for each individual in each group and this information is not available. Alternative
approaches to creating a viable sampling frame do not appear viable given privacy
concerns of employees and students. Even if such information were available it would
still incur two obstacles: the cost in time and effort in securing such a list for this
unfunded study and the assumption that such a new topic is ready for more wide-scale
hypothesis testing. This is a preliminary study and its focus is hypothesis defining in the
hope that it can then lead to a more extensive investigation with a large, random sample
of potential respondents.

42
The size and type of the survey sample can be viewed from a number of different
perspectives. If this study were funded, then a multi-part investigation could begin with a
problem defining approach and then move to collect representative data. If the study were
funded it might be possible to engage a large sample of over 1,200 individuals randomly
selected at different (randomly) selected colleges and universities. Such a sample might
allow for testing hypotheses at α = .05 with a confidence interval of ±3%. However, this
is not a funded study and it is not conducted in an area where prior research has identified
variables and constructed viable models of how information literacy may define what it
means to be an educated person.
To define the issues present during a transition from paper-based print to
multimedia digital products will require that an initial investigation include individuals
from different disciplines. Three groups are identified as appropriate for this study since
their roles interact directly with students who are involved in research papers: 1) full-time
professors (in their role as research and course instructors), 2) librarians (in their role as
library instruction and information literacy instructors), and 3) TAs (in their role as full or
part-time lecturers for the course and also as current graduate students). Their roles are
important as integral members of the teaching and learning mission for students’ research
in colleges and universities. These groups have core knowledge about undergraduate
research and they engage in pursuing the shared goal of educating these students. It is
assumed here that the knowledge gained in doing a research paper contributes in a
meaningful way to defining an educated person.
There is a growth in collaborative efforts involving teaching faculty and librarians
to reach larger numbers of students and to offer students support in building strong

43
academic information literacy skills (Arp, Woodard, Linstrom, & Shonrock, 2006; Black,
Crest, & Volland, 2001; Cunningham, & Lanning, 2002; Dorner, Taylor, & HodsonCarlton, 2001; Farber, 1999; Raspa & Dane, 2000). The professors and librarians work
cooperatively to promote an effort to integrate information literacy into the curriculum.
The ideal cooperative relationship between teaching faculty and librarians might be best
described by a pioneer in this field, Evan Farber (1999) who stated, “…where both the
teacher’s objectives and librarian’s objectives are not only achieved, but are mutually
reinforcing—the teacher’s objectives being those that help students attain a better
understanding of the course’s subject matter, and the librarian’s objectives being those
that enhance the students’ ability to find and evaluate information” (p. 233). A successful
collaboration would be expected to produce a seamless blend of core subject with
research skills and also information literacy proficiency as ideal ways to meet students’
needs with full faculty support. The learning outcomes that would provide evidence of
what is learned is not addressed in this study.
In this study, the sample of TAs are current graduate students, and at the same
time they teach their classes as part-time lecturers (PTLs) or as assistants to professors.
TAs in the classroom have direct contact with students either as a class or in a recitation
group. For this, they are trained through a series of workshops designed to develop
technological skills and enhance teaching. TAs at Rutgers University are required to
attend at least four sessions listed below to earn a certificate before entering the
classroom:
1) Managing a course web site (Sakai)
2) Online grade reporting and communication
3) Creating Excel spreadsheets for grading

44
4) Getting started with RefWorks and Flow
5) Basic web design
6) Copyright issues for academic research and publication
7) Copyright issues for teaching
8) Lecture recording and Podcasting
9) Creating eBooks for the classroom
10) Creating PowerPoint presentations for teaching
11) Using media with PowerPoint presentations
12) Getting started with RefWorks and Flow
13) Windows Movie Maker
14) Introduction to Prezi
Through a series of workshops, TAs at Rutgers University are well trained to use
multimedia digital publications and tools. These workshops are offered by the Center for
Teaching Advancement and Assessment Research (CTAAR) and the TA Project.
Certificates are awarded by the TA project. In order to guide undergraduate students
effectively, professors, librarians, and TAs may also work collaboratively with each other
although the normal mode of instruction is one teacher to a class of students. In all, these
three groups are essential to this study and individuals will be selected from different
disciplines.
Four academic areas are identified by aggregating specific disciplines into broad
disciplinary categories: 1) sciences, 2) social sciences, 3) humanities, and 4) professional
schools. For instance, individuals designated from the sciences are found in departments
of chemistry, earth science, physics, biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, botany,
zoology, or anatomy. Social sciences hold appointments in departments of anthropology,
psychology, economics, political science or government, sociology or social psychology,
communication or information technology and informatics. Humanities include
departments of English language and literature, foreign language and literature, history,

45
philosophy and religion, or theology. Lastly, professional schools include business
schools, social work, education, nursing, human resource management, and labor studies.
The survey sample included 148 participants—60 professors (full-time faculty),
42 librarians, and 46 TAs from Rutgers University in New Jersey—who were recruited as
volunteers. As described above, individuals are solicited to represent four academic areas:
sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools. This is a non-random,
convenience sample and its purpose is to define how information literacy is addressed in
a multimedia world where the format of the research paper is evolving from a long-form
to incorporate audio and video information.
The personal interview sample consists of 16 participants— eight professors, four
librarians, and four TAs. They all agreed and gave their permission to use their name
with quoted comments for this study. The relatively small sample size will limit the
ability to generalize to larger populations of professors, librarians, and TAs. It is hoped
that the data from this study might be used to define the model and create hypotheses
useful in a larger study.

Measurement / Instrumentation
The survey uses Likert scales. The number of scale points used with such a
responses, specifically, 4, 5, 7 and 11 Likert-scale points, is still controversial (Leung,
2011; Lim, 2008; Wakita, Ueshima & Noguchi, 2012). Yet, research findings show that
“having more scale points seems to reduce skewness, and the 11-point scale, ranging
from 0 to 10, has the smallest kurtosis and is closest to normal … and suggests the use of
an 11-point scale as it increases sensitivity and is closer to interval level of scaling and
normality” (Leung, 2011, p. 412). This survey uses “don’know,” “don’t use,” “cannot do,”
or “not applicable” as part of its eleven-point Likert style response scale. This study
emphasizes individuals’ knowledge and experience as well as perceptions. Additional
personal information is not requested of participants. Open-ended responses follow each

47
major section of the survey. Respondents were asked to volunteer for personal interviews
to expand on their responses to the scaled items and their open-ended comments.

Study Site / Location of Procedures
All of the subjects (professors, librarians, and teaching assistants) were recruited
on Rutgers University campus.

Detailed Study Procedures
The quantitative portion of the study is a questionnaire survey which consists of
Likert-type scales and “Yes/No” questions about perceptions and evaluations of research
papers over the recent past and likely future. The qualitative portion of the study involves
open ended questions asked of participants so they can expand on information provided
in the questionnaire. Personal interviews of 16 individuals provided in-depth, descriptive
data on how they perceive and evaluate the research papers in any formats over time.
Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed.
There was a one-time response to a brief questionnaire for 148 participants which
should take no longer than 30 minutes to complete (depending on amount of detail
provided in the open-ended questions). 16 interviewees (eight professors, four librarians,
and four TAs) were recruited for interviews. These in-depth personal interviews were
approximately 30 minutes in length.

48
Any risks involved for the participants in the project would be their recollection
of research paper changes, a topic many individuals do not often reflect on. The
risk/benefit ratio of the proposed research sees very little risk to participants and greater
potential benefits to how knowledge is reported.
The survey data will be stored in the Principal Investigator’s computer database
with access locks (security code accessible only to the Principal Researcher) for three
years after the completion of the research. All paper documents will be shredded and
computer files of data will be deleted after five years.

Consent Procedures
This study requires the approval of the Rutgers University Institutional Review
Board (IRB) for the protection of human subjects in research. The questionnaire was
presented to individuals following their completion of the consent form for this research.
All subjects gave their consent in order to participate. The consent form followed the
suggested language of the Rutgers IRB template.
Those who agreed to provide additional information in a personal interview were
given a separate consent form. These interviews were conducted in person by the
Principal Investigator with the respondent. 16 personal interviews took place. The content
of the interviews focused on responses to the survey with particular attention to the openended responses. Eight professors, four librarians, and four teaching assistants were
selected for these interviews.

49
The personal interviews were audio recorded and each respondent is asked to sign
the audio consent form. In all, the interviewees were signing three consent forms: one for
the survey, one for the interview, and one for the audio taping.

Internal Validity
It is expected that threats to internal and external validity may occur in this study
given it uses a non-random and small sample size. The simple design of this study does
not address internal validity issues such as before/after effects, maturation, and related
areas. Exploratory data analyses are used with quantitative and qualitative data to suggest
hypotheses for future investigations.

Data Analysis
Analyses of responses include overall correlational analyses with exploration
using factor analyses. Exploratory data analyses include factor analysis, hierarchical
multiple regression models, and binary logistic regression as well as statistical
interactions among variables. Models include all cases (N=148). This is the first study of
its type known on this topic and a mixture of exploratory data analyses and qualitative
data analyses might be used to suggest hypotheses for later investigations.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS

Participants and Demographics
Survey Participants and Response Rate
A total of 509 surveys were distributed via Qualtrics using university email
accounts. Among them, a total 148 individuals responded for a 29.1% response rate.
Table 4-1 provides a breakdown showing how many surveys were distributed and
responded to by each educator group. Note, for example, that 56 subject librarians of
Rutgers University received this survey and that 42 responded (75%). The yields from
each group’s survey participants and response rate were: 60 professors (31.1%), 42
librarians (75%), and 46 TAs (17.7%). The participation numbers of each group were
relatively similar compared to its response rate.

A total number of 16 interviewees participated in follow-up personal interviews:
eight professors, four librarians, and four TAs. Table 4-2 presents each interviewee’s

51
name, role, general academic area, and department. They all agreed and gave their
permission to use their name with quoted comments for this study. These interviews
included two faculty members who had published in a peer-reviewed video journal
(JoVE). Also as resource individuals for undergraduate education, two faculty members
were invited and agreed to be interviewed to share their thought about ‘what it means to
be an educated person in the digital age.’ Both of these individuals are in charge of
undergraduate education at Rutgers University.

These in-depth personal interviews averaged 31 minutes in length with a range of
20.2 minutes to 54.2 minutes. Data were obtained from interviews via transcription. All
of the interviews were transcribed into Word files, excluding non-meaningful utterances
such as uh, uhm, etc., by the principal investigator. An initial categorization of the data
was derived from each interview question. The most prevalent domains and keywords
from both survey open-ended answers and interview transcriptions were combined and
analyzed using NVivo as a thematic analysis of qualitative data analysis. Two main
questions using the thematic analysis were about the meanings of an ‘educated person’
and a ‘digitally literate person’ in the digital age.
General Academic Area
Figure 4-1 offers a graphic display of four academic area distributions used in this

Findings from Research Questions and Hypotheses
This section discusses data analysis results from four research questions and
hypotheses which are involved in past and future literacies for current undergraduate
students’ education. This study has a fundamental research question, “what does it mean
to be an educated person in the digital age?” This key question is linked with a specific
research agenda, how educators (professors, librarians, and teaching assistants) consider
‘digital research papers’ equivalent to ‘print research papers’ in order to educate
undergraduate students who are/will be ‘educated’ people continued to evolve in the
digital age. The data has been collected and combined from an online survey and followup personal interviews.
The research findings involve the four main study aims: 1) identify how several
independent variables (IVs) are affected on use of MDP (DV1); 2) produce a description
of potential differences among professors who themselves publish using multimedia
digital formats (MDP professors) compared to professors whose publications are in more
traditional text formats (non-MDP professors), especially if this is based on their
experience with publishing peer-reviewed MDP articles (DV2) and giving assignments to
students using MDP format (DV3); 3) discover professors’ evaluation variance of
research paper components (especially, content versus visual aids) in both print and
digital formats over time; and, lastly, 4) present a thematic analysis of qualitative data
analysis using NVivo emerging from open-ended survey questions with 16 in-depth
interviews from each group of professors, librarians, and TAs about the meanings of an
‘educated person’ in the digital age.

58
Hierarchical multiple regression and binary logistic analysis are the primary
analytic procedure used for quantitative data in this study. It is expected that a better
overall prediction of use of MDP scores can be obtained by using multiple independent
variables. The analysis for this study will be conducted in four phases: 1) bivariate
analysis; 2) exploratory factor analysis (EFA) or principal components analysis (PCA)
with reliability analysis; 3) hierarchical multiple regression analysis; and, 4) the final step
which includes a binary logistic regression. Figure 4-8 depicts this overall model for
digital scholarly communication.

Bivariate Analysis I: Zero-order Correlations
An initial examination of zero-order correlations with three dependent variables
offers useful insights into the important independent variables. Interpretation of the
overall correlations is provided in light of the theoretical model presented in chapter 3
which assisted in mapping the overall model covered by the four research questions and
hypotheses. Given the overall correlations, it may be possible to eliminate some variables
that appear to have minor effects in order to develop a more parsimonious set for the final
analysis. Table 4-4 organized the independent variables according to the major categories
of interest that are expected to impact the three dependent variables and this reports on
the Pearson correlations of those variables.
In Table 4-4, there are significant correlations between use of MDP and five
factors of self-perception of technology abilities. Regarding this category, the factors
include learning new software, doing online research, posting and publishing research on
the Internet, developing a blog or website, and finding help with a technology problem
online. These have positive correlations with use of MDP (r = .164, r = .181, r = .251, r
= .219, and r = .189 respectively). Significant and strongly positive correlations exist
between the factor of familiarity with MDP and use of MDP (r = .84). Among instruction
methods categories, the factor of email instructions is significant and it is positively
related to use of MDP (r = .171) but with a low effect size. But, there is the lack of any
significant correlation for those independent variables in the demographic and use of
DPT categories.
Professors constituted the main group publishing MDP journal articles so only
their responses have been analyzed to explore correlations associated with their

61
demographic information. There are significant and negative correlations with
participant’s age and number of teaching years (r = -.458 and r = -.397 respectively). In
instruction methods categories, in-class instruction and email instruction are negative and
also significant (r = -.342 and r = -.353 respectively). The self-perception of the
technology abilities’ category, familiarity with MDP, and the use of the DPT category do
not have significant correlations with experience in publishing MDP journal articles.
The dependent variable of experience in giving assignment to students using
MDP format focused on professor’s responses since they played a major role in assigning
and evaluating students’ research papers. The independent variable of use of PowerPoint
is significant and negatively correlated with MDP assignments variable (r = -.323). It is
assumed that PowerPoint is ubiquitous compared to other DPT and its presence here
reflects a negative relationship compared to more traditional research papers. There are
no statistically significant correlations for most of independent variables, opposite to the
premises that were hypothesized.
Preliminary observations are useful at this stage. Significant correlations exist to
support some hypotheses but not all. Also found were negative significant correlations
where positive relationships were proposed. What is expected and unexpected will be
discussed further with detailed qualitative data in chapter 5.

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
Both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal components analysis (PCA)
are useful methods to help investigators represent a large number of relationships among
normally distributed or scale variables in a more parsimonious way. The primary
difference between these two analyses is that “EFA is directed at understanding the
relations among variables by understanding the constructs that underlie them, whereas
PCA is simply directed toward enabling one to derive fewer variables the same
information that one would obtain from the larger set of variables” (Leech, Barrett, &
Morgan, 2011, p. 65). For the category of self-perception of technology abilities, EFA is
used for the methods of extracting factors and components that will be used for the next
step analysis. Regarding the use of DPT and instruction methods categories, PCA is
selected in order to reduce a relatively large number of variables to a smaller number of
variables that still capture the same information.
After each EFA and PCA, reliability analysis is also performed to check internal
consistency reliability, Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. Alpha is typically used when
researchers have several Likert-type items that are summed to make a composite score or
summated scale. It indicates the consistency of a multiple-item scale.

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Reliability Analysis
Self-Perception of Technology Abilities
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
The initial factor analysis of five self-perception of technology ability items was
conducted using principal axis factor analysis. The Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was

64
statistically significant and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy
(KMO) was 0.82, which falls into the range of being appropriate to use in this study.
These values confirm that factor analysis is an appropriate path for conducting further
analyses. Meanwhile, the solution was not rotated since only one component was
extracted. This means these five self-perception of technology ability items—1) learn
new software, 2) do online research, 3) post and publish research on the Internet, 4)
develop blog or website, and 5) find help with a technology problem online—are similar
variables and can be aggregated as an single variable. Table 4-5 shows communalities of
these five items.

Reliability Analysis
The self-perception of the technology ability scale’s reliability analyses are
presented in Table 4-6. The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.82 which indicated that
the items provide good internal consistency reliability. All items had moderate to strong
item-total correlations ranging from 0.42-0.65, thus all items were retained in subsequent
analyses.

After the EFA and Reliability Analysis, five self-perception of technology ability
items were combined into a single variable to create an aggregate index. It is followed by
Torres-Reyna (2016)’s method “(called naïve by some) to create indexes out of each
cluster of variables” and one new variable for self-perception of technology ability was
created for the further analysis with dependent variables. An additive index was
constructed to form a new variable as suggested by Torres-Reyna (n.d.). This resulted in
self-perception of technology ability = (learn new software + do online research + post
and publish my research on the internet + develop a blog or website + find help with a
technology problem online) / 5. The divisor here, 5, keeps the new variable consistent
with the range of the original scales.

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Reliability Analysis
Instruction Methods
Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted to assess the
underlying structure for the five items of the instruction methods questionnaire. The
rotated component matrix is presented in Table 4-7. The Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was
statistically significant and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy
(KMO) was 0.59, which falls into the lower acceptable ranges for such a statistic. These
values indicate factor analysis was appropriate to conduct but with a caveat that the intercorrelations assume enough independence to proceed using rotation. With a low cutoff
score of 0.5, five instruction methods items loaded onto two factors. After rotation, the
first factor accounted for 32.02% of the variance, and the second factor accounted for

67
31.18%. This analysis identified two factors that explained 63.2% of the variance in the
performance measures.

The factor analysis identified strong relationships among items of face-to-face
(one-to-one) and in-class instructions. This factor appears to represent traditional
instruction methods. The second factor extracted identified items of email, online chat,
and social media instructions. This factor appears to represent digital instruction methods.
They are relatively new instruction methods and based on current information technology.

Reliability Analysis
To assess whether the data from two variables that were summed to create the
traditional instructions score formed a reliable scale, Cronbach’s alpha was computed.
The alpha for the four items was .63, which indicated that the items come from a scale
that has minimally adequate consistency reliability. The traditional instruction methods
scale reliability analysis result is presented in Table 4-8.

The clustered items were combined into a single variable to create an index to be
used in additional analyses (Torres-Reyna, n.d.). It is recognized that this exploration is
tenuous given the weak findings which emerged in the above analyses. Rotation of the
component matrix can yield more viable results. Two additive indexes were created to
form two new variables as a composite representation of those variables found to be
similar using the above analyses (Torres-Reyna, n.d.). The new variables were created
consistent with the range of their original scales.

Use of Digital Presentation Tools (DPT)
Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
Principal components analysis with varimax rotation was conducted to assess how
seven DPT variables cluster. The rotated component matrix is presented in Table 4-10.
The Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was statistically significant and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO) was 0.60, which indicates factor analysis was
appropriate to conduct but still weak given these results. With a cutoff score of 0.5, seven
DPT items loaded onto three factors. This analysis identified three factors that explained
66.68% of the (internal) variance in the performance measures.

The most explanatory factor identified in the principal components analysis
included items of Haiku Deck, SlideShare, Prezi, and Keynote. This factor appears to

represent minor DPT. These are particular DPT used by relatively few people in
academic areas. The second factor extracted identified items of video (or YouTube) and
website. These two are major DPT when MDP are presented on the Internet. The third
factor extracted item was PowerPoint.

Reliability Analysis
Cronbach’s alpha was computed to assess whether the data from four variables
that were summed to create the minor DPT score formed a reliable scale. The minor DPT
scale reliability analysis result is presented in Table 4-11. The alpha for the four items
was .60, which indicated that the items form a scale that has minimally adequate
consistency reliability.

Finding from Research Question 1: Use of Multimedia Digital Publications (MDP)
Bivariate Analysis II: Zero-order Correlations after EFA and PCA
After the EFA and PCA were followed by reliability analysis, a second
examination of zero-order correlations using clustered independent variables with use of
MDP suggested useful insights into the next analysis. Table 4-13 presents correlations
between each combined score (IVs) and use of MDP (DV). Each factor score (IVs) and
use of MDP (DB) is also displayed as a guide.

On a basis of Torres-Reyna’s (2016) creation indexes out of each cluster of
variables, in Table 4-13, there are significant correlations between use of MDP and four
of the major factors in the research model. The factors of self-perception of technology
abilities, use of minor DPT, traditional instruction methods, and digital instruction
methods have positive correlations with use of MDP (r = .26, r = .18, r = .17, and r = .18

74
respectively). Use of PowerPoint and major DPT were not significantly related to use of
MDP (r = .09 and r = .08 respectively).

Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis
Use of Multimedia Digital Publications (MDP)
Initially, there were 23 independent variables including demographics in this
exploratory, hypothesis seeking investigation. Table 4-4 identified some independent
variables that were possibly impacting the three dependent variables. Then, after the EFA
and PCA with reliability analysis, six clustered independent variables were extracted. In
the first step of the regression, the analysis was limited to the expected best predictors
based on the theoretical model and the preliminary correlation analysis. The results are
presented in Table 4-14 and 4-15. Additional predictors are then brought into hierarchical
multiple regressions and the respective t-values and R2inc values are evaluated to
determine how they contribute to the overall model (Table 4-14). Adding variables to the
regression equation that do not explain use of MDP will reduce the values for adjusted R2
and the standard error of residuals by reducing the degrees of freedom.
Prior to undertaking the regression analysis, preliminary data screening was
conducted. Histograms for each independent and dependent variable indicated that the
univariate distributions were reasonably normal and that there were no extreme outliers.
Scatter plots between every pair of variables revealed linear relationships and in most
cases no extreme bivariate outliers. Yet, the data from one participant revealed bivariate
outliers with respect to familiarity with MDP and use of minor DPT when the boxplots
displayed. The data were self-contradictory indicating familiarity with DPT but no

75
knowledge of those products. Thus, this one outlier case was not included in the
regression analysis, resulting in a sample for analysis of 147 participants.
In this study, the first research question is to understand how well use of MDP can
be predicted by the complete set of independent variables and how much variance is
predicted uniquely by each independent variable when the contributions of other
predictor variables are statistically controlled. In hierarchical multiple regression (Leech,
Barrett, & Morgan, 2011; Warner, 2013), the independent variables are entered into the
analysis in a series of blocks or groups, each block containing one or more variables. In
each step, the effect size that describes the unique contribution of each variable is
adjusted to partial out or control for any linear association of this variable with predictor
variables that have been entered previously. The order of entry is determined based on
the theoretical model and the results from exploratory analysis. In this study, the selfperception of technology abilities is considered a control and entered first. As illustrated
in Table 4-14, the self-perception of technology abilities and predictors for use of minor
DPT, digital instruction methods, traditional instruction methods, and familiarity with
MDP are entered as separate models into the hierarchical multiple linear regression.
In SPSS, zero-order, partial, and part correlations are asked for each independent
variable (IV) with a dependent variable (DV) representing use of MDP. Partial
correlation is the relationship between the DV and an IV when the relationship between
the DV and other IVs has been removed or partialed out from the variance of both the IV
and the DV. Part correlation represents the portion of the total variance in the DV which
is contributed by the IV. The square of part correlation is the amount of change attributed
to R2 by including this variable. The standard error of residuals is the standard deviation

76
of the DV about the regression plane. The residuals can be other factors, apart from the
variable under consideration, that are influencing use of MDP. In the regression analysis,
residuals should be reasonably small because they represent the part of use of MDP
which is not predicted by the independent variables.
In Table 4-14, the null hypothesis for each model states that the change in R2
(contribution of this block to the variance in the DV) is zero when the variable is first
entered into the regression (H0: R2inc = 0). The Baseline model (Model 1) introduces the
control variable in the regression. From Model 2 to Model 5 it includes the direct effects
of the independent variables. For the overall model, the F value is examined for the final
step in the hierarchical multiple regression analysis. If p is less than the predetermined
alpha level (here, p d .05), the overall regression is considered significant.
For the results, hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed in which
each of the major predictors was entered in a single block. Table 4-14 provides a
summary of R2 and R2 changes for each step in the hierarchical multiple regression.

The overall regression, including the one with a control variable and four
predictor variables, was statistically significant, R = .85, R2 = .72, adjusted R2 = .71, F
(5,125) = 63.91, (Table 4-14, Model 5). The R2 value indicates how much variance in the
dependent variable can be explained by variation in the independent variables. The
probability values for variables in the equation are provided in a later table. The overall
model (Model 5) indicates 72% of the variation in educators’ use of MDP can be
explained by the control and the four predictor variables. After controlling for the selfperception of technology abilities, the three predictor variables—use of minor DPT,
digital instruction methods, and traditional instruction methods—contribute almost
equally to the variance in use of MDP. The last predictor variable, familiarity with MDP,
was the most dominant variable that contributes significantly to predicting use of MDP.
To assess the contributions of individual predictors, the t ratios for the individual
regression slopes were examined for each variable in the step in which it was first
introduced into the analysis. According to Field (2005), “The F-ratio is a measure of the
ratio of the variation explained by the model and the variation explained by unsystematic
factors” (p. 323). When a variable produced little or no increase in R2, the F-value may
go down because of the loss of degrees of freedom. The t-values of the five best
predictors are presented in Table 4-15.
In the first step (Model 1), the self-perception of technology abilities (SPTA) was
statistically significant, t (129) = 3.13, R2inc = .071. The relationship of SPTA to use of
MDP is positive and was expected. For Model 2, use of minor DPT had a positive
relationship to use of MDP as predicted in the research model, but not significant, t (128)
= 1.66, R2inc = .020. In Model 3, digital instruction methods did not have a statistically

79
significant correlation with the use of MDP, t (127) = 1.88, R2inc = .025. For Model 4,
traditional instruction methods also did not have a statistically significant correlation with
the use of MDP, t (126) = .75, R2inc = .004. In Model 5, the familiarity with MDP had a
significant and positive relationship to use of MDP, t (125) = 16.33, p  .001, R2inc
= .719. All of independent variables are positively related to use of MDP as indicated in
the research model. In Table 4-15, the regression coefficient reported the size of the
effect of use of MDP for each predictor variable. From the results in Table 4-14 and 4-15,
we can assume that educators’ use of MDP can be reasonably predicted from these five
variables.

Finding from Research Question 2: Published MDP and MDP Assignments
Binary Logistic Regression (BLR)
Comparison of Two Professor Groups with Two Dependent Variables
Logistic regression was conducted to assess how professors who themselves
publish using multimedia digital formats (MDP professors) compare to professors whose
publications are in more traditional text formats (non-MDP professors).
In Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) the outcome variable is dichotomous,
allowing the researcher to predict membership in a target group. In the first phase, the
target groups are identified as the MDP professors and the non-MDP professors. A BLR
was performed to see if a model could correctly classify or predict which professors
published using MDP. The outcome variable was coded as follows: 0 = non-MDP and 1
= MDP.
In the second phase, the target groups are the MDP format assignments and the
non-MDP format assignments. A BLR was used to assess if those professors who publish
using MDP formats could predict the format of assignments given to their students. The
professor groups were distinguished by MDP or non-MDP professors. The outcome
variable was coded as follows: 0 = non-MDP format assignments and 1 = MDP format
assignments.

Phase I: Published in Any Peer-Reviewed Journals using MDP
Binary logistic regression (BRL) was conducted to assess whether the predictor
variables significantly predicted whether a professors published in multimedia digital
publications (MDP) or not. The selection of the predictor independent variables were

81
specified by the theoretical model and from the results of the exploratory analyses. In this
BLR, four independent variables are included: three continuous variables (age, number of
teaching years, and use of MDP) and one categorical variable (academic areas). The
categorical variable, academic areas, is dichotomized and coded as follows: 1 = sciences,
0 = other academic areas (humanities, social sciences, and professional schools).
When all four predictor variables are considered together, they significantly
predict whether or not a professor published in any journals using multimedia digital
format, x2 = 22.13, df = 4, N = 50, p < .001. The Cox and Snell R2 of .358 and the
Nagelkerke R2 of .549 indicate a moderate association between publishing MDP and the
four predictor variables.
In Table 4-16 reported the percentage of professors’ publishing MDP correctly
classified as published in any journals using MDP format as 63.6%; the percentage of
professors’ publishing MDP correctly classified as not published in any MDP was 97.4%.
The overall correct percentage was 90%.

The Exp(B) gives the odds ratios for each variable (Leech, Barrett, & Morgan,
2011). Thus, the Exp(B) indicates, for each one unit change in the predictor variable, how
much change can be predicted in the odds of a professor being published multimedia
digital publications (MDP).
In this logistic regression model, the Exp(B) for age was .237. Since Exp(B) is
less than one for age, the odds of being published MDP decrease as the score for age
increases. That means older professors tend to not publish using MDP compared to
younger professors.

83
The Exp(B) for science areas was 21.486 indicating that for a one point increase
in science areas, the predicted odds of a professor being published MDP were almost 22
times greater. This means professors in science areas tend to publish more in MDP than
other areas such as humanities, social sciences, and professional schools.

Phase II: Experienced in Giving Assignments to Students using MDP formats
Binary Logistic regression (BLR) was conducted to assess whether the experience
in publishing any journals using MDP (predictor, IV) significantly predicted whether or
not giving assignments to students using MDP format (DV). In this BLR, both the
independent and dependent variables are dichotomous. When the predictor variable is
considered, the model does not significantly discriminate based on whether or not a
professor gave students assignments using MDP format, x2 = 2.28, df = 1, N = 53, p > .05.
The Cox and Snell R2 of .042 and the Nagelkerke R2 of .056 indicate a very week
association between publishing MDP and giving MDP format assignments.
Table 4-18 reported the percentage of professors’ giving MDP format
assignments. The model was unable to classify correctly those who were experienced
with MDP formats. The percent correctly classified as experienced was 28.6%; the
percentage of professors’ giving MDP format assignments correctly classified as not
experienced was 88%. The overall correct percentage was 56.6%. This model does not
describe the relationship between MDP experience and assigning students to use MDP
formats.

Finding from Research Question 3: Professors’ Assessment of Research Papers over
Time
Since the advent of research papers in academia, professors have played the major
role in assigning and evaluating students’ research papers. Survey data from 60
professors were examined in order to reveal how they identify essential components of
research papers in both print and digital formats to educate undergraduate students. The
survey questionnaire for this research question was “how important are the following
components when constructing a print / digital research paper [*]?” There were four parts
associated with this time frame [*]:
x

Part 1. when you were an undergraduate student

x

Part 2. when you were a graduate student

x

Part 3. now when you evaluate research papers as a professor

x

Part 4. in the next five years

There are nine essential components of research papers: 1) topic, 2) content, 3)
organization, 4) clarity and style, 5) visual Aids, 6) number of references, 7) length, 8)
timely submission, and 9) ethics. In particular, the components content and references
and visual aids were selected for the comparison over time. In academics, content and
references are considered as the most crucial component when constructing research
papers—even in a changing multimedia digital era. For a comparison, visual aids were
examined in order to see whether professors’ perceptions have changed over time when
they evaluate students’ research papers. Among the nine components of research papers,
visual aids is most affected by the format of research papers. In print research papers,

86
visual aids are graphs, images, and pictures. In digital research papers, visual aids include
not only graphs, images, pictures but also moving images, flash files, audios, and videos.

Difference Score between Print and Digital Research Papers Over Time
The table 4-20 shows the mean of difference score between print and digital
research papers over time. This is responded to on an 11-point Likert-scale. A score of
one is least important and a score of ten is most important. For instance, suppose a
professor responds to the importance of content. He or she checked the number ‘10’ on
print research paper and put the number ‘7’ on digital research paper, then the difference
score between print and digital research papers on content becomes ‘3’. In the next place,
in order to see any changes on research papers, each difference score was calculated to
produce respective averages according to four academic areas and also compare over the
four time frames.

Table 4-22 and Figure 4-10 present professors’ assessment of visual aids over
time by the four academic areas. Likewise, the difference score decreases over time. Even
the minus score on visual aids indicates that visual aids are considered as more important
components in digital research papers than in print research papers when professors
evaluate students’ research papers. Professors from all of four areas responded that in the
next five years that visual aids will be considered as more important components for
evaluation of research papers using digital format than for print format.

Finding from Research Question 4: Definition of Educated Person
Thematic Analysis of Definition of Educated Person
This is a thematic analysis of words used by the position of the respondent at a
major research university for three groups of individuals: 1) professors, 2) librarians, and
3) teaching assistants (TAs) by four general academic areas: 1) humanities, 2) social
sciences, 3) sciences, and 4) professional schools. The total number of respondent is N =
164. The data has been collected and combined from both an online survey and follow-up
personal interviews.
The question was “what does it mean to be an ‘educated person’ in multimedia
digital age?” In Table 4-23, 4-24, and 4-25 show the survey answers from each group:
professors, librarians, and TAs. These are the survey responses and do not include
interview transcriptions.

Table 4-23. The Open-Ended Survey Answers from Professors
What does it mean to be an educated person?
A well educated person reads, or obtains knowledge, from a wide range of sources, print,
digital, verbal. They keep current on past and present issues and have a broad understanding of
the many topics that they will encounter in life. For example, a pointy headed scientist like
myself should read and keep current on philosophy, science, religion, politics, economics, art,
history, etc.. Lifelong learning is essential to an attempt to understand the all the great
mysteries and wonder of life.
Knowing how to think and knowing how to find information; knowing about one's feelings;
having some broad sense of the world at large; being able to be empathetic.
Someone who has understood what they have studied
ability to analyze, react and communicate based on the experience of mankind not just the
personal one
An educated person has the ability to think independently and critically as well as be able to
communicate their ideas clearly orally, in written content, as well as digitally.

I guess to take advantage of all the possible information channels especially all sort of digital
ones. Of course their use must be accompanied by a good mind and an ethic behavior.
In the academic sense, it is someone who understands his/her field of study, knowledgeable
about the changes taking place in the field, uses his/her knowledge and skills to help others, fair
and ethical about use of his/her knowledge in his/her particular field, etc.
To be familiar with the cultural history, literature, arts and sciences of one's society and times /

democracy.
To be able to develop a framework through which you can analyze material, particularly media
created material, and find the relevant information to understand and hopefully contribute to a

Top Ten Keywords of Educated Person
For the next step, in order to identify key terms useful in defining an educated
person, 148 responses from open-ended questions from the online survey were compiled
with 16 in-depth transcriptions of interviews using qualitative data analysis software tool
NVivo. Based on this analysis, the top ten keywords for an educated person were
selected using frequency counts and including similar words. These top ten keywords
were analyzed by thematic analysis from combined data of all of the three groups, and all
of the four academic areas.
The first keyword representative of an educated person in a multimedia digital age
is knowledge, and then content and abstract. The forth keyword is change. Interestingly,
the word change is highly ranked. And then, communication, information, think, whole,
and make follow. The tenth word associated with an educated person is give. In the Table
4-26, the frequency of words used by all respondents are reported. The word frequency
counts are including similar words and the counts are given in brackets after each word.

CHAPTER 5: DISCUSSION WITH INTERVIEW DATA

Overview of the Study
This study emanates from concerns about a liberal education and this
investigation explores a core topic within that overall discussion. It employs a mixture of
exploratory quantitative and qualitative data analyses to suggest hypotheses for later
investigations. This research looks at the changes of research papers in academia and
makes a link to what it means to be an educated person in a multimedia digital
environment.
According to the dean of the Harvard Medical School, Jeffrey Flier (2016), “In
2015 more than one million papers in bioscience were published – more than ever before,
and reflecting enormous progress in biomedical research. But a growing number of highprofile retractions have led to a widespread belief that the results scientists publish are
increasingly irreproducible.” He continued to state that “Scientific journals are the major
vehicle for disseminating science, yet there is little active effort to determine how best to
deliver research results. In short, we need a science of how to publish science” (Flier,
2016). Filer argued about how to increase the productivity of scientific research.
In a similar manner, it was found that not only is the science area saturated but
also other disciplines are as well since print publication outlets are shrinking. Scholarly
book publishing in the humanities is a clear example of this as the movement to borndigital publication prevails and as students experience applications such as YouTube
which had over 750 million views per day in February 2016 (Social Blade LLC, 2016).

103
Danielle Bradley, a teaching assistant of history department who, like all those
interviewed, made her comments public and quotable by name. She shared her concern
about how to deliver research results effectively in academia during the interview:
I’ve been a graduate student for a long time now, from 2007 until now. And I
think that I’ve seen there’s this change with the digital humanities where
professionals are trying to make research papers something that has a different
format and that can reach a broader public. […] So, clearly there’s awareness that
we’re not communicating effectively when we produce our research papers, but if
we get rid of them, then I think the humanities might just fall part. We’ve got to
find a way to re-invent but also re-invest in the research paper.
(Danielle Bradley, history TA)

In the same vein, this investigation deals with the issue on changes of the format
for disseminating knowledge or research results that may combine with the evolution of
the meaning of an educated person. But, we might have to say it is not just changes of the
format. It may be the expansion of the format to reach out to a broader research base and
to the public at large.
Although multimedia digital publications (MDP) and research papers using MDP
formats may not be fully accepted in academia yet, some educators are already making
use of them through their broader roles as individuals who profess knowledge to others.
Bonnie Firestein, a professor of biology and neuroscience department, shared her
experience in publishing a peer-reviewed scientific video journal JoVE, and commented
on the benefit of this from a researcher’s view point:
My experience was very good. […] Our article, JoVE is really based on teaching
people the techniques that you know how to do in your lab, which I think is really
essential. We wrote a new program for looking at the input centers for nerve cells.
And often trying to explain to somebody through email or writing how to use this
computer program is very difficult, but if you show them through this media,

104
actually it’s much easier and people understand it better. And our experience with
JoVE itself was very good. They (JoVE videographers) came in, they videotaped,
they were very quick.
For me (as a researcher), (video journal) it is fantastic because we have people
emailing us from all over the world; they want to use our computer program. And
they’ll use it, and the way the computer program gives you data, you have to have
a certain file structure. So for me it’s great because I just say: please watch this
video. I send them a link to download it. And I always get back: oh, thank you so
much, and it helps them. And also it’s – I forgot how long that video is, but they
can sit and watch it at any time. For me, if I had to answer each individual person
for that amount of time I would never get my work done.
So from my point of view, it’s excellent because they get to watch it. They get to
watch us doing it. And it answers a lot of their questions, and then if they have
other questions I can answer them.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)
She also conversed about the advantages of video journals from the viewers view
point:
From the viewers view point, it’s actually great, because they watch things
being done in real time. So again they’re not just reading an email from me,
they’re actually watching a person. We had a high school student as part of
that video using the computer program. And if the high school student can
use it, then the researcher knows that they can use it as well. So I think
demonstration is often a better way for learning.
A video is often a better way than just having something written, because also
there are intricacies of the way […] maybe there’s a certain way they tilt the plate
that you don’t get from something be written. It’s just these little tiny changes that
you don’t realize that you’ll see on the video. And I think from the viewer’s point
of view it’s really powerful, because they’ll pick these things up by watching
rather than just having something written down.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)

Noshir Langrana, a professor of biology and neuroscience department and a researcher
who published in JoVE also shared the value of video journals:
Video journal articles show the power of the work, and show how effective one
can do things – that you can not necessarily write everything in detail. You have

105
to observe that. So when it comes to observing things, video journal articles are
very valuable. So that’s why we went in that direction. So showing the power of
DNA hydrogel, how taking the different combination, what happens, how the gel
swells and how the gel contracts, and how one can change the substantial
difference of the whole nine yards.
Otherwise, it’s just saying, “Believe me. It is true,” when you write a journal
article. You don’t see that. Video, you literally see, “Yes, this is what is
happening.” So it is a very strong message one can communicate, so it has a
place.
Like, I was talking to you about that article that popped from University of
California, that’s saying that a paralyzed person can walk for the first time.
There’s no way you can show that in any other way but the video, and not only
video, but you can also show the nitty gritty of the set up and how he was prepped
and how they made certain that he doesn’t fall and hurt himself.
And again, there are limitations because when you see the headline, you have
certain different concept, “Oh, wow. He’s walking, he’s walking like us.” No,
that’s not true. But he can walk. He is walking in the harness, but that’s fine, he
can walk. You can watch the whole thing. […] I think the video is very important.
Something that is moving, something you are animating, I think that’s very good
to do.
(Noshir Langrana, biology and neuroscience professor)

Moreover, the advantages of knowledge sharing through multimedia format will
not be restricted to the science area. It can also apply to other areas, such as humanities,
social sciences, and professional schools. Frederick Scott Bentley, a teaching assistant of
industrial relations and human resources department compared text-based and
multimedia-based publications.
Sometimes reading through things – it's difficult. I think it's also though – to use
an example – it's almost like text messaging and a phone call, or talking to
someone in person. You can read a text message and interpret it in a variety of
ways. And you can very easily misinterpret it. But if the person just said it
directly to you, it limits that ability to misinterpret it. I think the same thing can be
said with print versus multimedia. Sometimes in print, if you see an asterisk or a
footnote, it almost seems as though sometimes something is hidden. Like, they're
hiding – like, it should have been in here, but we're gonna put it somewhere else.
And it always kind of makes you question, you can't ask anything about that.

106
Whereas with multimedia, I feel like there would be a little bit more explanation.
Maybe if you see someone’s face and how they are describing something, you
might be more compassionate or understanding towards certain things. Or just
hearing their voice describing it, even if I can't watch it. I feel like the difference
between hearing their voice and seeing them say it, might be better than reading it,
versus the other two. Because it's very easy to misinterpret what people are
saying when you're just reading the text. About tone, or like aggression, things
like that, but if I hear them saying it, it's a lot easier.
And also when you read something, you don’t get to visualize a person
necessarily, but when you hear their voice, you start like a visualization, and I feel
like that could either work for them or against them, but either way as the
recipient of the information, you kind of have a closer connection to that
individual, and it makes it easier.
(Frederick Scott Bentley, industrial relations and human resources TA)

Although Frederick Bentley has no experience in publishing in a multimedia
digital journal yet, he said he is willing to publish an article using MDP format in
the near future. He suggested that qualitative researches using interview data will
also get benefits from MDP format.
I think that it’s worth – I think it's something that can be done across
disciplines. I think it's more important in others probably, like for example
medicine, or biology, like the hard sciences it might be easier. The other
way it could be used, if really allowed, would be through qualitative analysis.
So instead of having to transcribe everything, if you could show snippets of
video at different points, or if you get to an interview and instead of reading
the text, you click a footnote and the video comes up to show that actual
interview, that might be more interesting than just reading a transcript of the
interview itself.
And so you can see that qualitative aspect, instead of just reading it, you could see
the interview. Because sometimes, we have courses in qualitative analysis about
doing interviews and writing up the results of that, and the one thing that’s always
left to the author, and I've always been kind of puzzled by this, and viewed it as a
limitation is, they interpret emotion and convey to the reader. But you and I could
watch someone say something and have two different reactions. I could say
they're being condescending, and you could say they're being compassionate. We
could both be right, but it should be up to the person receiving the information
and how they view it, and not up to necessarily the author, who is trying to tell a

107
story and fit that interview to that story […] And I think having the video actually
would be a really good way to mitigate some of those possible biases.
(Frederick Scott Bentley, industrial relations and human resources TA)

Like Frederick Bentley, 13 of 14 interviewees responded positively and said ‘yes’
about publishing in journals using MDP format in the near future regardless of their
current position (professors, librarians, or teaching assistants), gender, age, and their
experience in MDP. However from a different perspective, David Redlawsk, a professor
of political science was not positive to publish an article using multimedia digital formats:
I’m not unwilling. I just don’t know how it would work. I don’t know in my field
what would be added. I mean, political scientists of the kind I am in any case –
quantitative political scientists were driven by analyzing data, collecting survey
data or experimental data and running traditional statistical analysis on them and
then publishing the results and so I don’t even know what would be multimedia in
that context for what I do. I’m not opposed to doing it. I just don’t know what it
would be.
(David Redlawsk, political science professor)

Professor Redlawsk’s comments are related to the issue of legitimacy of
multimedia digital publications in scholarly communication. Later in the interview he
remembered he had produced a video which was posted to journal’s website:
Now I just came off five years as an editor for the journal Political Psychology
and we talked a lot about a lot of issues relating to the journal and trying to
enhance its visibility and all that, multimedia was not one of the things – well I
shouldn’t say that, that’s not exactly true as I talk about it.
We did do – and now it reminded me because I participated, we did start doing
some videos where an author would talk about his or her paper and they would be
posted on the journal’s website. Why I forgot about it because I talked and I did a
special issue on the Obama presidency and we did a video where I talked about

108
that and so we’ve done a little bit of video work for the journal Political
Psychology and posted it on the website of the journal.
(David Redlawsk, political science professor)

Meanwhile, several educators talked about the issue of tenure and promotion in
academia linked with publishing in journals using MDP format as its legitimacy:
Especially for situations like tenure, so if you are the faculty who worked many
years updating this wonderful site that had won awards or had actually been cited
many times in various publications, etc. and how can you really say that that is
equivalent or more a refereed publication? […] There was a search at the School
for Arts and Sciences for digital humanities senior faculty hire and I think we had
three candidates on campus who had different kinds of digital projects that they
had spent a lot of time creating and required a lot of research skills, time and
energy to do that. One of the big questions was how would that be valued in terms
of tenure and promotion? Even to create these packets for promotion, I think of
tenure with this personnel packet at Rutgers. It’s still pretty much print based.
[…] He or she can print abstracts very well but to really convey and print format
what the project was is difficult and even if there was a narrative here and there,
how to print that without losing the visual aspect of it. I think that is one issue that
digital multimedia projects do face.
(Kayo Denda, social science librarian)

They (multimedia digital publications) don’t count for tenure; they’re not
taken seriously even though for years now professional scholars have
wanted other types of work like giving research papers, publishing research
papers online. They want it to count towards tenure, they want this
legitimacy for the research paper that it’s not getting and I’m not sure why
because there’s a sense that tenure review boards are the enemy. These
professionals are also part of tenure review boards, so I don’t understand
why there’s this disconnect between the professionals who want the digital
research paper to be legitimate and then the tenure boards because it’s the
same people who are in both fields, so I don’t know why it doesn’t have
that legitimacy.
[…] And if you work in the digital humanities, like blogs, data production,
like digitizing medieval manuscripts or trying to do statistical analysis
about the words used, about poetic meter, if all of that digital work isn’t
taken seriously as research then we’re producing all this work that isn’t
going anywhere and that’s leading a lot of people to question whether we

109
should even be doing research papers. There’s been a lot of writing on
blogs and I think I even read something in The Chronicle of Higher
Education about how we should just get rid of conferences because they’re
not helpful.
(Danielle Bradley, history TA)

Multimedia-type publications, as long as it’s peer-reviewed, it should counts as
equal (for the faculty tenure or promotion).
(Noshir Langrana, biology and neuroscience professor)

I think that multimedia journal articles if they’re experimentally based and not
methods based count as much as a print paper. […] But I should say that our
JoVE article goes hand in hand with another paper that we published, which was
in Cytometry. And so that paper described the method, but then the JoVE article
actually showed them how to use the program, and if you think of it as a whole
and an item, I think it actually strengthens it. So maybe by itself it wouldn’t count
(for the tenure), but as a whole it actually gives me more recognition in the
community, and that translates to tenure, or I don't have to worry about tenure, but
that translates to whatever the next promotion is.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)

The issue of multimedia digital publications counting as much as a print
publication for a faculty member seeking tenure or promotion appears to be a
controversial topic in academia.
Similarly, the issue of students doing a digital research papers is also going
through a period of transition. Some of educators said the practice of replacing a written
research paper with a multimedia digital research paper or presentations is more prevalent
than before:
I think it’s becoming more and more prevalent. I don’t think that many of my
colleagues read the written paper anymore. I think most of us go online and we
use – so the written paper for us often is the same as the digital paper, only the

110
difference is the digital paper has links to other things. I think the majority of my
colleagues that I’ve spoken to and deal with, and as we write grants, really deal
more with the digital and multimedia approach. And I think that the paper, even
though I still like to read things on paper, I think that it’s becoming less and less
common.
I think especially the point now that NIH, National Institutes of Health, when
things are funded by them; they want open access for everybody. And so I think
that digital is much easier. You can’t guarantee that there’s open access if you
have a paper copy, but with digital or multimedia everybody has access. And I
think that very soon that any typical paper article or media is going to be
debunked, at least for scientific research. I wouldn’t say for novels. I still like to
read novels. I don’t read them online, so there’s still old timers like me.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)

I think there’s pressure in doing this. I think first the pressure comes on the
practical side that professionals want to see more multimedia as you see in
companies. You see publications that are targeted for professionals. They use
greater amounts of multimedia. Like every single business school, like most
major companies, now have YouTube feeds—they’re assuming that people are
not reading their brochures, not reading their annual reports. Now the way people
consume this is through a podcast, is through a video. It’s as through something
other than the traditional communication mechanisms, right?
And so I think the pressure is coming from the professional side. And I think
increasingly it will come from students because this is how they probably have
learned before. As more multimedia is used for children who are in elementary
school and in high school I think we in the university will see a greater and
greater need to shift to that direction, which I think generationally or practicewise is something that really is different.
(Alexander Settles, business school professor)
I think it’s becoming more and more (prevalent) for undergraduates.
Undergraduates, I think it’s becoming really common partly because it’s easier.
[…] They (undergraduates) think that it’s inherently easier to create a multimedia
presentation than a research paper because research writing scares them. They
think it’s going to be easier, then they get low grades because they don’t realize
they have to put in thought, that it’s still research.
(Danielle Bradley, history TA)

111
I would say it’s pretty prevalent, it allows for students to see other styles of both,
not only how to display information on a PowerPoint, but also how to
communicate it to the audience. And you might start picking up on beneficial
aspects of other people’s presentation styles that you would kind of start to adopt
going forward.
[…] If the person is not a good writer, they don’t know how to communicate in
written form. And sometimes you don’t have the ability to communicate in a
multimedia way or present, all you have to do is write. And if you don’t have that
skill set, sometimes you might not see the outcomes you hoped to have. And so
being able to do both, I think, is very important, but there are several benefits
associated with introducing more multimedia in the classroom. I think that’s
something that we're definitely doing, and has been done.
(Frederick Scott Bentley, industrial relations and human resources TA)

Meanwhile, other educators told that the practice of replacing a written research
paper with a multimedia digital research paper or presentations will not be prevalent in
some areas:
In the English department, I always think there are probably two or three of us
who move in this direction, maybe four of us, out of 60. Most people, I mean
people use Sakai and use a lot of digital tools, but really for the same purpose, not
using them to analyze by and large, but to present. We are mostly paper-based,
still, which makes a lot of sense. I mean it’s the English department in which that
makes a lot of sense. If you went to economics and asked those questions, those
guys better be doing all kinds of digital stuff. Yeah, right. And librarians, the
people who have to be digitally literate. English majors, not so much.
(Martin Gliserman, English professor)
Depends on the subject area. […] Some people will say yes and some people will
say no. When you think of how scholars communicate with each other, they go to
conferences, you do it both ways. You do a PowerPoint presentation, which you
speak to the audience, and then if you have peer-reviewed published proceedings,
you write the paper. […] Both are expected of scholars. Some people do better at
the presentations than others; some people do better at the written paper than
others. I don’t know. It depends.
(Roberta Tipton, business librarian)

112

I don’t think it’s that prevalent right now, I think particularly in accounting and
financing there’s really a strict clinging to the original practices I think in some
ways. […] I don’t see – it’s going to be a long time before academics catch up
with – become really totally digital. That’s my opinion. (But) I think the real
business world is very interactive. […] I think you’ll find that more in the real
business world, they may have – like the data may be some place online or in a
Cloud type base system, but you find more businesses, they tend to – don’t have a
lot of time for the background information. There may be some attempt to justify
sort of positions of their research but I think they tend to get more towards
showing like interactive or more active visualization of their work and what
they’re doing. Whether it’s a dashboard – for example, for one project we created
a dashboard, actually it was an active online web capture of different steps, you
went through this dashboard. It’s very educational and people learn from that. It
really depends on the environment and the situation.
(Deniz Appelbaum, business school TA)

It is also assumed that the definition and format of the research paper is
undergoing dynamic changes and challenges in the emerging world of multimedia
production. This study attempts to explore how the research paper is changing in ways
that may redefine the meaning of an educated person in a digital, multimedia society.
Below are discussions from each research question that might be applied to each problem
area.

Discussion from Research Question 1
Individuals enter a discipline at a particular point in time and it is likely that their
use of multimedia digital publications (MDP) will differ across generations, academic
areas, technology abilities, digital presentation tools (DPT) use, and the instruction
methods used in classes. Initially, there were 23 variables in this exploratory, hypothesis
seeking investigation. It is expected that younger educators, more likely from the science

113
area, with higher technology abilities, and with more use of DPT and digital instruction
methods will have more use of MDP.
However, statistically significant analyses of the impact of demographic variables
such as age and academic areas were not significant. There are significant correlations
between use of MDP and four of the major factors in the research model: 1) selfperception of technology abilities, 2) use of minor DPT, 3) traditional instruction
methods, and 4) digital instruction methods have positive (significant) correlations with
use of MDP (r = .26, r = .18, r = .17, and r = .18 respectively). This observation suggests
that educators who have higher technology abilities, and with more use of minor DPT,
and often do traditional and digital instructions will have more use of MDP.
Then, the data analytic plan led to hierarchical multiple regression which was
performed to understand how well use of MDP can be predicted by the complete set of
independent variables and how much variance is uniquely explained by each independent
variable when the contributions of other predictor variables are statistically controlled.
The overall regression, including the one with a control variable and four predictor
variables, was statistically significant, R = .85, R2 = .72, adjusted R2 = .71, F (5,125) =
63.91. The overall model (Model 5) indicates 72% of the variation in educators’ use of
MDP can be explained by the control and the four predictor variables. It seems that
educators’ actual use of MDP are affected by their confidence of their technology skills
or their early adopter status such as more use of minor DPT (Keynote, Prezi, Haiku Deck,
and SlideShare) and use of both traditional and digital instruction methods (face-to-face,
in class, email, online chat, and social media).

114
In addition, significant and strong positive correlations exist between the
educators’ familiarity with MDP and their actual use of MDP (r = .84). This finding is
important, because “the measures of product use and a person’s objective knowledge
structure about the product may not necessarily be related. Product knowledge was also
shown not to be correlated with involvement to the product” (Zaichkowsky, 1985, p. 299).
Sometimes what we think we are familiar with in a certain publication or product may
not be directly linked to our actual use of the product. Also, what we actually know about
a publication or product may not necessarily be derived from its actual use. Interestingly,
in this investigation, educators’ familiarity with MDP is considerably linked to their
actual use of MDP unlike the previous study (Zaichkowsky, 1985). Therefore, this
exploratory study suggests that the familiarity with multimedia digital publications
affects its actual use. Further, even basic knowledge of MDP seems to allow the
individual to be more open to advanced uses of MDP. Meanwhile, for future studies,
perhaps one might employ specific indices of MDP familiarity and its potential uses to
assess the individual’s likely use of such information in research and teaching. This has
implications for journal marketing campaigns that may hope to move from static
environments to more dynamic multimedia platforms which include such formats as
video or three-dimensional interactive displays.

Discussion from Research Question 2
The underlying idea of the second research question is how different venues
might communicate scholarship and knowledge; in other words, the impact of form of
publication as a credible representation of authoritative knowledge. Before addressing

115
these issues it was important to first assess what features of the professors enable them to
publish in journals using multimedia digital format (MDP). Then, the next exploration
was to see whether professors’ experience in publishing journal articles using MDP
format is linked to their classroom activity in giving MDP format assignments to students
as equivalent print research papers.
In the first Binary Logistic Regression (BLR), four independent variables (age,
number of teaching years, academic area, and use of MDP) were regressed over the
dependent variable publishing in journals using MDP. Among the four independent
variables entered in the logistic regression, the two variables with significant coefficients
were an age (Exp(B) =.237) and academic areas, in particular science area (Exp(B) =
21.486). This means younger professors in science areas can be better predicted to
publish more in MDP than those in other academic areas.
The second BLR was cast to assess the prediction or classification accuracy of
using individuals’ experience in publishing in journals using MDP to predict their giving
assignments to students using MDP formats. There was no significant coefficient
between the predictor and the dependent variable. It seems that professors’ MDP
experience does not actively explain the formats to be used in classroom assignment by
students.
Nevertheless, a biology and neuroscience professor Bonnie Firestein, who
published in a video journal, noted that she uses both print-based assignments and inclass presentations about 50:50 in her classes. She thinks, overall, there will be fewer
written papers in the next five years:

116
I teach half of the class, and they (students) do one presentation in that half. And
so that, and then they write papers every week. And I would say probably the
presentation is about 50 percent and the papers are 50 percent. So even though
the presentation is only one week out of maybe the eight or ten weeks, I actually
put a lot of stock in that, or a high percentage of the grade because I think that you
can get a better evaluation of how the students are thinking and how well prepared
they are, versus just a piece of paper, so it’s about 50/50.
I actually think we’re going to have less and less written papers. So I think that
some of the formats, which I’d like to see, which I think would be better is some
online discussion. A lot of granting agencies are going to this, where maybe I’ll
say: okay, I want everybody to post a comment by a certain time two days before
a class meets. And I want you to post a comment on which paper you think is
better and why. And then what would suffice for Bonnie [sic] if people could then
have a conversation.
And kind of the climax of the conversation is the presentation, where we can
discuss it even in more detail. And I think that would be probably a better
platform than just papers, and I think that’s a direction we will go to in the next
five years.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)

Also, a business school professor, Alexander Settles, commented that multimedia
presentations are prevalent in business schools and that this has been true for some time:
In my discipline there is a long tradition of multimedia presentations. The balance
between written research presentations and multimedia presentation has been
shifting towards multimedia presentations due to the sophistication and ease of
use of such tools but the overall balance has changed little in the past 20 years.
Business people have always used these techniques - only the technology has
changed.
(Alexander Settles, business school professor)

Some professors give assignments to their students using multimedia digital
formats regardless of whether they have MDP publication experience or not. It seems that
multimedia digital papers and presentations maybe not prevalent yet, but they are notably
increasing in academia.

117
Discussion from Research Question 3
This third research question examines professors’ perception and evaluation in
changes to research papers over time: what their experience was with research papers
when they were undergraduate students; what changes have occurred when they were
graduate students; what their current practices are with research papers or equivalent
requirements; and, what changes might be expected in the next five years.
First, all of the professor interviewees shared information about their own
undergraduate and graduate experiences with research papers. Most of them had no
computers or information technology when they were undergraduates and graduate
students. Instead, they used a typewriter for producing papers. Their research work was
based on printed materials in libraries:
As an undergraduate, I did a senior thesis on William Blake and William Butler
Yeats. Yeats and Blake, doing their kind of visionary ideas about life. It was all
library book based. So, it was nothing else. This is 1966-1967.
In graduate school, the same thing, more intensely. Many more books, many more
articles, library, library, library, desk, cigarettes, typewriters. The most painful
part of all of it, it was the typewriter, because you can never correct anything. I
wasn’t a great typists. I have to tell you, it was absolutely the most frustrating
thing, because the computer life is just totally different. You know like this—send
it and throw it out is not enough to tear the paper out of the typewriter and start
from the beginning, again? I don't really know how I survived all that aggravation.
My blood pressure!
So, all of my early work was, even my first book was totally library researchbased, no computers until really the last round I had got my first Epson computer.
It didn't connect well with the printer. And it was an aggravation on another level,
but writing a dissertation on a computer was a big difference for sure.
(Martin Gliserman, English professor)

I was an undergraduate student a long time ago in the late 1970s. I wrote the usual
undergraduate papers. I was a political science major and so wrote a lot of papers

118
related to campaigns, elections, voting, or things like that. Wrote them up pretty
much on an old typewriter and rarely made any changes. Wrote it once and
turned it in.
(David Redlawsk, Political Science)

I certainly remember reading research papers as an undergraduate and I
participated in research as an undergrad and contributed to a research paper that
was published. I think at that point I wasn’t a very, you know, aside from doing
experiments that led to my contribution and putting that data into a figure and
writing the methods and writing a couple of paragraphs about it.
When I was a graduate student, I work with the PI the principal investigator of the
lab who really put together the whole package. But it was a fun experience to be
part of making that contribution. As far as reading research papers—certainly I
needed to read them in preparing for my research and also for certain classes it
was required, but obviously at that point everything is for going to the library,
taking journals off the shelves, making a photocopy and that was true in graduate
school as well.
(Nancy Walworth, pharmachology professor)

So as an undergraduate student, I actually did an honor’s thesis, but we didn’t
really publish a paper, we published an abstract for a meeting. And I think if I
can remember that far back, I remember Xerox and looking at papers in the
library and having journals in like little rooms in the building, you know, like
little libraries building like we have here, meeting rooms.
And as a graduate student, I also think it was the same thing, most of the papers
that I read were Xerox copies out of journals. So I would go to the library and I
would copy them. And then I had stacks of papers, like when I was writing my
dissertation stacks of papers. And everything – nothing was really electronic
except for typing up my dissertation for example.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)

My undergraduate was in India, so it was mainly all practicing engineering, so in
terms of research, there was nothing. Okay, so the research actually started when
I came to this country for doing my Ph.D.
(Noshir Langrana, biology and neuroscience professor)

119
Meanwhile, Alexander Settles, a business school professor shared his research
presentation experience when he was an undergraduate student. He had said presentation
has a long tradition in business but it was not like PowerPoint these days, but they used
an overhead slides. As earlier, he commented these presentation techniques always have
been in business, but only the technology has changed:

I made presentations as an undergrad. You would make slides. You’d make actual
overhead slides that you would use during your presentation. And I remember
printing – the big technological advancement that I had was not that you had
Power Point but that you could print your overheads on your laser printer. And
you could print them in color. This was the big advance.
Because before that you would have to actually have someone professionally do it.
Students were even able at that time in the late ‘80s, early ‘90s, to buy the
overhead printing pages and then take them and just stick them in the regular
printer. And you would get an overhead, which only ten years earlier you would
have to have photographed and somehow – some professional would have to do it
for you. But now you were able to do it, so that was an advance – so the way my
students use Power Point today – we used overhead slides then.
(Alexander Settle, business school professor)

What changes have occurred in the past five years continue to evolve at a rapid
pace. Current practices with research papers or equivalent requirements for students have
expanded across all of academic areas. Now all professors use computers and some of
them use digital presentation tools (DPT) and multimedia digital publications for their
research:
I'm totally addicted to the computer. When I was in graduate school, I had
questions that I couldn't answer. Because I would need a computer which I didn't
even conceptualize at that point of time. But I was interested in the 18th century,
17 to 18th century drama. I wanted a chart of changes over time of the dynamics
of character interactions which I could do now. I couldn’t do that then. I mean it
would just take forever. So now, so now all my research is really not library
oriented. It’s oriented with digital text and tools to analyze those texts. This is a

120
total revolution from everything I write to everything I think. At least in some of
the classes that I teach.
(Martin Gliserman, English professor)

I teach political science and so I teach courses that tie to politics and particularly I
teach some seminars, some first year seminars. And those students do a little bit
of what I call traditional academic writing but they do more putting together a
presentation about something, whatever the topic is. […] They certainly use
computer based search techniques and I actually have a session with the librarian
to talk about that and databases and all of that.
(David Redlawsk, political Science)
I think that’s changed, it may be on a little bit broader timeframe even maybe ten
years is for us in the biomedical sciences. […] So certainly a major change is that
you know if I’m reading a paper or preparing a paper. But if I’m reading a paper
and I need to look up a reference, I don’t have to walk out of my office, right. So
in the old days when I was a student or when I was an assistant professor here you
know I would sit at my desk read a paper and figure out what articles I need and I
would walk over to the library and I would get them and obviously now this is a
click of the button – using the laptop. Yeah and it’s right there in front of me so
that’s a significant change.
(Nancy Walworth, pharmachology professor)
I think the thing in research is that there is really this inertia or path dependency.
You have to get published. You have to look like the previous publications. And
so, the articles themselves, you’re gonna see the type settings better. Maybe the
graphs are better. The charts are clearer. But how the material is actually
organized I don’t think in business and economics has really changed in the last
50 years. In the academic journals.
In the professional journals, I think there was always this trend of having more
graphical user information, but you’re now starting to see a lot more of these
online publications, like I had – I used this one chapter in a class that has the
ability where you can manipulate the graphics. Like what it’s trying to do is
explain the relationship in foreign direct investment. And so what you’re able to
do is slide a toolbar along it, and you can see changes in distribution. You do it
through HBR Interactive Materials. Now I haven’t seen this yet used that much
in presentation of papers. But obviously, this type of software could be used in
presenting your materials if you’re doing it online. […]
Because you might have previously had a spreadsheet that would have come
along and you would have played with it. But this one actually has a graph inside
the document, which I like. So in the past five years, the technology has been

121
changing – I’ve noticed this being changing, so what you’re starting to see
especially in the professional side that you’re seeing more of this interactive
material being presented.
(Alexander Settle, business school professor)
So the past five years, so I would say one of them is this journal called Journal of
Visualized Experiments (JoVE), where now instead of just having data, they
actually have like movies of people, physically doing experiments and explaining
them, that was very new to me. The other thing is that people tend to attach more
supplementary data than they ever did, so a lot of biology looks at moving pieces
in a puzzle. We’re looking at moving molecules or moving proteins, and often
just taking snapshots and pictures is not enough.
It doesn’t really emphasize kind of the beauty of what’s going on, the significance
of what’s going on. And so I believe that over the past five years more and more
people have attached things like videos and movies to their papers.
So for research papers, we – as far as different supplementary data, for the most
part nothing has really changed, although we’re starting to do more types of
experiments where you would actually need to put things like movies online.
But my experience really is more with using digital images and digital data
platforms to submit to journals and publish, it’s actually much easier. For example,
as a post doc, we would take a picture of, let’s say some neurons. And we would
have slides made. And then we would take the slides, scan them back into the
computer, so the pictures weren’t even taken through the computer, they were
actually taken by film. We’d scan it back in, and then we would have to get the
colors just right in for example Adobe Photoshop before we could actually then
print it out. And that would take all day because the colors might not match and
then submit that to the journal, where now everything is electronic.
So it’s not just the actual papers that come out, but the ease of which it is – the
ease at which everything occurs now to submit your data, it’s much easier. It’s
easier to actually submit larger piece in raw data if the reviewers ask for it than it
used to be.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)

I think it’s getting more and more online, and more and more people are putting
as a PDF file, and it’s more and more open. So, even from NIH grants and NSF,
all the publication has to be available to other researchers. So practice is now
more writing papers – once they are approved, they’re put as a PDF file for other
researchers to look at it or view, and so forth. So it’s more digital.
(Noshir Langrana, biology and neuroscience professor)

122

Then, all professors said the technology will be changing in the next five years.
They expected they are starting to see more of interactive materials being presented in
higher education:
I would assume that things will escalate in the direction that they're going. There
will be more video, audio, we have access to archives and archival material we've
never had before. We have access to so much material in so many tools, we’ve
had never before. I mean, as an English professor, the only tool we had was our
brains, pencil, piece of paper, typewriter. Now we can really search text, things
that are revolutionary!
(Martin Gliserman, English professor)

I’m sure the newer, younger generation is moving in that (multimedia and digital)
direction as well. So I think that the journals are going to continue to do things
that make that experience of reading a paper online more – to take advantage
more of what’s available online.
(Nancy Walworth, pharmachology professor)

In the next five years, I think that one of the things that’s been changing is, it
appears that more and more data are needed in order to publish. So what was
considered top of the field ten years ago is no longer top of the field. You need
more experiments to prove your point. So maybe ten years ago, you did two
experiments, and you proved your point and they're really excellent experiments,
and this is one point in a paper, and now you have to do four or five different
techniques to prove it.
I think with that type of mentality that is going to increase the amount of data that
you need to submit for a paper, and more convincing data and real time data.
People are asking for InVivo data, so animal data. I think a lot of what’s going to
happen is we’re going to have to submit a lot of this data, or these data, and
they’ll have to be available online. I think it’s not only the types of data, but the
amount of data will be more in five years.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)
We’re all experts on PowerPoint so our students present things in PowerPoint.
And they include PowerPoint slides as part of their reports, so I think that that’s
become a standard practice. And the expectation, even, I think of people who are

123
hiring our students that they’ll be able to put together a ten slide PowerPoint
presentation on just about everything.
Like e-Portfolio but like say you get asked a specific question at work. You write
a five-page research report. You’re gonna probably do two or three slides that go
along with it because people are gonna look at your report but they want to know
what you think is the most important thing. So that will – it’s like an integral part
of the research practice now is what sort of presentation slides are you gonna put
together?
And so I do that with research projects in my class is I have a component of
where I give them guidance on how to produce their presentation part of it. So
how to present the research.
(Alexander Settle, business school professor)

All of the professor interviewees discussed that more and more multimedia digital
publications and products will be used for their research. Moreover, professors will use
those research tools for their students’ in-class activities and for career preparation in
their professional field. In the same context, the survey results also showed that the
evaluation gap between print and digital research papers has diminished over time in all
academic areas. Over time, there were some evaluation differences in traditional versus
digital assignments based on academic areas. However, professors evaluated both content
and references and visual aids in each of the two formats almost equally important. Even
in the next five years, visual aids will be considered as more important on digital format
research papers than on print format research papers. Furthermore, if it is a digital
research paper, the status accorded to visual aids are essential regardless of their
academic areas.

124
Discussion from Research Question 4
The fourth research question asks what it means to be an ‘educated person’. In
other words, what are essential components of an individual who will be considered
‘educated’ in a changing multimedia era.
For this research question, the top ten keywords were identified which were
linked to a definition of an educated person. This was extracted from the interviews and
the open-ended questions on the surveys. The method used selected words based on
frequency counts which included similar words. NVivo, a qualitative data analysis
software tool, was used for this purpose. The top ten keywords were analyzed by
thematic analysis from the combined survey and interview data with all three groups,
including all four academic areas.
The first keyword representative of an educated person in a multimedia digital age
is 1) knowledge, followed by 2) content, 3) abstract, 4) change, 5) communication, 6)
information, 7) think, 8) whole, 9) make, and 10) give. Basically, ‘knowledge’ might be
included in content, abstract, information, and think. Then, ‘communication’ can interact
with keywords information and make. ‘Impact and contribution’ encompass change,
whole, make, and give. Thus, on the basis of this research finding, 1) knowledge, 2)
communication of knowledge, and 3) impact and contribution to society through
communication of knowledge might be included in defining an educated person (Figure
5-1).

125

Figure 5-1. Educated Person in the Digital Age

Each group’s top ten keywords are slightly different. Professors' top three
keywords are communicate, change, and content. Librarians offer communicate,
knowledge, and change. Teaching assistants pick out knowledge, abstract, and
communication.
According to each academic area, educators in humanities focused on abstract,
communication, and knowledge. Social science educators are concerned with knowledge,
communicate, and changing. Educators in sciences enumerate knowledge, content, and
communicate. Professional school educators focused on change, communicate, and
knowledge.
Yet there are seven frequently counted common keywords regardless of role of
respondents and academic areas. They are: 1) knowledge, 2) communication, 3)
information, 4) change, 5) think, 6) make, and 7) give. In the narrative interview data, all
of interviewees shared their opinion and thought about what it means to be an educated

126
person. Two professors were invited and agreed to be interviewed as resource individuals
for undergraduate education. They shared their assessments about ‘what it means to be an
educated person in the digital age.’ Both of these individuals are in charge of
undergraduate education at Rutgers University. Here are some of their thoughts on this
issue:
The goals of an education have changed. They used to be learning certain things
that an educated person should be thought to know, whether it was principles of
Newtonian physics or having read Milton’s Paradise Lost or John Bunyan’s
Pilgrim’s Progress. Now, I’ve been on a number of curriculum committees here
and it’s been an interesting change over the years. The big one I was on ’91 and
there we had that debate a lot.
And the only thing we could agree on was that our responsibility as a university
was to teach students how to sort through the massive array of information
available online, although we hardly had an online in those days, but, you know,
technologies. But how we could get them with the explosion of information – and
this was almost before we have what we have now – how we could get – teach
our students not only to make sense of this, but also, and much more importantly,
to sort out the bogus, the foolish – bogus first, foolish second – from what was
real research and information. […]
I do think an educated person is someone who’s willing to weight the facts, but
you can't weigh facts until you learn some critical thinking skills. Now,
universities all over the country throw that word on their websites quite happily.
Critical thinking – come here and you’ll do critical thinking.
We do it in our program. We even do it in my signature course here and it’s all
about critical thinking. But it’s also vastly important. If we don’t get a citizenry
that thinks critically rather than politically all the time we don’t have a
democracy. That's the bottom line for me. So an educated person now ideally,
from my point of view, should be someone who, yes, pursues with absolute
dedication the fields which he or she want to work in, whether it’s engineering, or
business, or a humanistic subject, or what you're doing, or librarianship. […]
So an educated person, for me, is a person who can think critically about the
masses of information in front of her or him. An educated person is someone who
cares enough about his or her place in a global context to learn a language and an
educated person never allows herself or himself to say I’m an American. I don’t
care about the rest of the world. […]

127
So that’s my answer. I’ve talked on too much, but an educated person knows that
he or she knows enough to understand how much you don’t know and knows that
anything that we learn these days has to be learned in a context that is not just
American and that means languages too.
(Barry Qualls, vice president of undergraduate education & English professor)

I think this is a very complicated issue. As you know, we are undergoing a
technological revolution and the consequences of that revolution are not at all
well understood. Could be wonderful, could be terrible, right. So, I mean, people
always go back to the success stories of the past.
So for example, when the Greeks invented alphabetical literacy, Socrates said,
this is going to be a disaster. Did not happen, right? When the printing press was
invented, people predicted that there might be bad effects but it did not happen. It
turned out well.
On the other hand, technologies of communication have implications. So for
example, in most Arab countries, Arabic-speaking countries, a very small
percentage of people can read and write because Arabic is so difficult. Classical
Arabic is still the print language in most Arab-speaking countries. There is a
huge disjunction between the spoken Arabic on the street and classical Arabic,
which nobody speaks except perhaps the Saudis. […]
So here's another example. As you know, in Korea, Korea switched to
alphabetical literacy. Chinese people still use ideograms. Now again, very
difficult to learn that. Can be done but difficult. Makes mass literacy harder, right.
And the Chinese themselves went to a simpler form because the classical
Mandarin was so difficult to master, right. The only people with great amounts of
leisure time.
So I'm just prefacing my remarks. My feeling is that to be literate, to be an
educated person today, you have to say educated for what, right. So, not all
education is the same for everybody. So for example, people who go to Princeton,
Yale, Brown, Harvard are actually being prepared for careers in which print
literacy is very important. The global leadership elite are highly literate. […]
So anyway, my feeling is that it is important for them (undergraduate students) to
be able to learn how to use these technologies. The myth is that when they come
to college they already know these technologies, and they don't. They're not very
adept at using the internet. They’re not very adept at finding information. They
don’t read anything of substance on the internet.
The internet has had positive effects too. So for example, long-form journalism
has survived on the internet because you can do it so cheaply. So there are a
number of places where you get really excellent long-form journalism online. And

128
it would be impossible financially to do that now. Even places like the L.A.
Times, it has some wonderful features online with photographs, really beautifully
done and other venues too. There are other sort of like – I do think that the
internet has made it possible to have a resurgence of discourse on the left. […]
I mean, I feel that (an educated and) a digitally literate person would be somebody
who is able to read the internet critically and see the connection between
information – to evaluate content but also understand the forms in which content
would be conveyed, right. So that's a very complicated kind of literacy.
(Kurt Spellmeyer, director of writing program & English professor)

CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

Conclusions of the Study
Then, why would it be important to ask what it means to be an educated person?
One response to this hinges on an educator’s notion of an ‘educated person’ to have an
immediate and vital influence on the core curriculum and the necessary subjects to teach
all students in higher education. Furthermore, the core curriculum directly links to their
students’ research papers as a product of scholarly communication practices in academia
and these in turn are seen as valued by society. Then, does the core curriculum derive
from the educators’ notion of an ‘educated person’ address the central knowledge of the
society itself or its culture? Do colleges or universities’ core curricula reflect competency
in the workplace and does it prepare students to be career-ready? Does the content of
higher education stay parallel to the needs of society?
As stated in the introduction, there are differing expectations for students’ ICT
literacy skills between human resources consultants and business school faculty (Ali &
Katz, 2010). There are also criticisms that higher education is not preparing their students
for the workplace to be competent in contributing to society as an educated individual.
Although Hutchins (1936b) who created a radically different curricular model for The
University of Chicago stated “learning at the college level should have no vocational aim,”
this was well before the Millennium and the impact of a changing multimedia digital era.
The definition of an educated person continues to evolve over time, and the core
curriculum of the higher education may also need to be reflected by conveying various
scholarly communications in a multimedia digital environment.

134
What would educators expect of a person who will be considered ‘educated’ in a
changing multimedia era? As mentioned earlier, perhaps there is no universal definition
of what constitutes an educated person today. But again, on the basis of this research
study, the following three things might be included in defining an educated person on a
broader level: 1) knowledge, 2) communication of knowledge, and 3) impact and
contribution to society through communication of knowledge. Further reflection of the
time we live in would need to add the value of being an educated person in a digital age.
In particular, in the ‘communication of knowledge’ the format of communication
should not be limited to print format since other packages are now available. It could be
any format including audio, video, or other interactive digital presentation format. The
wider use of graphic, sound, and multimedia will enhance various scholarly
communications in disciplines of the humanities, social sciences, or professional areas
beyond the medical and science areas. In addition, subject areas such as music and art are
particularly appropriate for multimedia applications. Also, the broader use of modalities
will parlay dynamic and interactive research into a more effectual communication of
knowledge, especially when it is useful to present the processes involved in data
collection and analysis as well as communicating research results. In addition, the openended approach to use multiple modalities will embrace wider learning groups who are
less verbally-oriented such as students with dyslexia. These students have been
‘educated’ in a system which communicates using a medium that is counterproductive to
their ability to grasp information accurately. Thus, changing modalities may help them in
understanding content using an alternative perspective.

135
Furthermore, scholarly communication using any format could be linked to
students’ research activities using multimedia digital format. The research paper may
become a research product using any format will emerge as a vehicle to communicate
how students understood knowledge and how they are able to contribute to it. It is
fascinating to see if the traditional research paper can survive in a digital, multimedia era.

Limitations and Assumptions
The sampling methodology used in this study places restrictions on the generality
of results. The concern is that there might be sampling biases in this study from its
recruitment of participants in a university. Accordingly, although professors, librarians,
and teaching assistants are a major population, there may be institution, instruction,
position, academic area, age limitations. A sampling frame for this type of study would
need to consider all strata from each type of institution, from various populations, and
from various stakeholders. Problems can develop when a researcher uses a convenience
sample and compares groups that are not comparable. The focus of this preliminary
investigation is hypothesis defining with the intention that its exploration can lead to a
more extensive study with a large, random sample of potential respondents. Thus, the
sampling methods of future studies might include a wider array of stakeholders with
more representative, random samples of respondents. This will, in turn, allow for more
straightforward comparability between the samples.
Furthermore, if there are controls for differences across institutions or information
settings with a lager sample, then it might be assumed that individuals had the same
opportunities to access multimedia digital publications (MDP) or digital presentation

136
tools (DPT). That restriction was not adhered to with the samples used in this
investigation although respondents did indicate that knew of multimedia changes to
scholarly publications. The translation of this to the classroom was less transparent. It
was evident that TAs at the institution received instruction in teaching, which was not as
readily available to professors or librarians. The university offers a center for online and
hybrid learning which is available for those who seek it out. This center was not
mentioned by any of the respondents in this study. Note that this center deals with the
modes to deliver class instruction and not with the format of the scholarly work included
on syllabi.
Future studies would need to be conscious of linking all opportunities available to
respondents that are connected to the objectives of a research study. This would be
necessary if actual prediction models are anticipated to determine what factors influence
individuals’ acceptance of multimedia in lieu of print documents. This might include
replacing a term paper with a video presentation. Limitations in this study may have
suffered from lack of a control group in an experimental setting. Such a model would
require control over extraneous variables which might be accounting for acceptance of
multimedia products. It is hoped that this study does provide the footings necessary to
design such investigations. In fact, the qualitative comments of respondents provide
valuable insights on how they view change in this area. More tenuous is the use of this
study to define an educated person. It is likely that such a notion continues to evolve as
new technologies usher in new ways to communicate knowledge. It is important to note
that the tacit assumption of what constitutes an educated person needs full articulation
today.

137
Future Research
Larger and Random Sample
It is planned that this study will continue and expand as part of a research
program to explore the ways in which knowledge is communicated in a dynamic
information environment. As stated in the limitations and assumptions section, the study
posits the need for a larger and random sample from a number of different perspectives in
order to collect representative data. Individuals can be randomly selected at different
(randomly) selected colleges and universities. Ideally, and not considering cost, the
sample will comprehensively include all strata from each population.
This study successfully identified a number of key variables associated with the
actual use of and publication in multimedia digital publications (MDP). It suggested how
each variable is progressively involved in accounting for unique variance as the model is
built using blocks of data. This was augmented by qualitative comments regarding
individuals’ assessments of future directions in the communication of knowledge at the
publication and learning stages. Future research will be conducted based on the identified
variables to construct viable models of how research papers in any format may define
what it means to be an educated person in the multimedia digital environment, and also
would set the stage for a larger multi-level investigation.

Extended Methodology Research
The methodology of the research will be extended from the survey and in-depth
personal interview to experiments, observations, diary methods, and focus-group (group

138
discussion) interviews. This represents a pragmatic approach based on extended research
methods to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this research topic. Various
research methods can be used to explore variable interactions and nonlinear patterns
among the data. Not included here is the cognitive style preferred by individuals although
this, too, may be an important contributor to the variance explained in multimedia
publishing or learning. Hopefully, such models will address the details involved in
specific and broader situations using particular multimedia research tools. It will need to
encompass an understanding of the underlying reasons, motivations, and opinions why
and how educators use digital presentation tools (DPT) and multimedia digital
publications (MDP) for their teaching and research. In addition, this trajectory influences
how those underlying findings will be affected by educators’ notion of an ‘educated
person’ in a changing multimedia era, and how their perceptions apply to their actual
curriculum and subject content to be taught to students who, in turn, will then be
considered as educated individuals in a society. Seen today is the tension between
considering an educated person as someone who has experienced a core curriculum
versus a student who is educated only to be ready for a particular career. The meta- and
multi- research methods will be useful when developing appropriate, compatible models
for a research program in this area.

Discipline Specific Research
This study reveals some educators’ overall approach to using multimedia digital
publication (MDP) for research and teaching across core academic areas. The research
finding of this study reveals that professors in science areas publish more in MDP than

139
those in other academic areas and that the variables useful in predicting this are better
defined. Yet, their experience in publishing in journals using MDP format does not
directly link to their classroom practices for their students. It is possible that their practice
in research is media specific when it comes to teaching. They may publish in a video
journal and know its complexities which then inform them that it might be more efficient
for students to use simpler tools. But this speculation and future research will be needed
to uncover the reasons behavior in one area does not link to another area. Meanwhile, this
study’s findings also reveal that the younger generation is more likely to publish in MDP
than the older generation. In addition, it appears that some educators’ actual use of MDP
are affected by their confidence of their own technology skills or their early adopter
status such as more use of minor DPT (Keynote, Prezi, Haiku Deck, and SlideShare) and
use of both traditional and digital instruction methods (face-to-face, in class, email,
online chat, and social media).
Thus, in the future research, an experiment can isolate the teaching assistant
groups (TA, the younger educator group in this study) in a science area. Using an
experimental design, the study can compare the growth in students’ learning using DPT
and MDP between the TA group (randomly selected half) who do not use DPT and a
comparable group of the other half who gets instruction of DPT for their teaching.
Students in both control and treatment groups will take a pretest and a posttest. Growth in
students’ learning using DPT and MDP can measured by comparing scores on students’
research papers with a presentation at the beginning of the semester of the school year
and at the end of the school year. Then, it might eventually be seen how any initial
difference has an impact on undergraduate students learning and how this may project

140
upward to influence their professors’ research and teaching too.

Cross-Cultural Research
Future studies can also include diverse possibilities to develop research topics in
cross-cultural research investigations. The research can aim to investigate both Western
and Eastern educators’ branding thoughts and examine the interrelation among three
educator groups’ branding dimensions and their joint impact on undergraduates learning
outcomes through research products using different formats. For example, the study can
reveal that how American and Korean educators have different and similar perceptions
with respect to the effect of educators' research and teaching practices using multimedia
digital format. This can then be assessed to see if it has a significant effect on students’
learning outcome. The educators of different cultures may or may not perceive in the
same way the impact of multimedia digital publications in scholarly communication.

Concluding Remarks
Here is the quotation from one of the survey respondents’ definition of an
educated person:
To be able to develop a framework through which you can analyze material,
particularly media created material, and find the relevant information to
understand and hopefully contribute to a positive resolution of the issues facing
yourself, your community, and the larger society.

Here is another quotation from one of the interviewee, Bonnie Firestein’s
definition of an educated person:

141
I would say an educated person is – what defines an educated person is somebody
who is knowledgeable about the world. I mean, it’s great to be educated in one
area, but when you just say: okay, Bonnie, what is an educated person? It’s
somebody who reads and questions, right? So you can read the newspaper and
you can say you’re educated, but often the newspaper is there to sell newspapers.
So to be educated I think you have to ask questions and look at multiple sources
to come up with what you believe to be true. So questioning is part of being
educated, looking at multiple sources is part of being educated.
And, I think being open minded is part of being educated. Understanding
differences in people’s opinions and differences in what people are coming – right,
everybody comes to a situation or a question with different backgrounds and
different experiences, and trying to understand those experiences. So I think it’s
beyond just: okay, you have a PhD, you’re educated. I think an educated person is
beyond that. They have to be flexible to new ideas and new ways of doing things.
(Bonnie Firestein, biology and neuroscience professor)

These definitions of an educated person describe its meaning in a multimedia
digital age, and also they are linked to the new role of academic librarians. Academic
libraries can play a key role to improve students’ critical thinking and open-minded
learning through relevant library instructions and services.
As many scholars noted earlier, today’s students are entering colleges and
universities with a variety of experiences involving the Internet and information
technologies. Yet again, not all digital learners can be declared as digitally literate. If
there is no relevant instruction, students will struggle to evaluate critically the
information they found to support positions and conclusions in their research papers.
Even today’s digitally literate students and also educators who teach those students need
to be guided by the relevance of multimedia digital tools as an emerging and essential
component of research.
In mentoring for this, academic libraries can play a pivotal role to improve
students’ learning through relevant library instructions while they collaborate with

142
professors to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) literacy into the
universities’ core curriculum. A successful collaboration would be expected to produce a
seamless blend of a core subjects with research skills and also ICT literacy proficiencies
as ideal ways to meet students’ needs with full faculty support.
Educating academic librarians who will educate others using a digital literacy
perspective independent of format can advance knowledge in an iSociety. It is hoped that
academic librarians can be better-prepared to cope with the need for digitally literate
students who can be guided by instructors to improve their ICT literacy skills in an
educational environment evolving across a multimedia landscape. Then, academic
librarians will also be able to integrate their knowledge with practical work in the field of
library and information studies.
Meanwhile, an extensive application of multimedia modalities to scholarly
communication seems counter to the model of research papers that has been in place for
the past century. Given the explosive growth of multimedia content available for the
wider use of scholarly communication, academic libraries will be challenged to migrate
from print to electronic collections in providing unified access to research. This, in turn,
may force a redesign of the model now in place for academic libraries. It is hoped that a
new scholarly communication model will provide a useful roadmap for academic
libraries and the faculty and students they serve.
Ultimately, educators would want our ‘educated’ students to have a beneficial
impact on our society through communication of knowledge as we progress to a dynamic
multimedia digital environment. Also, the final goal of this study is to advance our
knowledge of how information and communication technology literacy may define an

143
educated person in our society, and to contribute to developing and supporting our
society through scholarly communication of this knowledge. As a hub of the scholarly
communication, academic librarians will play a pivotal role to improve students’ learning
through relevant information literacy instruction and effective library services.

Approximately 16 subjects between the ages of 21 and 75 years old will participate in the
study, and each individual's participation will last approximately 30 minutes.
This interview takes place for those who agree for follow-up information based on openended responses. If you agree then your quoted comments might be attributed to you by
name. The study procedures include a few questions about your experience and
perspective on research papers.
This research is confidential. Confidential means that the research records will include
some information about you and this information will be stored in such a manner that
some linkage between your identity and the response in the research exists. Some of the
information collected about you includes name, age, gender, and job title. We will keep
this information confidential by limiting individual's access to the research data and
keeping it in a secure location in the Principal Investigator’s computer database with
access locks (security code). It is accessible only to the Principal Investigator.
The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only
parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. If a report
of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference, only
group results will be stated. All study data will be kept for five years.
There are no foreseeable risks to participation in this study.
Participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate, and you may
withdraw at any time during the study procedures without any penalty to you. In addition,
you may choose not to answer any questions with which you are not comfortable.
